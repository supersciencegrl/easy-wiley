         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Nanomotor: H2S&#8208;Driven Cascade Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mitochondrial&#8208;targeted nanomotor integrates photodynamic therapy, mild photothermal therapy, and enzyme dynamic therapy into a self&#8208;amplifying cascade through H2S&#8208;driven metabolic reprogramming.








Abstract
Despite advances in combination therapies for cancer treatment, most strategies rely on modular&#8208;additive designs that lack dynamic molecular cues to achieve intrinsic synergy. Herein, a mitochondrial&#8208;targeted nanoplatform is introduced that orchestrates photodynamic therapy (PDT), mild photothermal therapy (mPTT), and enzyme dynamic therapy (EDT) into a self&#8208;amplifying cascade network through gasotransmitter (H2S)&#8208;driven metabolic reprogramming. It is constructed from an Au2Pt core with a surface functionalized mesoporous silica shell loaded with photosensitizers, encapsulated within a tumor cell membrane (Au2Pt@4sMSN/PS&#8208;TPP@CM). Upon GSH exposure, nanomotors produce H2S to boost diffusive motion, while TPP targeting directs this motility toward mitochondria, enabling efficient mitochondrial accumulation (internalization of &gt;100&#160;nm nanoparticles). Subsequently, mitochondrial targeted H2S releasing&#8208;mediated suppression of oxidative phosphorylation amplifies PDT efficacy; HSP70 downregulation enables mPTT; and hyperactive glycolytic metabolism fuels EDT. Furthermore, these enhanced modalities also interconnect in a positive feedback loop: mPTT&#8208;derived hyperthermia accelerates EDT&#8208;catalyzed oxygen generation for PDT, while mitochondria&#8208;localized PDT further inhibits HSP70 to boost mPTT. Ultimately, these interconnected molecular cues establish an H2S&#8208;driven, self&#8208;reinforcing therapeutic loop that enables effective eradication of hepatocellular carcinoma. Collectively, this study identifies mitochondria as the biological initiator and signal integrator for multimodal therapy, delivering a distinctive paradigm to overcome the limitations of conventional combination therapies.

         <title>Polarimetric Photodetector with Ultrahigh&#8208;Sensitivity and Polarity Reverse Based on Quasi&#8208;1D Semimetal (TaSe4)2I/2D MoTe2 Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel (TaSe4)2I/MoTe2 heterojunction architecture achieves four&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude dark current suppression via interfacial band engineering, enabling ultra&#8208;broadband detection with high sensitivity. Furthermore, its unique polarization&#8208;state reversal permits filter&#8208;free dual&#8208;band polarimetric imaging, showcasing significant potential for advanced on&#8208;chip photonic systems.








Abstract
Polarimetric photodetectors, capable of resolving both intensity and polarization states of light, are pivotal for advanced multispectral imaging and target recognition. Examples have been demonstrated for applications such as autonomous vehicle lidar systems and polarization&#8208;based biomedical imaging, where accurate polarization information improves target detection and contrast. However, conventional polarimetric detectors are constrained by complicated optical components and single&#8208;band polarization resolution. Here, a mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunction strategy is proposed that synergizes the unique optoelectronic properties and giant anisotropy of quasi&#8208;1D Weyl semimetal with 2D semiconductor 2H&#8208;MoTe2, achieving great dark current suppression and dual&#8208;band polarization&#8208;spectrum detection through interfacial band engineering. The (TaSe4)2I/2H&#8208;MoTe2 photodetectors demonstrate high&#8208;performance broadband operation (395&#8211;2200&#160;nm) with a detectivity of 2.1&#215;1012 Jones, responsivity of 40&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, and quantum efficiency exceeding 11400%, setting a new benchmark for comprehensive performance in phototransistors. Notably, the intrinsic wavelength&#8208;dependent dichroic inversion of (TaSe4)2I enables the orthogonal polarization response polarity reversal between the visible (532&#160;nm) and infrared (1550&#160;nm) bands. Note that dual&#8208;band polarization imaging is successfully achieved, which can be used for multispectral interference identification. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy by constructing mixed&#8208;dimensional semimetal/semiconductor heterojunctions toward future ultrahigh&#8208;sensitivity and broadband polarimetric detectors.

         <title>Polymers for Biomedical Applications: the Quest for Treating Cardiovascular Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modifications of stents can improve their endothelialization, which reduces the risk for thrombosis and restenosis. Biodegradability ensures no foreign body material remains over time, while shape memory expansion reduces damage to the arterial wall. Finally, advanced processing methods enable personalized treatments. The convergence of all these research fields could lead to improved stents for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide. Current treatments using balloon angioplasty, stents, and bypass grafts still suffer from significant risks of restenosis and thrombosis. This review outlines key research areas where polymers are used in treatments for cardiovascular diseases, highlighting developments from the last decade. Designed to serve both experts and non&#8208;experts in the field, it requires little prior knowledge of the subject. A description of the cardiovascular system, cardiovascular diseases, current treatments, and their limitations are first introduced. After providing a detailed overview of the basic and advanced requirements for new treatments, recent advances in key research fields where polymers are applied to achieve these goals are highlighted. While surface modifications aim to improve endothelialization and/or prevent neointimal proliferation, shape memory polymer stents are intended to reduce damage to the arterial wall upon expansion. Research has also focused on developing biodegradable polymer stents to avoid any remaining material in the artery after healing. Finally, various advanced processing methods enable the production of polymeric personalized stents. By addressing various research areas in a single review, the interplay among them is highlighted, demonstrating that their convergence is essential for optimizing treatments and improving human quality of life.

         <title>Modulating Salt Dissociation and Solvent Immobilization Through Dipole Interactions in Polymer Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;functional cationic COF&#8208;LiTFSI filler is incorporated into PVHF&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes, where strong dipole interactions enhance lithium salt dissociation and immobilize residual solvents, thereby facilitating Li&#8314; transport and stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (VDF)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) show great potential for application in solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, their poor ion transport capabilities and uncontrolled electrode/electrolyte interfacial reactions induced by residual solvents limit their overall electrochemical performance. To address these challenges, a LiTFSI&#8208;replaced dual&#8208;functional cationic covalent organic framework (COF)&#160;is strategically designed, denoted COF&#8208;LiTFSI, as organic fillers into poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVHF)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) to regulate Li+ transport and electrode/electrolyte interface stability. The introduction of dipole interactions between cationic moieties embedded in the COF&#8208;LiTFSI framework and Li salt significantly enhances dissociation, thereby improving Li&#8314; transport and lowering the activation energy (Ea), while the strong dipole interaction between residual N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and the COF&#8208;LiTFSI framework immobilizes the NMP molecule, markedly enhancing the electrochemical stability of the PVHF&#8208;COF&#8208;CPE with a Li metal anode. Consequently, the optimized PVHF&#8208;COF&#8208;CPE achieves a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 0.63 mS cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the Li/Li, Li/LFP (LiFePO4), and Li/NCM811(LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) cells equipped with PVHF&#8208;COF&#8208;CPE achieve remarkably stable cycling. This work presents a novel strategy to regulate ion transport and interface stability in VDF&#8208;based SPEs by leveraging dipole interactions, enabling high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Senescence Reprogramming Unleashes Tumor Immune Surveillance via Coordinated Gene Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target&#8208;enhanced gene delivery nanoparticle (TEPP) is developed to reprogram tumor&#8208;specific senescence by coordinating P16INK4a overexpression with PD&#8208;L1 knockdown. Through the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)&#160;targeting and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter&#8208;driven expression, TEPP selectively induces senescence in tumor cells, enhances senescence&#8208;associated secretory phenotype (SASP)&#8208;mediated immune activation, and alleviates immunosuppression. In combination with &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 checkpoint blockade, TEPP elicits robust anti&#8208;tumor immune responses across multiple tumor models.








Abstract
Cellular senescence can recruit immune cells for tumor therapy through the senescence&#8208;associated secretory phenotype (SASP). However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited by immune tolerance and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Reprogramming tumor&#8208;specific senescence through coordinated modulation of P16INK4a and PD&#8208;L1 enhances tumor immunogenicity and alleviates immunosuppression. To achieve this, a target&#8208;enhanced gene delivery nanoparticle is engineered using the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) as a senescence&#8208;specific targeting ligand, combined with a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter and a nuclear localization signal&#8208;microtubule&#8208;associated sequence (NLS&#8208;MTAS) peptide. This system efficiently induces tumor&#8208;specific senescence through cell&#8208;cycle arrest and promotes the chemotactic recruitment of cytotoxic immune cells. In vivo, the nanoparticle induces a robust anti&#8208;tumor response without causing systemic toxicity and significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 immune checkpoint blockade in subcutaneous, lung metastasis, postoperative recurrence, and spontaneous tumor models. This study emphasizes the therapeutic potential of reprogramming tumor&#8208;specific senescence to improve targeted gene delivery and immunotherapy outcomes, offering a viable approach for the treatment of immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors.

         <title>Flow&#8208;Regime&#8208;Controlled Fabrication of CNT&#8208;Bridged Vertically Aligned rGO/MXene Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Fiber Supercapacitors</title>

         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;bridged vertically aligned reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/MXene fibers (CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMFs) are fabricated by flow&#8208;driven wet spinning strategy with precisely regulated flow regimes. The vertical aligned 2D nanosheets are interconnected by CNT, forming continuous conductive networks for fluent ion accumulation and fast electron transfer, thereby significantly enhancing the energy storage performance.








Abstract
The directional construction of electrode frameworks aligned with the transport pathways of ions/electron is critical for electrochemical processes. However, conventional fabrication strategies suffer from bottlenecks such as complex processes, and difficulty in scaling up production. In this work, a flow&#8208;driven wet&#8208;spinning strategy is developed to fabricate carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;bridged vertically aligned reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/MXene fibers (CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMFs). Enabled by precisely regulating of flow regimes, the vertical aligned rGO/MXene nanosheets and CNT&#8208;bridged structure collaboratively establish open porous channels for rapid ion transport, continuous conductive networks for efficient electron transfer, and abundant accessible active sites for enhanced charge storage. Consequently, the CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMF electrode exhibits improved ion transport, exceptional specific capacitance (740 F g&#8722;1), and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability (98% retention after 30&#160;000 cycles) in H2SO4 electrolyte. The assembled flexible asymmetric supercapacitor achieves a remarkable energy density of 224&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (at 1200&#160;W kg&#8722;1) while maintaining robust mechanical flexibility.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Molecular Regulation of Perovskite Crystallization Enables Efficient and Stable FAPbI3 Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uncontrolled nucleation and growth in perovskite films often result in defective morphologies, degrading device efficiency and stability. Diphenyl carbonate (DPC) acts as a dual&#8208;functional crystallization regulator, employing synergistic covalent (carbonyl&#8208;Pb2+) and non&#8208;covalent (aromatic &#960;&#8208;Pb2+) interactions to control film formation. Consequently, DPC&#8208;modified PSCs achieve a PCE of 26.61% (certified: 26.21%). Mini&#8208;modules (active area: 14.0 cm2) incorporating DPC also reach 21.24% PCE.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are among the most promising photovoltaic technologies, yet their performance is critically constrained by uncontrolled crystallization, which generates suboptimal film morphologies and abundant defects. In this study, diphenyl carbonate (DPC) is introduced as a dual&#8208;functional molecular regulator that simultaneously governs nucleation and growth in FAPbI3 films. Through synergistic covalent carbonyl&#8208;Pb2+ coordination and non&#8208;covalent aromatic &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions, DPC promotes controlled PbI2 pre&#8208;aggregation to lower the nucleation barrier, while its strong precursor binding retards subsequent crystal growth. This cooperative regulation yields uniform, large&#8208;grain perovskite films with markedly reduced defect densities. Consequently, DPC&#8208;enabled PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.61% (certified 26.21%), outperforming the control devices (23.65%). Scalable mini&#8208;module (14.0&#160;cm2 active area) with DPC achieves a PCE of 21.24%. Furthermore, DPC&#8208;modified devices exhibit outstanding stability, retaining over 90% of their initial PCE after 1200&#160;h storage under ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;3 accelerated aging conditions and after 1100&#160;h of maximum power point tracking following ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocols. These findings establish a generalizable molecular strategy for overcoming intrinsic crystallization bottlenecks, advancing perovskite photovoltaics toward efficient, stable, and scalable deployment.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition of 2D Semiconducting Bi2O2S for High&#8208;Performance Field&#8208;Effect Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the successful low&#8208;temperature growth of high&#8208;quality Bi2O2S nanoplates via MOCVD, achieving a bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV and high field&#8208;effect mobility of 227&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Bi2O2S&#8208;based FETs exhibit outstanding on/off ratios, while photodetectors show high responsivity and fast response times, establishing Bi2O2S as a promising candidate for low&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Bi2O2S has emerged as a promising 2D semiconductor for high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) applications, effectively addressing limitations observed in conventional 2D materials, including environmental instability, challenges with achieving optimal bandgaps, and insufficient static power efficiency. However, practical application of Bi2O2S has been hindered by synthesis challenges; previous methods often relied on high&#8208;temperature processes (&gt;700&#160;&#176;C) for precursor sublimation resulting in the formation of undesired phases or solution&#8208;based approaches that compromise material quality. In this work, the growth of single&#8208;crystalline Bi2O2S nanoplates at a low temperature of &#8776;400&#160;&#176;C is demonstrated using metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), achieving a bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV compatible with Si&#8208;based devices. Fabricated Bi2O2S&#8208;based FETs through this process exhibit excellent electrical performance, with a maximum on/off ratio of 3.6 &#215; 10&#8313; and a field&#8208;effect mobility of 227&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, benefiting from the low effective mass (0.15&#160;m0) inherent to Bi2O2S. Furthermore, Bi2O2S photodetectors display remarkable optoelectronic characteristics, including a high responsivity of 11,577&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, rapid response time in the millisecond range, and a specific detectivity of 1014 Jones. These results confirm Bi2O2S's potential as a versatile semiconductor for next&#8208;generation electronics, offering both BEOL&#8208;compatible low&#8208;temperature synthesis and high&#8208;speed, low&#8208;power device capabilities.

         <title>Enzymatically Switchable Pyroptosis&#8208;Inducing Polymer Conjugate to Coordinate Host Immune Responses in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gasdermin&#8208;D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis is a potent form of immunogenic cell death that orchestrates innate and adaptive immunity. An Enzymatically switchable Pyroptosis&#8208;Inducing polymer Conjugate (EPIC) is developed that selectively induces gasdermin&#8208;D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis in cancer cells via chemiluminescence&#8208;triggered lysosomal disintegration. EPIC enhances dendritic and NK cell activation in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. When combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, EPIC boosts cytotoxic T&#8208;cell infiltration and memory T&#8208;cell formation, achieving durable tumor regression.








Abstract
Gasdermin&#8208;D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, an immunogenic cell death predominantly occurring in antigen&#8208;presenting cells, is pivotal in orchestrating innate and adaptive immunity. Therefore, this dynamic process holds significant potential as an effective cancer immunotherapy strategy. However, its adequate spatiotemporal control in cancer remains challenging. An Enzymatically switchable Pyroptosis&#8208;Inducing polymer Conjugate (EPIC) is reported that selectively triggers chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) in the lysosome in the presence of Cathepsin B, abundant in cancer cells. When exposed to cancer cells in vitro, EPIC generates reactive oxygen species via self&#8208;immolation&#8208;mediated CRET, triggering lysosomal membrane disintegration, followed by activation of the signaling cascade that cleaves gasdermin&#8208;D. Cleaved gasdermin&#8208;D forms pyroptotic pores in the cancer cell membrane, promoting the efflux of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and inflammatory cytokines. When systemically administered into the tumor&#8208;bearing mice, EPIC provokes a robust immune response by promoting dendritic cell maturation and reinvigorating cytotoxic NK cells. Combination of EPIC with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody enhanced infiltration of tumor&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells and promoted memory T cells, resulting in a durable remission of established tumors with complete tumor regression in more than half of the treated mice. Overall, EPIC has potential as a nanoplatform with multifaceted advantages for precise and effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained, Continuous Jumping of a Light&#8208;Driven Electronics&#8208;Free Insect&#8208;Scale Soft Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a 301 mg soft robot capable of continuous, autonomous jumping with energy harvesting, actuation, and control embedded in their physical structure without electronics. Coupling snap&#8208;through instability with self&#8208;shadowing of photoresponsive LCEs yields over 188 nonstop and 800 lifetime jumps, with self&#8208;righting, directional locomotion, sensing, and heavy load&#8208;bearing, advancing long&#8208;lived insect&#8208;scale autonomy.








Abstract
Insects scavenge energy from the environment for self&#8208;sustained operation, and some species use repeated jumping to traverse varied terrain. Such capabilities are desirable for surveillance, disaster recovery, environmental monitoring, and hazardous environment exploration. However, insect&#8208;scale (sub&#8208;gram) robots are typically limited to few jumps due to inefficient integration of energy, actuators, and control. Here, insect&#8208;scale (301&#160;mg) soft robots capable of continuous, autonomous jumping with energy harvesting, actuation, and control embedded in their physical structure without electronics are introduced. Powered by constant light, a single robot achieves 188 nonstop jumps and accumulates over 800 jumps in a year without diminished performance. This behavior is enabled by self&#8208;sustained, repeated snapping (SSRS), a light&#8208;driven mechanism from a self&#8208;shadowing&#8208;induced feedback loop based on dynamic light&#8211;material interplay. The SSRS exploits snap&#8208;through instability and self&#8208;shadowing of photoresponsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), enabling untethered, perpetual actuation, and the snapping dynamics are investigated through simulations and experiments. Beyond sustained motion, the robot demonstrates self&#8208;righting, directional jumping, obstacle negotiation, hazardous gas sensing, and extreme load&#8208;bearing (&#8776;1700 times its weight), highlighting potential for disaster recovery, confined&#8208;space exploration, and environmental monitoring. This work advances insect&#8208;scale robotics toward fully autonomous, long&#8208;lived micro&#8208;robots.

         <title>Multifunctional Liquid Metal&#8211;2D Material Composites: Structural Design, Properties, and Applications in Advanced Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal (LM)&#8211;2D material composites combine the high conductivity and fluidity of LM with the anisotropic properties and rich surface chemistry of 2D materials, enabling multifunctional performance in advanced electronics. This review summarizes recent advances in modification, structure, properties, and subsequently discusses current challenges and future prospects for next&#8208;generation multifunctional LM&#8211;2D material composites.








Abstract
The rapid advancement of high&#8208;integration electronics demands materials that unify thermal, electrical, and mechanical functionalities. Liquid metals (LMs) exhibit exceptional conductivity and self&#8208;healing capabilities, but their intrinsic fluidity poses leakage risks. Incorporation with 2D materials yields LM&#8211;2D material composites with enhanced structural stability and multifunctional integration. This review systematically summarizes: 1) interfacial enhancement strategies (oxidation, heterometallic doping, polymer grafting, mechanochemistry) to improve wettability and dispersion; 2) representative structural designs, including blended, core&#8211;shell, layered, and 3D networks supported by elastomers or hydrogels; 3) key properties across different structural types, such as mechanical robustness, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity; 4) multifunctional applications enabled by enabled by property synergy, spanning thermal&#8211;mechanical coupling (thermal management), electrical&#8211;mechanical coupling (electromagnetic interference shielding, wearable sensors, and energy storage electrodes), and electrical&#8211;thermal&#8211;mechanical coupling (multifunctional films). Despite significant progress, critical challenges remain in scalable fabrication, long&#8208;term reliability, and efficient recycling. To address these challenges, this review further discusses emerging directions for LM&#8211;2D material composites, including novel composite systems, responsive smart materials, multiscale manufacturing technologies, and AI&#8208;assisted design, aiming to provide a roadmap for their development in next&#8208;generation electronic applications.

         <title>Emergent Global&#8208;Pinning Exchange Bias in van der Waals Magnetic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates an emergent global&#8208;pinning exchange bias (GPEB) effect in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of diverse 2D vdW magnets, achieving long&#8208;range magnetic pinning up to 100&#160;&#181;m via simply partial stacking. By tuning interlayer coupling and coverage ratio, it offers a scalable approach for energy&#8208;efficient spintronic memory devices based on 2D vdW materials.








Abstract
As magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) technology becomes increasingly vital for emerging applications, such as artificial intelligence, the development of cost&#8208;effective and miniaturized solutions is essential. van der Waals (vdW) magnets, which can be vertically stacked with various functional blocks, offer promising potential to enhance the performance and scalability of memory devices. Nevertheless, the need for perfect alignment between adjacent layers and finite local interactions at the interfaces often complicates device architectures and leads to high power consumption. Addressing these challenges, a new device configuration with partial overlap while maintaining the global effect would be a promising scheme. Here, using Fe3GeTe2/MnBi2Te4 (FGT/MBT) as a paradigm, the global&#8208;pinning exchange bias (GPEB) effect is successfully achieved with a horizontal pinning distance approaching 100 &#181;m. Specifically, once stacking a small&#8208;area MBT on FGT, the entire FGT is fully biased due to magnetic couplings inherent to vdW magnets, as confirmed by the theoretical model. Interlayer coupling and coverage ratio provide additional degrees of freedom to manipulate the GPEB. Remarkably, this emergent GPEB effect is prevalent across vdW heterostructures composed of various vdW magnets. This work expands design flexibility and offers strategies for constructing new in&#8208;memory computing devices, opening exciting possibilities for future spintronic applications.

         <title>Biocompatible Ink Optimization Enables Functional Volumetric Bioprinting With Xolography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xolography's reliance on weak&#8208;base co&#8208;initiators introduces unique biochemical constraints. By dissecting the effects of extracellular pH, osmolality, and lysosomotropic stress, this study defines the biochemical design space that enables fully biocompatible, cell&#8208;laden volumetric printing.








Abstract
Xolography is a novel linear volumetric manufacturing technique that offers unparalleled precision and speed. Yet, its application to bioprinting remains limited due to insufficient understanding of biocompatibility constraints.

&lt;p&gt;Xolography's reliance on weak-base co-initiators introduces unique biochemical constraints. By dissecting the effects of extracellular pH, osmolality, and lysosomotropic stress, this study defines the biochemical design space that enables fully biocompatible, cell-laden volumetric printing.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xolography is a novel linear volumetric manufacturing technique that offers unparalleled precision and speed. Yet, its application to bioprinting remains limited due to insufficient understanding of biocompatibility constraints. Here, this work establishes fundamental design principles for cell-compatible Xolography bioinks by dissecting the effects of extracellular pH, osmolality, and lysosomotropic stress on cell viability and function. By systematically studying the tolerances for these parameters, this work defines a framework for bioink formulations that enables fast, support-free fabrication of complex designs with maintained cell viability and function as validated in different murine and human cell lines, primary human cells and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells. These results show that, unlike triethanolamine, BisTris indeed can function as a fully biocompatible co-initiator enabling cell viability beyond 90% as well as uncompromised metabolic activity and differentiation performance when used in a tightly controlled formulation, contrasting previous reports. This work showcases the biomedical potential of the formulation by achieving fibroblast-driven extracellular matrix (ECM) formation, endothelial sprouting from pre-vascularized spheroids, and maintenance of an iPSC-derived hepatocyte differentiation phenotype within Xolography-printed constructs. These advancements transform Xolography into a powerful and foremost reliable bioprinting platform for fabrication of complex, cell-laden structures for versatile applications in tissue engineering, organ-on-a-chip models, and regenerative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advanced Design and Characterization of Polyether&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyether solid electrolytes possess strong lithium&#8208;salt solvation ability and flexible interfacial contact, yet suffer from sluggish ion transport and poor interfacial stability in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cells. This review integrates multicomponent and structural tuning strategies, illustrates structure&#8211;property insights via multiscale characterizations, benchmarks pouch&#8208;cell performance, and outlines the scalability and consistency challenges facing commercialization.








Abstract
Polyether&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes have shown great potential in lithium batteries due to their excellent interfacial flexibility and high solvation ability for lithium salts. However, the problems of limited ion transport and insufficient interfacial stability have restricted the application of polyether&#8208;based electrolytes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#160;batteries. To tackle these problems, researchers have explored a variety of strategies, such as multi&#8208;component compounding and structural regulation, and developed a vast array of solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Therefore, this review first summarizes the key modification strategies and representative examples of electrolytes from a systematic design perspective, aiming at the two aforementioned major issues. Meanwhile, to precisely implement the above strategies and to design more effective modification strategies, latent yet valuable structure&#8211;property relationships should be further uncovered. Thus, multiscale characterizations are rationally integrated through representative case studies. Finally, it summarizes the reported performance of representative polyether&#8208;based solid&#8208;state pouch cells, emphasizes scale&#8208;up and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency, and outlines future research directions for translating these electrolytes into high&#8208;energy, market&#8208;ready batteries.

         <title>Ultrathin Monatomic Antimony Films by Sacrificial Atomic Layer Deposition for Phase Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;step sacrificial atomic layer deposition (s&#8208;ALD) process enables wafer&#8208;scale growth of ultrathin and uniform antimony (Sb) thin films. An ultrathin (&#8776;4 nm) Sb film is uniformly deposited with its characteristic bilayer structure (Sb&#8208;Sb) aligned along the substrate. The excellent surface coverage of the s&#8208;ALD allows facile electrical conduction even in the few&#8208;nanometer thickness range.








Abstract
Antimony (Sb) is an intriguing material for advanced electronics, with thickness&#8208;dependent properties at the nanoscale offering new functionalities. However, conventional methods for depositing Sb thin films cannot produce continuous ultrathin films with conformality in complex nanoscale structures. This study introduces a novel sacrificial atomic layer deposition (s&#8208;ALD) approach that overcomes these limitations by using chemical substitution between the antimony precursor and the pre&#8208;deposited Sb2Te3. The structural similarity between Sb2Te3 and Sb enables local epitaxial growth of a uniform, (00l)&#8208;oriented Sb film with exceptional surface smoothness (root&#8208;mean&#8208;squared roughness &lt;&lt; 1 nm) at a 4&#8208;nm thickness. Highly pure Sb films with excellent wafer&#8208;scale uniformity and conformality are achieved on high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio structures. The mechanism involves substitution reactions driven by the preferential Te&#8208;(CH3)3Si bonding, along with enhanced atomic diffusion through the aligned crystal structure. Phase change memory devices using 5&#8208;nm&#8208;thick s&#8208;ALD Sb films demonstrate ultrafast switching with femtosecond laser pulses (&#8776;220 fs) with high device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity (coefficient of variation &lt; 5 %) and ultralow drift coefficients (0.0013 for the on state and 0.0073 for the off state). This s&#8208;ALD technique offers a promising pathway for depositing ultrathin, uniform Sb films, enabling full utilization of Sb's unique nanoscale properties.

         <title>Constructing Highly Durable Fuel Cell Catalysts Through Integrating Graphitic Shell&#8208;Protected Composite Carbon Support with Gaseous Co Deposition&#8208;Driven PtCo Intermetallics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated strategy is developed to design high&#8208;performance Pt3Co intermetallic catalysts by regulating gaseous Co&#8208;driven diffusion into finely dispersed Pt nanoparticles supported on a ZIF&#8208;8/polyaniline&#8208;derived core&#8208;shell structured composite carbon support. The corresponding PGM catalysts simultaneously achieved exceptional carbon support and catalyst stabilities owing to highly ordered PtCo intermetallic nanoparticles covered with a thin carbon layer, which are well&#8208;dispersed on the unique composite carbon support.








Abstract
Metal dissolution, nanoparticle agglomeration, and carbon support corrosion cause significant performance degradation of current PtCo catalysts under acidic and oxidative oxygen reduction reaction. Here, an integrated strategy is presented to design high&#8208;performance Pt3Co intermetallic catalysts by regulating gaseous Co deposition&#8208;driven diffusion into Pt nanoparticles supported on a composite carbon. The composite carbon is derived from ZIF&#8208;8/polyaniline, consisting of a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area (HSC) core and a protective graphitic shell (GS), which is employed to design 40&#160;wt.% Pt/HSC@GS catalyst. The corresponding membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) can maintain 1.09 A cm&#8722;2 at 0.7&#160;V (20. 7% loss) after 10&#160;000 cycles (1.0&#8211;1.5&#160;V for carbon stability) and 1.15 A cm&#8722;2 (16.1% loss) after 150&#160;000 cycles (0.60&#8211;0.95&#160;V for catalyst stability). A ordered Pt3Co intermetallic is synthesized via a gaseous Co&#8208;deposition process, which yields a homogeneous Co&#8208;rich layer onto the Pt nanoparticles on the composite support, thereby facilitating Co diffusion into Pt crystal during subsequent ordering annealing to form the ordered intermetallic structure. This gaseous deposition leads to a thin carbon layer on PtCo nanoparticles, inhibiting particle growth during the annealing and mitigating Co dissolution under dynamic electrochemical conditions. The PtCo catalyst achieves impressive MEA performance and long&#8208;term durability (1.45 A cm&#8722;2 at 0.7&#160;V after 120&#160;000 cycles) under heavy&#8208;duty conditions.

         <title>Chiral Inorganic Nanomaterials: Exploring New Horizons in Catalysis Through Symmetry Breaking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral inorganic nanomaterials have emerged as a novel paradigm in catalytic design and modulation of various catalysis processes. This review highlights recent advances in their synthesis, characterization, and catalytic applications. Key chiral effects and their catalytic roles are discussed, and current challenges and future perspectives are outlined to guide further research in this growing field.








Abstract
Traditional catalytic strategies are based on composition engineering, active site modification and structural tuning to optimize performance. More recently, chirality has emerged as a novel design paradigm, enabling modulation of catalytic activity, selectivity, and enantioselective outcomes. In particular, chiral inorganic nanomaterials, which integrate intrinsic catalytic functions with unique asymmetric nanostructures, have demonstrated impressive chirality&#8208;dependent performance in various catalytic processes, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, and enantioselective organic transformations. Despite these developments, the rational design of chiral nanomaterials and mechanistic understanding of their chirality&#8208;governed catalytic behaviors remain limited. This review systematically summarizes recent progress in the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic applications of chiral inorganic nanomaterials. It covers both bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down synthetic strategies and highlights advanced techniques for probing their chiral structures and properties. Representative material systems are classified based on their composition, including metals, semiconductors, and hybrid materials. Key chirality&#8208;related effects relevant to catalysis, such as chiroptical responses, structural asymmetry, and spin regulation, are discussed, along with their implications on typical photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and enantioselective transformations. Finally, major challenges and prospective directions are outlined to guide further research and practical applications in this evolving field.

Representative material systems are classified based on their composition, including metals, semiconductors, and hybrid materials. Key chirality-related effects relevant to catalysis, such as chiroptical responses, structural asymmetry, and spin regulation, are discussed, along with their implications on typical photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and enantioselective transformations. Finally, major challenges and prospective directions are outlined to guide further research and practical applications in this evolving field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Laser&#8208;Directed Assembly of Stretchable Strain Sensors with Tunable Performance on Complex Curved Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a bilayer strain sensor fabrication strategy that enables large&#8208;scale patterning via laser direct writing on 3D stretchable substrates. The resulting sensors exhibit tunable performance through laser&#8208;induced microstructural engineering. By constructing a sensor array on a hemispherical surface, the authors further demonstrate the potential of this approach for curved&#8208;surface strain mapping and deformation reconstruction.








Abstract
Stretchable strain sensors are capable of accurately mapping deformation across object surfaces, serving as critical components in structural health monitoring and failure mitigation across diverse systems. However, the inherent geometric complexity and non&#8208;uniformity of real&#8208;world surfaces pose significant challenges to conformal sensor integration. Moreover, conventional strain sensors face inherent trade&#8208;offs among sensitivity, detection range, and tunability, limiting their adaptability in practical applications. This study introduces a laser direct writing strategy that combines material and process innovations to enable scalable fabrication of strain sensors on preformed stretchable curved surfaces. Precise control of laser&#8208;induced microstructures allows programmable tuning of electromechanical properties, enabling selective behaviors such as high linearity, strain insensitivity, or pronounced resistance changes at small strains. The resulting devices exhibit a high gauge factor of up to 106, a strain detection range exceeding 100%, a minimum detectable strain of 0.1%, and excellent linearity (correlation coefficient &gt; 0.98) within defined operational ranges. As a proof of concept, a sensor array is implemented for strain mapping and deformation reconstruction on a hemispherical 3D stretchable substrate, demonstrating the capability of this approach for high&#8208;resolution strain monitoring on complex, non&#8208;planar geometries.

         <title>La(OH)3&#8208;Based Lithium Ionic Conductor for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxide&#8208;based Li0.15Sr0.525La0.6(OH)3 (LSLOH) conductor is first designed and synthesized. The LSLOH is air&#8208;stable and cost&#8208;effective compared to existing inorganic electrolytes, and shows Li&#8314; conductivity of 0.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. The pouch cell with polymer&#8208;inorganic electrolyte delivers 146&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 reversible capacity over 200 cycles, showing the potential for quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (QSSLMBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation energy storage but face major challenges for applications, including air instability of electrolytes, high synthesis cost, and poor interfacial compatibility. Here, La(OH)3&#8208;based Li+ conductor Li0.15Sr0.525La0.6(OH)3 (LSLOH) is reported, which is air&#8208;stable and cost&#8208;effective. LSLOH serves as an ionic conductor exhibiting Li&#8314; conductivity of 0.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. To improve interfacial transport, LSLOH is incorporated into a polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;LiTFSI polymer electrolyte (PL) to form a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (PL&#8208;LSLOH). LSLOH provides additional Li&#8314; transport channels, while La3+ and Sr2+ interact with TFSI&#8722; to promote Li&#8314; mobility. Moreover, LSLOH induces the formation of a LiOH and Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, effectively suppressing Li dendrite growth. As a result, the LiNi0.6Co0.1Mn0.3O2 | PL&#8208;LSLOH | Li pouch cells achieve 2.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.83&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 (with cathode loading of 19&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) over 200 cycles with 92.5% initial capacity retention, underscoring the potential for scale&#8208;up. For the first time, this work demonstrates La(OH)3&#8208;based lithium ionic conductors and electrolyte design that address key barriers to the QSSLMBs.

         <title>Decoding Lithium Metal Battery Degradation with Symmetric&#8208;Cell Artificial Intelligence Diagnostics (SAID)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using Li|Li symmetric cells to exclude cathode effects, an artificial intelligence model is proposed to diagnose the key process responsible for lithium metal polarization acceleration, yielding experimentally validated insights applicable to lithium metal batteries and analogous metal&#8208;based battery optimization.








Abstract
While the underlying crosstalk effect between cathode and anode complicates the understanding of lithium metal degradation utilizing asymmetric (full)&#8208;cell data, employing a symmetric cell configuration enables isolation of contributions from specific electrodes. In this study, a symmetric&#8208;cell artificial intelligence diagnostics (SAID) is devised to decipher lithium metal anode degradation. Leveraging easily accessible, early&#8208;cycle lithium | lithium symmetric&#8208;cell data, SAID is demonstrated to accurately predict the elbow points (indicators of polarization acceleration) with a test mean absolute percentage error of 13.3%. More importantly, SAID reveals the persistent role of an initial&#8208;nucleation&#8208;related fingerprint in determining long&#8208;term cell polarization, which is validated through experiments and extended to full cells across different electrolytes. This approach, therefore, not only offers valuable insights into battery design but also exhibits great potential in uncovering hidden chemical correlations and advancing the field of energy storage in general.

         <title>Shutting Down the &#8216;Language Encoder&#8217;: A Pathogen&#8208;Derived Nano&#8208;Interferer Disrupt Sialylation Metabolism and Reprogram Intercellular Communication in Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glioblastoma (GBM) exploits aberrant membrane sialylation to establish a &#8216;language encoder&#8217; that translates metabolic states into glycan&#8208;mediated intercellular communication, enhancing signaling plasticity and immune evasion. This study introduces a metabolism&#8208;guided nano&#8208;interferer (OMV@HM&#8208;T/F) that crosses the BBB, suppresses the encoder by blocking glycosylation precursor synthesis and sialic acid activation, and remodels membrane glycans to restrain GBM malignancy.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM), constrained by the limited cranial space and the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), establishes a rapidly adaptable, generalized communication network through enhanced terminal sialylation of membrane proteins. This metabolism&#8208;driven network encodes cellular metabolic states into functional information at the membrane level, thereby markedly enhancing signaling plasticity, intercellular communication, and immune evasion, which together sustain and expand malignant phenotypes within a resource&#8208;limited microenvironment. Here, a &#8220;metabolism&#8208;guided decoding of communication architecture&#8221; strategy is proposed and developed a brain&#8208;targeted pathogen&#8208;derived nano&#8208;interferer (OMV@HM&#8208;T/F). By simultaneously inhibiting glycosylation precursor synthesis and sialic acid activation, the platform remodels membrane glycan structures, disrupts glycan&#8208;dependent communication scaffolds, and effectively blocks downstream signal amplification and immune suppression pathways. Integrating BBB penetrability with tumor microenvironment responsiveness, this strategy enables precise metabolic&#8208;level intervention, offering a promising approach to overcoming high adaptability and therapeutic resistance.

         <title>2D Silver Nanosheet Assembly for an Isotropic, Stretchable, and Highly Conductive Nanomembrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

A stretchable silver nanosheet nanomembrane (AgNS NM) is developed through partially&#8208;overlapped face&#8208;to&#8208;face contacts assembly of AgNSs, enhancing isotropic inter&#8208;sheet connectivity and maximizes material performance. Simulation and experiments reveal an AgNS&#8208;geometry&#8208;dependent design principle of the NM. The ultrathin AgNS NM features high conductivity and omnidirectional stretchability, enabling the fabrication of an impedance&#8208;tomography&#8208;based electronic skin device for spatially&#8208;resolved, real&#8208;time tactile mapping.








Abstract
Achieving isotropic electrical and mechanical properties is essential for skin&#8208;integrated electronics to operate reliably under complex, multidirectional skin deformations. However, nanomaterial&#8208;based composites in skin electronics often rely on anisotropic filler configurations to meet demanding requirements for high&#8208;quality bio&#8208;interfacing materials, such as ultrathin thickness, high conductivity, and stretchability. While directional alignment of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanofillers facilitates dense percolation, it compromises isotropic material uniformity. To overcome the trade&#8208;off between high performance and omnidirectional material properties in the nanocomposites, a controlled assembly strategy is proposed for silver nanosheets (AgNSs) that forms face&#8208;to&#8208;face contacts with partial overlaps, enhancing inter&#8208;sheet contact area and reducing contact resistance. Implementing this assembly configuration in an ultrathin elastomeric membrane yields a silver nanosheet nanomembrane (AgNS NM) with both isotropic material properties and high performance, featuring a high conductivity of &#8776;115&#160;000 S&#160;cm&#8722;1, a stretchability of &#8776;50%, and a total thickness of &#8776;235&#160;nm. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations (CGMD) reveal that the degree of overlap correlates with nanosheet geometry, providing design insights for controlling interfacial contact configurations in nanomaterials. Finally, the potential of the AgNS NM for bio&#8208;interfacing applications is demonstrated through an electrical impedance tomography&#8208;based tactile electronic skin, enabling reliable multi&#8208;point pressure mapping and real&#8208;time tracking.

         <title>Biomimetic TPMS Structure&#8208;Based Entangled Hydrogel for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a TPMS structure&#8208;based entangled hydrogel mesh (TSEHs) for efficient atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Its unique hierarchical porous structure offers a large air&#8208;sorbent interface and low mass transfer resistance, enabling superior AWH performance of over 1.28 g g&#8722;1 in 195 min. Such enhanced sorption kinetics are more pronounced in thicker sorbents, highlighting its potential for decentralized freshwater production.









Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is emerging as a sustainable and decentralized strategy for producing freshwater. However, achieving rapid AWH remains challenging due to the slow sorption kinetics, especially in the case of thick hygroscopic hydrogels. Here, a TPMS structure&#8208;based entangled hydrogel mesh (TSEHs) is proposed, featuring a hierarchical porous structure that facilitates a high mass transfer coefficient and a significant air&#8208;hygroscopic site interface. The TPMS&#8208;based hierarchical structure endows the TSEHs with rapid sorption&#8208;desorption kinetics. As a result, in comparison to conventional dense hydrogels (CDHs), TSEHs achieve a remarkable reduction in sorption time by 385%. When the thickness of TSEHs increases from 2 to 12&#160;mm, only a slight decrease in equilibrium sorption time is observed, while CDHs exhibit an exponential increase in equilibrium sorption. Furthermore, the rapid water uptake of ultra&#8208;thick TSEHs is demonstrated at 50&#160;mm, which, to the best of the knowledge, represents the largest recorded thickness for hygroscopic gels. Additionally, a continuous solar&#8208;driven TSEH&#8208;based water production prototype is developed, achieving a high water collection rate of 4.89&#160;kg m&#8722;2 under 1 sun and showcasing its significant practical potential.

         <title>Radiation Effects in Electret Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistors Due to High Flux and High Dose X&#8208;Ray Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electret&#8208;style organic thin&#8208;film transistors are evaluated for synchrotron X&#8208;ray dosimetry at ultra&#8208;high dose rates, showing promising performance and agreement with standard detectors. XPS and NEXAFS reveal radiation&#8208;induced oxidation and Fermi level shifts in pentacene and polystyrene, correlating with reduced charge carrier mobility and providing insight into radiation degradation mechanisms in organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic electronic devices offer lightweight, flexible, and low&#8208;cost alternatives to conventional semiconductor technologies, with growing interest in dosimetry applications. An organic thin&#8208;film transistor (OTFT) with a polymer electret is presented for high dose&#8208;rate synchrotron dosimetry. The OTFT operates in accumulated&#8208;dose and real&#8208;time readout modes and demonstrates excellent linearity with various beam filtrations. Device response increases with decreasing energy, and simulations reveal gold contacts as the primary source of energy dependence. Depth dose measurements show good agreement with a commercial detector, validating dosimetric performance. Minimal changes in mobility are observed at clinically relevant doses, but mobility degradation becomes apparent after high accumulated doses, indicating radiation damage in active materials. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) techniques are employed to analyze pristine and irradiated active material films separately and in a combined stack. XPS reveals oxidation in pentacene and a Fermi level shift in polystyrene in irradiated films, both of which likely cause the mobility reduction observed in OTFTs. Valence band and NEXAFS spectra show no evidence of new states in the bandgap. These findings demonstrate the potential of OTFTs as dosimeters for high dose&#8208;rates and clarify how radiation alters the molecular structure and electronic behavior of the device.

         <title>Janus Nanohybrids Enable Superflash Warming and High&#8208;Affinity Ice Confinement for Cross&#8208;Scale Cryopreservation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a Janus nanocryoprotectant featuring a heterogeneous cranial and corporal structure, achieving 98.4% ice recrystallization inhibition and record&#8208;high superflash warming rates across various scales. It effectively addresses key challenges in cross&#8208;scale cryopreservation of commercial cell cryopackages, offering significant advancements for cell therapy and organ transplantation.








Abstract
Strong hydration of cryoprotective agents reduces the glass transition temperature of water and suppresses ice formation. However, lethal cooling and warming remain a critical obstacle to cross&#8208;scale cryopreservation of clinical biospecimens. Herein, a snowman&#8208;like Janus nanohybrid composed of magnetic iron tetraoxide and photothermal polypyrrole is reported. Its cranial&#8211;corporal asymmetry enables heterogeneous hydration for a record high efficiency of ice confinement, reducing mean ice crystal area by 98.4%. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that Janus architecture simultaneously enhances interactions with ice and strengthens the local hydration anisotropy, accounting for the effective inhibition of ice growth. Superflash warming over 920&#160;&#176;C min&#8210;1 by magnetically rotating its anisotropic structure for uniform heat dissipation narrows the hostile temperature window in micro&#8208;/macroscopic scenarios, as further confirmed by Monte Carlo modeling. This design enables cost&#8208;effective post&#8208;thaw magnetic retrieval, eliminating the need for heavy centrifuges, well&#8208;suited for scalable and on&#8208;site applications. As a result, cryopreserved samples from single cells, bacteria, to porcine trachea retain near&#8208;complete viability and functionality. Therefore, this study offers a promising technique to bridge the gap between microscale cell storage and whole&#8208;organ preservation.

         <title>Regulation of Solvation and Interfacial Chemistry via Monofluorinated Cations Enables High&#8208;Voltage and Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel localized moderate&#8208;concentration ionic liquid electrolyte, derived from the monofluorinated ionic liquid, has been developed that exhibits superior safety performance and good compatibility with lithium metal anodes and Ni&#8208;rich cathodes.








Abstract
The fluorine&#8208;rich electrode electrolyte interphase, chemically sourced from fluorinated anions and solvents, plays a pivotal role in improving the cycling stability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) equipped with Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. To prestore fluorine source on cations, here a novel monofluorinated cationic skeleton has been designed and synthesized. Its role is first investigated in the regulation of solvation structure and evolution in both bulk and interface regions.

&lt;p&gt;A novel localized moderate-concentration ionic liquid electrolyte, derived from the monofluorinated ionic liquid, has been developed that exhibits superior safety performance and good compatibility with lithium metal anodes and Ni-rich cathodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fluorine-rich electrode electrolyte interphase, chemically sourced from fluorinated anions and solvents, plays a pivotal role in improving the cycling stability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) equipped with Ni-rich cathodes. To prestore fluorine source on cations, here a novel monofluorinated cationic skeleton has been designed and synthesized. Its role is first investigated in the regulation of solvation structure and evolution in both bulk and interface regions. The monofluorinated cation can compete with lithium ions for coordinating electrolyte molecules, which improves the oxidative stability of solvents on the cathode surface and prevents the undesirable transition from the anion-rich to anion-deficient structure at the anode interface induced by the interfacial electric field. By leveraging this ionic liquid architecture carrying fluorine in both cation and anion, A localized moderate-concentration ionic liquid electrolyte (LMCILE) is developed that exhibits exceptional compatibility with lithium metal anodes and superior safety characteristics. LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|LMCILE|Li (4.5&#160;V) cells display excellent cycle stability with a good capacity retention of 82.9% over 950 cycles. The Ni-rich LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|LMCILE|Li (4.5&#160;V) system also delivers good electrochemical performance with high capacity retention of 91.4% after 300 cycles and 90.3% after 200 cycles, even at 60&#160;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Potent Liver&#8208;Tropic mRNA Lipid Nanoparticles: ApoE&#8208;Mediated Delivery Through a Low&#8208;Density Lipoprotein Receptor Independent Uptake Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helper and ionizable lipids play a crucial role in determining ApoE binding and subsequent liver tropism and LDLR&#8208;mediated uptake. Ionizable lipids primarily govern the LDLR&#8208;independent uptake pathway. This complementary interplay between lipid components ultimately governs LNP delivery performance and therapeutic efficacy in the liver.








Abstract
The development of nucleic acid therapeutics using non&#8208;viral delivery systems requires efficient payload delivery to target organs for higher potency and tolerability. While lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations influence biodistribution, cellular uptake, and therapeutic efficacy, underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study develops potent mRNA&#8208;LNP formulations and investigates determinants of liver tropism using ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency as a protein replacement therapy model. Systematic screening of ionizable and helper lipids, optimization of composition and process, and biophysical characterization identify a liver&#8208;tropic helper lipid&#8211;1,2&#8208;dierucoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine (DEPE) that modulates LNP structure and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) binding, enhancing liver&#8208;specific delivery. Analysis of ionizable lipid chemistry reveals its role in cellular uptake mechanisms, leading to the identification of a novel ionizable lipid designed with N&#8208;(2&#8208;Hydroxyethyl)piperazine&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;(4&#8208;butanesulfonic acid) (HEPBS) core that enables efficient delivery independent of the low&#8208;density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) pathway. The optimized formulation achieves robust dose responsiveness, sustained therapeutic expression, and favorable tolerability in preclinical models. Therapeutic levels of OTC protein expression are observed with minimal toxicity, as indicated by stable liver function markers and cytokine levels. These findings provide mechanistic insights and establish a platform for mRNA&#8208;based protein replacement therapies, supporting broader applications in rare genetic diseases requiring hepatic gene expression.

         <title>Microphase&#8208;Separated Hydrogel Electrolytes with Selective Ion Transportation Pathways for Flexible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study presents a microphase&#8208;separated single&#8208;zinc&#8208;ion conducting hydrogel electrolyte (SIHE) formed by disentangling polyanionic zinc&#8208;alginate chains using Nafion (ZA/N). The engineered hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains create continuous Zn2+ pathways, yielding high ion selectivity and fast transport. The ZA/N electrolyte enables dendrite&#8208;free cycling and long&#8208;life, deformation&#8208;tolerant flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries, offering a general strategy for high&#8208;performance SIHEs.









Abstract
Flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics and soft robotics, yet their development is hindered by the non&#8208;selective ion transport of conventional hydrogel electrolytes, which induces concentration polarization, uneven Zn2+ flux, and dendrite formation, ultimately causing battery failure. Here, a microphase&#8208;separated single&#8208;zinc&#8208;ion conducting hydrogel electrolyte (SIHE) constructed via polymer chain disentanglement within a polyanionic zinc&#8208;alginate (ZA) matrix is reported. Due to the pronounced steric disparity between Zn2+ and the alginate chains, ZA holds intrinsic potential for ion&#8208;selective transport. However, spontaneous chain entanglement within the alginate network under the applied electric field severely impedes the formation of continuous ion transport pathways, limiting Zn2+ conduction. By incorporating Nafion, well&#8208;defined hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains are induced that simultaneously relax the entangled polymer network and establish continuous Zn2+&#8208;conducting pathways. This microstructural engineering enables a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.967 and ionic conductivity of 25.5 mS cm&#8722;1, resolving the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between ion selectivity and transport kinetics. The zinc&#8208;alginate/Nafion (ZA/N) electrolyte enables dendrite&#8208;free cycling for over 4600 h. The ZA/N&#8208;based flexible ZIB retains 90% capacity after 5000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This work presents a general strategy to engineer high&#8208;performance SIHEs for safe and durable flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Harnessing Targeted Photodynamic Therapy to Synergistically Activate T Cell and NK Cell Responses in Multiple Myeloma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel targeted photodynamic therapy system is developed that simultaneously activates adaptive immunity through T cells and innate immunity through NK cells, thereby fostering a synergistic anti&#8208;tumor immune response in multiple myeloma (MM). In vivo studies using an NSG mouse model demonstrate robust activation of patient&#8208;derived T and NK cells with this agent, leading to potent anti&#8208;MM immunotherapy effects.








Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable malignancy, with immune suppression in the bone marrow microenvironment playing a critical role in disease progression and relapse. Restoring both adaptive and innate immunity represents a promising therapeutic strategy. In this study, a novel photodynamic therapy (PDT) platform is developed that simultaneously activates both adaptive immunity through T cells and innate immunity through natural killer (NK) cells, thereby fostering a synergistic anti&#8208;tumor immune response in MM. A series of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based photosensitizers is synthesized and compared, identifying a dual&#8208;acceptor molecular design with superior PDT efficacy. The high&#8208;performance AIEgen is formulated into nanoparticles and functionalized with B&#8208;cell maturation antigen monoclonal antibodies for precise MM targeting. Upon photoactivation, the nanoagent triggers immunogenic cell death, dendritic cell activation, and T&#8208;cell priming. Simultaneously, it induces DNA damage in MM cells, upregulating MICA/B expression via the ATM/SMAD1 pathway to activate NK cells through NKG2D receptor engagement. In vivo studies using an NSG mouse model demonstrate robust activation of patient&#8208;derived T and NK cells, leading to potent anti&#8208;MM effects. This work presents a dual&#8208;pronged immunotherapeutic strategy to overcome immune suppression in MM, offering a synergistic approach to harness both adaptive and innate immunity for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Bioinspired Force&#8208;Inducible Hydrogel Conduit for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) causes serious health problems for patients. A bioinspired force&#8208;inducible nerve conduit can self&#8208;generate enhanced capillary forces without external stimuli to promote directed axon growth and delivery of Schwann cells toward the nerve distal ends, paralleling the repairing efficacy of autografts in long&#8208;gap PNI. This innovative approach enhances the potential for clinical implementation in long&#8208;gap PNI therapies.








Abstract
Long&#8208;gap peripheral nerve injury (PNI) presents a significant challenge since the growth cone at the proximal end fails to detect and respond to neurotrophic signals from the distal ends, even when bridging the long&#8208;gap with nerve guide conduits (NGCs), impeding the motivated growth of new axons. In this study, a bioinspired force&#8208;inducible multichannel nerve guide conduit (FI&#8208;MNGC) is developed, constructed from silk fibrin&#8208;based hydrogel. By mimicking the gradient capillary architectures in vascular plants, the FI&#8208;MNGC utilizes a multichannel design with gradient apertures that can self&#8208;generate enhanced capillary forces, which not only promote directed axon growth but also guide the directed delivery of Schwann cells (SCs) toward the distal ends of the injured nerve, without the need for any external stimuli. Implemented in a rat model with a 16&#160;mm and a rabbit model with a 30&#160;mm long&#8208;gap sciatic nerve defect, the FI&#8208;MNGC significantly accelerates the recovery process, paralleling the efficacy of autografts in nerve regeneration, functional recovery, and repair speed. This innovative approach offers a promising alternative to autografts, enhancing the potential for clinical implementation in long&#8208;gap PNI therapies.

Implemented in a rat model with a 16&#160;mm and a rabbit model with a 30&#160;mm long-gap sciatic nerve defect, the FI-MNGC significantly accelerates the recovery process, paralleling the efficacy of autografts in nerve regeneration, functional recovery, and repair speed. This innovative approach offers a promising alternative to autografts, enhancing the potential for clinical implementation in long-gap PNI therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A One&#8208;Pot Carbonyl&#8208;Functionalization Strategy for Hybrid Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Towards Highly Efficient Narrowband Blue and Yellow&#8208;Green OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a novel one&#8208;pot method is developed for introducing carbonyls into the B/N&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF molecule BCzBN, yielding blue&#8208;emitting BN&#9472;CO. BN&#9472;CO is further converted into yellow&#8208;green BN&#8208;CN via iron&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;annulation, which combines B/N&#8208;based and imine/amine&#8208;based structures. Both molecules showed narrower spectra compared with their B/N&#8208;based precursors as well as good OLED performance, validating the efficacy of the proposed MR hybridization design.








Abstract
The incorporation of fused carbonyl structures into multi&#8208;resonance (MR) molecular frameworks is a promising strategy for precise emission color tuning and spectral narrowing. However, few molecules have been developed through this strategy, primarily because of the harsh reaction conditions required for carbonyl&#8208;related reactions. Herein, a feasible one&#8208;pot synthetic approach is reported for embedding carbonyl groups as lockers in B/N&#8208;based skeletons under mild conditions, yielding BN&#8208;CO, a blue boron/nitrogen/carbonyl hybrid MR emitter. Owing to enhanced molecular planarity and rigidity, BN&#8208;CO exhibits an emission maximum (&#955;e) of 462 nm with an ultra&#8208;narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16 nm. These carbonyl groups also function as versatile modification sites. Subsequent aza&#8208;annulation affords a yellow&#8208;green&#8208;emitting BN&#8208;CN (&#955;e = 546 nm, FWHM = 26 nm), which uniquely combines imine/amine with B/N MR characteristics while exhibiting a significant 84 nm emission red&#8208;shift. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit high maximum EQEs (33.5% for BN&#8208;CO and 38.0% for BN&#8208;CN). Notably, BN&#8208;CN&#8208;based devices exhibit extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;offs (EQE = 34.2% at 100,000 cd/m2) and a maximum luminance of 5.61&#215;10&#8309; cd/m2. The proposed approach provides a versatile route for fabricating novel MR architectures and enables the use of carbonyl groups as tunable modification sites facilitating molecular engineering.

         <title>Metallophilic Non&#8208;van der Waals Roll&#8208;ups Engineered for Long&#8208;Life Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique metallophilic non&#8208;vdW roll&#8208;ups of transition metal carbides are developed by metal&#8208;bonding MXene roll&#8208;ups via a pulsed Joule&#8208;heating technology. These non&#8208;vdW roll&#8208;ups exhibit high thermal stability and unexpected metallophilic property to molten metals, facilitating the formation of thin metal foils with high mechanical tensile strengths. Moreover, the full cells with these metal hybrid electrodes exhibit a long&#8208;term cycling stability.








Abstract
Metal hybrid electrodes are promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries owing to their high theoretical capacities. However, their practical employment is hampered by the inherent incompatibility between molten metals and composite materials resulting from the high surface tensions. Herein, unique metallophilic non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) roll&#8208;ups of transition metal carbides are produced via metal&#8208;bonding adjacent atomic layers in scrolled MXenes, featuring a nano&#8208;sized hollow structure and abundant surface dangling bonds as well as remarkable thermal stability up to 800&#160;&#176;C. These features enable the formation of chemical bonding and strong capillary forces between the non&#8208;vdW roll&#8208;ups and molten metals such as Li, Ga, Mg, and their alloys, leading to the unexpected metallophilic property. As a result, the surface tensions of metal&#8208;based composites are significantly reduced, facilitating the fabrication of thin metal hybrid foils with high mechanical tensile strengths. For instance, a Mg foil incorporated with non&#8208;vdW Al&#8208;V2CTx roll&#8208;ups exhibits a high tensile strength up to 204&#160;MPa, &#8776;2 times that of bare Mg. When employed as an anode in magnesium batteries, the full cell coupled with the Mo6S8 cathode delivers long&#8208;term cycling stability with &#8776;90.0% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C, attributed to the low diffusion resistance of the hybrid electrode.

         <title>Aqueous Sodium Humate Binder Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Voltage Cathodes via Protection from Interface to Bulk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eco&#8208;friendly and water&#8208;soluble sodium humate (NaHA) working as multifunctional binder enables high&#8208;performance for high&#8208;voltage cathodes. It is found that the proposed binder simultaneously stabilizes the interphase and bulk structure in high&#8208;voltage LCO via uniform surface coating and lattice&#8208;cognate in situ trace&#8208;level Na doping in the bulk during cycles, respectively.








Abstract
Raising the charging cutoff voltage is a well&#8208;established approach to enhance the energy density of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathodes, known for their high bulk energy density, in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their practical implementation under high&#8208;voltage conditions remains limited by interphase instability and bulk structural degradation. Herein, an innovative application of low&#8208;cost and water&#8208;soluble sodium humate (NaHA) is proposed, traditionally employed in aquaculture and pharmaceuticals, as a multifunctional binder for high&#8208;voltage LCO cathodes. Enriched with &#9472;COOH and &#9472;OH functional groups, NaHA not only forms robust hydrogen bonds with the LCO surface, enabling uniform coating on LCO particles, but also promotes a protective interphase microenvironment. More importantly, NaHA facilitates lattice&#8208;cognate in situ trace Na doping into the LCO bulk lattice during cycling, effectively enhancing its structural stability. This dual modification strategy, combining surface confinement and bulk reinforcement, endows LCO cathodes with ultra&#8208;stable electrochemical performance, retaining 95.1% capacity after 1700 cycles at 4.45&#160;V and 87.1% over 1000 cycles at 4.5&#160;V. Moreover, the water solubility of NaHA simplifies end&#8208;of&#8208;life electrode disassembly and promotes recyclability, supporting sustainable battery design. This binder&#8208;directed strategy offers a scalable, eco&#8208;friendly, and efficient binder&#8208;based stabilization route for high&#8208;voltage LCO cathodes, paving the way for the development of high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy LIBs.

         <title>Suppressing Energetic Disorder of Organic Semiconductors for Semitransparent Photovoltaics and Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of using phthalate esters as assembly&#8208;inducing agents (AIAs) is introduced to improve the packing ordering of organic semiconductors, thereby reducing the energetic disorders. After AIA processing, the light utilization efficiency of semitransparent organic photovoltaics and the mobility of organic field&#8208;effect transistors are improved by 13.7% and 33.3%, respectively.








Abstract
The weak intermolecular interaction and short&#8208;range aggregation endow organic semiconductors with the merits of flexibility, light weight, and solution processibility, while introducing more disorders at the same time. The greater degree of disorders in organic semiconductors, compared to inorganic semiconductors, is one of the major obstacles to their performance; thus, minimizing disorders is a key approach to boost the performance of organic electronics. Here, a strategy of using phthalate esters is introduced as assembly&#8208;inducing agents (AIAs) to improve the packing ordering of organic semiconductors, thereby reducing the energetic disorders and improving the device performance. With dioctyl phthalate AIA, the organic semiconductor PM6 shows a 24% reduction in Urbach energy, 11% narrower absorption full width at half maximum, and suppressed absorption tails in thin film. In organic field&#8208;effect transistors, this strategy offers a lift of hole mobility by 33.3%. In semitransparent organic photovoltaics, this strategy improves the average visible transmittance by 11.2% while maintaining the power conversion efficiency, yielding a high light utilization efficiency of 4.63% in optical structure&#8208;free devices. This work provides a facile and effective approach to suppress the energetic disorder of organic semiconductors and opens up a new avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance organic electronics.

Here, a strategy of using phthalate esters is introduced as assembly-inducing agents (AIAs) to improve the packing ordering of organic semiconductors, thereby reducing the energetic disorders and improving the device performance. With dioctyl phthalate AIA, the organic semiconductor PM6 shows a 24% reduction in Urbach energy, 11% narrower absorption full width at half maximum, and suppressed absorption tails in thin film. In organic field-effect transistors, this strategy offers a lift of hole mobility by 33.3%. In semitransparent organic photovoltaics, this strategy improves the average visible transmittance by 11.2% while maintaining the power conversion efficiency, yielding a high light utilization efficiency of 4.63% in optical structure-free devices. This work provides a facile and effective approach to suppress the energetic disorder of organic semiconductors and opens up a new avenue for fabricating high-performance organic electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Inorganic Nanomembrane Tubes: Rolled&#8208;Up Piezoelectrics for Microacoustic Wave&#8208;Based Actuators and Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a self&#8208;assembly process to generate free&#8208;standing piezoelectric nanomembranes, forming ultracompact microtubular acoustic wave sensors and actuators. The miniaturized 3D piezoelectric platform reported in this work can be applied in telecommunication, energy harvesting, and acoustofluidics. Moreover, the 3D self&#8208;assembly can add a degree of freedom for topological design of acousto&#8208;optic and magneto&#8208;acoustic devices.








Abstract
Shaping piezoelectrics into innovative 3D microstructures is an emerging field, offering the potential to unlock new functionalities through topological engineering. Existing methods can create 3D piezoelectric composites and origami&#8208;inspired structures, but they often reduce electromechanical resonance quality, especially when using organic elastic backbones with low mechanical quality factors. At the same time, 2D free&#8208;standing piezoelectric nanomembranes used in acoustic wave resonators require thin film materials with low intrinsic stress to prevent device rupture as lateral dimensions increase. In this work, the first example of 3D self&#8208;assembled piezoelectrics composed entirely of inorganic materials is presented. By precisely controlling mechanical stress and the nanomembrane release process, free&#8208;standing nanomembranes are shaped into conformably stable tubular structures. The resulting rolled&#8208;up piezoelectric (RUP) structures can be tuned in diameter, length, and winding number to optimize their performance for either actuation or sensing applications. Tubes up to 11&#160;mm in length and 3.5&#160;mm in rolling length are demonstrated, with functionality confirmed through 1&#8208;port interdigital transducers (IDT) and 2&#8208;port delay&#8208;line architectures, integrating up to 10 mm2 of a free&#8208;standing nanomembrane. Such devices can open new application possibilities for miniaturized medical devices, telecommunication, microfluidics, and energy harvesting, considering the large functional surface which adds another degree of freedom for topological design.

         <title>Sieving Hydrogen Isotopes via Machine Learning Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) of High&#8208;Quality Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h&#8208;BN) on Iron Foils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;atomic scale separation of hydrogen isotopes (H+/D+) require near pristine h&#8208;BN membranes, and scalable synthesis of such high&#8208;quality h&#8208;BN comparable to mechanically exfoliated crystals remains a significant challenge. This study reports a scalable Fe&#8208;catalyzed Machine&#8208;Learning Enabled Chemical vapor deposition process for bottom&#8208;up large&#8208;area, high&#8208;quality monolayer h&#8208;BN film synthesis and demonstrate H+/D+ separation with selectivity approaching mechanically exfoliated h&#8208;BN.








Abstract
Atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ceramics, such as monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), present potential for disruptive advances in separations. However, sub&#8208;atomic scale separation of hydrogen isotopes (H+/D+) require near pristine 2D material membranes, and scalable synthesis of such high&#8208;quality h&#8208;BN comparable to mechanically exfoliated crystals remains a significant challenge. Here, we&#160;report a scalable Fe&#8208;catalyzed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for bottom&#8208;up synthesis of large&#8208;area, high&#8208;quality monolayer h&#8208;BN films, overcoming key limitations of conventional ammonia&#8208;based routes. By leveraging mechanistic insights and higher CVD temperatures, we&#160;suppress multilayer formation and achieve uniform monolayer h&#8208;BN coverage on commercially available Fe foils. Machine learning enables systematic exploration of the complex, multi&#8208;dimensional CVD parameter space (growth time, temperature, precursor temperature, multilayer faction, coverage), providing data&#8208;driven approaches to visualize and identify process regimes facilitating predominantly monolayer h&#8208;BN growth with minimal secondary nuclei/ad&#8208;layers. The optimized Fe&#8208;catalyzed CVD h&#8208;BN membranes show high&#8208;quality as observed by proton/deuteron (H+/D+) selectivity &#8776;8.45, approaching the highest quality benchmark of mechanically exfoliated h&#8208;BN (H+/D+ selectivity &#8776;10) as well as significantly outperforming Cu&#8208;catalyzed CVD h&#8208;BN membranes (H+/D+ selectivity &#8776;3.62, control selectivity &#8776;1.7). Our work provides a scalable cost&#8208;effective route for high&#8208;quality monolayer h&#8208;BN synthesis for sub&#8208;atomic scale separations (H+/D+) and demonstrates the broader potential of machine learning&#8208;guided optimization of CVD for advancing synthesis of 2D materials.

         <title>Disrupting Complement&#8208;Inflammation Positive Feedback Circuit via Oligonucleotide Hydrogel Microspheres for Reversing Joint Inflammation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following intra&#8208;articular injection, MMP&#8208;9&#8208;responsive hydrogel microspheres release C5 antisense oligonucleotide liposomes, selectively inhibiting complement activation in inflammatory synovial cells, reducing C5a&#8208;driven inflammatory cell activation, and inhibiting immune complexes&#8211;mediated complement reactivation. This multilayer regulation can remodel the RA joint immune microenvironment and significantly delay disease progression by suppressing the complement&#8211;inflammation circuit.








Abstract
The positive feedback circuit between the complement system and inflammatory immune responses maps the malignant progression of chronic joint inflammation. Prolonged dysregulation of the immune microenvironment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) further exacerbates sustained complement activation, thereby establishing a vicious cycle. In this study, MMP&#8208;9&#8208;responsive, injectable micro&#8208;nano geneplexes (C5ASO@HAP&#8208;CL&#8208;TIMP@HMs) are developed for on&#8208;demand regulation of complement component C5, aiming to disrupt this pathological circuit. C5 antisense oligonucleotides (C5ASO) are loaded into cationic liposomes, which are subsequently encapsulated within hyaluronic acid microspheres via click chemistry. In vitro, these geneplexes effectively block abnormal C5 activation in RA synoviocytes, restore macrophage polarization balance, reduce pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels and immune complex precursor molecules, and upregulate anti&#8208;inflammatory mediators. In an adjuvant&#8208;induced arthritis rat model, they significantly alleviate joint swelling and cartilage degradation and suppress inflammatory responses, further highlighting the therapeutic potential of geneplexes in dismantling the complement&#8208;inflammation circuit. In summary, the development of micro&#8208;nano geneplexes capable of precisely disrupting the complement&#8208;inflammatory circuit in RA offers a promising new perspective for the targeted treatment of chronic joint inflammation.

         <title>The Space Within: How Architected Voids Promote Tissue Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the role of void spaces in tissue engineering scaffolds and examines four key methods for introducing porosity into hydrogels at different scales. It discusses sacrificial templating, microgels, phase separation, and 3D printing, highlighting principles, advantages, and limitations. It also addresses emerging strategies integrating these techniques to better mimic physiological microenvironments in hierarchical structures and enhance scaffold functionality.








Abstract
Physiological void spaces exist at every scale of the human body, from organs to molecules, facilitating transport, signal propagation, and localized biochemical activity. Constriction of these spaces (e.g., arterial occlusion, fibrosis) highlights their importance, making their mimicry essential in tissue engineering (TE). This review examines four key strategies for introducing porosity into hydrogels across multiple length scales: templating, microgels, phase separation, and 3D printing. The first three methods enable the engineering of physiological environments at the nano&#8208; to micro&#8208;scale, mimicking tissue&#8208; and extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;level spaces. Templating involves embedding and removal of gas, liquid, or solid phases, leaving behind pores. Microgel annealing generates inherent interstitial voids. Liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) creates biphasic networks reminiscent of native ECM. The fourth approach, extrusion&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D printing techniques, enables the fabrication of larger&#8208;scale spaces, such as luminal structures (e.g., vasculature, airways, and ducts). Combining these methods enables the creation of hierarchical architectures from the nano&#8208; to centimeter scale. The review also highlights Filamented Light (FLight) technology, which creates internal microstructural voids relevant to anisotropic tissues. This review offers insights into current methods and their convergence for generating biomimetic void spaces to meet the physiological demands of cells, tissues, and organs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Conductivity Enhancement of Robust All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Ion Elastomers via Strain&#8208;Induced Ion Channel Alignment and Temperature&#8208;Activated Ion&#8208;Gated Release</title>

         <dc:description>
Enhancing the electrical conductivity of ionic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state conductors under stretch and temperature&#8208;altering conditions remains challenging. This work simultaneously achieves strain&#8208;induced and temperature&#8208;gated conductivity enhancement by modulating the microphase structure and interfacial interactions through in situ polymerization of polyacrylamide and the introduction of lithium salts in SEBS. With their remarkable conductivity and mechanical properties, flexible strain sensors in a wide temperature and stretching range are realized.








Abstract
Despite their potential in ionic electronics, conventional ionic conductors face critical limitations, including modest strain&#8208;modulated conductivity and restricted self&#8208;regulation under temperature variations. Here, a mechanically robust all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ionic elastomer is presented, engineered through molecular design and microphase separation. By in situ integrating polyacrylamide (PAM) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) into maleic anhydride&#8208;grafted styrene&#8208;ethylene&#8208;butylene&#8208;styrene (SEBS&#8208;MAH), a hierarchical structure with dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions (hydrogen bonds, lithium bonds, and cation&#8208;&#960; effects) is achieved. This design yields exceptional mechanical properties, including a tensile strength of 46.4 MPa, strain of 1066%, and toughness of 207.8 MJ m&#8722;3, alongside outstanding recyclability and puncture resistance. Remarkably, strain&#8208;induced alignment of microphase&#8208;separated domains reduces ion transport tortuosity, enabling a 1300 times conductivity enhancement at 1066% strain. Concurrently, temperature&#8208;gated ion release from confined regions triggers a 1600 times conductivity increase at 120&#160;&#176;C. The elastomer maintains high conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;3 S m&#8722;1) across an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range (&#8722;45&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C), overcoming the limitations of conventional hydrogels and ionogels. This work pioneers a dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive strategy for advanced ionic conductors, offering transformative potential in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and adaptive sensors.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Polymer Electrolyte with Liquid Single&#8208;Atoms for Fast&#8208;Charging Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic liquid single&#8208;atoms introduce high disorder into the polymer chain segments, elevating the entropy of polymer the system and enabling entropy&#8208;driven fast ion transport. Simultaneously, the liquid metal atoms exhibit voltage&#8208;responsive stress behavior, which enhances the mechanical strength of polymer. This combination breaks the traditional view that polymer disorder and mechanical strength are mutually exclusive.








Abstract
The rate of interfacial transport and bulk transport of Na+ are determining steps that restrict fast&#8208;charging in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). Owing to the high interfacial compatibility, SPEs can reduce the interfacial impedance associated with ionic conduction. Despite the ability of high interfacial compatibility in the SPEs to promote the interfacial ion transfer, there remains no known material capable of concurrently boosting bulk&#8208;phase ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Specifically, the study reports an entropy&#8208;driven strategy based on dynamic liquid single atoms that rapidly rearranges polymer chains into entropy&#8208;increased regions, accelerating polymer complexation and dissociation to facilitate ion transport for fast&#8208;charging. Meanwhile, dynamic stress regulation by liquid atoms enhances the mechanical strength of the electrolyte. An independently designed stress&#8208;monitoring electrolytic cell is employed to perform in situ monitoring of the stress&#8208;voltage relationship. The novel SPE exhibits the capacity of 85.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, and the capacity retention of 91.76% after 1000 cycles at 10 C. Cell has the capability of 5&#8208;minute fast&#8208;charging with 19.8&#160;&#181;m thickness for the full&#8208;capacity at 10 C. Ah&#8208;level engineering application cells have the retention of 93.69% after 600 cycles at 1 C. Electrolytes incorporating liquid single&#8208;atoms offer new strategies for fast charging.

Nanopore&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule sequencing (SMS) is a powerful tool for acquiring detailed heterogeneous information on critical building blocks of life, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and a wide array of biomolecules, at the single&#8208;molecule level. Real&#8208;time current&#8208;intensity fluctuations corresponding to the passage of target molecules through nanopores enable long&#8208;read length, high&#8208;throughput, and high&#8208;accuracy detection, thus meeting the stringent demands of precision diagnosis. Herein, a concise overview of various principles and fabrication methods is provided for nanopores, with particular emphasis on recent advancements in nanopore&#8208;based DNA and protein sequencing, revealing innovative approaches for effectively capturing and translocating target molecules, and rapid and accurate identification. Further typical cases of nanopore&#8208;based SMS applications in precision diagnosis are analyzed, focusing on genetic disorders, infectious diseases, cancers, and abnormal post&#8208;translational modifications to highlight the clinical potential of nanopores. Additionally, the inherent limitations and challenges of nanopores in terms of sensitivity, detection range, and selectivity are discussed and present the latest strategies for enhancing nanopore performance. Finally, perspectives are provided on the future of nanopore&#8208;based SMS, particularly at the intersection of microfluidic devices, surface functionalization, and machine learning, to facilitate more diverse and advanced developments in this field.

         <title>Integrated Hydrogel Optical Fiber Electronics with Mechanically Robust Interfaces Enable Simultaneous Electrophysiological Recording and Optogenetic Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated hydrogel optical fiber electronics: A multi&#8208;functional hydrogel fiber&#8208;based bioelectronics iHOFE, consisting of a hydrogel core for perfect total internal reflection and a conducting hydrogel cladding with a mechanically robust interface, enables the simultaneous electrophysiological recording and optical modulation in behaving animals at the same region.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based electrodes and optical guides are promising tools for neural bioelectronics, offering tissue&#8208;like compliance, hydration capacity, and customizable functionalities. However, integrating multiple hydrogel modalities into a single device remains challenging due to material compatibility, cross&#8208;modal interference, and interfacial integration issues. In this work, an integrated hydrogel optical fiber electronics (iHOFE) platform is reported, including a step&#8208;index optical core, a conductive hydrogel layer, and a tissue&#8208;matched insulating sheath. By engineering the robust interface between each layer through chemical bonding and topological entanglement, a multilayer architecture capable of concurrent electrical and optical operation under dynamic mechanical deformation is created, thus high&#8208;fidelity electrophysiological recording and optogenetic modulation within the same region. The efficacy of the iHOFE is validated via two&#8208;month hippocampal implantation, demonstrating recording and manipulation of neural activity. This platform marks a significant advancement in developing multifunctional neural bioelectronics for interrogating and manipulating deep neural circuits compared to existing&#160;technologies.

         <title>3D Flat Band in Ultra&#8208;Thin Kagome Metal Mn3Sn Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy have been used to demonstrate that ultra&#8208;thin films of the kagome metal Mn3Sn exhibit a robust dispersionless 3D flat band with a bandwidth of 50 meV.Importantly, manganese defect engineering was used to demonstrate chemical tuning of the flat band to near the Fermi level. The realization of a robust three&#8208;dimensional kagome band in an ultra&#8208;thin kagome metal is an important step towards observing kagome&#8208;lattice derived strongly correlated topological and quantum phases when the flat band is tuned to the Fermi level, with implications for quantum computing, spintronics, and low&#8208;energy electronics.








Abstract
Flat bands with narrow energy dispersion can give rise to strongly correlated electronic and topological phases, especially when located at the Fermi level. Whilst flat bands are experimentally realized in 2D twisted van der Waals heterostructures, they are highly sensitive to twist angle, necessitating complex fabrication techniques. Geometrically frustrated kagome lattices have emerged as an attractive alternative platform as they can natively host flat bands that are observed experimentally in quasi&#8208;2D bulk&#8208;crystal kagome metals. An outstanding experimental question is whether flat bands can be realized in ultra&#8208;thin metals, with opportunities for stronger electron&#8211;electron interactions through tuning of the surrounding dielectric environment. Here, angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunnelling microscopy, and band structure calculations are used to show that ultra&#8208;thin films of the kagome metal Mn3Sn host a robust dispersionless flat band with a bandwidth of 50 meV. Furthermore, chemical tuning of the flat band to near the Fermi level via manganese defect engineering is demonstrated. The realization of tunable kagome&#8208;derived flat bands in an ultra&#8208;thin kagome metal represents a promising platform to study strongly correlated and topological phenomena, with applications in quantum computing, spintronics and low&#8208;energy electronics.

&lt;p&gt;Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy have been used to demonstrate that ultra-thin films of the kagome metal Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn exhibit a robust dispersionless 3D flat band with a bandwidth of 50 meV.Importantly, manganese defect engineering was used to demonstrate chemical tuning of the flat band to near the Fermi level. The realization of a robust three-dimensional kagome band in an ultra-thin kagome metal is an important step towards observing kagome-lattice derived strongly correlated topological and quantum phases when the flat band is tuned to the Fermi level, with implications for quantum computing, spintronics, and low-energy electronics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flat bands with narrow energy dispersion can give rise to strongly correlated electronic and topological phases, especially when located at the Fermi level. Whilst flat bands are experimentally realized in 2D twisted van der Waals heterostructures, they are highly sensitive to twist angle, necessitating complex fabrication techniques. Geometrically frustrated kagome lattices have emerged as an attractive alternative platform as they can natively host flat bands that are observed experimentally in quasi-2D bulk-crystal kagome metals. An outstanding experimental question is whether flat bands can be realized in ultra-thin metals, with opportunities for stronger electron&#8211;electron interactions through tuning of the surrounding dielectric environment. Here, angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunnelling microscopy, and band structure calculations are used to show that ultra-thin films of the kagome metal Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn host a robust dispersionless flat band with a bandwidth of 50 meV. Furthermore, chemical tuning of the flat band to near the Fermi level via manganese defect engineering is demonstrated. The realization of tunable kagome-derived flat bands in an ultra-thin kagome metal represents a promising platform to study strongly correlated and topological phenomena, with applications in quantum computing, spintronics and low-energy electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Kinetics and Dual&#8208;Interfacial Stability in High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Loading Electrodes for Lithium Metal Batteries via Crosstalk&#8208;Active Polymer&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes</title>

         <dc:description>
The integration of sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into the electrode framework facilitates beneficial interfacial crosstalk between the cathode and anode, thereby synergistic effect effectively suppresses interfacial impedance and dendritic Li growth, offering a viable pathway toward scalable, long&#8208;life, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
With the rapid shift toward sustainable energy systems, battery technologies offering high energy densities and long cycle life are critical. Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are central to achieving high energy storage required by global sustainability efforts, yet their practical deployment faces critical limitations, including dendritic lithium deposition and challenges associated with thick cathode structures. To simultaneously overcome these issues, this research develops a polymer&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotube framework grafted with poly(2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methylpropane sulfonic acid), effectively enhancing dispersion, ionic transport, and electrode integrity. A unique cathode&#8211;anode crosstalk, arising from the sulfonic acid functional groups, stabilizes lithium interfaces and significantly mitigates dendrite formation, as revealed by computational studies. Advanced characterizations confirm improved Li&#8314; kinetics, reduced interfacial resistances, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Implementing in pouch cells, this strategy achieves a remarkable energy density of 453.2 Wh kg&#8722;1. This holistic approach provides a practical and scalable strategy to overcome key commercial barriers, paving the way for next&#8208;generation LMBs.

         <title>A Labor&#8208;Division Cooperation Electronic Palm System for High&#8208;Precision Crosstalk&#8208;Free Cognition of Pressure and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper proposes a novel biomimetic electronic palm system (BEPS), which solves the issues of crosstalk and low integration in existing sensing methods. Demonstrations show that the mechanical hand can detect water temperature, water level, and determine the softness and shape of objects. By integrating the neural hand contraction reflex, the BEPS achieves closed&#8208;loop control and feedback for hot and cold objects.








Abstract
Current methods for pressure and temperature sensing face issues such as crosstalk, low integration, and difficulty in achieving large&#8208;scale arrays. These problems significantly impact the practical application value of multifunctional biomimetic sensors in intelligent biomimetic robots. Herein, this paper presents a novel multifunctional biomimetic electronic palm system (BEPS) consisting of 16 bimodal decoupling biomimetic electronic skins (e&#8208;skin). By subtly introducing vertical stacking design and in situ photopolymerization and 3D printing technologies&#8208;based fabrication, large&#8208;scale arrays integration with high sensing performances is constructed. Furthermore, a universal decoupling calculation model is developed, achieving crosstalk&#8208;free sensing of temperature and pressure. To demonstrate the practical application value of the proposed biomimetic palm, three implemented demonstration applications in this paper show that the mechanical hand has the ability to detect water temperature and water level, as well as to confirm the softness and shape of grasped objects. The BEPS system combines neural hand contraction reflexes to achieve closed&#8208;loop control and feedback when dealing with hot and cold objects. This progress has enormous potential in enhancing the functionality and adaptability of robotic systems.

         <title>Rapid Fabrication of Self&#8208;Propelled and Steerable Magnetic Microcatheters for Precision Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid Joule heating fabrication method for the production of self&#8208;propelling, adaptive microcatheters, with tunable stiffness and integrated microfluidic channels is presented. Demonstrated through three microrobotic designs, including a steerable guiding catheter, an untethered wave&#8208;crawling TubeBot, and a distal&#8208;end propelled microcatheter, it was possible to achieve robust navigation in confined, delicate environments, validated in diverse synthetic and biological models, offering new possibilities for targeted intracorporeal interventions.








Abstract
Minimally invasive therapies demand precise navigation through complex and delicate anatomical pathways, requiring medical tools that are small, flexible, and highly maneuverable. Here, a high&#8208;yield fabrication method for the production of magnetic tubular microrobots, tethered and untethered, with programmable magnetization, is presented. The method uses Joule heating through a template wire, enabling the fabrication of microrobots with tunable dimensions. Three device configurations are demonstrated: 1) a steerable guiding microcatheter with stiffness modulation; 2) an untethered tubular microrobot (TubeBot), exhibiting wave&#8208;crawling locomotion; and 3) a hybrid microcatheter robot that integrates distal&#8208;end wave&#8208;crawling propulsion with linear insertion to minimize tissue trauma. Validation in tortuous channels, soft phantoms replicating tissue compliance, 3D&#8208;printed organ models, ex vivo tissues, and live mice demonstrates the microrobots's ability to achieve precise navigation across different environments. The successful targeted delivery of sperm cells, embryos, and drug&#8208;mimicking compounds further highlights its potential for precision medicine, including applications in assisted reproduction and targeted drug delivery.

         <title>High&#8208;Speed Electro&#8208;Optic Modulator Based on Chemical&#8208;Vapor&#8208;Deposited Graphene with van der Waals Hybrid Dielectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile integration of a Sb2O3/Al2O3 hybrid dielectric on the chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposited (CVD) graphene for the graphene electro&#8208;optic modulators is demonstrated. Benefitting from the preservation of graphene's electronic properties by van der Waals (vdW) Sb2O3/graphene interface, the graphene electro&#8208;absorption modulator shows a 160% higher modulation efficiency (0.0054 dB V&#8722;1 &#181;m&#8722;1) and 580% higher bandwidth (&#8776;35 GHz). 








Abstract
Graphene&#8208;based optoelectronic devices have shown high bandwidth and easy incorporation in silicon photonics. However, given that graphene is a single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick material with a large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, the intriguing properties of the graphene optoelectronic devices are very susceptible to surrounding environments, including interfacial states and dangling bonds from dielectrics. This has degenerated the performance of graphene electro&#8208;optic modulators that rely on uniform electrical gating. Herein, a facile integration of a Sb2O3/Al2O3 hybrid dielectric on the chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposited (CVD) graphene is reported for electro&#8208;absorption modulators. The Sb2O3 molecular crystal as interfacial layer enables a homogeneous Al2O3 dielectric growth and a van der Waals (vdW) interface with graphene, which can significantly reduce the interfacial scattering centers (such as dangling bonds) and thus preserves the electronic properties of graphene, showing an averaged carrier mobility (&#956;) of 10880 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and residual carrier concentration (n*) of 1.35 &#215; 1011 cm&#8722;2. In contrast to the device with a single dielectric, the electro&#8208;absorption modulator with the vdW interface shows a 1.6 times higher modulation efficiency (0.0054 dB V&#8722;1 &#181;m&#8722;1) and 5.8 times higher bandwidth (&#8776;35 GHz). Moreover, modulation rate is up to 30 Gbit s&#8722;1. Our work provides a promising dielectric option for graphene optoelectronic devices.

Photonic Spin&#8208;Locking
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202511084), Andrea Al&#249; and co&#8208;workers demonstrate spin&#8211;orbit coupling and spin&#8208;locking in momentum&#8208;biased higher&#8208;order topological states. By leveraging tilted incident illumination to break symmetry, they achieve spatial phase control of hybridized s orbitals, with handedness determined by the beam's orientation relative to the mirror&#8208;symmetry axes of the Kagome lattice.

Laser&#8208;Synthesized TiC Colloidal Variants
In their Research Article (10.1002/adma.202509060), Farman Ullah, Kevin P. Musselman, and co&#8208;workers synthesize colloids of TiC in a clean, waste&#8208;free process. A laser beam interacts with TiC in acetonitrile, generating a strong electric field that breaks the Ti&#8211;C covalent bonds formed by the hybridization of C_p and Ti_d orbitals. The surface and elemental composition of the TiC colloids are tuned through laser&#8208;induced carbon nucleation and nitridation, maximizing light&#8208;colloid interactions.

Skeletal High&#8208;Strength Nanoporous Copper and Metamaterials
Inspired by the centuries&#8208;long mechanical resilience of Hakka Tulou walls, Jianfeng Gu, Ma Qian and co&#8208;workers engineered a strong, multifunctional and scalable hierarchical Cu lattice metamaterial via a two&#8208;phase precursor alloy design and controlled dealloying. It surpasses the Gibson&#8208;Ashby strength predictions by 800% and offers an outstanding specific surface area (&#8776;27.6 m2 g&#8722;1), unlocking multifunctional conformal and stand&#8208;alone components for heat exchangers, reactors, antimicrobial surfaces and beyond. More details can be found in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202503701).

Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Fluoro&#8208;Containing Graft Copolymers
This cover illustrates a closed&#8208;loop recyclable fluoropolymer constructed by PVDF&#8208;CTFE backbones and PTMC side chains. The graft copolymer serves as a high&#8208;performance battery electrolyte with enhanced ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness. Selective deconstruction of PTMC side chains yields a recycled backbone for capacitor/coating applications, exhibiting high dielectric constant and extreme&#8208;environment resistance. The reconstruction process demonstrates dual&#8208;life utilization of fluoropolymer&#8212;transforming persistent PFAS waste into versatile materials while mitigating environmental impact. More details can be found in the Research Article by Lengwan Li, Yu Chen, Peng&#8208;Fei Cao, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202505158).

Highly Sensitive Liquid Biopsies for Cancer Diagnosis
MUTE&#8208;seq is an innovative technique that employs an advanced&#8208;fidelity CRISPR&#8208;based system to enable highly sensitive liquid biopsies for cancer diagnosis. The image illustrates how MUTE&#8208;seq solves the classic &#8220;needle in a haystack&#8221; problem. A dense cylindrical haystack of wild&#8208;type cfDNA that conceals a single mutant ctDNA&#8212;the &#8220;needle&#8221;&#8212;precisely illuminated by a CRISPR&#8208;guided light beam. More details can be found in the Research Article by Yonggoo Kim, Song Cheol Kim, Sungho Lee, Junho K. Hur, Junseok W. Hur, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202505208).

Making Incompatible Materials Compatible
A scalable process forms an ultra&#8208;thin &#8220;free surface&#8221; at the Ge/Si interface, allowing lattice&#8208;mismatched materials to integrate seamlessly. This approach minimizes strain and dislocations, enabling defect&#8208;free films and opening new routes for advanced micro&#8208; and optoelectronic technologies. More details can be found in the Research Article by Youcef A. Bioud and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202505101).

Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202508729), Yujie Zhang, Chantal Paquet, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the volume and quality of 3D prints made using tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing (TVAM) can be improved by introducing chemical additives that suppress oxygen inhibition without compromising light penetration. The 16&#8208;fold increase in print volume opens the door for new possibilities for large&#8208;volume and high&#8208;resolution TVAM 3D printing.

Precision Tumor Therapy
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202418134), Ru&#8208;Shi Liu, Joonho Bang, Sehoon Kim, Luke P. Lee, Dong Ha Kim, and co&#8208;workers develop a novel and controllable cancer therapy approach that uses light to trigger healing. This method involves a photoinduced plasmon electron transfer (PiPET) process to carefully break down allyl carbamate&#8208;conjugated MB, aided by Pd&#8208;conjugated Au nanobipyramids. This system not only targets and inhibits tumors precisely through combined thermal and PiPET effects but also shows promising potential for targeted and effective treatments.

         <title>Polarized Luminescence in Halide Perovskite Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines polarized luminescence in halide perovskite nanomaterials, dissecting structural engineering strategies for the generation of LPL and chiral CPL. It analyzes chirality transfer via ligand functionalization, liquid crystal templating, and nanocrystal alignment, while evaluating performance through dissymmetry factors and quantum yield metrics. The integration of machine learning (ML) for predictive design, synthesis optimization, and structure&#8208;property elucidation is highlighted.









Abstract
Halide perovskite nanomaterials have emerged as a transformative platform for generating and manipulating polarized luminescence, offering unprecedented opportunities for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic technologies. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in engineering both linearly polarized luminescence (LPL) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from perovskite nanostructures, focusing on structural design principles, chirality transfer mechanisms, and performance optimization strategies. Methods are systematically analyzed to achieve polarized emission, including anisotropic nanocrystal growth, chiral ligand functionalization, and liquid crystal&#8208;mediated alignment, while highlighting critical optical factors such as dissymmetry factors and photoluminescence quantum yield. Key challenges in enhancing the precision control over perovskite nanostructures, room&#8208;temperature CPL efficiency, and scalable assembly are discussed, with a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate progress in the development of perovskite nanomaterials with customized polarized luminescence. By bridging fundamental insights with technological applications, this review outlines a roadmap for developing perovskite&#8208;based polarized light sources that combine high performance, stability, and manufacturability, which are key enablers for the future of quantum photonics, ultra&#8208;secure communication, and intelligent optical systems.

By bridging fundamental insights with technological applications, this review outlines a roadmap for developing perovskite-based polarized light sources that combine high performance, stability, and manufacturability, which are key enablers for the future of quantum photonics, ultra-secure communication, and intelligent optical systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrating Hierarchical Vasculature into Engineered Cardiac Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vascularization remains one of the greatest challenges in cardiac tissue engineering. Current approaches to developing myocardial and vascular structures can be broadly classified into biologically driven and engineering&#8208;driven, each offering distinct advantages and having inherent limitations. This review attempts to combine key insights from both domains to guide the integration of perfusable hierarchical vasculature into engineered cardiac tissues.








Abstract
The integration of hierarchical, perfusable vasculature remains one of the most critical and unresolved challenges in engineering human cardiac tissues. Although substantial progress has been made in independently advancing myocardial and vascular tissue constructs, integrating both into a single functional platform remains a major barrier to translation. This review categorizes and evaluates two overarching strategies for engineering vascularized cardiac tissues: biologically driven approaches that leverage cell&#8208;driven self&#8208;organization, and engineering&#8208;driven methods that impose tissue structure through biofabrication. Each strategy is examined in terms of its contributions to structural fidelity, functional maturation, and scalability, and a benchmarking framework is introduced to assess their physiological and translational relevance. Key insights are then synthesized to outline a path forward, with particular emphasis on the need for hybrid strategies that unite the complementary advantages of both approaches.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites are promising photoabsorbers in solar water&#8208;splitting devices owing to their outstanding optoelectronic properties. This review summarizes advances in encapsulation techniques and material engineering strategies to enhance efficiency and device stability. It also highlights the classification of device configurations, recent innovations supporting cost&#8208;effective green hydrogen production, and key scientific challenges with future research directions for perovskite&#8208;based water&#8208;splitting systems.








Abstract
Recently, halide perovskite materials have attracted significant research interest in photoelectrochemical cells as promising photoabsorbers due to their superior optoelectronic properties. However, their instability under environmental conditions remains a major obstacle to the development of stable water&#8208;splitting devices. This review thoroughly examines the growing array of encapsulation strategies that have accelerated the integration of perovskite materials into water&#8208;splitting systems. In addition, various approaches to extending device lifetime while maintaining high performance are discussed in detail. Recent advances that render perovskite&#8208;based water&#8208;splitting systems a viable source of low&#8208;cost green hydrogen are also highlighted. Finally, current scientific challenges, emerging concepts, and future research directions aimed at enhancing both the performance and operational stability of perovskite&#8208;based electrochemical cells are introduced.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Oxidation for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Aqueous Batteries: Mechanisms, Materials, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the feasibility of in situ techniques for activating inert cathode materials into high&#8208;performance phases/structures, and electrochemical oxidization methodology for diversifying element valences to boost specific capacity by multielectron conversion reactions. This technique can be generalized to a broader field of various aqueous batteries, especially multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries, promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous energy storage devices.








Abstract
To advance the commercial utilization of aqueous electrochemical devices for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, it is crucial to address the current limitations related to energy density and cycle stability. Indeed, the lack of high&#8208;performance cathodes is still an obstructive issue, not to mention the limited capacities related to the monotonic cation intercalation/deintercalation mechanism. Fortunately, conversion chemistries with redox reactions bring a new dimension, where materials with multiple valence states facilitate multi&#8208;electron redox reactions, offering the potential for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage. Recently, the in situ electrochemical oxidation technique has been developed to diversify element valences and transform the structure and chemical environment of cathode materials, which is conducive to efficient conversion reaction and extended lifespan for aqueous batteries. This review systematically investigates the newly developing in situ electrochemical oxidation technique, shedding light on the mechanism investigations with different reaction pathways and facing the rapid developments for aqueous batteries. A comprehensive knowledge of the corresponding superiorities of multiplied specific capacity, broadened voltage window, and accelerated reaction kinetics associated with higher energy and power densities has been explored extensively. In the end, future research directions are outlined to advance the development of stationary energy storage systems with high energy density, fast charging capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability.

By methodically analyzing technical bottlenecks and advancement pathways, this work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing micro&#8208;electric field regulation in environmental remediation applications. The insights presented are expected to accelerate the development of sustainable water treatment solutions, offering innovative approaches for pollution control aligned with global carbon emission reduction targets. 








Abstract
Fenton&#8208;like systems utilizing micro&#8208;electric field&#8208;engineered catalysts have emerged as a promising technology for water remediation, demonstrating distinctive advantages via their efficient electron transport networks. This innovative approach not only significantly reduces oxidant consumption but also enables thorough mineralization of contaminants. However, current research faces critical challenges in fundamental mechanistic understanding, particularly regarding reactor scale&#8208;up strategies and biological synergy mechanisms, where a cohesive theoretical framework remains to be established. This comprehensive review systematically addresses four pivotal aspects: i) Mechanistic elucidation of charge transfer dynamics and pollutant transformation pathways in micro&#8208;electric field&#8208;enhanced Fenton systems; ii) Development of structure&#8208;activity relationship models for system optimization; iii) Implementation of modular scale&#8208;up methodologies with pilot&#8208;scale validation for engineering feasibility assessment; iv) Quantitative environmental impact evaluation using full lifecycle assessment under carbon neutrality objectives. By methodically analyzing technical bottlenecks and advancement pathways, this work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing micro&#8208;electric field regulation in environmental remediation applications. The insights presented are expected to accelerate the development of sustainable water treatment solutions, offering innovative approaches for pollution control aligned with global carbon emission reduction targets.

         <title>Unveiling the Electrolyte and Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Sodium Ion Batteries: Mechanisms, Progress, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advances in sodium&#8208;ion battery electrolytes (including organic, aqueous, gel, ionic liquid, and solid&#8208;state types) and their influence on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). It discusses SEI formation, aging, and optimization, as well as cases where no SEI forms, providing insights into the critical relationship between electrolyte chemistry and interfacial stability.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are regarded as a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the low cost and abundant availability of sodium. Electrolyte, as the medium for ion transport, plays a crucial role in determining the electrochemical performance. Currently, SIBs employ mainly organic electrolytes, aqueous electrolytes, ionic liquids, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes. These electrolytes have made significant progress according to the needs of various application scenarios. Notably, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed by decomposition of electrolytes on the electrode surface has a decisive influence on the performance of SIBs, and its composition and formation mechanism are closely related to the chemical nature of the electrolyte. Therefore, a deep understanding of the structure and interfacial chemistry of the SEI is essential for developing high&#8208;performance SIBs, preferably through the simple and effective modulation of electrolyte composition. However, the fragmented and insufficient mechanistic summary on this connection results in poor guidance on future research, especially for the co&#8208;design of electrolyte and solid electrolyte interphase. This review summarizes and compares the research progress of various electrolyte systems, discusses the formation and aging mechanisms of SEI, and presents the perspectives on the integrated design of electrolyte and SEI.

This review summarizes and compares the research progress of various electrolyte systems, discusses the formation and aging mechanisms of SEI, and presents the perspectives on the integrated design of electrolyte and SEI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic and Extrinsic Determinants of Stability in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers in Perovskite Solar Cells: Mechanistic Insights and Strategic Perspectives</title>

         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive and multidimensional examination of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that dictate the physicochemical stability of spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based hole&#8208;transporting layers. It further underscores recent breakthroughs in dopant molecular design, additive modulation, and strategies enabling post&#8208;oxidation&#8208;independence doping, all of which seek to overcome the fundamental trade&#8208;offs associated with conventional doping systems.








Abstract
Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD has remained the benchmark hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells, owing to its favorable energy level alignment and excellent interfacial compatibility. However, its practical implementation is critically hindered by the intrinsic instabilities introduced by conventional dopants such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine (tBP). While these dopants enhance electrical conductivity, they concurrently initiate multiple degradation pathways&#8212;including ionic migration, radical deactivation, and moisture/thermal&#8208;induced morphological failure&#8212;thereby compromising device longevity and reproducibility. This review presents a comprehensive and mechanistic perspective on dopant&#8208;induced instabilities in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based hole&#8208;transporting layers, systematically unraveling the physicochemical origins of performance loss under operational stress. Recent advances in dopant design, additive engineering, and post&#8208;oxidation&#8208;independence doping strategies that aim to circumvent the trade&#8208;offs inherent to traditional systems are further highlighted. Emphasis is placed on the interdependence among dopant formulation, charge transport kinetics, and environmental resilience. By integrating insights from advanced characterization and molecular&#8208;level design, rational guidelines toward the development of next&#8208;generation dopant systems and HTM architectures that reconcile high efficiency with long&#8208;term operational stability are proposed. This review offers a forward&#8208;looking framework to steer the evolution of robust and commercially viable perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Phase Control via Composite Encapsulation for Ultra&#8208;Stable, High&#8208;Resolution Organic Manganese Halide Scintillator Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new way to protect a special manganese&#8208;based glass material used for X&#8208;ray imaging is developed. The glass normally degrades in air, but with the encapsulation method, it stays stable for months. This makes it possible to create clear, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray images for longer periods, which is important for practical medical and industrial use.








Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic metal halide glasses (OIMHGs) are promising materials for high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging due to their transparency and tunable properties. However, their practical applications are severely limited by a transition from the glassy state to a polycrystalline phase under ambient conditions, leading to significant optical and performance degradation. Herein, the underlying mechanism of the rapid glass&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transition in methyltriphenylphosphonium&#8208;based hybrid materials (MTP)2MnBr4 is systematically investigated through X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements, X&#8208;ray scattering analysis, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. For the first time, it is demonstrated that this transition is driven by the water molecules, which significantly influence the spatial arrangement of the organic (MTP+) and inorganic ([MnBr4]2&#8722;) components within the materials framework. To address the severe instability of this X&#8208;ray imaging glass in air, a novel composite encapsulation strategy is developed that integrates quartz glass layers with a waterproof parylene polymer coating. Consequently, the glass&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transition is substantially suppressed, enhancing the stability of the synthesized glass by over 100 times. This improvement enabled the material to maintain a spatial resolution of 26.3&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1 for more than twelve months. These findings underscore the critical role of environmental stability strategies in enhancing OIMHG&#8208;based scintillators for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray imaging applications.

         <title>Organic Afterglow Emitters for Visual Observation of Hydrogel Formation in Biomedical Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomedical hydrogels play vital roles in various applications but lack visual confirmation of gelation and localization. This study introduces organic afterglow emitters exhibiting bright and persistent afterglow upon hydrogel formation. This gelation&#8208;induced afterglow, driven by reduced oxygen diffusion and concentration within hydrogels, enables precise visualization of gelation, offering a novel strategy for high&#8208;performance organic afterglow in soft matter systems.








Abstract
Biomedical hydrogels are integral to a wide range of applications, with their efficacy critically hinging on precise delivery and successful gelation at targeted sites. Nevertheless, existing technologies that provide reliable, visual confirmation of gelation and accurate localization remain very limited. Here organic afterglow emitters are reported that are designed with small phosphorescence rate (kP &#8776; 0.04 s&#8722;1), small nonradiative decay rate (knr &#8776; 0.01 s&#8722;1), and controllable oxygen quenching rate (kq). The organic emitters exhibit no afterglow in liquid state under ambient conditions. Upon hydrogel formation, the organic emitters, embedded within the as&#8208;formed biomedical hydrogel, demonstrate bright and persistent afterglow with phosphorescence lifetimes extending up to 15.82 s. This gelation&#8208;induced afterglow, characterized by a high on/off contrast, facilitates a visual observation of successful hydrogel formation and precise localization of biomedical hydrogels. In&#8208;depth studies reveal that, within the biomedical hydrogel, the diffusion of oxygen is significantly impeded and oxygen concentration is also reduced, leading to a substantially small kq of the organic emitter (&#8776;0.02 s&#8722;1) and subsequent emergence of the afterglow. This study presents a novel afterglow&#8208;based approach for visualizing hydrogel formation and localization, and meanwhile offering an innovative strategy to achieve high&#8208;performance organic afterglow in soft matter systems.

         <title>A Synergistic 3D&#8208;Printed Collar Transforms Radiofrequency Ablation Into Potent Thermal Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;functional 3D&#8208;printed adjuvant collar (3D&#8208;LC12) is designed for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined therapy against lung cancer. The temperature&#8208;sensitive 3D&#8208;LC12 can respond to the radiofrequency electrical field during treatment, enhancing heating temperature, ablation area, and nano&#8208;adjuvant's diffusion. Then, the released nano&#8208;adjuvant could form an in situ therapeutic cancer vaccine, activate APCs, and remodel the tumor microenvironment (TME), triggering a robust antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Interventional thermal therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), is a preferred therapy for non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, part of some patients will still suffer from tumor recurrence due to incomplete ablation (e.g., restricted thermal conductivity, etc.). Notably, RFA can evoke anti&#8208;tumor immunity by releasing tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs), but this effect is weak. Herein, to boost thermal and immune therapeutic efficiency for complete tumor eradication, an effective nano&#8208;adjuvant (CpG&#8208;pIL12&#8208;LDHs, LC12), layered double hydroxides (LDHs) carrying immune stimulators, CpG ODN (CpG) and IL&#8208;12 plasmid (pIL&#8208;12), is developed, which is further integrated into a 3D&#8208;printed collar for eliciting potent thermotherapy and therapeutic vaccine against lung cancer. The as&#8208;prepared 3D&#8208;printed adjuvant collar (3D&#8208;LC12) can be attached to the RFA electronic needle and respond to the radiofrequency electrical field during treatment, enhancing ablation temperature, area, and nano&#8208;adjuvant's diffusion. After release from the temperature&#8208;sensitive collar, LC12 can form an in situ therapeutic cancer vaccine, activate APCs, and remodel the tumor microenvironment (TME), triggering a robust antitumor immune response. Therefore, the current study demonstrates a multi&#8208;functional 3D&#8208;printed adjuvant collar for efficient eradication of lung cancer via one&#8208;time RFA&#8208;integrated therapy, providing a novel combined strategy for interventional thermal therapy against tumors.

Therefore, the current study demonstrates a multi-functional 3D-printed adjuvant collar for efficient eradication of lung cancer via one-time RFA-integrated therapy, providing a novel combined strategy for interventional thermal therapy against tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous In&#8208;Plane Anomalous Hall Response Observed in a Ferromagnetic Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Observation of in&#8208;plane anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is demonstrated in a typical ferromagnet SrRuO3. The (111)&#8208;orientated ultrathin films with in&#8208;plane easy axes exhibit spontaneous AHE at zero field, which is controllable via its intrinsic coupling to the in&#8208;plane spin magnetization through higher order effects allowed by symmetry, revealing the versatile and controllable in&#8208;plane Hall responses with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orbital ferromagnetism.








Abstract
Recent observation of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) induced by magnetic field or spin magnetization lying in the Hall deflection plane has sparked interest in diverse mechanisms for inducing the Hall vector component perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. Such off&#8208;diagonal coupling, which is strictly constrained by symmetry of the system, provides new degrees of freedom for engineering Hall responses. However, spontaneous response as extensively studied for out&#8208;of&#8208;plane AHE remains unexplored. Here, in&#8208;plane AHE in a typical ferromagnetic oxide SrRuO3 is elucidated. The (111)&#8208;orientated ultrathin films with in&#8208;plane easy axes of spin magnetization exhibit spontaneous AHE at zero field, which is intrinsically coupled to the in&#8208;plane spin magnetization and controllable via its direction. Systematic measurements by varying azimuthal and polar field angles further reveal complex Hall responses shaped by higher&#8208;order terms allowed by trigonal distortion of the films. These findings highlight versatile and controllable in&#8208;plane Hall responses with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orbital&#160;ferromagnetism.

P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) ferroelectric polymer with Au electrode becomes an effective photo&#8208;pyroelectric harvester, achieving a record energy density of 4.75 J cm&#8722;3 that is discharged in several milliseconds. Simultaneously, the material exhibits a large light induced capacitance change of 281%, realizing light&#8208;tunable energy storage. The discoveries enable the combination of pyroelectric harvesting and energy storage in one material.








Abstract
The rapid growth of micro&#8208;devices demands power supplies with remote self&#8208;powering, high energy density, and high power capability, thereby driving continuous advancements in energy harvesting technology. Here, a novel photo&#8208;pyroelectric energy harvester based on poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) ferroelectric polymer is presented, addressing the limitations of conventional pyroelectric energy harvesting technologies, particularly their low energy and power densities. The unique photothermal effect of nanostructured Au electrode on the polymer generates rapid temperature oscillations of the polymer under visible light, enabling efficient pyroelectric energy harvesting. The harvester achieves a highest energy density of 4.75 J cm&#8722;3 and a highest power density of 1711.9&#160;W cm&#8722;3, surpassing existing pyroelectric energy harvesters. Furthermore, functioning as dielectric capacitors, the Au metallized polymer films exhibit a photo&#8208;capacitance effect as high as 281%, allowing for greatly enhanced energy storage and power conditioning capabilities via light irradiation. In addition, the successful combination of pyroelectric energy harvesting and electrostatic energy storage, which are often considered to be incompatible in term of energy generating mechanism and energy release speed, in one material offers a promising strategy for developing compact energy supply and power conditioning devices for various applications.

         <title>Artificial Transmembrane Oligopeptide&#8208;Integrated Interferon mRNA with Monoclonal Antibody to Improve Specificity and Efficacy of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the specificity and efficacy of combination immunotherapy while minimizing its adverse toxic effects, this study proposes a novel, simple, and versatile platform by an artificial transmembrane oligopeptide to integrate mRNA with monoclonal antibody into one nanoparticle (aCmRi). aCmRi possesses distinctive capabilities for targeting tumor cells, facilitating transmembrane transport of mRNA, and realizing in situ expression of IFN&#946; and PD&#8208;L1 blocking.








Abstract
Combination therapy to improve the immunotherapy response rate without causing treatment toxicity remains a significant challenge. Here, an artificial transmembrane oligopeptide, cholesterol&#8208;grafted polylysine (CPL), is synthesized to integrate mRNA with a monoclonal antibody into a single system. CPL with a 6% substitution degree is optimized and complexed with IFN&#946; mRNA to form CmRi nanoparticles. Subsequently, anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody (aPD&#8208;L1) is modified on the surface of CmRi to produce aCmRi nanoparticles. Notably, CPL facilitates cytosolic delivery via a membrane&#8208;interacting mechanism, thereby bypassing lysosomal degradation of mRNA. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that CPL promoted tumor cell apoptosis and upregulated MHC I expression by disrupting lysosomes in tumor cells. Additionally, CPL combined tumor cell&#8208;targeting and PD&#8208;L1 inhibitory functions of aPD&#8208;L1 with the multidimensional immunoadjuvant properties of in situ&#8208;expressed IFN&#946;. This approach overcame the side effects of IFN&#946; while fully leveraging its therapeutic potential.&#160;In a B16&#8208;F10 melanoma mouse model, aCmRi demonstrated a superior mRNA transfection rate (26.1%) and achieved the highest tumor suppression rate (89.9%) among all test formulations, without causing significant toxicity. This study presents a simple and versatile strategy to enhance the efficacy, selectivity, and safety of tumor immunotherapy in vivo.

         <title>Wireless Acousto&#8208;Piezoelectric Conduit with Aligned Nanofibers for Neural Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound&#8208;driven, highly aligned piezoelectric nanofiber&#8208;based nerve guidance conduit (APNF&#8208;NGC) designed for effective peripheral nerve repair has been demonstrated in this study. Featuring aligned topology, cell&#8208;adhesive surfaces, and an axial electric field, the APNF&#8208;NGC collectively promotes significant nerve regeneration. In vivo experiments validate its effectiveness, revealing nerve repair outcomes comparable to those achieved with autografts.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) represents a significant clinical challenge, leading to severe motor and sensory dysfunction, as well as irreversible tissue atrophy. Autograft has been commonly utilized as the clinical gold standard; however, it is limited by donor availability and secondary surgery requirements. Here, an ultrasound&#8208;responsive, highly aligned piezoelectric nanofiber nerve guidance conduit (APNF&#8208;NGC) is introduced for peripheral nerve regeneration. Fabricated from electrospun poly&#8208;l&#8208;lactic acid (PLLA) nanofibers, the APNF&#8208;NGC features an anisotropically oriented architecture with shear piezoelectricity, providing both structural support and wireless electrical stimulation. The incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) tailors mechanical properties, increases piezoelectric&#8208;phase crystallinity, and improves the surface hydrophilicity, thereby enhancing both biocompatibility and acousto&#8208;piezoelectric response. Finite element analysis and electrical assessment confirm that ultrasound activation of the APNF&#8208;NGC generates an axially oriented electric field, facilitating directional axon elongation. In vivo studies using an 8&#8208;mm sciatic nerve defect rat model demonstrated that the APNF&#8208;NGC achieved nerve reinnervation comparable to that of autografts, as comprehensively validated by behavioral, motor function, and histological evaluations. This dual&#8208;function platform, combining physical guidance with electrical stimulation, presents a promising strategy for neural tissue engineering, offers a potential breakthrough in treating long&#8208;gap PNIs.

         <title>Skeletal High&#8208;Strength Nanoporous Copper and Metamaterials: The Hakka Tulou Design Heritage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the Hakka Tulou walls, skeletal nanoporous copper is fabricated via a two&#8208;phase MnCu precursor and controlled dealloying. This strategy achieves high strength (200 MPa) and large specific surface area (27.6 m2/g), and extends to lattice metamaterials with hierarchical porosity, offering new design pathways for multifunctional metal architectures.








Abstract
Nanoporous metals (NPMs) are pivotal for next&#8208;generation technologies, yet their inherent mechanical fragility has long hindered practical implementation. Drawing inspiration from the ingenious architecture of the ancient Hakka Tulou walls, a novel class of nanoporous copper (NPCu) materials&#8212;skeletal NPCu&#8212;is developed to overcome this limitation. To achieve&#160;this, we leverage the principles of solidification and dealloying in alloy design to engineer a unique two&#8208;phase precursor alloy microstructure. This microstructure comprises a strong, ductile, non&#8208;dealloyable skeletal phase (minor phase) and a readily dealloyable principal phase. Upon dealloying, the precursor transforms into skeletal NPCu, achieving exceptional yield strength (200.4 &#177; 15.2 MPa)&#8212;significantly surpassing that of conventional NPMs. Extending this design concept, we fabricate skeletal NPCu lattice metamaterials that surpass the Gibson&#8208;Ashby strength model predictions by 800%, while offering an outstanding specific surface area (27.6 &#177; 1.2 m2&#160;g&#8722;1) that enhances multifunctionality. By marrying ancient architectural wisdom with modern materials science, this innovation unlocks the vast potential of advanced NPMs for applications spanning energy, aerospace, and beyond.

         <dc:description>
This article presents a surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) platform using mass&#8208;manufactured gradient plasmonic metasurfaces, overcoming limitations in analyzing real&#8208;world biosamples. The technology achieves 20&#8208;fold signal enhancement and demonstrates superior molecular fingerprinting capabilities. By combining high&#8208;throughput fabrication with simplified optical readout and capability to analyze human biofluids, this work establishes a foundation for translating SEIRAS technology into practical biomedical applications.








Abstract
Mid&#8208;infrared (Mid&#8208;IR) spectroscopy offers powerful label&#8208;free molecular analysis capabilities but faces significant challenges when analyzing complex biological samples. Here, a transformative surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) platform is presented that overcomes fundamental limitations through key innovations. First, high&#8208;throughput wafer&#8208;scale fabrication of mid&#8208;IR plasmonic micro&#8208;hole&#8208;array (MHA) metasurfaces is demonstrated on free&#8208;standing silicon nitride (Si3N4) membranes, yielding &#8776;400 sensor chips per 6&#8208;inch wafer. Second, the gradient MHA metasurface design supports spectrally cascaded plasmonic modes, generating over 400 sharp resonance peaks across the 1200&#8211;2000 cm&#8722;1 fingerprint region. This approach enables comprehensive molecular fingerprinting using simple imaging optics in transmission mode. Third, the SEIRAS platform is validated using a model polymer system and clinical peritoneal fluid samples from ovarian cancer patients, demonstrating its capability to resolve complex molecular signatures in real biological specimens. The platform's dense spectral coverage ensures optimal on&#8208;resonance enhancement across the broad fingerprint region, revealing previously obscured vibrational bands that conventional IR spectroscopy cannot distinguish. By combining high&#8208;throughput fabrication with simplified optical readout and the capability to analyze complex biological samples, this work establishes a foundation for translating SEIRAS technology into practical biomedical applications, promising a real&#8208;world impact.

         <title>An Intracellular Magnetic Micromotor Drives Spatiotemporal Mechano&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MagMotor is designed to integrate with rotating magnetic fields, which can intracellularly exert tunable torques in a frequency&#8208;dependent pattern within lysosomes for orchestration of antigen release from tumor cells and cross&#8208;presentation in APCs. The sequential IIMT paradigm confers a spatiotemporal interaction between tumor cells and immune cells for mechano&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Spatiotemporal coordination of coherent steps in the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle is desirable yet inherently challenging in nature, thereby impeding the effectiveness of immunotherapy in treating solid tumors. Here, this work designs an intelligent intracellular magnetic torque (IIMT) paradigm to spatiotemporally orchestrate tumor cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) by integrating with rotating magnetic fields to drive immunotherapy. A rod&#8208;shaped magnetic micromotor is engineered to manipulate tunable torques inside lysosomes and regulate selective biological functions in these cells. High&#8208;intensity torques primarily cause tumor immunogenic cell death and antigen release, whereas, low intensity&#8208;torques trigger antigen leakage from lysosomes for APC cross&#8208;presentation and simultaneously activate NOD&#8208;like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Importantly, sequential IIMT boosts antitumor immunity and synergistically enhances anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein 1 antibody (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) therapeutic effect. In sum, this work develops a magnetic torque&#8208;based strategy to drive the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle for mechano&#8208;immunotherapy, which opens an intriguing field to explore mechanobiology and immunity through intracellular mechanics.

         <title>High Performance Ultrawide Temperature Range Planar Hall Devices by 2D Hidden&#8208;Rashba Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zhibin Qi et al. report a new type of planar Hall devices based on 2D hidden&#8208;Rashba material 1T&#8208;PtSe2. Unexpected for a centrosymmetric nonmagnetic system, the PtSe2 devices exhibit superior performance exceeding the commercial Hall sensors, fully unfolding the unprecedented potentials of 2D hidden&#8208;Rashba systems for future spintronics. 








Abstract
Lattice symmetry determines the manifestations of the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect in crystals, e.g. spin polarizations in hidden&#8208;spin Rashba systems are concealed by the sublattice inversion symmetry, making spintronic applications impractical with negligible spin lifetimes. Here, high performance planar Hall effect (PHE) devices based on van der Waals 1T&#8208;PtSe2 thin films with hidden&#8208;Rashba spins are reported. By temperature&#8208; and layer&#8208;dependent magneto&#8208;transport, the quantum signature of the hidden&#8208;Rashba PHE is unveiled, which exhibits suppressed backscattering for parallelled electric and magnetic fields, and thus, produces an opposite sign to the conventional Rashba&#8208;rooted PHE signals. The inherent strong hidden&#8208;spin SOC allows high performance magnetic device operations from 0.3 K to room temperature (RT), exhibiting an ultralow working heat load of 1 nW below 80 K and retaining a superior RT signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio exceeding 18&#8201;000. It is demonstrated that, by eliminating defects and via optimizing device structure, the sensitivity of hidden&#8208;Rashba PHE devices can be efficiently improved to exceed the commercial Hall sensors, making 2D hidden&#8208;spin Rashba systems a promising material platform for spintronics.

         <title>Overcoming Material Incompatibility via 2D Free&#8208;Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable post&#8208;epitaxial strategy introduces a sub&#8208;nanometric 2D free surface (2DFS) at the heterointerface, effectively decoupling lattice&#8208;mismatched layers. This process significantly reduces strain&#8208;driven defects and dislocation density in Ge/Si heterostructures. The resulting bulk&#8208;like material quality, validated by advanced microscopy and optical analyses, opens new pathways for high&#8208;performance heteroepitaxy across micro&#8208; and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Heteroepitaxy has been pivotal in advancing both optoelectronics and microelectronics, driving the development of faster, more efficient devices across diverse applications. However, achieving high material quality remains challenging due to lattice mismatches. Strain induced by variations in lattice parameters and thermal properties provides additional degrees of freedom for material tailoring but often leads to dislocation generation, wafer bowing, and cracking. These issues are addressed through a scalable post&#8208;epitaxial approach that strategically targets the misfit dislocation network, leading to the creation of a sub&#8208;nanometric 2D free surface (2DFS). This interface effectively decouples the epilayer from the substrate, significantly reducing strain&#8208;related defects. Scalable heterostructures exhibited pronounced defect annihilation, as demonstrated by electron microscopy, defect etching, and photoluminescence analysis&#8212;an effect attributed to the surrounding free surfaces.

&lt;p&gt;A scalable post-epitaxial strategy introduces a sub-nanometric 2D free surface (2DFS) at the heterointerface, effectively decoupling lattice-mismatched layers. This process significantly reduces strain-driven defects and dislocation density in Ge/Si heterostructures. The resulting bulk-like material quality, validated by advanced microscopy and optical analyses, opens new pathways for high-performance heteroepitaxy across micro- and optoelectronic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heteroepitaxy has been pivotal in advancing both optoelectronics and microelectronics, driving the development of faster, more efficient devices across diverse applications. However, achieving high material quality remains challenging due to lattice mismatches. Strain induced by variations in lattice parameters and thermal properties provides additional degrees of freedom for material tailoring but often leads to dislocation generation, wafer bowing, and cracking. These issues are addressed through a scalable post-epitaxial approach that strategically targets the misfit dislocation network, leading to the creation of a sub-nanometric 2D free surface (2DFS). This interface effectively decouples the epilayer from the substrate, significantly reducing strain-related defects. Scalable heterostructures exhibited pronounced defect annihilation, as demonstrated by electron microscopy, defect etching, and photoluminescence analysis&#8212;an effect attributed to the surrounding free surfaces. This method strikes an optimal balance between bulk-quality characteristics and high surface integrity, offering a new paradigm for achieving heteroepitaxial bulk-class materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemoselective Characterization of New Extracellular Matrix Deposition in Bioengineered Tumor Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the bi&#8208;directional crosstalk between cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) is critical for tissue engineering. This study presents a chemoselective strategy for proteomic profiling of newly deposited ECM from resident cells. Applying this analytical pipeline to bioengineered tumor tissues reveals elevated ECM remodeling activities in tumor cells in response to biomaterial support and the associated culture conditions.








Abstract
In both native and engineered tissues, the extracellular matrix (ECM) supports and regulates nearly all aspects of cellular pathophysiology, and in response, cells extensively remodel their surrounding extracellular environments through new ECM protein deposition. Understanding this intricate bi&#8208;directional cell&#8208;ECM interaction is key to tissue engineering, but it remains challenging to investigate. This is partly due to the limited sensitivity of conventional proteomics to capture low&#8208;abundance newly synthesized ECM (newsECM). This study presents a glycosylation&#8208;enabled, chemoselective strategy to label, enrich, and characterize newsECM proteins with augmented specificity and sensitivity. Applying newsECM profiling to bioengineered tumor tissues, either built upon decellularized ECM materials (dECM&#8208;tumor) or as ECM&#8208;free tumoroids, revealed distinct ECM synthesis patterns. Tumor cells cultured within dECM scaffold present elevated ECM remodeling activities, mediated by augmented digestion of pre&#8208;existing ECM coupled with upregulated synthesis of tumor&#8208;associated ECM components. These findings highlight the sensitivity of newsECM profiling to capture remodeling events that are otherwise under&#8208;represented by bulk proteomics and underscore the significance of dECM support for enabling native&#8208;like tumor cell behaviors. The newsECM profiling described here is anticipated to be applicable to a wide range of engineered tissue models and pathophysiological processes to deliver fundamental insights regarding the mutual cell&#8208;ECM crosstalk.

         <title>The Formation of Supramolecular Rigid Glass Based on Transparent Deep Eutectic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the formation of traditional inorganic glass, a new design strategy involving molecular recognition, deep eutectic, and photopolymerization is designed to construct mechanically strong and optically transparent supramolecular materials.








Abstract
The development of transparent materials with mechanical rigidity and hardness via the non&#8208;covalent bonding of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight building blocks is a major challenge. Although various strategies have been developed to improve the mechanical performance of supramolecular materials, they are frequently accompanied by complex designs and tedious syntheses. Therefore, it is urgent to develop perspectives that are fundamentally distinguished from previous strategies. In this study, a new design solution that involves with non&#8208;covalent molecular recognition, deep eutectic solvent formation, and solvent&#8208;free photopolymerization is conceived and validated. Metal coordination and hydrogen bonding between zinc tetrafluoroborate hydrate (ZTH) and acrylamide (AM) facilitated the formation of ZTH&#8208;AM, which can be recognized as the analogue of the glass liquid in the preparation of inorganic glass. ZTH&#8208;AM significantly suppressed the nucleation and crystallization of ZTH and AM. Subsequently, it is used to fabricate transparent poly[ZTH&#8208;AM] glass in bulk using photopolymerization. The obtained supramolecular glass is rigid, exhibiting high tensile strength (93.50 MPa), Young's modulus (1.12 GPa), and hardness (92.1 HD).

         <title>Laser&#8208;Patternable and Stretchable Metal Electrodes Using Metal&#8211;Amine Coordination Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable electrode, called the metal&#8211;amine coordination&#8208;complex&#8208;based electrode (MACE), is introduced, which involves the formation of coordination complexes between a metal and an organic layer. MACE exhibits excellent stretchability of up to 70% and stability under both air and wet conditions. Through direct laser processing, MACE forms desirable patterns under dry conditions and allows for the adjustment of stretchability.








Abstract
Coordination bonding is a crucial interaction between heteromaterials that enhances both mechanical toughness and stretchability, with mussels serving as a natural example of thriving in harsh marine environments due to this interaction. However, stretchable electronic materials based on this fundamental interaction have been rarely reported. In this study, a stretchable electrode, called the metal&#8211;amine coordination&#8208;complex&#8208;based electrode (MACE) is introduced, which involves the formation of coordination complexes between a solid metal and an organic layer. MACEs are based on a single Au layer with a thickness of a few tens of nanometers, yet they exhibit excellent stretchability of up to 70% and high durability under strain at 40% for 10 000 cycles without conventional treatments, such as pre&#8208;stretching the substrate. Additionally, the direct laser patterning process on the metal film allows for high versatility in forming desirable patterns and adjusting stretchability. Furthermore, by utilizing the mechanical and electrical properties of MACE, a reversible soft actuator with a simple laminated structure is demonstrated. This approach, based on the formation of coordination complexes between heteromaterials, provides insights into fully mechanically stretchable electronics that achieve both softness and toughness simultaneously.

         <dc:description>
An evaporation&#8208;driven fabric with triple&#8208;functional architecture synergistically enables water purification, hydrovoltaic energy harvesting, and lithium recovery through hierarchically structured ionic transport channels, resulting in a hydrovoltaic effects with a current density of 7.7&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2, an evaporation rate of 1.42&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, and lithimu adsorption of 40.87 mg m&#8722;2 in brine.








Abstract
Water evaporation constitutes a ubiquitous physical phenomenon. This natural process enables efficient energy and resource harvesting through water interacting with materials with tailored structural, chemical, and thermal properties. Here, this work designs an evaporation&#8208;driven fabric (e&#8208;fabric) that enables the utilization of water&#8208;electricity&#8208;lithium from brine through three optimized functional layers. Interfacial charge asymmetry between the carbon black (CB) photothermal layer and Al2O3 thermal insulation layer drives directional ion transport, generating sustained hydrovoltaic output with &#8776;7.7 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 current density. Under 1 kW m&#8722;2 sun irradiation, e&#8208;fabric demonstrates 1.42 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 evaporation rate in brine while the Al2O3 layer reduces thermal dissipation. The middle protonated lithium titanate (HTO) adsorption layer selectively captures Li+ which achieves an adsorption capacity of 40.87 mg m&#8722;2 during a 2&#8208;h adsorption cycle while maintaining 93.2% recovery efficiency over 8 cycles. The decoupled operation of the adsorption process from the evaporation power generation system effectively prevents ion accumulation from affecting performance. This work can provide an approach for evaporation&#8208;driven water&#8208;electricity&#8208;lithium co&#8208;production systems.

         <title>Osmotic Energy Directly Driving Flexible All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State 2D Nanofluidic Pressure Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state iontronic pressure sensor is developed, which is directly driven by osmotic energy through a mechanically regulated 2D nanofluidic effect. By optimizing interlayer spacing, device geometry, and stacking design, the sensor achieves high voltage output, fast response, and robust stability. Integrated with deep learning, it enables accurate human&#8211;machine interaction using a single self&#8208;powered sensor.








Abstract
Current utilization of osmotic energy often involves multiple complex processes, including collection, storage, and conversion, which limits its applicability in portable electronic devices. Inspired by the biosensing system of human skin, a novel iontronic pressure sensor is developed, directly driven by osmotic energy. By leveraging the tunable nanofluidic effects of 2D materials, ion selective migration driven by osmotic energy is controlled through mechanical modulating of interlayer spacing, thereby converting external pressure into encodable electrical signals. In addition, the geometric configuration is optimized to further enhance the performance of the pressure sensor, achieving an ultrahigh output voltage (up to 13.10&#160;V), fast response/recovery time (115.0/128.0&#160;ms), and a wide pressure detection range (up to 360&#160;kPa). By integrating the deep learning algorithm with the sensor's excellent performance, high&#8208;resolution human&#8208;machine intelligent interaction is successfully demonstrated with 95.78% recognition accuracy. This work establishes a new paradigm for direct application of osmotic energy in real&#8208;world scenarios.

         <title>Fully Erasable Amphibious Adhesives Derived from Soybean Oil with Record&#8208;High Underwater Adhesion Strength</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphibious and fully erasable adhesives with record&#8208;high underwater adhesion are fabricated by reversibly cross&#8208;linking epoxidized soybean oil with boroxine and hydrogen&#8208;bonded hydrophobic nanodomains. These adhesives exhibit outstanding adhesion to a wide range of substrates in both dry and underwater environments, without requiring any post&#8208;curing. They are biocompatible, reusable, and can be completely removed from the adherend surface simply by rinsing with ethanol.








Abstract
Developing amphibious adhesives that combine high adhesion strength with on&#8208;demand erasability in both dry and wet environments remains a significant challenge. In this study, biomass&#8208;derived, amphibious, and erasable adhesives are fabricated by grafting 3&#8208;aminobenzoic acid and 3&#8208;aminobenzeneboronic acid onto epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), yielding ESO&#8208;Am adhesives. These adhesives are dynamically cross&#8208;linked with boroxines, hydrogen bonds, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded hydrophobic nanodomains. ESO&#8208;Am adhesives exhibit strong and durable adhesion to a wide range of substrates under dry conditions, with adhesion strengths comparable to those of commercial counterparts. Remarkably, they also demonstrate exceptional underwater adhesion without the need for post&#8208;curing, achieving an adhesion strength of 5.2&#160;MPa on iron, surpassing previously reported underwater adhesives. This outstanding performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of dynamic boroxine linkages and hydrogen&#8208;bonded hydrophobic nanodomains, which enhance both cohesive strength and interfacial interactions. Importantly, the dynamic cross&#8208;links allow for complete and on&#8208;demand removal of the adhesive by simple ethanol rinsing. In addition, ESO&#8208;Am adhesives are biocompatible, degradable in soil, and reusable, retaining 96% of their original adhesion strength after ten cycles of reuse. The combination of strong amphibious adhesion, full erasability, biodegradability, and reusability makes ESO&#8208;Am adhesives highly promising for a wide range of sustainable and advanced applications.

         <title>Mixed Ionic and Electronic Charge Transport in Conductive Protein Fibers Revealed with DC Electrical Measurements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
M13 bacteriophage films deposited on micro interdigitated electrodes behave as a Randles simplified equivalent circuit under direct current. We derive contact and film resistance as well as capacitance of films of M13 phages, aromatic curli fibers or pilA&#8208;containing nanowires. By separating time&#8208;domain transient and steady state current profiles and controlling humidity, we gain information on ionic and electronic charge transport.








Abstract
Naturally conductive protein nanowires have inspired efforts to engineer electrical conductivity into synthetic fibrous proteins for the development of bioelectronic materials and devices. A comprehensive analysis of charge transport in these systems requires a combination of various measurement methods, instruments and electrode designs. Measurements under direct current (DC) typically focus on charge transport without distinguishing between charged species, requiring alternating current (AC) and electrochemical methods to probe additional phenomena. Here, ionic and electronic charge transport mechanisms are separately studied within nanowires on interdigitated micro&#8208;electrodes under DC. This study also deconvolutes the effects of humidity, salts and polyethylene glycol (PEG) on protein conductivity. As a model system, the M13 bacteriophage, a filamentous protein assembly that is an ideal scaffold for engineering charge transport is used. The M13 phage is also compared with two previously studied conductive protein fibers, Geobacter&#8208;derived protein nanowires (e&#8208;PN) and engineered aromatic curli fibers. This study observes both transient ionic charge transport and steady&#8208;state electronic conductivity in the M13 phage and curli fibers, whereas e&#8208;PN materials predominantly exhibited electronic charge transport. The results show that transient and steady&#8208;state examinations of sensitive DC measurements in protein fibers help better understand mixed transport in these materials with particularly low conductivity.

         <title>Genetic Surfaceome E. coli Reprogramming Enables Selective Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel enzymatic material based on bilirubin oxidase (BOD) surface&#8208;expressed on E. coli for effective electrocatalysis is reported. With this material, highly efficient and selective water oxidation is achieved, a critical half reaction for synthetic photosynthesis.








Abstract
Programming catalytic behavior at the microbial genome level is a frontier in synthetic biology with direct impact on bioelectrocatalysis. A key challenge is the coordinated control of gene expression, localization, folding, and cofactor maturation required to achieve proper bioelectrocatalytic activity. Here, a synthetic operon in Escherichia coli is engineered to reprogram its surfaceome for selective water oxidation. Using orthogonal IPTG&#8208;inducible control and codon&#8208;optimized expression, a fungal bilirubin oxidase (BOD) displayed at the cell surface is produced by ice nucleation protein anchoring (BOD&#8208;E. coli). Post&#8208;overexpression copper catalytic site reconstitution provides an active holoenzyme. The developed engineered living material performs water oxidation at near&#8208;zero overpotential (27&#160;mV at pH 9.1), with complete suppression of the oxygen reduction reaction. These results show how regenerable microbial platforms can be designed for selective catalysis and artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Piezoelectric Nanoparticles Targeting and Activating NK Cells for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional &#945;NK1.1/&#945;CD56&#8208;Polydopamine@Barium titanate (&#945;NK1.1/&#945;CD56&#8208;P@BT) piezoelectric nanoparticles are designed and synthesized to target NK cells via mussel&#8208;inspired chemistry and targeted antibody modification strategies. The &#945;NK1.1/&#945;CD56&#8208;P@BT enhances the cytotoxicity and cytokine&#8208;producing ability of NK cells with external ultrasonic stimulation. Upon transfer therapy, NK cells loaded with &#945;NK1.1/&#945;CD56&#8208;P@BT exhibit superior antitumor efficacy in mice with different solid tumor models under ultrasonic treatment.








Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cells can swiftly and efficiently kill tumor cells with low toxicity and show great potential as anticancer agents. However, the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) reduces the number and functionality of NK cells, leading to tumor progression and the limited therapeutic effect of adoptively transferred NK cells, especially in solid tumors. Here, via mussel&#8208;inspired chemistry and targeted antibody modification strategies, functional piezoelectric nanoparticles are designed to target NK cells, named as &#945;CD56&#8208;P@BT (for human) or &#945;NK1.1&#8208;P@BT (for mouse). With external ultrasonic stimulation, &#945;CD56&#8208;P@BT or &#945;NK1.1&#8208;P@BT can enhance the cytotoxicity and cytokine&#8208;producing ability of NK cells. Mechanistically, the synergistic mechanical and electrical signals generated by ultrasound&#8208;irritated P@BT activate the TRP ion channel&#8208;mediated calcium ion influx and cytoskeleton rearrangement, in turn improving NK cell migration, infiltration, and function. Upon transfer therapy, NK cells loaded with &#945;NK1.1&#8208;P@BT exhibit superior antitumor efficacy in mice with subcutaneous melanoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma under ultrasonic treatment. Moreover, transfer of &#945;CD56&#8208;P@BT loaded NK&#8208;92 cells retard the growth of human hepatoma xenograft in immunodeficient mice.

&lt;p&gt;Functional &#945;NK1.1/&#945;CD56-Polydopamine@Barium titanate (&#945;NK1.1/&#945;CD56-P@BT) piezoelectric nanoparticles are designed and synthesized to target NK cells via mussel-inspired chemistry and targeted antibody modification strategies. The &#945;NK1.1/&#945;CD56-P@BT enhances the cytotoxicity and cytokine-producing ability of NK cells with external ultrasonic stimulation. Upon transfer therapy, NK cells loaded with &#945;NK1.1/&#945;CD56-P@BT exhibit superior antitumor efficacy in mice with different solid tumor models under ultrasonic treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural killer (NK) cells can swiftly and efficiently kill tumor cells with low toxicity and show great potential as anticancer agents. However, the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) reduces the number and functionality of NK cells, leading to tumor progression and the limited therapeutic effect of adoptively transferred NK cells, especially in solid tumors. Here, via mussel-inspired chemistry and targeted antibody modification strategies, functional piezoelectric nanoparticles are designed to target NK cells, named as &#945;CD56-P@BT (for human) or &#945;NK1.1-P@BT (for mouse). With external ultrasonic stimulation, &#945;CD56-P@BT or &#945;NK1.1-P@BT can enhance the cytotoxicity and cytokine-producing ability of NK cells. Mechanistically, the synergistic mechanical and electrical signals generated by ultrasound-irritated P@BT activate the TRP ion channel-mediated calcium ion influx and cytoskeleton rearrangement, in turn improving NK cell migration, infiltration, and function. Upon transfer therapy, NK cells loaded with &#945;NK1.1-P@BT exhibit superior antitumor efficacy in mice with subcutaneous melanoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma under ultrasonic treatment. Moreover, transfer of &#945;CD56-P@BT loaded NK-92 cells retard the growth of human hepatoma xenograft in immunodeficient mice. This work establishes a wireless electrostimulation strategy integrating ultrasound-responsive nanomaterials to potentiate the cytotoxic activity of NK cells, thereby advancing the clinical translation of NK cell adoptive immunotherapy for solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Robustness and Multistability of Small Mesoscale Continuous GFRP Metamaterials: Novel M&#246;bius Strip Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel M&#246;bius metamaterial is proposed. By integrating advanced 3D printing technology with traditional composite manufacturing processes, the researchers have successfully fabricated small&#8208;mesoscale, complex FRP composite structures. The remarkable achievement of this material&#8208;process&#8208;structure integration lies in the unprecedented balance it achieves among lightweight, high&#8208;strength, high&#8208;resilience, reconfigurable, multi&#8208;stable, and excellent acoustic performance characteristics of the resulting structures.








Abstract
Fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer composite mechanical metamaterials have emerged as promising candidates for multifunctional structural applications owing to their exceptional strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios. However, achieving concurrent high stiffness, high strength, and large recoverable strain in such structures remains challenging due to inherent trade&#8208;offs between these properties. To address this limitation, a novel M&#246;bius&#8208;inspired metamaterial through optimized fiber orientation design is developed. Notably, compared to conventional fully composite metastructures, the design achieves a 67% reduction in unit cell size while maintaining comparable stiffness and enhanced recoverable strain capacity. The proposed structure exhibits three distinctive characteristics: effective low&#8208;frequency sound insulation, reconfigurable adaptability, and secondary deformability after the hot molding process. These synergistic effects enable enhanced collaboration, enable multifunctional capabilities, including noise reduction, programmable Poisson's ratio (&#8722;0.4 to +0.6), and mechanical switching behavior. These performance improvements originate from synergistic fiber&#8208;matrix interactions and unique bending&#8208;twisting deformations inherent to the M&#246;bius geometry, which are previously undocumented in fully composite metamaterials. This deformation mode facilitates significant elastic energy storage while minimally influencing peak stress levels associated with material failure. These findings elucidate a fundamental mechanism for developing high&#8208;performance composite metamaterials with tailorable energy storage capacity, addressing critical challenges in adaptive structural engineering.

         <title>Advancing Tomographic Volumetric Printing Via Oxygen Inhibition Control: Improved Accuracy and Large&#8208;Volume Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen inhibition limits the printable volume and resolution in tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing using (meth)acrylate photoresins. This study presents a simple yet strategic formulation design using additives that regenerate active radicals from peroxyl radicals. Incorporating N&#8208;methyldiethanolamine enables high&#8208;resolution, large&#8208;volume printing of complex structures up to 60 mm, achieving a 16&#8208;fold increase in print volume without compromising print fidelity or speed.








Abstract
Tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing (TVAM) is an emerging 3D printing technology capable of producing complex structures in seconds. However, achieving reliable prints using TVAM requires sufficient light penetration throughout the print volume, which often limits the photoinitiator (PI) concentration that can be used. In (meth)acrylate&#8208;based photoresins, this constraint severely restricts achievable print size and quality due to oxygen inhibition. To address this challenge, a chemical strategy is demonstrated to control the oxygen inhibition period without compromising light penetration, using an amine, a thiol, and a phosphine additive as representative examples. Among these, N&#8208;methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) emerged as the most promising candidate, effectively reacting with non&#8208;reactive peroxy radicals to regenerate propagating radicals and sustain polymerization. Incorporating MDEA into a low&#8208;PI photoresin enabled high&#8208;resolution and large&#8208;volume printing in a custom&#8208;built TVAM system, achieving a root&#8208;mean&#8208;square surface deviation of 0.175&#160;mm (&#8776;2 pixels) and printable structure sizes up to 60&#160;mm. These advances represent a 16&#8208;fold increase in print volume relative to the previous TVAM demonstrations and enable high&#8208;throughput fabrication of multiple complex parts without sacrificing print quality. This work establishes a scalable approach to overcoming oxygen inhibition in (meth)acrylate TVAM systems, unlocking new possibilities for large&#8208;volume, high&#8208;resolution additive manufacturing.

         <title>Photothermal Boost of Laser&#8208;Synthesized TiC Colloidal Variants with Engineered Solid&#8208;State Interfaces and Nitridation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiC Colloidal variants are synthesized via a green and waste&#8208;free laser fragmentation technique. The surface and elemental composition of the TiC colloids are tuned through laser&#8208;induced carbon nucleation and nitridation while maintaining their crystal integrity. These changes maximize light&#8211;colloid interactions, thereby improving photo thermalization. The underlying formation mechanisms of the TiC colloidal variants and their distinct photothermal responses are systematically investigated.








Abstract
Colloids are vital in many fields, including optics, energy conversion, and photothermal therapy. TiC colloids and their variants are synthesized in acetonitrile using a &#8220;green&#8221; femtosecond laser fragmentation method under varying laser&#8208;power conditions. Three distinct types of TiC colloids are produced: i) pure TiC spherical nanoparticles at low laser power (&lt;0.5&#160;W) through thermodynamically driven spheroidization; ii) TiC nanoparticles with a multilayer graphene shell at moderate laser power (0.5&#8211;1&#160;W) via carbon nucleation from acetonitrile decomposition; and iii) nitridated TiC nanoparticles with a multilayer graphene shell at high laser power (1.5&#8211;2&#160;W), achieved through nitrogen incorporation facilitated by the breakdown of strong C&#8801;N bonds in acetonitrile. The structural integrity of TiC in all three types of nanoparticles is maintained. The nanoparticle formation mechanisms are investigated, along with the effects of the interfaces and nitridation of TiC on its light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion. Photothermal measurements show a significant improvement in light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion for TiC nanoparticles with shells compared to pure TiC. This enhancement is attributed to light trapping within the colloidal solution, caused by the refractive index mismatch between TiC and graphene. Comparative scattering, absorption, and extinction efficiencies calculations based on Mie theory confirm this effect. Further photothermal enhancement is observed in the nitridated nanoparticles attributed to superior absorption in the NIR region. This study presents a sustainable approach for synthesizing photothermally efficient TiC&#8208;based colloids with nanoscale interface engineering and doping, enabling applications in energy and biomedical technologies.

         <title>Sn4+&#8208;Mediated Trap Engineering in Cr3+&#8208;Activated Titanate Nanophosphors Enables Self&#8208;Sustained Multimodal Imaging and Combinatorial Oncotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research utilisation of the Sn4+&#8208;Mediated trap engineering dramatically enhanced the Cr3+&#8208;Activated Titanate phosphors near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence. Sub&#8208;100 nm nano&#8208;phosphor with superior multimodal imaging capacity are synthesized via coprecipitation&#8208;solid&#8208;state calcination. Subsequent surface modification of anticancer drugs established an efficient theranostic nanoplatform for anticancer therapy, integrating efficient drug delivery and safe real&#8208;time tracking capabilities.








Abstract
Multimodal imaging provides comprehensive and precise tools that significantly increase the efficiency and accuracy in clinical decision&#8208;making. The integration of superior multimodal imaging capabilities with stimuli&#8208;responsive drug release functionalities within a single nanoplatform holds crucial promise for both scientific exploration and clinical translation but remains a formidable challenge in advancing precision medicine. The unique integration of near&#8208;infrared emission (&#955;em = 760 nm), multiwavelength&#8208;rechargeable afterglow, photostimulated luminescence under 980 nm excitation, and Gd3&#8314;&#8208;specific ferromagnetism is highlighted in Na0.5Gd0.5TiO3:Cr3+,Sn4+ phosphor. By doping with Sn4+, a threefold enhancement in the luminescent performance is achieved, demonstrating a 1.37&#8208;fold increase in initial afterglow brightness and extending the persistent luminescence duration to over 15 h. Uniform cubic long&#8208;persistent luminescent nano&#8208;phosphor Na0.5Gd0.5TiO3:Cr3+,Sn4+ with sub 100 nm dimensions are synthesized by coprecipitation. Following SiO2 surface functionalization, it showed sustained luminescence exceeding 2.5 h under UV charging, as validated by in vivo murine imaging. Notably, &#8776;2 h of imaging can still be achieved in mice under blue light charging. A theragnostics nanoplatform is developed by conjugating drugs onto the exterior of SiO2, achieving &#8776;50% bactericidal and antitumour effects, endowing the system with integrated antibacterial&#8208;antitumour efficacy, thereby establishing a multifunctional capability for simultaneous diagnosis and therapy.

Sub-100 nm nano-phosphor with superior multimodal imaging capacity are synthesized via coprecipitation-solid-state calcination. Subsequent surface modification of anticancer drugs established an efficient theranostic nanoplatform for anticancer therapy, integrating efficient drug delivery and safe real-time tracking capabilities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multimodal imaging provides comprehensive and precise tools that significantly increase the efficiency and accuracy in clinical decision-making. The integration of superior multimodal imaging capabilities with stimuli-responsive drug release functionalities within a single nanoplatform holds crucial promise for both scientific exploration and clinical translation but remains a formidable challenge in advancing precision medicine. The unique integration of near-infrared emission (&#955;&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt; = 760 nm), multiwavelength-rechargeable afterglow, photostimulated luminescence under 980 nm excitation, and Gd&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;-specific ferromagnetism is highlighted in Na&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Gd&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;,Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; phosphor. By doping with Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, a threefold enhancement in the luminescent performance is achieved, demonstrating a 1.37-fold increase in initial afterglow brightness and extending the persistent luminescence duration to over 15 h. Uniform cubic long-persistent luminescent nano-phosphor Na&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Gd&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;,Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; with sub 100 nm dimensions are synthesized by coprecipitation. Following SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface functionalization, it showed sustained luminescence exceeding 2.5 h under UV charging, as validated by in vivo murine imaging. Notably, &#8776;2 h of imaging can still be achieved in mice under blue light charging. A theragnostics nanoplatform is developed by conjugating drugs onto the exterior of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving &#8776;50% bactericidal and antitumour effects, endowing the system with integrated antibacterial-antitumour efficacy, thereby establishing a multifunctional capability for simultaneous diagnosis and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemically&#8208;Fueled Time&#8208;Gated Luminescent Metamorphosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimal precursor, NI&#8208;VD, undergoes chemically&#8208;fueled transient hydrogelation, autonomously shuttling between green and bright blue emissions. The transient hydrogel acts as a dynamic scaffold to perform the dual role of transforming the built&#8208;in fluorophore into an effective donor and temporarily entrapping external acceptors within close proximity of the donor to initiate F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) interactions, producing time&#8208;gated multicolor emission shuttles, which are translated to color&#8208;coded time&#8208;locked information encryption.








Abstract
Recent quest for emulating lifelike smart materials for developing functional outcomes has been spurred by the unparalleled spatiotemporal control of natural systems. However, it is still highly challenging to replicate the progressive time&#8208;dependent programmable features of biological systems, such as adaptive broad&#8208;spectrum luminescence accompanying functions. Here in, a chemically&#8208;fueled transient hydrogel is created based on an aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active peptide conjugate (NI&#8208;VD). The fuel&#8208;driven anhydride formation, NI&#8208;VD&#8208;An, which results in transient hydrogelation and an evolution in emission from green to blue. The process's autonomous reversibility on successive anhydride hydrolysis over time enables the emission characteristics of the system to be dynamically modulated. Importantly, selective fluorophore trapping inside the chemically&#8208;fueled transient hydrogel network can achieve the programmable multicolor emission ranging from blue, green, white, yellow, red, and purple. For the first time, fuel&#8208;powered such an ephemeral hydrogel network potentially acts as a time&#8208;dependent donor in F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) processes toward the entrapped acceptors as well as a distance modulator of the donor&#8208;acceptor pairs, causing dynamic regulation of the emission properties. The exploration advances beyond the fundamental investigation of the transient hydrogel platform producing time&#8208;gated multicolor emission to the translation of spatiotemporal pattern development and precisely controlled time&#8208;coded information encryption.

         <title>Turbulent Flow&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Graphene&#8208;Skinned Boron Nitride Heterostructures for Dendrite&#8208;Free Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene&#8208;skinned h&#8208;BN powdery heterostructure is synthesized through a fluidized bed&#8208;chemical vapor deposition strategy. The potassium metal anodes assembled with the support of such a high&#8208;surface&#8208;energy heterostructure demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (1050 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2).









Abstract
Potassium metal batteries are considered as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, their practical development is hindered by the insufficient capacity output and persistent dendritic proliferation at the anode side. Here graphene&#8208;skinned hexagonal boron nitride powder is demonstrated synthesized via fluidized bed&#8208;chemical vapor deposition, realizing conformal growth of layer&#8208;controlled graphene (5&#8211;90 layers) over h&#8208;BN with atomically coupled heterointerfaces. Fluid dynamic simulations of fluidization environments in fluidized&#8208;bed reactors reveal that localized turbulence&#8208;driven precursor transport enables uniform powder fluidization and homogeneous graphene formation. Potassium metal electrodes fabricated with Gr&#8208;skinned h&#8208;BN powder modified Al current collector exhibit favorable cyclic stability (1050 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2) and low nucleation overpotential (&lt;7 mV). The polar hexagonal lattice of h&#8208;BN and high surface energy (43.27 mJ m&#8722;2) of graphene readily promote uniform potassium deposition via Frank&#8208;van der Merwe mode. This dual&#8208;scale approach, which integrates atomic&#8208;scale interface engineering with reactor&#8208;scale manufacture innovation, offers an appealing pathway toward industrial&#8208;level production of high&#8208;performance metal batteries.

         <title>Detecting the Six Polytypes of Five&#8208;Layer Graphite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The six possible periodic crystals&#8212;so&#8208;called polytypes of Penta layer graphene are identified using Raman, second harmonic, and electric surface potential measurements. The measurements reveal the polytypes&#8217; abundance, relative stability, and annihilation dynamics, crucial for future multiferroic SlideTronic applications.








Abstract
Graphene layers can assemble in two shifted metastable positions per interface, leading to eight possible structural arrangements in five&#8208;layer graphene, six of which correspond to distinct periodic crystals. These polytypes exhibit diverse symmetries, interlayer electronic hybridization, van der Waals adhesion, and optical responses. Arrangements lacking inversion [I] and mirror [Mz] symmetries host intrinsic polarizations, while those with sufficiently flat electronic bands display orbital magnetization, unconventional superconductivity, and anomalous fractional quantum Hall states. Here, a detailed comparative study of these polytypes is presented, examining their Raman scattering spectra, second&#8208;harmonic optical emission microscopy, and surface electric potential maps. Each configuration is deterministically identified, its natural abundance is quantified, and its relative stability is assessed. Understanding these stacking&#8208;dependent properties is a critical step toward the development of multiferroic devices that leverage sliding transitions between structural configurations.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging and Long&#8208;Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by an Ultra&#8208;Stable Carbon Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional carbon anodes exhibit constrained rate capabilities. This study designed the g&#8208;C3N4@hollow carbon anode that achieves remarkable cycling stability for over 40&#160;000 cycles with enhanced kinetics. The full battery with this anode enables rapid charging in 0.1 h and discharging in 1 h. These findings may pave the way for durable and high&#8208;efficiency Na+ storage.








Abstract
The realization of rapid&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with exceptional power density represents a pivotal challenge for next&#8208;generation electric vehicles. Currently, carbonaceous anodes are considered the most technologically mature yet rate&#8208;limited candidate approaching commercialization. To address the bottlenecks of slow ion transport and interfacial instability in conventional carbon architectures, a hierarchical anode material has been designed by incorporating g&#8208;C3N4 electronic inert layer onto hollow carbon spheres (CN@HCS). This structure not only facilitates Na&#8314; diffusion but also effectively suppresses side reactions, while enabling selective screening of electrons. As a result, the material exhibits outstanding rate capabilities, maintaining high performance even at a current density as high as 40 A g&#8722;1, and demonstrates remarkable cycling stability over 40&#160;000 cycles with negligible capacity decay. Consequently, the full battery enables rapid charging within 0.1&#160;h and delivers a prolonged discharge duration of up to 1&#160;h, accompanied by a high power density of 21&#160;600&#160;W kg&#8722;1(cathode + anode). This work represents a significant advancement in the development of advance anode materials for SIBs.

         <title>Non&#8208;Contact Dipole Moment Electric Modulation Achieving High Performance Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;contact dipole moment electric modulation strategy is adopted to precisely regulate the magnitude and direction of dipole moments in narrow&#8208;bandgap near&#8208;infrared materials. This strategy enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and promotes J&#8208;aggregation to form a fibrous network, suppresses energetic disorder and electron&#8211;phonon coupling, reduces exciton recombination, and facilitates dissociation, thereby achieving efficient carrier transport.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) detectors, serving as critical technological nodes bridging microscopic molecular recognition and macroscopic intelligent perception, meet the demands of cutting&#8208;edge technologies such as multispectral imaging. Organic semiconductor materials demonstrate unique advantages for NIR organic photodetectors (OPDs) due to their precisely tunable bandgaps, solution processability, flexibility compatibility, and biocompatibility. However, the narrow&#8208;bandgap intrinsic characteristics required for NIR response inevitably lead to carrier concentration surge that exponentially increases dark current, while hot carriers undergo phonon scattering relaxation that suppresses carrier collection. In this work, the inherent limitations of narrow&#8208;bandgap polymer materials are overcome through a contactless direct current external electric field (EEF). The PTB7&#8208;Th:COTIC&#8208;4F device achieves an outstanding detectivity of 2.45&#160;&#215;&#160;1013 Jones at 1100&#160;nm, ranking among the highest values reported in the NIR spectral range. The applied EEF modulates both orientation and magnitude of electric dipole moments in acceptors, inducing ordered face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular stacking, enhancing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and promoting J&#8208;aggregation, thereby facilitating fibrous network formation. Consequently, the optimized film morphology effectively suppresses energetic disorder and electron&#8208;phonon coupling, while simultaneously inhibiting exciton recombination and promoting exciton dissociation to achieve high&#8208;efficiency carrier transport. This non&#8208;contact external field modulation strategy establishes a novel pathway for developing high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;OPDs.

         <title>Stabilizing Cu0/Cu+ Interfaces via High&#8208;Entropy Electrochemical Potential Regulation Strategy for Enhanced CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Conversion in Acidic Medium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy electrochemical potential regulation strategy (HEEPRS) is employed to precisely tailor the electronic structure of Cu&#8208;based catalysts, which effectively promotes the formation and stabilization of active Cu0/Cu+ interfaces under acidic conditions, achieving a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (66.7%) and continuous operational stability (52 h) for ethylene production from CO2 electrolysis, opening new avenues for efficient and durable CO2 conversion.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in acidic media represents an efficient carbon&#8208;negative strategy, mitigating greenhouse effects while selectively producing value&#8208;added multi&#8208;carbon compounds. The Cu0/Cu+ interfaces could promote C&#9472;C coupling processes, but preserving the interface integrity under highly reductive potentials and acidic conditions presents substantial challenges. Here, a high&#8208;entropy electrochemical potential regulation strategy is reported that leverages high&#8208;entropy doping synergy to atomically tailor the surface electronic structure of Cu&#8208;based catalysts. This strategy creates an electron shield effect around the host element (Cu), protecting it from excessive reduction and facilitating the formation and stabilization of Cu0/Cu+ interfaces during acidic CO2RR. Comprehensive operando characterizations combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the electron shield effect strategically modulates the electron&#8208;accepting capability of Cu. The optimized surface electronic structure facilitates C&#9472;C coupling, significantly enhancing the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion efficiency. The designed catalyst achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 66.7% for ethylene production at &#8722;1.69 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode in acidic electrolyte (pH 2), while maintaining excellent stability with an average ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 63.1% over 52&#8208;h continuous operation. This work establishes a new strategy for designing and stabilizing active interfaces of copper&#8208;based electrocatalysts for efficient and durable acidic CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Molecular Nanosolids Generation by Vapor Jet Desublimation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;step, solvent&#8208;free approach to fabricate nanoparticles of small organic molecules is demonstrated, using a nitrogen&#8208;propelled vapor jet, enabling tunable particle morphology and crystallinity. Pharmaceutical, flavoring, dyeing and electronics&#8208;relevant molecules are used, demonstrating process generalizability.








Abstract
Critical phenomena in nature (e.g., albedo, precipitation, pollination, etc.) depend on formation and transport of nanomaterials in the gas phase, as do many industrial processes. Yet controlling and predicting particle formation and growth in the gas phase,&#160;particularly involving small organic molecules, remains challenging. Here, controlled formation of nanoparticles composed of small molecular organic materials is achieved using a nitrogen&#8208;propelled vapor jet. The entire process is modeled in detail using multiphysics simulation, linking materials&#8217; thermophysical properties to processing conditions, and the model is experimentally validated. This combined experimental and modeling approach presented here for controllably generating pure, molecular organic nanoparticles has broad applications in pharmaceutical, flavoring, dyeing, and electronics.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Cation Solvation Polymer Gel for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Anodes in Rechargeable Flexible Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;cation polymer gel electrolyte (PVA/Lcys/Zr) is developed via cation coordination chemistry for rechargeable flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries. The competitive solvaed Zr4+ reduces the water activity within the coordination shell of Zn2+ and promotes uniform zinc deposition along the (002) crystal plane, while Lcys weakens the interactions between PVA chains and creates a &#8220;sliding&#8208;rail&#8221; dynamic solvation structure that facilitates Zn2+ migration.








Abstract
In semi&#8208;open rechargeable flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries (RFZABs), the polymer gel electrolyte, influenced by high&#8208;water&#8208;activity solvation structures during cycling, experiences slow ion conduction and severe dendrite growth, significantly reducing the durability of the zinc anode. This limits its application and development in wearable RFZABs. Thus, modifying the traditional single Zn2+ solvation structure is crucial for enhancing anode stability. Here, a dual&#8208;cation solvation strategy is proposed that fundamentally redefines polymer gel electrolyte chemistry and zinc deposition behavior. By incorporating L&#8208;cystine (Lcys) as a dynamic modulator within a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix, Zn2+ and Zr4+ are coordinated to form a robust dual&#8208;metal solvation network, which imparts multiple functional advantages: i) competitive solvation by Zr4+ lowers water activity in the Zn2+ coordination shell, effectively suppressing dendritic growth; ii) weakened PVA chain interactions create a &#8220;sliding&#8208;rail&#8221; dynamic solvation structure enhancing Zn2+ migration; and iii) solvated Zr4+ and Zr3Zn1[(OH)2(H2O)4]48+ clusters cooperatively promotes uniform Zn deposition along the (002) crystal plane. As a result, Zn//Zn symmetric cells exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan of 1628 h, and RFZABs demonstrate stable operation for over 212 h. This dual&#8208;cation solvation design offers a scalable and effective pathway for advancing durable, high&#8208;performance flexible energy storage systems.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Abundant Molybdenum Dioxide Electrodes with Minimal Interfacial Charge&#8208;Transfer Resistance for Ultrafast Filter Electrochemical Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoporous MoO2&#8722;x electrode featuring oxygen vacancy&#8208;abundant characteristics is engineered via laser&#8208;induced in situ synthesis, which exhibits significantly reduced charge transfer resistance at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, showcasing superior high&#8208;frequency capacitive performance of metal oxide&#8208;based electrochemical capacitors.








Abstract
Electrochemical Capacitors (ECs) are considered capable of replacing bulky and low&#8208;capacitance aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs) in alternative&#8208;current filtering, yet regrettably, they have been plagued by slow ion migration and sluggish electrical response. Non&#8208;carbon&#8208;based electrode materials, while exhibiting significantly higher electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) compared to carbon&#8208;based electrodes, still face the challenge of relatively high interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) that needs to be overcome. Here, a charge&#8208;transfer kinetics enhancement strategy is demonstrated by utilizing the lattice oxygen deficiency in molybdenum dioxide (MoO2&#8722;x) to increase metallic electrical conductivity and the number of active sites. This strategy substantially reduces the Rct, thereby upgrading the high&#8208;frequency performance of ECs, featuring the first high&#8208;performance and scalable metal oxide&#8208;based ultrafast ECs. The ECs with aqueous electrolyte achieve a phase angle (&#966;) of &#8722;80&#176; and a specific capacitance of 966.8 &#181;F cm&#8722;2 (3.9 F cm&#8722;3) at 120 Hz, while the surface&#8208;mountable capacitors incorporating NC@MoO2&#8722;x and EMImBF4 demonstrate a &#966; of &#8722;80.3&#176; and super&#8208;long cycle stability (1&#160;400&#160;000 cycles), surpassing commercial AECs in many key performance indexes. This approach aligns with modern embedded electronic component manufacturing processes, which is about to provide profound impact to the advancement of high&#8208;performance miniaturized components and emerging electronic technologies.

         <title>Molecular Hybrid Bridging for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells without a Pre&#8208;Deposited Hole Transporting Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular hybrid bridging strategy is developed by doping (2&#8208;aminothiazole&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acetic acid (ATAA) and 4&#8208;(2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylacridin&#8208;10(9H)&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (DMAcPA) into the perovskite precursor, enabling in situ formation of a perovskite/hole&#8208;selective&#8208;contact interface during fabrication. The ATAA not only suppresses DMAcPA self&#8208;aggregation but also enhances hole extraction. Leveraging this approach, the PSC without a pre&#8208;deposited HTL achieves a certified PCE of 26.34% and excellent operational stability. 








Abstract
Establishing a low&#8208;resistance perovskite/ITO contact using self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) is crucial for efficient hole transport in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) without a pre&#8208;deposited hole&#8208;transporting layer. However, SAMs at the buried interface often encounter issues like nonuniform distribution and molecular aggregation during the extrusion process, leading to significant energy loss. Herein, a molecular hybrid bridging strategy by incorporating a novel small molecule is proposed, (2&#8208;aminothiazole&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acetic acid (ATAA), featuring a thiazole ring and carboxylic acid group, along with the commonly used SAM, 4&#8208;(2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylacridin&#8208;10(9H)&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (DMAcPA), into the perovskite precursor to synergistically optimize the buried interface. Composition analysis demonstrates that both molecules are effectively extruded to the bottom of the perovskite layer and form a well&#8208;oriented hole&#8208;selective contact interface through strong coordination between the anchoring groups and ITO substrate. The intermolecular interaction, along with the small molecular size of ATAA, enables its uniform dispersion among large DMAcPA, facilitating a compact molecular arrangement, effectively suppressing aggregation, and enhancing hole&#8208;transporting efficiency. As a result, the inverted PSC employing this molecular hybrid strategy exhibits a power conversion efficiency as high as 26.64% (certified at 26.34%) and maintains 98.5% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous operation under 1&#8208;sun illumination at the maximum power point.

         <title>Direct Deep&#8208;UV Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Disordered &#935;2&#8208;Modulated Ferroelectric Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a viable approach is demonstrated for generating coherent DUV radiation at 177 nm and below using a classically ferroelectric and readily growable crystal, LPS. Under 355 nm nanosecond pumping from a Nd:YAG laser, an x&#8208;cut LPS crystal produced SHG output at 177 nm with a pulse energy of 3.1 &#181;J and a conversion efficiency of 0.11%.








Abstract
The generation of coherent deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) radiation via nonlinear frequency conversion remains a major scientific and technological challenge in modern optics. To date, only a very limited number of nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals&#8212;such as KBBF, ABF, and quartz&#8212;have been experimentally demonstrated to support measurable direct second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at wavelengths of 177&#160;nm or shorter. There is a pressing need to develop alternative materials or strategies that enable efficient frequency conversion in the DUV region. In this work, it is reported that LiKSO4 (LPS), a ferroelectric sulfate crystal with z&#8208;aligned needle&#8208;like domains, forms an intrinsically disordered &#967;2 structure that enables DUV random quasi&#8208;phase matching (RQPM) down to 163&#160;nm across a broad spectral range. Remarkably, under nanosecond pulsed pumping at 355&#160;nm, an SHG output at 177&#160;nm with an energy of 3.1 &#181;J and a conversion efficiency of 0.11% is achieved using an x&#8208;cut LPS crystal. This study provides experimental evidence that selecting NLO crystals compatible with RQPM offers a feasible new route for DUV frequency conversion.

         <title>Peptide Coacervates with Metal&#8211;Phenolic Membranes Modulate Glucose Metabolism and Enhance Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide coacervates encapsulated with interferon&#8208;&#945; and membranized with metal&#8211;phenolic networks (PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs) are designed to reprogram glucose competition between tumor and cytotoxic T cells. This metabolic modulation enhances immunotherapy by suppressing tumor glycolysis and boosting T cell effector function. The combined use of PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs and surgery prevents tumor recurrence by activating immune memory, offering a promising strategy for cancer therapy.








Abstract
Glucose consumption by tumors induces metabolic restriction of T cells, which results in immune evasion and tumor progression. Regulating cellular metabolism represents a promising strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapy; however, redirecting glucose utilization from tumor cells to T cells is challenging. Herein, the activation of cytotoxic T cells using engineered peptide coacervates (PCs) containing interferon alpha (IFN&#945;) and membranized with metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) (PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs), which promote glucose uptake and glycolysis, is reported. PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs modulate the molecular conformation of the co&#8208;stimulatory lymphocyte function&#8208;associated antigen 1 on CD8+ T cells, while suppressing tumor cell glycolysis through the sustained release of IFN&#945;, thereby increasing the energy supply for T cells. Furthermore, PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs suppress tumor progression in preclinical orthotopic tumor mouse models by facilitating T cell infiltration and activation. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs further improve therapeutic outcomes (99% inhibition of tumor growth), even in ICB&#8208;insensitive tumor models. Notably, PC&#8208;IFN&#945;@MPNs exert a robust immune&#8208;memory effect (a 4.8&#8208;fold increase in memory T cells) and provide long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;tumor activity (over 74 days), thereby preventing postsurgical tumor recurrence. The present study offers insights into metabolic intervention mechanisms mediated by glucose modulation and provides a rational design for metal&#8211;organic materials in cancer therapy.

The present study offers insights into metabolic intervention mechanisms mediated by glucose modulation and provides a rational design for metal&#8211;organic materials in cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Demonstration of strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and spin&#8208;locking of higher&#8208;order topological photonic states via momentum&#8208;biased orbital hybridization at corners of a Kagome triangular lattice.








Abstract
The advanced manipulation of topological photonic states with expanded degrees of freedom offers innovative ways of achieving robust light modulation and control. Here, by harnessing the orbital degree of freedom, strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and associated photonic spin&#8208;locking of Type&#8208;II higher&#8208;order topological states (HOTSs) are theoretically and experimentally demonstrated via momentum&#8208;biased orbital hybridization at the apex of a Kagome triangle lattice. The momentum bias, induced by the tilted incident light, not only produces symmetry breaking of the Kagome triangle lattice, but also introduces orbital momentum to Type&#8208;II HOTS. By attaining strong spin&#8208;locked SOC through momentum&#8208;biased topological orbital hybridization of Type&#8208;II HOTSs, the way is paved for the spin&#8208;based interplay and control between near&#8208;field and far&#8208;field in higher&#8208;order topological photonic crystals, with potential applications in polarization manipulation, spatial light modulation, quantum emitter control, and beyond.

         <title>Minimizing Photovoltage Loss for Efficient p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells via a Dual&#8208;Site Anchoring Bridge</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy via a dual&#8208;site anchoring interfacial bridge to engineer the contact between perovskite and electron transport layer has been successfully developed, enabling an impressive power conversion efficiency of 26.3% with a supreme photovoltage of 1.215&#160;V in p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) suffer from severe nonradiative recombination&#8208;induced photovoltage loss, limiting the device overall performance. To address this key issue, an efficient strategy via a dual&#8208;site anchoring bridge is developed to engineer the heterointerface between perovskite and PCBM electron transport layer. The resulting reinforced and homogeneous passivation by forming strong dual&#8208;site P&#9472;O&#9472;Pb covalent bonds, effectively decreases perovskite surface defect density. This simultaneously reconstructs surface energetics of perovskite with upshifted Fermi level and enhanced electric field, promoting electron extraction at the perovskite/PCBM heterointerface. Corresponding nonradiative recombination at such perovskite electron&#8208;selective contact is greatly suppressed. An impressive power conversion efficiency of 26.3% is obtained with excellent stability under continuous maximum power point operation, and a supreme photovoltage of 1.215&#160;V in p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs via interfacial engineering reported so far. This work offers a promising strategy for solving the perovskite contact challenge via innovative modifier for further improvement of PSCs.

         <title>Janus MXene Fiber Constructed via Flake Orientation Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus&#8208;oriented MXene fiber is developed, featuring vertically and horizontally oriented MXene flakes on opposite sides. This Janus&#8208;orientation design integrates electrical conductivity, strength, and water&#8208;responsive deformation. The resulting large curling actuation enables an event&#8208;triggered logic gate for dual&#8208;mode water&#8208;immersion signaling. This work advances the orientation engineering of MXene flakes and MXene&#8208;based intelligent information devices.








Abstract
The orientation of MXene flakes has received increasing research attention as it plays a critical role in determining the performance of MXene&#8208;based assemblies. Engineering MXene flakes into horizontal or vertical orientations can offer distinct advantages such as higher electrical conductivity, higher mechanical strength, and more efficient ion/molecule transport across the flakes. However, the benefits of horizontal and vertical orientations are mutually exclusive, and both of them possess structural symmetry that restricts their ability for stimuli&#8208;responsive deformation. Herein, a Janus&#8208;oriented MXene fiber is reported, consisting of vertically oriented flakes on one side and horizontally oriented ones on the other. The unique Janus orientation endows the fiber with good mechanical properties, high electrical conductivity, and asymmetric volume expansion capability. Interestingly, such asymmetric volume expansion between the two orientations induces a pronounced curling deformation under water stimuli, leading to a high length change of up to 2100%. Due to such a strong deformation response, the Janus MXene fiber is used to construct an event&#8208;triggered logic gate, which enables the operation of a dual&#8208;mode water immersion warning system featuring both light and Bluetooth signaling. This work is believed to provide inspiration for future orientation engineering of MXene flakes and the design of advanced MXene&#8208;based information devices.

         <title>Charge&#8208;, Size&#8208;, and Symmetry&#8208;Matched Pore Partitioning in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

The pore&#8208;space&#8208;partition (PSP) strategy is successfully realized on rigid acs&#8208;type frameworks. This breakthrough relies on simultaneous control over symmetry, size, and charge matching between the partitioning agents and the parental frameworks.








Abstract
The pore&#8208;space&#8208;partition (PSP) strategy, which subdivides large pores into smaller segments, has proven highly effective in flexible acs&#8208;type frameworks. However, extending this approach to rigid structures has remained a formidable challenge due to the strict size and symmetry constraints required for partitioning ligands. In this study, we successfully overcome these limitations and, for the first time, apply the PSP strategy to rigid acs frameworks. This breakthrough relies on the precise geometric and size compatibility between the parent framework and specially designed partitioning ligands. A series of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on four ligand pairs and four metal combinations are synthesized. Notably, MOFs incorporating partitioning ligands with a hexaazaphenalene core exhibited exceptional benzene adsorption properties. Among these, the neutral NNM&#8208;750&#8208;Fe, featuring ideal charge balance between the metal trimer (+1) and the partitioning ligand (&#8722;1), demonstrated significantly enhanced benzene uptake at low pressure compared to non&#8208;partitioned and charged&#8208;partitioned analogues. This work not only expands the boundaries of the PSP strategy to rigid frameworks but also opens new avenues for the rational design of high&#8208;performance porous materials for advanced separation and adsorption applications.

A cost&#8208;effective and carbon&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;FeSe cathode is first introduced into all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries, which yields a notably high energy density (515.3 Wh kg&#8722;1), high areal loading (&#8776;26 mg cm&#8722;2), wide&#8208;temperature operability (&#8722;20&#8211;150&#160;&#176;C) and long&#8208;term cycling stability (over 6000 cycles), thereby surpassing most of lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes currently available.

Conversion&#8208;type iron chalcogen cathodes, characterized by the multi&#8208;electron redox reaction and cost&#8208;effectiveness, represent an alternative pathway for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). In this study, &#945;&#8208;FeSe as a cathode is identified that operates stably through a Fe2+/Fe0 redox reaction in a sulfide solid&#8208;state system at 30&#160;&#176;C, without the need for any carbon additives. This carbon&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;FeSe cathode exhibits rapid Li+/e&#8722; transfer properties and limited volume change, thus yielding high reversible capacity (564.6 mAh g&#8722;1), long&#8208;term cycling stability (80.3% capacity retention after 800 cycles), high areal loadings (&#8776;26 mg cm&#8722;2), and wide&#8208;temperature operability (&#8722;20&#8211;150&#160;&#176;C). Apart from Fe2+/Fe0 redox reaction, extended cycling or elevated temperature induces partial electrolyte decomposition to generate S&#8208;containing species while triggering a complementary S/S2&#8722; redox process. This dual mechanism enables exceptional cyclability (&gt;6000 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C) and a near&#8208;doubled specific capacity of 956 mAh g&#8722;1 at 120&#160;&#176;C. Thereby, as&#8208;fabricated ASSLBs deliver the ultrahigh energy densities (515.3 Wh kg&#8722;1/1874.6 Wh L&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C, 1568 Wh kg&#8722;1/8310 Wh L&#8722;1 at 120&#160;&#176;C), demonstrating the great potential of using iron selenides as the next&#8208;generation cathode for practical applications of ASSLBs.

         <title>Molecular Extrusion Drives Polymer Dynamic Soft Encapsulation to Inhibit Lead Leakage for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(dipropylene adipate) (PPA) enables grain&#8208;level perovskite encapsulation, suppressing lead leakage by 95.0% (cell) and 91.4% (module) while reducing biotoxicity 93.1% versus control. The PPA&#8208;modified inverted perovskite solar cell (0.04 cm2) achieves 26.37% efficiency; the 30 &#215; 30 cm2 module (651.42 cm2) reaches 20.06% (certified 19.68%), demonstrating high&#8208;efficiency, eco&#8208;friendly photovoltaic devices.








Abstract
Polymer additives exhibit unique advantages in suppressing lead leaching from perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, polymers tend to excessively aggregate in the perovskite film, which hinders comprehensive encapsulation and disrupts charge transport efficiency, degrading lead leakage inhibition and device performance. Herein, a polymer dynamic soft encapsulation strategy driven by molecular extrusion is introduced to mitigate lead leakage in PSCs, achieved through the incorporation of poly(propylene adipate) (PPA) as a multifunctional additive in the perovskite formulation. The PPA&#8208;modified inverted perovskite solar cell (aperture area: 0.04 cm2) and module with dimensions of 30 &#215; 30 cm2 (aperture area: 651.42 cm2) achieve superior power conversion efficiencies of 26.37% and 20.06% (certified 19.68%), respectively. Furthermore, the PPA anchors Pb2+ via chemical coordination and physically blocks moisture ingress, resulting in lead leakage suppression efficiencies of 95.0% in the perovskite solar cell and 91.4% in the module, with a concomitant 93.1% reduction in environmental biotoxicity compared to the control device. This work addresses the critical challenge of lead leakage in PSCs and offers a scalable strategy for advancing the development of environmentally friendly and high&#8208;performance perovskite photovoltaic technology.

The conductive phosphorus (P)&#8208;doped iron telluride (FeTe2) nanoparticles with engineered Te vacancies anchored on nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped carbon (C) (P&#8208;FeTe2&#8208;x@NC) network facilitates rapid electron/lithium ion (Li+)transport, while Te vacancies generate electron&#8208;deficient Fe sites that strengthen polysulfide adsorption via iron&#8208;sulfur (Fe&#9472;S) covalent interactions. Concurrently, P doping upshifts the Fe d&#8208;band center toward the Fermi level, enhancing intermediate affinity through d&#8208;p orbital hybridization. This dual&#8208;defect synergy synchronizes adsorption&#8208;conversion kinetics, significantly improving lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery performance.








Abstract
The polysulfide shuttling and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics hinder the commercialization of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. Herein, the fabrication of phosphorus (P)&#8208;doped iron telluride (FeTe2)&#160;nanoparticles with engineered Te vacancies anchored on nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped carbon (C)&#160;(P&#8208;FeTe2&#8208;x@NC) is presented as a multifunctional sulfur host. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that Te vacancies create electron&#8208;deficient Fe sites, which chemically anchor polysulfides through enhanced Fe&#9472;S covalent interactions. Additionally, P doping shifts the Fe d&#8208;band center toward the Fermi level, increasing the affinity for polysulfide intermediates through d&#8208;p orbital hybridization. This dual modulation strengthens the built&#8208;in electric field at the P&#8208;FeTe2&#8208;x/NC interface, effectively suppressing the shuttle effect and accelerating redox kinetics. The optimized P&#8208;FeTe2&#8208;x@NC host enables Li&#8208;S batteries to achieve an initial capacity of 1475.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and remarkable cycling stability, exhibiting only a 0.031% capacity decay per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C. High sulfur utilization is evidenced by attaining 6.51 mAh cm&#8722;2 areal capacity under a loading of 7.80 mg cm&#8722;2, while a 2.67 Ah pouch cell delivers an energy density of 326.6 Wh kg&#8722;1. This work establishes a vacancy&#8208;doping synergy strategy for coordinating adsorption and conversion processes in sulfur electrochemistry, offering new insights into the design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Siloxane&#8208;Tethered Halogenated Thiophene Additives Enable Excellent Fibrillar Morphology and Air Processing for High&#8208;Performing Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel siloxane&#8208;tethered halogenated thiophene additives Cl&#8208;Th&#8208;SiO, Br&#8208;Th&#8208;SiO, and I&#8208;Th&#8208;SiO are designed and synthesized. The additives can enable D18:L8&#8208;BO active layers with fibrillar morphology and afford the most powerful air&#8208;processing of the high&#8208;performing active layers.








Abstract
For organic solar cells (OSCs), morphological optimization and high&#8208;performance air&#8208;processing of the photoactive layer are important concerns. Herein, three siloxane&#8208;tethered halogenated thiophene additives Cl&#8208;Th&#8208;SiO, Br&#8208;Th&#8208;SiO, and I&#8208;Th&#8208;SiO, with chlorine, bromine, and iodine substitutions on the thiophene, are designed and synthesized, respectively. With the three additives, fibrillar active layer networks based on polymer donor D18 and nonfullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO can be achieved. Among the three additives, the chlorinated Cl&#8208;Th&#8208;SiO possesses the largest dipole moment and the strongest interactions to D18 and L8&#8208;BO, leading to the closet &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking for both the D18 and L8&#8208;BO. The fibrillar morphology is beneficial for enhancing exciton dissociation and charge transport as well as reducing trap&#8208;state density, finally achieving remarkably improved photovoltaic performances for the three additives processed OSCs. Among the additives, Cl&#8208;Th&#8208;SiO is the most powerful, which affords the N2&#8208;processed D18:L8&#8208;BO binary OSCs with excellent PCEs of 20.64% (certified 20.11%). When casting the active layers in air with 60% and 90% relative humidity, high PCEs of 20.45% and 20.19%, respectively, can be achieved, representing the most powerful air&#8208;processed active layers. Our results suggest that the additive design in this work is promising toward ambient&#8208;processed high&#8208;performing OSCs.

Herein, three siloxane-tethered halogenated thiophene additives Cl-Th-SiO, Br-Th-SiO, and I-Th-SiO, with chlorine, bromine, and iodine substitutions on the thiophene, are designed and synthesized, respectively. With the three additives, fibrillar active layer networks based on polymer donor D18 and nonfullerene acceptor L8-BO can be achieved. Among the three additives, the chlorinated Cl-Th-SiO possesses the largest dipole moment and the strongest interactions to D18 and L8-BO, leading to the closet &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; stacking for both the D18 and L8-BO. The fibrillar morphology is beneficial for enhancing exciton dissociation and charge transport as well as reducing trap-state density, finally achieving remarkably improved photovoltaic performances for the three additives processed OSCs. Among the additives, Cl-Th-SiO is the most powerful, which affords the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-processed D18:L8-BO binary OSCs with excellent PCEs of 20.64% (certified 20.11%). When casting the active layers in air with 60% and 90% relative humidity, high PCEs of 20.45% and 20.19%, respectively, can be achieved, representing the most powerful air-processed active layers. Our results suggest that the additive design in this work is promising toward ambient-processed high-performing OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing the Neglected Role of Passivation Layers of Current Collectors for Solid&#8208;State Anode&#8208;Free Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy experiment revealed that the surface passivation layers on copper and stainless steel interact with the sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte upon contact, leading to the formation of various interfacial species. This study provides insights into interfacial chemistry evolution during lithium plating and stripping.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs), which eliminate the need for a lithium metal anode during fabrication, offer superior energy density, enhanced safety, and simplified manufacturing. Their performance is largely influenced by the interfacial properties of the current collectors. Although previous studies have investigated the degradation of sulfide electrolytes on commonly used copper (Cu) and stainless steel (SS) current collectors, the impact of spontaneously formed surface oxides, such as copper oxide (Cu2O/CuO) and chromium oxide (Cr2O3), on interfacial stability remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates the neglected role of passivation layers of both Cu and SS. Results demonstrate that Cu facilitates more stable lithium deposition. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveals that interfacial resistance on SS is consistently higher than on Cu during cycling. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and computational modelling confirm the formation of phosphate (PO43&#8722;) and sulfate (SO42&#8722;) species at both interfaces, attributed to reactions between the sulfide electrolyte and surface oxides. On SS, partial reversible formation of transition metal chlorides is also detected. Based on these findings, an artificial interface is engineered on Cu, significantly improving lithium plating/stripping efficiency. These insights contribute to solid&#8208;solid interface engineering strategies and advance the fundamental understanding of anode&#8208;free ASSLMBs.

         <title>Monolayer MnPS3 Nanosheet Integration for Extended Exciton Diffusion and Charge Transport in High&#8208;Performance Thickness&#8208;Insensitive Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D atomic crystal, MnPS3, is integrated into active layer to extend exciton diffusion and charge transport. Consequently, the resulting OPVs achieves a highly thickness&#8208;insensitive characteristic with a PCE of 19.70% at an active&#8208;layer thickness of 300 nm.








Abstract
Industrial&#8208;scale roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll processing of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) requires photoactive layers &#8805;300 nm for manufacturability and mechanical robustness, yet state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;efficiency systems remain confined to 80&#8211;120 nm due to intrinsic exciton diffusion and charge transport limitations. To resolve this fundamental thickness&#8208;efficiency trade&#8208;off, monolayer MnPS3 nanosheet (1&#8211;2 nm) via liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation are engineered to extend exciton diffusion lengths and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge mobility, as validated through multimodal characterization. The optimized PM6:Y6:MnPS3&#160;system achieves record efficiencies of 19.53% (100 nm) and 18.41% (300 nm), demonstrating unprecedented 94.3% thickness tolerance and setting the highest reported retention for thick&#8208;film (&gt;300 nm) OPVs. Universal applicability is evidenced through 20.45%/19.70% (D18&#8208;Cl:L8&#8208;BO system) and 20.41%/19.62% (D18:L8&#8208;BO system) efficiencies at 100/300 nm, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art thick&#8208;film devices. This monolayer MnPS3 nanosheet integration paradigm establishes a general design rule for thickness&#8208;insensitive organic semiconductors, overcoming the critical photon harvesting&#8208;charge extraction dichotomy in industrial&#8208;scale OPV manufacturing.

         <title>Incipient Ionic Conductors: Ion&#8208;Constrained Lattices Achieving Superionic&#8208;Like Thermal Conductivity Through Extreme Anharmonicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CsCu2I3, a typical incipient ionic conductor in the alkali&#8208;metal halide family, shows confined ion mobility. The beyond&#8208;rattling behavior of Cu atoms enhances extreme anharmonicity, resulting in glass&#8208;like thermal conductivity while preserving structural stability. As an ideal model for incipient ionic conductors, it effectively balances ultralow thermal conductivity and stability, boosting its potential for thermoelectric applications.&#160;








Abstract
Phonon liquid&#8208;like thermal conduction in the solid state enables superionic conductors to serve as efficient thermoelectric device candidates. While liquid&#8208;like motion of ions effectively suppresses thermal conductivity (&#954;), their high mobility concurrently triggers material degradation due to undesirable ion migration and consequent metal deposition, making it a challenge to balance low &#954; and high stability. Here, phonon liquid&#8208;like thermal transport is reported alongside restricted long&#8208;range ion migration in CsCu2I3 with incipient ionic conduction, using synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering, and machine&#8208;learning potential&#8208;based simulations. The Cu ions are revealed to exhibit confined migration between CuI4 tetrahedra at high temperatures, displaying extreme anharmonicity of dominated phonons beyond conventional rattling and comparable to that in superionic conductors. Consequently, a glass&#8208;like &#954; (&#8776;0.3 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 300 K) following the relationship of &#954; &#8776; T 0.17, is achieved along the x&#8208;direction, where Cu ion migration is three orders of magnitude lower than in superionic conductors. These results highlight the advantage of incipient ionic conductors in simultaneously maintaining both low &#954; and high stability, elucidating the thermal transport mechanism via ion migration constraints, and paving an effective pathway toward ultralow thermal conductivity in ionic conductors.

         <title>In Situ Soft X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy Investigation on Charge Transfer Mechanism in COF/CdS S&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work elucidated the electron transfer mechanisms for an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction composed of CdS and covalent organic framework using synchrotron&#8208;based in situ soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Interfacial Cd&#9472;N and Cd&#9472;S bonds act as the charge transfer channels within the heterojunction. This study validates a new approach to characterizing S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions and can guide the design of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts.








Abstract
Photocatalysis enabled by step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunction has emerged as a promising strategy for addressing the global energy crisis and achieving carbon neutrality. However, mechanisms regulating the interfacial charge transfer dynamics of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions remain elusive. Herein, the electron transfer mechanisms are elucidated for a model S&#8208;scheme heterojunction composed of cadmium sulfide and a covalent organic framework material using synchrotron&#8208;based in situ soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, substantiating the well&#8208;established in situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that interfacial Cd&#9472;N and Cd&#9472;S bonds act as the charge transfer channels within the heterojunction. The S&#8208;scheme heterojunction exhibits high charge separation efficiency, as demonstrated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, which contributed to enhanced photocatalytic performance in coupled H2O2 generation and organic transformation reactions. This study validates a new approach to characterizing S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions and can guide the design of inorganic&#8208;organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions for practical photocatalytic applications.

The results, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that interfacial Cd&#9472;N and Cd&#9472;S bonds act as the charge transfer channels within the heterojunction. The S-scheme heterojunction exhibits high charge separation efficiency, as demonstrated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, which contributed to enhanced photocatalytic performance in coupled H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation and organic transformation reactions. This study validates a new approach to characterizing S-scheme heterojunctions and can guide the design of inorganic-organic S-scheme heterojunctions for practical photocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced Plasmon Electron Transfer&#8208;based Bioorthogonal Cleavage Reaction for Precision Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatiotemporally controllable photocatalytic cancer therapy is developed using a PiPET&#8208;based bioorthogonal cleavage of allyl carbamate&#8208;conjugated MB. Pd&#8208;conjugated Au nanobipyramids enhanced catalytic activity, achieving a ninefold increase in MB release. This system demonstrates precise tumor suppression via photothermal and PiPET effects, offering innovative, targeted therapy.








Abstract
Photocatalytic reactions have been harnessed to develop advanced medical solutions for transformative cancer therapy. However, their limited catalytic activities within biological environments must be enhanced to maximize their potential in practical applications. Here, a spatiotemporally controllable photocatalytic cancer therapy is reported through the photoinduced plasmon electron transfer (PiPET)&#8208;based biorthogonal cleavage reaction of a pro&#8208;photosensitizer, allyl carbamate&#8208;conjugated methylene blue (MB). The electron transfer in Pd&#8208;conjugated Au nanobipyramids is examined to improve catalytic activity by simulating the energy differences between the desorbed and adsorbed states, bond distances, and charge densities with and without excess electrons. A significantly enhanced release of allyl carbamate&#8208;conjugated methylene blue is achieved by ninefold and demonstrated precise spatiotemporal control of the bioorthogonal reaction in vivo. Both in vitro and in vivo studies reveal the remarkable tumor&#8208;suppressing capability of the bioorthogonal system, which is attributed to the photothermal and PiPET effects, coupled with the prevention of leuko&#8208;MB formation. The PiPET&#8208;based bioorthogonal cleavage reaction can offer an innovative solution for precise tumor therapy using spatiotemporal phototherapeutic strategies.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop and Selective Recyclable Fluoro&#8208;Containing Graft Copolymers with Diverse Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research develops a fluoro&#8208;containing graft copolymer whose side chains can be selectively &#8220;disintegrated&#8221; into monomers and &#8220;re&#8208;grafted,&#8221; in which both the &#8220;ungrafted&#8221; backbone polymer and &#8220;regenerated&#8221; graft copolymers can be utilized for different high&#8208;value applications. The demonstration using fluoropolymer provides a potential solution to alleviate the environmental concerns of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&#8208;typed polymeric materials.









Abstract
The intrinsic chemically inert fluoropolymers, constitute a large portion of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), granting them unique properties and prolonged lifetime while also bring substantial environmental concerns. This study develops fluoro&#8208;containing graft copolymer with closed&#8208;loop and selective recyclability of side chains. The poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVDF&#8208;CTFE) backbone is modified via 4&#8208;vinylbenzyl alcohol (VBOH) units and then grafted by poly (trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) side chains, yielding the graft copolymer with improved ionic conductivity and enhanced mechanical robustness, demonstrating it as a polymer electrolyte for battery application. The selective deconstruction of PTMC side chains from graft copolymer affords the recycled backbone with a high dielectric constant and superior resistance to harsh environments, suitable for capacitor fabrication and anti&#8208;corrosion coating. The reconstructed graft copolymer exhibits comparable electrochemical performance for related applications. Such a strategy not only deals with PFAS&#8208;based polymeric wastes but also diversifies the application scenarios of typical copolymers.

         <title>MUTE&#8208;Seq: An Ultrasensitive Method for Detecting Low&#8208;Frequency Mutations in cfDNA With Engineered Advanced&#8208;Fidelity FnCas9</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced&#8208;fidelity CRISPR nuclease, FnCas9&#8208;AF2, is rationally engineered to discriminate single&#8208;base mismatches with unprecedented level precision. Integrated into the MUTE&#8208;Seq workflow, FnCas9&#8208;AF2 depletes wild&#8208;type cell&#8208;free DNA, thereby exposing rare tumor&#8208;derived mutant DNA (a molecular &#8220;needle in a haystack&#8221;). The method enables ultrasensitive, cost&#8208;efficient detection of low&#8208;frequency mutations for liquid&#8208;biopsy cancer diagnostics, supporting early detection, companion diagnosis, and MRD monitoring.








Abstract
In this study, we present the development of the Mutation tagging by CRISPR&#8208;based Ultra&#8208;precise Targeted Elimination in Sequencing (MUTE&#8208;Seq) method. We engineered a highly precise advanced&#8208;fidelity FnCas9 variant, named FnCas9&#8208;AF2, to effectively discriminate single&#8208;base mismatches at all positions of the single guide RNA (sgRNA) target sequences. FnCas9&#8208;AF2 exhibited significantly lower off&#8208;target effects compared to existing high&#8208;fidelity CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 variants. MUTE&#8208;Seq leverages FnCas9&#8208;AF2 for the enrichment of mutant DNA through the exclusive cleavage of perfectly matched wild&#8208;type DNA, allowing for sensitive detection of low&#8208;frequency cancer&#8208;associated mutant alleles. MUTE&#8208;Seq enabled sensitive monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) from the bone marrow of patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Furthermore, MUTE&#8208;Seq was applied in a multiplexed manner on cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) from patients diagnosed with non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. This approach demonstrated a significant improvement in the sensitivity of simultaneous mutant detection and highlighted its clinical utility for early&#8208;stage cancer patients with extremely low levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). We anticipate that the FnCas9&#8208;AF2&#8208;based MUTE&#8208;Seq could offer a valuable clinical tool to facilitate improved molecular diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and treatment planning for cancers in various stages.

         <title>Defect Engineering&#8208;Driven Electron Spin Polarization and Charge Transfer in MOFs for Enhanced Sonocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a new paradigm for MOF&#8208;based sonocatalysts, where metal node substitution induces linker defects to optimize the electron transfer pathway and modulate the spin state of the catalytic center, enhancing sonocatalytic performance and enabling efficient tumor therapy.








Abstract
Sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) is a non&#8208;invasive tumor treatment modality that utilizes ultrasound (US)&#8208; activated sonocatalysts to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), whose production critically dependent on the electronic structural properties of the catalytic sites. However, the spin state, which is a pivotal descriptor of electronic properties, remains underappreciated in SCT. Herein, a Ti&#8208;doped zirconium&#8208;based MOF (Ti&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, denoted as UTN) with ligand&#8208;deficient defects is constructed for SCT, revealing the important role of the electronic spin state in modulating intrinsic catalytic activity. The defect&#8208;driven sonocatalytic mechanism is elucidated as follows: 1) structural defects alleviate the limitations of ligand&#8208;metal charge transfer, achieving a 2.1&#8208;fold enhancement in charge transfer efficiency; 2) spin polarization at Ti active sites reconfigures the d&#8208;orbital electron distribution, thereby increasing the density of spin&#8208;polarized electronic states near the Fermi level. Furthermore, Ti 3d&#8208;O 2p orbital hybridization lowers the adsorption energies of H2O and O2 by 2.5&#8208;fold and 1.6&#8208;fold, respectively, thereby facilitating interfacial redox reactions and leading to enhanced ROS generation. Notably, UTN combined with US achieves 86.07% tumor inhibition efficiency. This work establishes novel insights into defect engineering, spin&#8208;state modulation, and surface interfacial adsorption in SCT, providing a theoretical paradigm framework for designing of high&#8208;performance sonocatalysts.

         <title>Dynamic Localization Effect of Dendritic and Eutectic Growth Patterns Stimulated by Space Fluid Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the containerless experiment conducted in space, a spatially ordered separation of dendritic and eutectic regions is observed on the surface of Nb&#8208;Si alloy. Furthermore, the space fluid flow induces a dynamic localization effect in the growth patterns of these dendrites and eutectics. These findings provide new insights into in&#8208;situ manufacturing and controlled growth of crystals in space environments.








Abstract
Conventional solidification theory asserts that eutectic phases solidify into only one specific morphology at a fixed undercooling when volume effects are negligible, while dendrites adopt rotationally parabolic tips. Here, experiments aboard China Space Station reveal that space fluid flow localization reshapes these dynamics: confined solute&#8208;thermal coupling near solid&#8208;liquid interfaces drives transitions among three eutectic growth patterns (worm&#8208;like, lamellar, faceted). Simultaneously, Marangoni convection at large undercoolings induces non&#8208;parabolic dendritic tip morphologies (dome&#8208;like, finger&#8208;like, needle&#8208;like). Spatially ordered separation of eutectic and dendritic zones is governed by localized spherically symmetric temperature and concentration fields arising from space fluid flow, whereas buoyancy&#8208;driven convection in terrestrial gravity environment disrupts this ordering, perturbing phase domain distributions. When solidified at a small undercooling, the weak convection during late stage preserves the near&#8208;perfect symmetry of dendrites under microgravity. These findings uncover novel dendritic and eutectic growth patterns under microgravity and may be applied to in&#8208;situ space manufacturing and controlled growth of crystals.

         <title>Programmable and Unidirectional Liquid Self&#8208;Transport on Modular Fluidic Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular fluidic units can achieve versatile on&#8208;surface liquid self&#8208;transport via assembly and integration. Accordingly, the real&#8208;time reconfigurability, unidirectional self&#8208;transport property, and ease of plug&amp;play together confirm opportunities in mass transfer, concentration titration, and future smart liquid manipulation.








Abstract
The precise control of liquids is essential for both organisms in harsh environments and human society. However, current nature&#8208;inspired fluidic systems, especially liquid self&#8208;transport on open&#8208;surfaces, lack programmability due to their inherent fixed structures, and freely integrating such interfaces remains challenging. Here, modular fluidic units (MFUs) enabling real&#8208;time reconfiguration of pathways through the simple assembly and disassembly of joint structures are presented. Continuous self&#8208;transport across discontinuous units is achieved by means of a water bridge induced unidirectional mechanism. Given the promoted transport performance, a series of functional devices are further developed in plane, including switchable flow distributor, stepwise liquid delivery, transport editing, and micro&#8208;reaction platform. These findings provide a facile yet efficient strategy to enable unidirectional self&#8208;transport, simultaneously enhancing the capability of pathway regulating and transport predicting, offering possibilities for future smart liquid manipulation on open&#8208;surfaces.

         <title>Achieving Mechanical Evolution in Polymer Materials Through Phase Evolution Induced by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy involving in situ polymerization is proposed to achieve &#8220;evolutionary polymer materials&#8221;, whose polymer phases and mechanical properties can both continuously evolve over time. Such a process is controlled by visible light and leads to a significant enhancement of 2400 times in Young's modulus of a hydrogel. A hydrogel metamaterial is constructed based on the spatiotemporal controllability of the above evolution process.








Abstract
Can artificial polymer materials exhibit the characteristic of &#8220;evolution&#8221; over time, similar to biological tissue? The limitations arise from their inherently static nature and the absence of dynamic structures. A strategy is proposed for designing polymer materials whose phases and mechanical properties can be continuously transformed and enhanced temporally. Specifically, the polymer phases experience a sequence of transitions involving generation, separation, and fusion. Each period enhances mechanical properties in distinct and significant ways, demonstrating a mechanical evolution. This evolution is initiated through in situ polymerization within the material and can be precisely controlled using visible light. Applied to a hydrogel system, this approach achieves a record&#8208;breaking increase in Young's modulus by over 2400&#8208;fold, from 18.5&#160;kPa to 44.5&#160;MPa. The findings highlight the potential for tailoring mechanical properties on demand and constructing metamaterials with multilevel moduli and composite architectures.

         <title>Altermagnetic Band Splitting in 10 nm Epitaxial CrSb Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin film altermagnets are attractive for potential spintronic applications. How thin can we make an altermagnet before quantum confinement perturbs the distinctive band structure? This paper uses angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy to show that the canonical g&#8208;wave altermagnet, NiAs&#8208;type CrSb, grown by molecular beam epitaxy, preserves its altermagnetic band splitting of about 700 meV in films as thin as 10 nm.








Abstract
Altermagnets are a newly identified family of collinear antiferromagnets with a momentum&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;split band structure of non&#8208;relativistic origin, derived from spin&#8208;group symmetry&#8208;protected crystal structures. Among candidate altermagnets, CrSb is attractive for potential applications because of a large spin&#8208;splitting near the Fermi level and a high N&#233;el transition temperature of around 700 K. Molecular beam epitaxy is used to synthesize CrSb (0001) thin films with thicknesses ranging from 10 to 100 nm. Structural characterization, using reflection high energy electron diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, demonstrates the growth of epitaxial films with good crystallinity. Polarized neutron reflectometry shows the absence of any net magnetization, consistent with antiferromagnetic order. In vacuo angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements probe the band structure in a previously unexplored regime of film thickness, down to 10 nm. These ARPES measurements show a bulk&#8208;type, 3D momentum&#8208;dependent band splitting of up to 0.7 eV with g&#8208;wave symmetry, consistent with that seen in prior studies of bulk single crystals. The distinct altermagnetic band structure required for potential spin&#8208;transport applications survives down to the &#8764;10 nm thin film limit at room&#160;temperature.

         <title>Giant Birefringence Induced by Intermolecular Aromatic Interactions in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework exhibits a giant birefringence induced by intermolecular aromatic interactions, which surpasses all reported organic birefringent crystals and significantly exceeds that of any commercial birefringent crystals.








Abstract
Birefringent crystals are crucial optical materials that play a pivotal role in modulating and detecting the polarization state of light. However, there is still a significant challenge in regulating the assembly of &#960;&#8208;conjugated active units to construct optical crystals with giant birefringence. In this study, a hydrogen&#8208;bonding self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed to construct an aromatic &#960;&#8208;conjugated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework birefringent crystal (HOFBC) which exhibits a remarkable birefringence value of 0.763@546&#160;nm, surpassing all reported organic birefringent crystals and significantly exceeding that of any commercial birefringent crystals. Theoretical calculation and structural analyses indicate that this exceptional birefringence arises from high polarizability anisotropy of aromatic &#960;&#8208;conjugated units and intermolecular aromatic interactions. Interestingly, when HOFBC&#8208;1 is heated to 250&#160;&#176;C and transforms into HOFBC&#8208;1&#8208;250, the crystal retains its crystalline structure and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly mode, achieving a giant birefringence value of 0.800@546&#160;nm. This work presents a novel strategy for developing giant birefringent materials, opening up new opportunities for the application of HOF crystals in birefringence.

In this study, a hydrogen-bonding self-assembly strategy is proposed to construct an aromatic &#960;-conjugated hydrogen-bonded organic framework birefringent crystal (HOFBC) which exhibits a remarkable birefringence value of 0.763@546&#160;nm, surpassing all reported organic birefringent crystals and significantly exceeding that of any commercial birefringent crystals. Theoretical calculation and structural analyses indicate that this exceptional birefringence arises from high polarizability anisotropy of aromatic &#960;-conjugated units and intermolecular aromatic interactions. Interestingly, when HOFBC-1 is heated to 250&#160;&#176;C and transforms into HOFBC-1-250, the crystal retains its crystalline structure and layer-by-layer assembly mode, achieving a giant birefringence value of 0.800@546&#160;nm. This work presents a novel strategy for developing giant birefringent materials, opening up new opportunities for the application of HOF crystals in birefringence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Surface Autogenous Mineralization Enabling Epitaxial Zn Electrodeposition on Weakly Conductive Crystalline Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supercritical CO2&#8208;induced surface mineralization strategy is developed to form a dense ZnCO3 layer on Zinc (Zn) anodes. This crystalline coating enables epitaxial Zn growth along the (0002) plane, suppressing dendrites and enhancing metal anode lifespan to over 3500&#160;h. The method is simple, scalable, and effective, offering a promising route for durable Zn metal anodes in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Regulating Zinc (Zn) nucleation and crystal growth on the anode surface is critical for reliable aqueous Zn metal batteries. However, achieving scalable and uniform surface modifications remains challenging. A Supercritical CO2&#8208;induced surface autogenous mineralization (SAM) strategy is introduced to fabricate a large&#8208;area, uniform, and crystalline Smithsonite autogenous regulating layer (ARL) on Zn foil. SAM enables in situ generation of H2CO3 and direct reactions with Zn under supercritical conditions, suppressing Zn2+ hydrolysis and inducing in situ mineralization. The ARL well&#8208;defined facets provide zincophilic sites, promoting single&#8208;crystal Zn nucleation and facilitating dense epitaxial deposition, thereby mitigating dendrites and enhancing cycling stability. The modified electrodes achieve over 1200&#160;h with 99.48% Coulombic efficiency in SZn&#8208;4||Cu cells, over 3500&#160;h in symmetrical cells, and over 8000 cycles in full cells at high current densities. This scalable SAM route offers a robust platform for high&#8208;performance, long&#8208;life Zn anodes in next&#8208;generation aqueous energy storage.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Programmed siRNA&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Spatiotemporal Gene Silencing in Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an intelligent, dual&#8208;response hydrogel system for chronic wounds. By delivering siRMMP&#8208;9, the system effectively silences MMP&#8208;9, thereby preventing excessive ECM degradation. The SS&#8208;HPT structure enables efficient binding of siRMMP&#8208;9 and controlled release triggered by GSH. Moreover, the OR&#8208;S gel, formed by Fc/&#946;&#8208;CD self&#8208;assembly, exhibits ROS&#8208;responsive properties and ROS&#8208;scavenging capabilities, thereby promoting wound healing.








Abstract
Excessive inflammation and overexpressed matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are significant factors in the prolonged healing of chronic diabetic wounds. Here, a precise gene therapy strategy is proposed utilizing siRNA and employing intelligent responsive materials for controlled release to mechanistically intervene in the pathological process of chronic non&#8208;healing wounds. The system employs a cationic hyperbranched aminoglycoside with disulfide bonds (SS&#8208;HPT) as its core delivery mechanism. These SS&#8208;HPT/siRMMP&#8208;9 complexes are incorporated into a hyaluronic acid&#8208;based hydrogel with redox&#8208;responsive properties (OR&#8208;S gel), allowing dual regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the wound microenvironment. The hydrogel network actively scavenges excess ROS, mitigating oxidative stress damage to tissue repair. Simultaneously, ROS&#8208;mediated hydrogel degradation enables the controlled release of siRMMP&#8208;9, enhancing the treatment's spatiotemporal precision and biocompatibility. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirm that this treatment system effectively down&#8208;regulates MMP&#8208;9 expression, remodels the extracellular matrix, and enhances the wound repair microenvironment, thereby significantly accelerating the healing of chronic diabetic wounds. This study introduces an innovative intervention targeting the mechanisms underlying non&#8208;healing diabetic wounds and offers a theoretical foundation for applying intelligent responsive gene delivery systems in tissue repair, demonstrating promising translational potential and clinical prospects.

         <title>20.64% Efficient and Stable Binary Organic Solar Cells via Thermodynamic&#8208;Engineered Interlayer Diffusion and Exciton Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unresolved thermodynamic mechanisms in active&#8208;layer optimization limit efficiency enhancement in organic solar cells. Here, real&#8208;time thermal imaging coupled with in situ absorption spectroscopy is utilized to elucidate the temperature&#8208;dependent assembly dynamics during sequential deposition of active&#8208;layer films on hot&#8208;substrate. Finally, over 20% efficiency is demonstrated in three different systems: 20.02% (D18/eC9&#8208;4F), 20.25 (D18/eC9), and 20.64% (D18/L8&#8208;BO, certified 20.10%).








Abstract
Despite thermodynamics playing a central role in active&#8208;layer optimization, unresolved temperature&#8208;dependent mechanisms hinder further efficiency improvements in organic solar cell. Herein, real&#8208;time thermal imaging is employed to unravel the temperature&#8208;controlled assembly dynamics during sequential processing (SqP) of active&#8208;layer films on a hot&#8208;substrate (HS). The HS process provides higher temperature and prolonged heating time for the active layer during SqP compared to the widely adopted hot&#8208;solution technique, enabling accelerated liquid&#8208;phase reorganization and nucleation in the bottom layer. The HS&#8208;induced interfacial energy difference promotes layer interpenetration and achieves suitable donor content in the bottom region of the active layer while boosting exciton generation. The highly crystalline fibrous structure improves hole mobility and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination (0.214&#160;eV), yielding a high fill factor (81.00%) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (0.868&#160;V). The 100&#160;nm&#8208;thick D18 HS/eC9 device achieves an efficiency of 19.75% (vs 18.89% for the control) and retains 90% of its initial efficiency after 270&#160;h under &#8776;1 sun illumination (vs 84% for the control). With 2PACZ as the hole transport layer, over 20% efficiency is demonstrated in three systems: 20.02% (D18/eC9&#8208;4F), 20.25 (D18/eC9), and 20.64% (D18/L8&#8208;BO, certified 20.10%). Notably, HS&#8208;processed 300&#160;nm&#8208;thick binary devices achieve over 18.12% efficiency&#8212;among the highest reported.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for BBB Transport Mediated by an Inflammatory Receptor Antagonist for Neuroprotection in Ischemic Stroke</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of the design and mechanism of receptor antagonist&#8208;guided polyphenol nanoparticles for ischemic stroke treatment. Leveraging the ischemia&#8208;induced upregulation of inflammatory receptors, receptor antagonists act both as targeting ligands and therapeutic agents, enabling BBB transcytosis, lysosomal escape, and ferroptosis suppression through LOXs inhibition and ROS reduction, ultimately contributing to endothelial restoration and neuronal protection in ischemic brain injury.








Abstract
Delivering therapeutics across the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) remains a major challenge in ischemic stroke therapy. Ischemic stroke induces upregulation of various inflammatory membrane receptors on brain endothelial cells, offering potential entry points for receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis. This study proposes a universal targeting strategy by employing inflammatory pathway antagonists as targeting ligands, which broadens the spectrum of available ligands beyond traditional receptor&#8208;binding molecules. Notably, many antagonists not only confer receptor&#8208;targeting ability but also actively participate in downstream anti&#8208;inflammatory, antioxidant, or cellular repair signaling pathways. A multifunctional polyphenol&#8208;based nanoparticle system is developed by co&#8208;assembling oligomerized cyanidin&#8208;3&#8208;glucoside (C3G) with a series of receptor&#8208;specific antagonists as targeting ligands, including those for thromboxane A2 receptor (TxA2R), Toll&#8208;like receptors 4 and 7 (TLR4 and TLR7), and purinergic receptors (e.g., P2X4). The nanoparticles demonstrate a bifurcated intracellular fate: Golgi&#8208;mediated transcytosis into brain parenchyma or endothelial repair via upregulation of tight junction proteins. Nanoparticles loaded with Seratrodast (CCS) are selected as a representative formulation for in&#8208;depth evaluation. Upon entering the ischemic microenvironment, CCS nanoparticles are degraded by reactive oxygen species, releasing catechol&#8208;containing metabolites for potent inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, thereby blocking ferroptosis and promoting neuroprotection. These findings highlight the dual functionality of antagonists as both targeting ligands and therapeutic modulators, offering a highly translatable design paradigm for intelligent stroke therapeutics.

The nanoparticles demonstrate a bifurcated intracellular fate: Golgi-mediated transcytosis into brain parenchyma or endothelial repair via upregulation of tight junction proteins. Nanoparticles loaded with Seratrodast (CCS) are selected as a representative formulation for in-depth evaluation. Upon entering the ischemic microenvironment, CCS nanoparticles are degraded by reactive oxygen species, releasing catechol-containing metabolites for potent inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, thereby blocking ferroptosis and promoting neuroprotection. These findings highlight the dual functionality of antagonists as both targeting ligands and therapeutic modulators, offering a highly translatable design paradigm for intelligent stroke therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Consecutive Hybrid Bioprinting of Microfiber&#8208;Reinforced Living Muscle Constructs with Highly&#8208;Aligned Cellular Organizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;nozzle consecutive hybrid bioprinting strategy is proposed to fabricate centimeter&#8208;scale living composite constructs that well integrates polymeric microfibers, sacrificial gelatin, and cell&#8208;laden fibrin hydrogels. The microfibrous structure not only provides tunable mechanical properties to the composite constructs, but also enables cell&#8208;induced anisotropic remodeling of fibrin filaments to form highly&#8208;aligned myoblast bundles, closely resembling those of native muscle tissues.








Abstract
Replicating the highly&#8208;organized extracellular matrix microfibrillar networks and directional cellular organization of native skeletal muscles is essential for engineering functional muscle constructs. Here, we propose a consecutive hybrid bioprinting (CHB) strategy to fabricate living composite constructs with polymeric microfibers, sacrificial gelatin and cell&#8208;laden fibrin hydrogels by combining electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing and extrusion&#8208;based bioprinting, which enables the engineering of mechanically&#8208;matched and highly&#8208;aligned porous muscle constructs. The bioprinted hydrogel components provide a smooth and dynamically&#8208;rising conductive surface for stable EHD printing of well&#8208;organized microfibers with centimeter height, which conversely provides mechanical support to ensure the structural integrity of the resultant composite constructs. Upon removal of the sacrificial hydrogel, the porous composite constructs maintain their original shape, and native muscle&#8208;like mechanical properties can be achieved by modulating the microfiber configurations. Notably, these microfibrous structures facilitate cell&#8208;induced anisotropic remodeling of fibrin filaments, resulting in cross&#8208;sectional contraction to form highly&#8208;aligned myoblast bundles along the bioprinting trajectory. This enables the CHB of circumferentially or layer&#8208;specifically aligned cellular constructs. The aligned myoblast constructs can be differentiated into multinucleated myotubes with enhanced muscle&#8208;specific protein and gene expression. This CHB strategy provides a promising platform to directly engineer living composite constructs with native anisotropic mechanical properties and cellular organizations.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Mediated Microenvironment Modulation of High&#8208;Density Fe&#8208;N4 Sites for High&#8208;Efficiency Oxygen Reduction and Cryotolerant Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

An S&#8208;mediated microenvironment modulation strategy is developed for Fe&#8208;N4 sites, synthesizing a Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (FeNSC) with optimized Fe&#8208;N4 density and electronic structure that exhibits exceptional oxygen reduction reaction activity. With FeNSC used as the cathode in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries, the batteries demonstrate high power density and extended low&#8208;temperature cycling stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) featuring Fe&#8208;N4 active sites hold significant potential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, achieving high&#8208;density Fe&#8208;N4 active sites while precisely modulating their microenvironment to enhance ORR activity remains a formidable challenge. Here, an S&#8208;mediated strategy is presented for the preparation of Fe single&#8208;atom&#8208;loaded S,N&#8208;doped carbon (FeNSC). This strategy leverages the interactions between S and N during pyrolysis to significantly suppress N loss, thereby achieving a high density of Fe&#8208;N4 sites. Concurrently, the precise doping of S into the second coordination shell of Fe&#8208;N4 centers modulates their electronic structure, leading to a significant weakening of *O and *OH intermediates adsorption during the ORR. Consequently, the FeNSC catalyst exhibits excellent pH&#8208;universal ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.928 V (0.1 M KOH), 0.806 V (0.1 M HClO4), and 0.755 V (0.1 M phosphate buffer solution). A FeNSC&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air battery (QSS&#8208;ZAB) achieves smooth operation over a broad temperature range of &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C. Notably, it sustains continuous operation for over 940 h at &#8722;40 &#176;C, showcasing unprecedented cryotolerance. This work provides novel insights into the electronic microenvironment engineering of Fe&#8208;N4 sites in SACs for high&#8208;efficiency ORR and cryotolerant QSS&#8208;ZABs.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Engineering of Neural Stem Cells with Membrane&#8208;Bound Microsatellites for Enhanced Brain Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyaluronic acid methacryloyl microsatellites are bio&#8208;orthogonally conjugated to the cell membrane of neural stem cells to create engineered stem cells. These microsatellites can migrate together with the engineered cells and continuously release differentiation regulators around the cells to precisely regulate their neuronal differentiation in vivo, improving the tissue repair and behavioral recovery of traumatic brain injury rats.








Abstract
Regulating the differentiation of implanted stem cells into neurons is crucial for stem cell therapy of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, due to the migratory nature of implanted stem cells, precise and targeted regulation of their fate remains challenging. Here, neural stem cells (NSCs) are bio&#8208;orthogonally engineered with hyaluronic acid methacryloyl (HAMA) microsatellites capable of sustained release of differentiation modulators for targeted regulation of their neuronal differentiation and advanced TBI repair. By employing bio&#8208;orthogonal covalent reactions and optimizing the microsatellite size, HAMA microsatellites can stay on membranes for over 10 days owing to the minimal detachment or endocytosis. These microsatellites can thus migrate together with engineered NSCs and release modulators around the cells, actively inducing 45.1% of NSCs to differentiate into neurons compared to only 18.8% for normal NSCs. These microsatellite&#8208;engineered stem cells improve brain tissue repair and enhance behavioral recovery in TBI rats after implantation. This strategy holds promise for the advanced treatment of TBI and other neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Interstitial Cobalt in Pt Shell of Pd@Pt Mesoporous Core&#8211;Shell Nanospheres with Strong d&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates an interstitial Co in Pt shell of Pd@Pt catalyst for ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR). Pt&#8208;Co d&#8208;d orbital hybridization optimizes Pt's electronic structure, lowering the energy barrier for N&#8208;N coupling. The catalyst exhibits 4.8&#8208;fold higher AOR activity than commercial Pt/C and enables stable operation of a Zn&#8208;NH3 battery while maintaining a high hydrogen production Faradaic efficiency of 96.8%. 








Abstract
Ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) is critical for efficient ammonia utilization as a hydrogen carrier, yet state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based catalysts suffer significant activity loss due to strong *NOx species (*NO, *NO2) adsorption. Herein, Pd@Pt mesoporous core&#8208;shell nanospheres with interstitial Co in Pt shell (Pd@Pt&#8208;Co MCSN) are demonstrated as an excellent AOR electrocatalyst, which achieves a mass activity of 293.6 A g&#8722;1 at 0.7&#160;V versus RHE, 4.8&#8208;fold higher than commercial Pt/C. The interstitial Co dopant tunes the d&#8208;d orbital hybridization state, optimizes the Pt d&#8208;band center position, and facilitates electron transfer from Co to Pt, which effectively weakens the adsorption of toxic *NOx and lowers the energy barrier for N&#8208;N coupling. When integrated into a Zn&#8208;NH3 battery, the catalyst enables efficient NH3&#8208;to&#8208;H2 conversion with a Faradaic efficiency of 96.8% and stable operation for 30 hours at 12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The work may provide a new design concept to develop advanced electrocatalysts for AOR.

         <title>Worse Interference of Fe3+ than Fe2+ on Degrading the Interphase and Performance of LiFePO4||Graphite Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 47, November 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interference of Fe3+ and Fe2+ cross&#8208;talk on degrading the interphase and performance of LiFePO4||Graphite batteries is compared and proved that Fe2+ mainly exacerbates existing electrolyte decomposition pathway while Fe3+ further facilitates radical recombination and catalyzes two&#8208;electron electrolyte decomposition; the latter is validated to be present in the practical LiFePO4||Graphite batteries, resulting in severe side reaction and capacity decline.








Abstract
The detrimental effects of Fe&#8208;ion crosstalk on LiFePO4||Graphite battery performance, coupled with limited mechanistic insights into solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) evolution under such interference, warrant systematic investigation. Herein, advanced characterization techniques&#8212;including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy&#8212;are employed to reveal SEI evolution on graphite anodes under Fe2+/Fe3+ influence. Results demonstrate that Fe3+ exerts more severe adverse effects than Fe2+. Specifically, Fe2+ primarily promotes conventional electrolyte reduction reactions, increasing H2, CH4, and CO2 generation. In contrast, Fe3+ facilitates radical combinations and catalyzes two&#8208;electron reductions, triggering side reactions releasing CO, C2H4, and C2H6. The SEI thickness under Fe&#8208;ion interference (Fe2+: 7.20&#8211;13.76&#160;nm, Fe3+: 9.12&#8211;17.55&#160;nm) significantly exceeds that of the base electrolyte (3.15&#8211;7.64&#160;nm), with Fe deposits accumulating in organometallic forms. Critically, the presence of Fe3+ and its adverse impacts on battery safety and cycling stability are validated in practical pouch cells. This study uncovers the chemical nature of the dissolved Fe ion and its deposits, provides mechanistic insights into its interference with SEI properties and Li&#8208;ion battery performances, which in turn helps to mitigate such detrimental effects.

         <title>Quadruple Moir&#233; Pockets in Lateral Heterobilayers: Programmable Phononic Reconfiguration and Anomalous Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable CVD&#8208;grown lateral heterostructures stacked with controllable twist angles form quadruple moir&#233; pockets, enabling programmable tuning of phonon, exciton, and SHG. Material&#8208;selective lattice relaxation modulates strain, interlayer coupling, Davydov splitting, valley polarization, and anomalous SHG enhancement. Such multi&#8208;moir&#233; networks establish a scalable pathway for multifunctional moir&#233; engineering, opening opportunities in opto&#8208;straintronics, nonlinear optoelectronics, and quantum photonics.








Abstract
Moir&#233;&#8208;engineering in 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides offers access to correlated quantum phenomena. However, simultaneous control over twist&#8208;angle (&#952;) and material combinations to tune phonons, excitons, and their collective interactions remains limited. This study presents scalable, quadruple moir&#233;&#8208;pockets formed by vertically stacking chemical vapor deposition&#8208;grown monolayer MoS2&#8211;WS2 and MoSe2&#8211;WSe2 lateral heterostructures with controlled &#952; (0&#8304;&#8211;60&#176;), within a single flatland. Moir&#233; non&#8208;rigidity induces lattice&#8208;relaxation via rotational reconstruction (&#952;&lt;8&#176;) and volumetric dilation (&#952;&gt;8&#176;), resulting in strain&#8208;mediated phonon frequency&#8208;softening and linewidth&#8208;broadening, respectively. Strain localizes selectively in mechanically softer crystal for &#952;&lt;8&#176;, while an epitaxial&#8208;pseudomorphic pattern dominates for &#952;&gt;8&#176;. Degree of phonon&#8208;reconfiguration and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy uncover the role of interfacial orbitals in modulating interlayer coupling. At aligned angles (&#952;&#8211;0&#176; and 60&#176;), specifically, MoS2 exhibits Davydov splitting and reduced valley polarization, reflecting symmetry breaking and chiral phonon effects. At &#952;&#8211;3&#176;, WS2/WSe2 shows up to 480% enhancement in second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), while WS2/MoSe2 records the lowest due to variations in interlayer&#8208;coherence and band&#8208;offset&#8208;driven phase delay. Notably, at &#952;&#8211;60&#176;, only WS2/MoSe2 exhibits an anomalous 300% SHG enhancement, attributed to large phase delay and reconstruction&#8208;induced strain. Electronic bandstructure calculations support these observations. These findings offer programmable multi&#8208;moir&#233; platforms for opto&#8208;straintronics, sensing, and on&#8208;chip quantum photonics applications.

         <title>POM&#8208;Based Water Splitting Catalyst Under Acid Conditions Driven by Its Assembly on Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly&#8208;engineered POM&#8208;based electrocatalyst incorporating non&#8208;innocent counter cations exhibits fast kinetics for either the OER or HER under strongly acidic conditions (1&#160;m H2SO4), depending on whether it is assembled on carbon nanotubes (1@CNT) or physically mixed with them (1/CNT). In water&#8208;splitting tests using a two&#8208;electrode setup, these systems demonstrated significantly higher stability than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmark electrocatalysts (Pt/C and Ir/C).








Abstract
Development of efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for water electrolysis under acidic conditions is essential for sustainable hydrogen production. A novel vanadium polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based material, Na4(H2O)12[(CH2OH)3CNH3]2[V10O28]&#183;4H2O (1) is presented, incorporating non&#8208;innocent cations and whose electrocatalytic activity can be switched from the production of oxygen to hydrogen through its assembly on carbon nanotubes (CNT). A physical mixture (1/CNT) shows remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, with an overpotential of 0.34&#160;V at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, outperforming commercial IrO2 (0.45&#160;V) and approaching Ir/C (0.31&#160;V), with 80% Faradaic efficiency. In contrast, directed assembly (1@CNT) unlocks TRIS &#8314;= [(CH2OH)3CNH3]&#8314; groups functionality, enabling high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency, with an onset potential of &#8722;0.07&#160;V, close to Pt/C, and 94% Faradaic efficiency. Mechanistic studies, strongly supported by in&#8208;operando confocal microscopy and theoretical calculations, reveal that the modulation of crystal interactions and the local microenvironment is key to orchestrating the OER/HER tuning. OER is proposed to proceed via an alcohol oxidation reaction (AOR), while HER benefits from TRIS&#8314; moieties acting as a &#8220;proton sponge&#8221;. This work provides a compelling approach for rational design of bifunctional molecular electrocatalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant elements and controlled nanoassembly, with clear relevance for advancing green hydrogen production technologies.

         <title>Ultralight and Ablation&#8208;Resistant Shape&#8208;Memory Ceramizable Polymer Aerogel for Self&#8208;Adaptive Thermal Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape&#8208;memory ceramizable polymer aerogel is developed that sequentially activates shape recovery and in situ ceramization under increasing temperatures, thereby combining aerodynamic deceleration with high&#8208;temperature thermal insulation.








Abstract
Deployable thermal protection systems (DTPS) for deep&#8208;space exploration require materials that integrate lightweight design, high deformability, and extreme temperature resistance. However, existing shape memory polymers (SMPs) suffer from limited thermal stability, while shape memory ceramics (SMCs) lack rapid programmability and efficient deployment capability. To overcome these limitations, a shape&#8208;memory ceramizable polymer aerogel (SMCPA) is developed capable of sequential self&#8208;adaptive thermo&#8208;responsive behavior, enabling the integration of structural deployment and thermal protection within a single material system. Upon exposure to high temperatures, SMCPA first undergoes rapid shape recovery to increase the projected area, followed by in situ ceramization at elevated temperatures to form a continuous ablation&#8208;resistant ceramic layer.

&lt;p&gt;A shape-memory ceramizable polymer aerogel is developed that sequentially activates shape recovery and in situ ceramization under increasing temperatures, thereby combining aerodynamic deceleration with high-temperature thermal insulation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployable thermal protection systems (DTPS) for deep-space exploration require materials that integrate lightweight design, high deformability, and extreme temperature resistance. However, existing shape memory polymers (SMPs) suffer from limited thermal stability, while shape memory ceramics (SMCs) lack rapid programmability and efficient deployment capability. To overcome these limitations, a shape-memory ceramizable polymer aerogel (SMCPA) is developed capable of sequential self-adaptive thermo-responsive behavior, enabling the integration of structural deployment and thermal protection within a single material system. Upon exposure to high temperatures, SMCPA first undergoes rapid shape recovery to increase the projected area, followed by in situ ceramization at elevated temperatures to form a continuous ablation-resistant ceramic layer. The resultant SMCPA combines ultralow density (0.12 &#177; 0.02&#160;g cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), outstanding shape-memory performance (shape fixation ratio of 97.0 &#177; 0.5% and shape recovery ratio of 94.2 &#177; 0.6%), with remarkable ablation resistance (mass ablation rate of 0.012 &#177; 0.003&#160;g s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 1.5 MW m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; heat flux), outperforming conventional SMPs and SMCs in its ability to simultaneously provide programmable shape change and high-temperature stability. This study demonstrates that SMCPA successfully reconciles the conflict between lightweight deployable structures and high-temperature thermal protection, offering a promising material solution for next-generation DTPS in deep-space missions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Narrow&#8208;Emitting Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode with an Intramolecular Sensitization Mechanism by Through&#8208;Space Energy Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and narrow&#8208;emitting solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes are developed using a novel multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter operated by an intramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitized fluorescence emission mechanism.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable circularly polarized (CP) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are unique devices generating CP electroluminescence. However, the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed CP OLEDs is still low compared with vacuum&#8208;processed CP OLEDs. In this work, highly efficient and narrow&#8208;emitting solution&#8208;processed CP OLEDs are developed using a novel multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter operated by an intramolecular TADF sensitized MR&#8208;TADF emission mechanism. The CP&#8208;type MR&#8208;TADF emitter is designed to have a TADF antenna unit and a terminal MR&#8208;TADF unit connected through a planar chiral unit. The TADF antenna unit plays the role of initial exciton generator, harvesting both singlet and triplet excitons, and the exciton energy is transferred to the terminal MR&#8208;TADF unitby through&#8208;space energy transfer. As a result, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the chiral MR&#8208;TADF emitter is significantly enhanced from 16.2% of the MR&#8208;TADF emitter without the TADF antenna unit to 28.0% by solution process. The CP OLEDs showed an electroluminescence dissymmetry factor of 10&#8722;3 order, demonstrating that the molecular design is also effective to achieve highly efficient CP emission in OLED. This work establishes an effective strategy for realizing highly efficient narrowband CP electroluminescence via intramolecular TADF&#8208;sensitized MR emission.

         <title>Photochemical Anchoring of Ultrahigh&#8208;Loading Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts in MOFs for Enhanced Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a pyrolysis&#8208;free, low&#8208;temperature photochemical strategy to anchor ultrahigh&#8208;loading single&#8208;atom catalysts in meta&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Preserving structural integrity and pyridinic N sites, enables unique coordination environments (Pt&#8208;N2Cl2) for exceptional oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity and ultrasensitive biosensing.








Abstract
Achieving high metal loadings in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) remains a major challenge due to the degradation of anchoring sites during high&#8208;temperature synthesis. Here, a low&#8208;temperature photochemical reduction strategy that preserves the structural integrity of MOF and maximizes the density of unsaturated pyridinic nitrogen sites for efficient metal atom anchoring is reported. This pyrolysis&#8208;free approach enables the synthesis of SACs with record&#8208;high metal loadings, up to 20.5 wt.% for Pt, 16.9 wt.% for Ru, 15.4 wt.% for Os, 12.9 wt.% for Fe, and 9.6 wt.% for Cu, surpassing previous MOF&#8208;derived SACs by one order of magnitude. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the unique Pt&#8208;N2Cl2 coordination significantly enhances oxidase&#8208;like activity compared to conventional Pt&#8208;N3 configurations. Furthermore, the high metal loading increases the density of catalytically active sites, thereby improving overall catalytic efficiency. As a proof of concept, a Pt&#8208;SACs@MOF&#8208;based immunosensor achieves ultrasensitive detection of &#945;&#8208;fetoprotein (AFP) with a detection limit as low as 3 fg mL&#8722;1. This work offers a general and scalable strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;density SACs, addressing the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between metal loading and structural stability in MOF&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Nanoscale Synthesis for Electrocatalytic Performance: From Data&#8208;Driven Methodologies to Closed&#8208;Loop Optimization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review demonstrates how machine learning (ML) redefines the paradigm of nanoscale research by uniting data&#8208;driven modeling, synthesis control, and electrocatalytic performance. It emphasizes closed&#8208;loop strategies for precision synthesis, interpretable design, and autonomous experimentation. The review lays out a forward&#8208;looking blueprint for ML&#8209;native platforms that dynamically iterate design, validation, and inverse optimization in nanocatalyst discovery.








Abstract
The rational design of functional nanomaterials is fundamentally challenged by complex synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;performance relationships and vast design spaces that defy conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods. In particular, nanomaterials have become integral to electrocatalysis, where their tunable surface structures and quantum&#8208;scale effects govern catalytic activity and selectivity. Nevertheless, translating their intrinsic physicochemical advantages into catalytic performance remains difficult, as it requires precise control over synthetic parameters to access desired surface structures and active sites. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative framework, integrating predictive modeling, data&#8208;driven synthesis optimization, and autonomous experimentation to accelerate the discovery of high&#8208;performance nanocatalysts. This review outlines how ML provides a unified foundation for nanomaterials research by integrating data curation, algorithmic development, and application&#8208;specific modeling. It also enables controllable synthesis through reaction condition optimization, multimodal descriptor learning, and autonomous experimentation, while linking structural complexity to catalytic function via interpretable learning frameworks. Building on these capabilities, ML is redefining materials innovation through physics&#8208;informed generative models, autonomous platforms, and multiscale interpretability. These advances collectively support closed&#8208;loop, end&#8208;to&#8208;end strategies for nanocatalyst design by integrating precision synthesis, model&#8208;guided optimization, and multimodal characterization. Together, they lay the foundation for a new paradigm in the discovery of intelligent nanomaterials.

         <title>Methylation&#8208;Engineered MR&#8208;TADF Emitters for BT.2020&#8208;Compliant Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with High kRISC and ACQ Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly distorted MR&#8208;TADF emitters are developed by precise methylation of the B/N core, boosting spin&#8211;orbit coupling and suppressing ACQ. The resulting OLEDs exhibit BT.2020&#8208;compliant blue emission, record&#8208;high EQEs (up to 34.8%) with minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off, and negligible performance loss up to 10 wt% doping, representing a breakthrough toward practical deep&#8208;blue OLED applications.








Abstract
Achieving deep&#8208;blue emission with high efficiency and color purity remains a major challenge for next&#8208;generation organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), particularly those targeting the BT.2020 color standard. Herein, a methyl substitution&#8208;induced molecular distortion strategy is proposed to construct deep&#8208;blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (BN&#8208;M2 and BN&#8208;M3), that simultaneously enhance spin&#8211;orbit coupling and suppress &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Strategic methyl substitution induces significant distortion in the B/N core geometry (dihedral angle &gt; 40&#176;), boosting reverse intersystem crossing rates (up to 2.71 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1) and mitigating aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. The optimized emitters achieve narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission (Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage y coordinate, CIEy = 0.045) and near&#8208;ultraviolet emission (CIEy = 0.035), with a full width at half maximum of 22&#8211;24&#160;nm and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields (&#8776;100%). Furthermore, OLEDs show record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency with minimal roll&#8208;off: BN&#8208;M3 achieves 34.8% for BT.2020 blue emission, while BN&#8208;M2 reaches 21.4% in the near&#8208;UV spectrum, setting a new benchmark. Notably, the device performance remains stable even at high doping concentrations (up to 15 wt%). This work provides a viable pathway toward realizing BT.2020&#8208;compliant blue OLEDs with both outstanding optoelectronic performance and excellent industrial processability.

Strategic methyl substitution induces significant distortion in the B/N core geometry (dihedral angle &amp;gt; 40&#176;), boosting reverse intersystem crossing rates (up to 2.71 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and mitigating aggregation-caused quenching. The optimized emitters achieve narrowband deep-blue emission (Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage y coordinate, CIE&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.045) and near-ultraviolet emission (CIE&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.035), with a full width at half maximum of 22&#8211;24&#160;nm and near-unity photoluminescence quantum yields (&#8776;100%). Furthermore, OLEDs show record-high external quantum efficiency with minimal roll-off: &lt;b&gt;BN-M3&lt;/b&gt; achieves 34.8% for BT.2020 blue emission, while &lt;b&gt;BN-M2&lt;/b&gt; reaches 21.4% in the near-UV spectrum, setting a new benchmark. Notably, the device performance remains stable even at high doping concentrations (up to 15 wt%). This work provides a viable pathway toward realizing BT.2020-compliant blue OLEDs with both outstanding optoelectronic performance and excellent industrial processability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailored Xenogeneic&#8208;Free Polymer Surface Promotes Dynamic Migration of Intestinal Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a PoLymer&#8208;coated Ultra&#8208;stable Surface (PLUS), a nitrogen plasma&#8208;treated poly(ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate), as a stable xenogeneic&#8208;free platform for intestinal stem cell culture. PLUS enhances cell attachment, supports actin&#8208;driven migration, and retains functionality after 3 years of storage. Promoting cytoskeletal reorganization, it enables dynamic migration and wound closure, offering a scalable solution for regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Regenerative therapy employing intestinal stem cells (ISCs) holds promise for epithelial restoration. However, it requires scalable and robust, but fully defined culture platforms free of xenogeneic components. Most existing systems, however, typically rely on Matrigel, which complicates clinical translation and limits understanding of stem cell&#8208;material interactions. Here, a poly(ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate) (pEGDMA)&#8208;based synthetic culture surface is exposed to N2 plasma treatment for tailored modulation of surface properties. This modification enhances surface wettability and introduces N&#8208;containing functional groups, resulting in a PoLymer&#8208;coated Ultra&#8208;stable Surface (PLUS) that improves ISC attachment under xenogeneic&#8208;free culture conditions. Remarkably, PLUS maintains its ISC&#8208;supportive function even after 3 years of ambient storage. Gene expression and proteomic analyses reveal upregulation of factors involved in actin dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization. Consistently, colonies on PLUS exhibit a broader migratory range, with a 1.8&#8208;fold increase in migration speed compared to pristine pEGDMA. Small&#8208;molecule perturbation assays confirm the involvement of cytoskeletal remodelling by mediating ISC&#8208;substrate interaction. Furthermore, PLUS supports dynamic, actin&#8208;dependent migration, enabling up to 46.7% wound closure within 144&#160;h. These findings demonstrate that PLUS engages cytoskeletal machinery as a central mediator of ISC&#8208;substrate interaction, in part by promoting actin&#8208;dependent cytoskeletal reorganization, positioning it as a scalable, translational platform for ISC&#8208;based regenerative medicine.

         <title>A Spin&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme Overcomes the Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;Off for Sustainable Adhesive Production From Lignin Biomass Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the multispin&#8208;state characteristics of natural laccase's multicopper centers, a 2D copper&#8208;based MOF is developed with optimal laccase&#8208;like activity, named COHBLO. This nanozyme selectively degrades lignin into uniform, hydroxyl&#8208;rich products. Through a ring&#8208;opening reaction between the hydroxyl and epoxy groups, a high&#8208;strength, eco&#8208;friendly lignin&#8208;based wood adhesive is successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Lignin, a major component of plant cell walls, is the most abundant source of natural aromatic polymers. Efficient production of its valuable degradation products requires highly selective catalysts. This study introduces a spin&#8208;state&#8208;modulated nanozyme system for precise lignin depolymerization into targeted biobased chemicals. Precise copper spin state control in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) copper&#8208;based metal organic framework (MOF) nanozymes, achieved via redox treatment and ligand exchange modulation, replicates natural laccase multicopper center spin synergy. Integrated experiments and theory reveal a volcano&#8208;shaped spin state&#8208;activity correlation, enabling synthesis of optimized nanozyme Cu(OH)2BDC&#8208;LA&#8208;OAc (COHBLO). This material demonstrates exceptional laccase&#8208;mimicking activity, with a peak reaction rate 70 times higher than natural laccase and a 5.14&#8208;fold specific activity increase. Through laccase&#8208;like catalysis, it selectively cleaves lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages, directionally yielding fragments rich in phenolic hydroxyl groups. Their efficient reaction with epoxy groups produces a nanolignin&#8208;based epoxy adhesive. Featuring a three&#8208;dimensional cross&#8208;linked network, this adhesive delivers superior bonding under varied conditions. Its shear strength significantly surpasses commercial phenolic resins while eliminating conventional adhesive formaldehyde emissions. This study advances 2D MOF nanozyme design and establishes an integrated pathway from controlled lignin depolymerization to high&#8208;performance adhesive production, providing key theoretical and practical foundations for biomass valorization and sustainable adhesive development.

         <title>Engineered Cryo&#8208;Shocked Cancer Cells Deliver Dual&#8208;Function Gene Medicines for Melanoma Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering integrated platform for melanoma immunotherapy is presented using cryo&#8208;shocked cancer cells as a targeted &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; delivery system. This nanocarrier transports a novel dual&#8208;function plasmid that co&#8208;delivers the chemokine CXCL9 and a PCSK9 adenine base editor, synergistically enhancing T&#8208;cell infiltration and activation to achieve strong antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Immunotherapies for melanoma are frequently hindered by resistance to immune checkpoint blockade and poor infiltration of T cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME). To overcome these limitations,&#160;a novel dual&#8208;function plasmid is designed, termed CXCL9&#8208;ABEPCSK9, that combines adenine base editing to knock down PCSK9 (a newly identified immunosuppressive factor that impairs CD8&#8314; T cell activity) with overexpression of the chemokine CXCL9, known for its role in recruiting T cells. The plasmid is first encapsulated into a liposome and then loaded on the liquid nitrogen&#8208;treated (LNT) tumor cells, generating LNT@LipoC9AP particles. These LNT cells maintain structural integrity and tumor&#8208;homing properties, functioning as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; delivery system, while losing pathogenicity. It is find that LNT@LipoC9AP effectively increased CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration and exhibited potent antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. To further improve tumor targeting, LNT@LipoC9AP is engineered by decorating the LNT cell surface with RGD4C peptides, yielding R&#8208;LNT@LipoC9AP, which targets &#945;v&#946;3 integrins commonly overexpressed in melanoma. R&#8208;LNT@LipoC9AP demonstrated superior tumor accumulation, enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and a favorable safety profile. Altogether, the LNT cell&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery system for CXCL9 and ABEPCSK9 overcomes the limitations of current tumor immunotherapy and may serve as a promising gene therapy strategy for solid tumors treatment.

         <title>Green Porphyrin Interface Anchoring Enables &gt;24% Efficiency in n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Minimodules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates an environmentally benign interfacial engineering strategy based on dual&#8208;sided chemical coordination, providing a promising pathway toward scalable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency perovskite optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Scaling of n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite photovoltaics to large&#8208;area modules is impeded by intensified nonradiative recombination at the buried interface of perovskite and electron transport layer, resulting in severe carrier transport losses. Therefore, effective and environmentally benign interfacial modifiers are urgently required. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable tetrasulfonated porphyrin interlayer with a strong dipole moment and multiple coordination sites is designed, which can be vertically anchored at the SnO2/perovskite interface via a simple water&#8208;based post&#8208;treatment. Two sulfonic acid groups form robust bonds with Sn atoms in SnO2, while the remaining two coordinate with Pb in the perovskite lattice, passivating interfacial defects. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing character of sulfonic acid groups imparts the porphyrin with a pronounced intrinsic dipole moment (10.12 D), which significantly promotes rapid and efficient electron extraction and transport from perovskite to SnO2. Consequently, the treated perovskite modules deliver a power conversion efficiency of 24.49% (certified 23.95%), ranking among the highest reported, while small&#8208;area devices reach 26.66%. Notably, after more than 1500&#160;h of maximum power point tracking, the treated device preserves 90% of its initial efficiency. This study demonstrates an environmentally benign interfacial engineering strategy based on dual&#8208;sided chemical coordination, providing a promising pathway toward scalable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Measuring Zn Transference with Precision: Insights for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anodes (Adv. Mater. 46/2025)</title>

Measuring Zn Transference
This study shows that Zn ion transport critically governs Zn battery performance. While adding potassium co&#8208;salt boosts conductivity, it lowers Zn ion transference, causing concentration gradients and unstable plating (dendrites). Conversely, higher Zn ion transport facilitates uniform deposits and durable cycling &#8212; highlighting that conductivity alone cannot guarantee dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes. More details can be found in the Research Article by Maria R. Lukatskaya and co&#8208;workers (10.1002/adma.202502245).

         <title>Toward Zero&#8208;Excess Alkali Metal Batteries: Bridging Experimental and Computational Insights</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores zero&#8208;excess alkali metal batteries, highlighting anode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces, metal nucleation, dendrite growth, and SEI formation while comparing Li, Na, and K metals. It critically examines electrolyte and separator roles, emphasizing substrate design, electrolyte modifications, interfacial engineering, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Experimental and computational advancements are integrated to guide future developments.








Abstract
This review introduces alkali metal (Li, Na, and K) anode&#8208;less and anode&#8208;free batteries and conveys a synopsis of the current challenges regarding anode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. The review focuses on a critical analysis of the fundamental understanding of the (eletro)chemical and (electro)physical processes occurring at the anode, including metal nucleation and dendrite growth, the properties of liquid and solid electrolytes, and their roles in the metal stripping/deposition process and the formation of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, and the properties of separators and their role in inhibiting dendrite growth. Solutions to tackle the challenges for anode&#8208;less and anode&#8208;free batteries are discussed extensively in the aspects of the modifications of the anode substrate, novel electrolyte solutions and SEI structures, interface design, and novel separators/solid&#8208;state electrolytes to enable stable battery performances. To highlight the importance of bridging experimental and computational insights, experimental progress derived from a range of advanced characterization techniques is analyzed in combination with the advancement in multi&#8208;scale theory and computational modeling. Finally, outlooks are provided from both experimental and computational points of view for the exciting field of zero&#8208;excess alkali metal batteries.

Transition metal ions migration is the fundamental science for layered oxides of Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries and demands more efforts in this direction. In this review, the Ni, Co, Mn, Fe, Cr, and V ions migration in layered oxides, covering the key thermodynamic and kinetic factors, universal and specific migration characteristics, effects on the electrochemical performance, optimization strategies, and characterization techniques, are comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries are promising systems for powering electric vehicles and grid storage. Layered 3d transition metal oxides AxTMO2 (A = Li, Na; TM = 3d transition metals; 0&#160;&lt;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;2) have drawn extensive attention as cathode materials due to their exceptional energy densities. However, they suffer from several technical challenges caused by crystal structure degradation associated with TM ions migration, such as poor cycling stability, inferior rate capability, significant voltage hysteresis, and serious voltage decay. Aiming to tackle these challenges, this review provides an in&#8208;depth discussion and comprehensive understanding of the TM ions migration behaviors in AxTMO2. First, the key thermodynamics and kinetics that impact TM ions migration are discussed, covering ionic radius, electronic configuration, crystal structure arrangement, and migration energy barrier. In particular, details are provided regarding the universal and specific migration characteristics of Ni, Co, Mn, Fe, Cr, and V ions in layered cathode materials. Subsequently, the impacts of these migrations on electrochemical performance are emphasized in terms of the fundamental science behind technical issues, and strategies to modulate TM ions migration for advanced cathode materials development are summarized. Besides, characterization techniques for probing the TM ions migration are present, like neutron diffraction (ND), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and others. Finally, future directions in this regard are comprehensively concluded. This review offers valuable insights into the basic design of advanced layered oxide cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Functional Hydrogels for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries: Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the role of functional hydrogels in advancing aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs), focusing on essential properties like mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and degradability. Integration challenges, modification strategies, and future directions for hydrogels to support AZB commercialization and bridge the gap between academic research and industrial applications are highlighted.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) hold great potential for green grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their affordability, resource abundance, safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their practical deployment is hindered by challenges related to the electrode, electrolyte, and interface. Functional hydrogels offer a promising solution to address such challenges owing to their broad electrochemical window, tunable structures, and pressure&#8208;responsive mechanical properties. In this review, the key properties that functional hydrogels must possess for advancing AZBs, including mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, swelling behavior, and degradability, from a perspective of the full life cycle of hydrogels in AZBs are summarized. Current modification strategies aimed at enhancing these properties and improving AZB performance are also explored. The challenges and design considerations for integrating functional hydrogels with electrodes and interface are discussed. In the end, the limitations and future directions for hydrogels to bridge the gap between academia and industries for the successful deployment of AZBs are discussed.

         <dc:description>
Significant progress is made in PIBs over the past decade, but the improvements based on half&#8208;cell testing, low mass loading, and low energy density are insufficient for practical applications. This review summarizes the challenges and strategies for PIBs, highlights the importance of further research focusing on full cells, and provides an analysis of their practical application potential.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), with abundant resources and low cost, are considered as a promising alternative to commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale applications. Over the past decade, significant academic progresses are made in the development of PIBs, including advancements in cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes. However, most improvements are achieved under laboratory conditions (e.g., K metal&#8208;based half&#8208;cells and low mass loading of active materials), and the performance of PIBs in full cells is still far from the requirements for commercial applications. A critical insight bridging the academic research and the commercialization of PIBs is urgently needed to guide future research in this field. This review will discuss the challenges and improvement strategies in the development of PIBs, focusing on the potential practical cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes, as well as their performance in full cells. It aims to give the readers a clear and logical understanding of the development of PIBs. The application analysis is also discussed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the commercialization potential of PIBs. Finally, perspectives are provided for the future development of PIBs.

         <title>Recent Advances in Scalable, High&#8208;Mass Loaded Electrodes for Grid&#8208;Scale Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increased reliance on renewable energy requires enhanced grid&#8208;scale energy storage. The subject of this review, the high mass loading of electrodes, is critical for determining manufacturing costs. Several of the reviewed fabrication techniques surpass the mass loading of conventional electrodes and achieve values above 100&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. These results represent an important step towards meeting future demands for grid storage.








Abstract
The increasing electrification of daily life as well as the intermittent characteristic of renewable energy sources require viable solutions for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Critical considerations for grid storage applications are electrode mass loading and electrode thickness as these features govern battery pack energy density, an important factor in determining manufacturing costs. For this reason, there is increased interest in finding new ways of creating electrodes with high mass loading. In this review, various high&#8208;mass loading fabrication approaches are considered for positive electrode materials used in batteries. The benchmark used for high mass loading is above 20&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is higher than the practical limit of conventional tape&#8208;cast electrodes. Several different electrode approaches are described including templating, laser patterning, direct ink writing, and electrodeposition. A variety of materials are covered with the most prominent being LiFe(PO4) (LFP), LiCoO2(LCO), and MnO2. In research to date, scalable electrochemical performance has been achieved with mass loadings over 100&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. Areal capacities as high as 14.7&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.82&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 have been achieved in non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes and 9.8&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in aqueous electrolytes. These results establish that the mass loading of electrodes can be scaled up without compromising their electrochemical properties.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities for Rechargeable Aqueous Sn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable aqueous batteries with metal anodes promise enhanced energy density, combining higher output voltage and capacity with high safety. This perspective highlights the emerging potential of the Sn metal anode, emphasizing its resistance to hydrogen evolution, high reversibility, and sustainability. Key challenges, including dead Sn formation and electrolyte evolution, as well as innovative design strategies for robust Sn&#8208;based batteries are also discussed. The development of Sn metal batteries could contribute to a sustainable society.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries based on metallic anodes hold tremendous potential of high energy density enabled by the combination of relatively low working potential and large capacity while retaining the intrinsic safety nature and economical value of aqueous systems; However, the realization of these promised advantages relies on the identification of an ideal metal anode chemistry with all these merits. In this review, the emerging Sn metal anode chemistry is examined as such an anode candidate in both acidic and alkaline media, where the inertness of Sn toward hydrogen evolution, flat low voltage profile, and low polarization make it a unique metal anode for aqueous batteries. From a panoramic viewpoint, the key challenges and detrimental issues of Sn metal batteries are discussed, including dead Sn formation, self&#8208;discharge, and electrolyte degradation, as well as strategies for mitigating these issues by constructing robust Sn anodes. New design approaches for more durable and reliable Sn metal batteries are also discussed, with the aim of fully realizing the potential of Sn anode chemistry.

Abstract
Traditional aqueous electrolytes have a limited electrochemical stability window due to the decomposition voltage of water (&#8776;1.23&#160;V). &#8220;Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; (WIS) electrolytes, which expand the stability window of aqueous electrolytes from 1.23 to 3&#160;V and spark a global surge of research in aqueous batteries, are developed. This breakthrough reveals novel aspects of solvation structure, ion transport mechanisms, and interfacial properties in WIS electrolytes, marking the start of a new era in solution chemistry that extends beyond traditional dilute electrolytes and has implications across electrolyte research. This review presents the current mechanistic understanding of WIS electrolytes and their derivative designs, focusing on the construction of solvation structures. The insights gained and limitations encountered in bulk solvation structure engineering are further discussed. Finally, future directions beyond WIS for advancing aqueous electrolyte design are proposed.

         <title>Disordered Rocksalts as High&#8208;Energy and Earth&#8208;Abundant Li&#8208;Ion Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disordered rocksalts with lithium excess (DRX) offer a new direction in Li&#8208;ion cathode design beyond conventional Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;based materials. This review highlights the design principles, synthesis strategies, and performance optimization of DRX oxides and oxyfluorides for energy&#8208;dense, sustainable batteries using Earth&#8208;abundant transition metals and tailored cation disorder.









Abstract
To address the growing demand for energy and support the shift toward transportation electrification and intermittent renewable energy, there is an urgent need for low&#8208;cost, energy&#8208;dense electrical storage. Research on Li&#8208;ion electrode materials has predominantly focused on ordered materials with well&#8208;defined lithium diffusion channels, limiting cathode design to resource&#8208;constrained Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;based oxides and lower&#8208;energy polyanion compounds. Recently, disordered rocksalts with lithium excess (DRX) have demonstrated high capacity and energy density when lithium excess and/or local ordering allow statistical percolation of lithium sites through the structure. This cation disorder can be induced by high temperature synthesis or mechanochemical synthesis methods for a broad range of compositions. DRX oxides and oxyfluorides containing Earth&#8208;abundant transition metals have been prepared using various synthesis routes, including solid&#8208;state, molten&#8208;salt, and sol&#8208;gel reactions. This review outlines DRX design principles and explains the effect of synthesis conditions on cation disorder and short&#8208;range cation ordering (SRO), which determines the cycling stability and rate capability. In addition, strategies to enhance Li transport and capacity retention with Mn&#8208;rich DRX possessing partial spinel&#8208;like ordering are discussed. Finally, the review considers the optimization of carbon and electrolyte in DRX materials and addresses key challenges and opportunities for commercializing DRX cathodes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the growing demand for energy and support the shift toward transportation electrification and intermittent renewable energy, there is an urgent need for low-cost, energy-dense electrical storage. Research on Li-ion electrode materials has predominantly focused on ordered materials with well-defined lithium diffusion channels, limiting cathode design to resource-constrained Ni- and Co-based oxides and lower-energy polyanion compounds. Recently, disordered rocksalts with lithium excess (DRX) have demonstrated high capacity and energy density when lithium excess and/or local ordering allow statistical percolation of lithium sites through the structure. This cation disorder can be induced by high temperature synthesis or mechanochemical synthesis methods for a broad range of compositions. DRX oxides and oxyfluorides containing Earth-abundant transition metals have been prepared using various synthesis routes, including solid-state, molten-salt, and sol-gel reactions. This review outlines DRX design principles and explains the effect of synthesis conditions on cation disorder and short-range cation ordering (SRO), which determines the cycling stability and rate capability. In addition, strategies to enhance Li transport and capacity retention with Mn-rich DRX possessing partial spinel-like ordering are discussed. Finally, the review considers the optimization of carbon and electrolyte in DRX materials and addresses key challenges and opportunities for commercializing DRX cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Measuring Zn Transference with Precision: Insights for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>A modified Hittorf method reveals how co&#8208;salt composition affects Zn2+ transference numbers. Coupled with molecular dynamics and spectroscopy, we shows that electrolytes with high Zn transference number (tZn) suppress dendrites, enabling longer high&#8208;rate cycling and more stable Zn&#8208;metal anodes.


Abstract
Electrolyte engineering in Zn&#8208;metal batteries frequently employs alkaline metal salts to enhance conductivity and reduce overpotential for Zn plating. While these additives improve conductivity, the presence of more mobile alkali cations can negatively affect the Zn2+ transference number. Optimizing this property is crucial for high&#8208;rate performance, efficiency, and safety, as high Zn2+ transference number minimizes concentration polarization and dendrite formation during high&#8208;current cycling. However, reliably measuring the transference number in non&#8208;binary electrolytes presents significant experimental challenges due to dynamic Zn metal interfaces, rendering traditional methods ineffective. Here, we use a modified Hittorf&#8208;type method to measure Zn2+ transference numbers in complex electrolytes. Supported by molecular dynamics&#160;simulations, this method is applied to obtain transference numbers of Zn2+, K+, and acetate ions in Zn&#8208;K acetate electrolytes. By varying the Zn2+ fraction, the impact of co&#8208;salts on transport properties is studied and correlated with the Zn solvation environment using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. It is revealed that while ionic conductivity increases with the addition of KOAc co&#8208;salt, the Zn2+ transference number dramatically decreases. Electrolytes with higher Zn2+ transference numbers enable longer high&#8208;rate cycling, underscoring the importance of optimizing Zn2+ transference for improved performance of Zn&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>A Disordered Rock Salt Anode for Long&#8208;Lived All&#8208;Vanadium Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;vanadium sodium&#8208;ion battery using a novel disordered rock salt anode, DRS&#8208;NVO, delivers long life, fast charging, and high efficiency. This system retains 80% capacity after 3&#160;000 cycles, with over 93% energy efficiency. Combining low&#8208;cost materials with stable performance, it presents a scalable and recyclable solution for future grid&#8208;level energy storage.








Abstract
Rechargeable batteries wherein both the cathode and the anode are vanadium&#8208;based phases are promising grid&#8208;energy storage candidates, offering long cycle life and easy recycling. However, their system&#8208;level energy density must be improved to lower their footprint and operating costs. In this work, an all&#8208;vanadium sodium&#8208;ion battery that uses a new disordered rock salt (DRS) anode, Na3V2O5 (DRS&#8208;NVO), is proposed. For DRS&#8208;NVO, &#8776;2 Na+ ions can be reversibly cycled at &#8776;0.7&#160;V versus Na/Na+. Structural characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis reveal increased local distortions during Na+ insertion but the overall DRS structure is maintained. The material shows exceptional stability and rate capability, achieving 10&#160;000 cycles in half&#8208;cell tests at rates of up to 20 C. Molecular dynamics simulations produce voltage profiles and ion diffusivities in good agreement with experimental results. Pairing the DRS&#8208;NVO anode with a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode yields a cell (NVO|NVP) voltage of 2.7&#160;V, with symmetric voltage profiles and an energy efficiency &gt;93%. This all&#8208;vanadium sodium&#8208;ion battery exhibits excellent cycling stability, retaining 80% of its capacity after 3&#160;000 cycles. Levelized cost&#8208;of&#8208;storage (LCOS) evaluations based on a cell design model confirm the cost&#8208;effectiveness, positioning NVO|NVP as a competitive grid&#8208;scale energy storage solution.

         <title>FeNb2O6 as a High&#8208;Performance Anode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Structural Amorphization Coupled with NbO6 Local Ordering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeNb2O6 is applied for the first time as a high&#8208;performance anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The presence of iron disrupts the long&#8208;range order by local disorder of the FeO6 octahedra during initial sodiation. Simultaneously, the formation of short&#8208;range ordered zigzag&#8208;chain structures within the NbO6 planes establishes a robust intercalation host that maintains abundant active sites for pseudocapacitive intercalation and enhanced ion&#8208;diffusion pathways.








Abstract
Pseudocapacitance&#8208;type transition metal oxides have been extensively investigated as anodes&#160;for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Currently, they are also gaining attention&#160;for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low volume change and safety. However, their performance in sodium storage remains limited, primarily due to the larger Na+ ion radius. Here, for the first time, an iron niobate is reported with a columbite structure as a high&#8208;performance sodium storage anode. The presence of iron triggers&#160;the loss of long&#8208;range order through disorder of the FeO6 octahedra local structure, subsequently allowing reversible sodium storage in an amorphous phase. Simultaneously, the formation of short&#8208;range ordered zigzag&#8208;chain structures within the NbO6 planes creates a &#8220;skeleton&#8221; that offers abundant active sites for pseudocapacitive ion storage and enhanced ion diffusion pathways. These characteristics of FeNb2O6 make it an effective intercalation host, offering high capacity along with fast Na+ kinetics, as demonstrated through operando and ex situ characterizations. It leads to an applicable reversible capacity (&gt;300 mAh g&#8722;1) with a favorable average voltage of &#8776;0.6&#160;V and excellent rate capability (180.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at a current density of 2 A g&#8722;1). This study provides insights into the development of intrinsically active transition metal oxides for Na+&#8208;ion intercalation.

         <title>Ultrahigh Plateau&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage by Plugging Open Pores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh&#8208;plateau&#8208;capacity (490 mAh g&#8722;1 below 0.25 V) hard carbon is synthesized through chemical activation of biomass wastes and subsequent catalytic decomposition of industrial&#8208;grade solvents (here acetonitrile). The detailed structure&#8211;property&#8208;performance relationship is articulated.








Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) stands out as the most promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), and a precise adjustment of the pore structure is the key to achieving high plateau&#8208;capacity. In this work, composite hard carbon is developed by integrating graphitic carbon with biomass waste (banana peel)&#8208;derived activated carbon (AC). In this design, N&#8208;doped pseudographite layer is stacked at the entrance of open pores, forming a long&#8208;range graphitic layer without excessive graphitization. As a result, the surface area of AC is decreased by 170 times down to less than 10&#160;m3 g&#8722;1, and the corresponding open pores are in situ converted into closed pores. In an optimized electrolyte solvation structure, the obtained HC anode achieves the reversible sodium&#8208;storage capacity up to 524 mAh g&#8722;1. In particular, a large portion of the capacity (490 mAh g&#8722;1) lies below the plateau of 0.25&#160;V, which originates from the pore&#8208;filling mechanism as revealed by in situ Raman. This study provides a straightforward method to modulate the pore structure of carbon materials, and an energy&#8208;efficient (900 &#176;C) synthesis for HC compared to traditional high&#8208;temperature routes (e.g., &#8776;1300&#8211;2000 &#176;C).

&lt;p&gt;An ultrahigh-plateau-capacity (490 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; below 0.25 V) hard carbon is synthesized through chemical activation of biomass wastes and subsequent catalytic decomposition of industrial-grade solvents (here acetonitrile). The detailed structure&#8211;property-performance relationship is articulated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard carbon (HC) stands out as the most promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and a precise adjustment of the pore structure is the key to achieving high plateau-capacity. In this work, composite hard carbon is developed by integrating graphitic carbon with biomass waste (banana peel)-derived activated carbon (AC). In this design, N-doped pseudographite layer is stacked at the entrance of open pores, forming a long-range graphitic layer without excessive graphitization. As a result, the surface area of AC is decreased by 170 times down to less than 10&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the corresponding open pores are in situ converted into closed pores. In an optimized electrolyte solvation structure, the obtained HC anode achieves the reversible sodium-storage capacity up to 524 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In particular, a large portion of the capacity (490 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) lies below the plateau of 0.25&#160;V, which originates from the pore-filling mechanism as revealed by in situ Raman. This study provides a straightforward method to modulate the pore structure of carbon materials, and an energy-efficient (900 &#176;C) synthesis for HC compared to traditional high-temperature routes (e.g., &#8776;1300&#8211;2000 &#176;C).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Untangling the Role of Capping Agents in Manipulating Electrochemical Behaviors Toward Practical Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the critical role of capping agents in nanomaterials synthesis and bulk crystal growth, the role of capping agents in manipulating the electrochemical behaviors of AZIBs is untangled. The multifunctional role of the capping agents in terms of the Zn anode, electrolyte, and cathode validates stable and practical AZIBs.








Abstract
Long&#8208;standing challenges including notorious side reactions at the Zn anode, low Zn anode utilization, and rapid cathode degradation at low current densities hinder the advancement of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Inspired by the critical role of capping agents in nanomaterials synthesis and bulk crystal growth, a series of capping agents are employed to demonstrate their applicability in AZIBs. Here, it is shown that the preferential adsorption of capping agents on different Zn crystal planes, coordination between capping agents and Zn2+ ions, and interactions with metal oxide cathodes enable preferred Zn (002) deposition, water&#8208;deficient Zn2+ ion solvation structure, and a dynamic cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Benefiting from the multi&#8208;functional role of capping agents, dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating and stripping with an improved Coulombic efficiency of 99.2% and enhanced long&#8208;term cycling stability are realized. Remarkable capacity retention of 91% is achieved for cathodes after more than 500 cycles under a low current density of 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1, marking one of the best cycling stabilities to date. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of capping agents in manipulating electrochemical behaviors, which should inspire and pave a new avenue of research to address the challenges in practical energy storage beyond AZIBs.

         <title>Edge Electron Effect Induced High&#8208;Entropy SEI for Durable Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The specific facet boundary and electron&#8208;donating property of flower edges zinc&#8208;modified aluminum substrate (E&#8208;Zn@Al) enhances anion adsorption onto the inner Helmholtz plane and accelerates anion/solvent decomposition. This process results in a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase layer with high&#8208;entropy discrete multicomponent distribution, and ensures high&#8208;density sodium nucleation and pyknotic growth. Anode&#8208;free sodium batteries exhibit high stability under ultrahigh cathode loading.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries represent great promising as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and resource&#8208;rich electrochemical energy storage systems. However, the savage growth of sodium metal and continuous consumption hinder its stable capacity output. Herein, ordered flower&#8208;edges of zinc on Al substrate can induce high&#8208;entropy solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to adjust sodium uniform deposition and extremely reduce electrolyte consumption with ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (97.05%) for prolong batteries cycling life. Theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the electron&#8208;donating property and exposed edge sites between (100) and (101) facets in zinc flower enhance anion adsorption onto the inner Helmholtz plane accelerating its interface decomposition. Additionally, the ordered zinc edges serve as homogeneous&#8208;nucleating template, leading to thin and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI layer (18 nm, ZnF2, NaZn13, NaF, and Na2CO3) with high&#8208;entropy discrete multicomponent distribution, so that fast and high&#8208;flux Na ions transport field, thereby reducing the critical nucleation barrier and promoting sodium high density nucleation (7.36 &#215; 1013 N cm&#8722;2) and pyknotic growth (3 mAh cm&#8722;2, 22&#160;&#181;m). The assembled anode&#8208;free sodium batteries exhibit high stability (86%, 90 cycles) under ultrahigh cathode loading (32 mg cm&#8722;2). Moreover, the anode&#8208;less single&#8208;layer pouch batteries exhibit a durable capacity retention of 99% after 600 cycles.

         <title>Expandable Fast Li&#8208;Ion Diffusion Network of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Oxides via Single&#8208;Layer LiCo(Ni)O2 Segregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;layer LiCo(Ni)O2 segregation layers are uniformly distributed within the Li2MnO3 domains of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2, initially forming a homogeneous dual&#8208;phase structure. These segregation layers create a fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion network. Furthermore, they help to uniformly divide the large Li2MnO3 domains into nano&#8208;sized islands, effectively preventing the formation of oxygen percolation networks and enhancing the stability of anion redox reactions.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode materials exhibit a remarkable reversible specific capacity exceeding 250 mAh g&#8722;1, positioning them as the preferred choice for the next generation of high&#8208;energy density lithium&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. However, their inferior rate and cycling performance pose significant challenges. In this context, a Li&#8208;rich material incorporating an expanded fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion network has been successfully synthesized. This advancement involves the introduction of a single&#8208;layer of LiCo(Ni)O2 with high Li&#8208;ion diffusion coefficients into the crystal structure of Li&#8208;rich cathode, thereby enhancing the rate performance, achieving an impressive capacity of 212 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C. Furthermore, the single&#8208;layer LiCo(Ni)O2 can effectively isolates Li2MnO3 phase domains, thereby enhancing the structural stability during the anion redox process, consequently extending the electrochemical stability limits. Operating within a voltage range of 2.1&#8211;4.6&#160;V, the capacity retention reaches 80% after 400 cycles, with a voltage decay of merely 0.74&#160;mV per cycle. This innovative utilization of an expanded fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion network provides invaluable insights that will guide the development of strategies aimed at unlocking rate capability in layered oxide cathode materials.

         <title>All&#8208;Climate Energy&#8208;Dense Cascade Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries Enabled by a Polycationic Hydrogel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries is seriously restricted by their low energy density and poor temperature tolerance. Herein, a temperature&#8208;insensitive polycationic hydrogel electrolyte borax&#8208;bacterial cellulose / p(AM&#8208;co&#8208;VBIMBr) (denoted as BAVBr) is designed to realize an energy&#8208;dense Zn&#8208;I2 battery with cascade I0/I&#8722;, I+/I0, and Br0/Br&#8722; redox couples over a widen temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The practical development of aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries is greatly hindered by the low energy density resulting from conventional I0/I&#8722; conversion and the limited temperature tolerance. Here, a temperature&#8208;insensitive polycationic hydrogel electrolyte borax&#8208;bacterial cellulose / p(AM&#8208;co&#8208;VBIMBr) (denoted as BAVBr) for achieving an energy&#8208;dense cascade aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 battery over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C is designed. A comprehensive investigation, combining advanced spectroscopic investigation and DFT calculations, has revealed that the presence of Br species in the gel electrolyte facilitates the conversion reaction of Br0/Br&#8722;. Simultaneously, it activates the high voltage I+/I0 redox reaction through interhalogen formation. Consequently, sequential and highly reversible redox reactions involving I0/I&#8722;, I+/I0, and Br0/Br&#8722; are achieved with the assistance of &#8722;NR3+ units in BAVBr, effectively suppressing interhalogen hydrolysis in aqueous electrolyte. The cascade reactions lead to a high area capacity of 0.76 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a low I2 loading of 1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 or 760 mAh g&#8722;1 based on the mass of iodine, demonstrating exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C. This study offers valuable insights into the rational design of electrolytes for high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries, specifically tailored for wide&#8208;temperature operation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical development of aqueous zinc-iodine (Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries is greatly hindered by the low energy density resulting from conventional I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; conversion and the limited temperature tolerance. Here, a temperature-insensitive polycationic hydrogel electrolyte borax-bacterial cellulose / &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;(AM-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-VBIMBr) (denoted as BAVBr) for achieving an energy-dense cascade aqueous Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C is designed. A comprehensive investigation, combining advanced spectroscopic investigation and DFT calculations, has revealed that the presence of Br species in the gel electrolyte facilitates the conversion reaction of Br&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Simultaneously, it activates the high voltage I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; redox reaction through interhalogen formation. Consequently, sequential and highly reversible redox reactions involving I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, and Br&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; are achieved with the assistance of &#8722;NR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; units in BAVBr, effectively suppressing interhalogen hydrolysis in aqueous electrolyte. The cascade reactions lead to a high area capacity of 0.76 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a low I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loading of 1&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 760 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; based on the mass of iodine, demonstrating exceptional long-term cycling stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Doped Sodium Vanadate Cathode for Improved Zn Ion Diffusion Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;doping strategy is developed to modify the Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, effectively reducing the electrostatic interaction between zinc ions and the host structure. This modification enables faster diffusion and higher storage capacity of zinc ions.








Abstract
The electrostatic interaction between zinc ions and the host structure significantly limits the practicality of vanadium&#8208;based cathodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, an anion doping strategy is demonstrated to mitigate electrostatic resistance and steric hindrance during zinc ion insertion by incorporating iodine atoms into the lattice of the cathode material, Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O. Iodine doping reduces the adsorption energy at the most stable site, thereby weakening the Zn2+&#8208;host interaction and lowering the Zn2+ diffusion energy barrier, resulting in a one&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in the diffusion coefficient. Moreover, the large atomic size of iodine expands the host lattice, creating ample space for increased zinc ion storage capacity, further supported by the introduced oxygen vacancies. As a result, the iodine&#8208;doped Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O cathode achieves an impressive specific capacity of 528.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and retains 262&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 12,000 cycles at a high current rate of 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance cathode materials for AZIBs.

         <title>Structural Modulation of Cu&#8208;Mn&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogs for Practical Sodium Ion Cylinder Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective ternary Prussian blue analog is synthesized via structural regulation to achieve the compatibility of high capacity and long lifespan for sodium&#8208;ion batteries within a wide temperature range. Mn and Cu synergistically enhances conductivity, operating voltage, and stability, suppressing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions. This design enables high&#8208;loading 18650&#8208;type cells with exceptional electrochemical performance, supporting grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective cathodes are essential for grid&#8208;scale sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have shown great potential as SIB cathodes, but achieving both high capacity and long lifespan remains challenging. In this study, a series of low&#8208;cost ternary PBAs synthesized through structural regulation is presented to simultaneously achieve high capacity, stable cycling performance, and broad temperature adaptability. Among them, CuHCF&#8208;3 demonstrates a specific capacity of 132.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with 73.3% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. In&#8208;depth analyses, using in situ techniques and density functional theory calculations, reveal a highly reversible three&#8208;phase transition (monoclinic &#8596; cubic &#8596; tetragonal) in Na1.96Cu0.45Mn0.55[Fe(CN)6]0.91&#183;&#9633;0.09&#183;2.14H2O (CuHCF&#8208;3), which is driven by synergistic interactions between Mn and Cu. Mn enhances conductivity, increases the operating voltage, and introduces additional redox centers, while Cu mitigates the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions associated with Mn and buffers volume changes during cycling. This structural synergy results in excellent temperature stability across a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 55&#160;&#176;C). 18650&#8208;type cylindrical cells based on CuHCF&#8208;3 with high loading density achieve 73.54% capacity retention over 850 cycles. This study offers valuable insights for designing durable, high&#8208;capacity electrode materials for SIB energy storage applications.

         <title>Hyper&#8208;Crosslinking to Customize Ultrathin&#8208;Wall Closed Pores in Pitch&#8208;Derived Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative hyper&#8208;crosslinking strategy to molecularly reconstruct pitch and precisely tailor the closed&#8208;pore structure of derived carbon. This strategy enables the structure transition from graphitic soft carbon to highly disordered carbon with abundant closed&#8208;pore featuring appropriate pore sizes (2&#160;nm) and ultrathin pore walls (1&#8211;2 layers). This work advances the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance carbon materials.








Abstract
Pitch is a highly preferable and cost&#8208;effective precursor of carbon materials. Nevertheless, its direct pyrolysis typically yields highly graphitized soft carbon, posing challenges to the modulation of closed&#8208;pore architecture, due to intense intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This results in a negligible plateau capacity and sluggish diffusion kinetics in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). In this study, an innovative hyper&#8208;crosslinking strategy is proposed to reconstruct pitch molecularly and precisely tailor the closed&#8208;pore structure of the derived carbon. The crosslinker intertwined the pitch units, transforming the linear molecules into 3D porous polymers. Structurally, these 3D cavities tactfully reserved space for forming closed&#8208;pore cores, with the single&#8208;layer pitch network skeleton transforming into ultrathin pore walls upon carbonization. This strategy enabled the disruption of intense &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and, therefore, inhibited structural ordering, facilitating a structure transition from graphitic soft carbon to highly&#8208;disordered carbon with abundant closed pores featuring appropriate pore sizes (2&#160;nm) and ultrathin pore walls (1&#8211;2 layers). The optimal sample delivered a high capacity of 370&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 30&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, as well as a rate capability that surpassed those of most previously reported pitch&#8208;derived carbons. Hyper&#8208;crosslinking has advanced the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance carbon materials for large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>A Multifunctional Binder for Current&#8208;Collector&#8208;Free Zn Powder Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing abundant polar groups as Zn2+ absorption sites and hydrogen bond arrays, a protein structure&#8208;derived binder for ZP anode and iodine cathode is proposed. This design can regulate the Zn2+ flux, benefit the formation of free&#8208;standing electrode, inhibit the side reactions, suppress the shuttle effect of polyiodides, and enable the large&#8208;scale potentials.








Abstract
Compared with commonly used Zn foil anodes, Zn powder (ZP) anodes offer superior versatility and processability. However, in aqueous electrolytes, dendrite growth and side reactions, such as corrosion and hydrogen evolution, become more severe in ZP anodes than those in Zn foil anodes because of the rough surfaces and high surface areas of ZP, leading to poor reversibility and limitations in high&#8208;loading mass cathodes. In this study, a diisocyanate&#8208;polytetrahydrofuran&#8208;dihydrazide polymer (DDP) binder is developed, inspired by protein structures. The strong Zn2+ adsorption capability of the binder effectively regulates Zn2+ flux, while its unique hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays facilitate the formation of a free&#8208;standing ZP anode and inhibit side reactions. The binder exhibits superior mechanical performance, providing ZP electrodes with excellent resistance to various mechanical stresses, including tensile, nanoindentation, scratch, and dynamic bending tests. ZP symmetric cells achieve stable cycling at capacities of 2 and 5 mAh cm&#8722;2. In addition, DDP functions as an iodine cathode, effectively mitigating the polyiodide shuttle effect. The fabricated ZP/DDP||I2/DDP full cells demonstrate an excellent rate capability and cycling stability, even under a high&#8208;loading conditions. This study presents a novel approach for preparing stable ZP anodes and iodine cathodes, offering a promising strategy for large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Revealing the Catalysis Modes for Sulfur Conversion Kinetics in Molten Salt Aluminum&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) loaded with various metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is constructed as a sulfur host for molten salt Al&#8208;S batteries, and the effects of different SACs on the reaction kinetics of the sulfur positive electrodes are examined. Based on strong anchoring of polysulfides and regulation of the conversion rate kinetics at different stages, the CoNC@S positive electrode achieves stable cycling up to 6000 cycles.








Abstract
Molten salt aluminum&#8208;sulfur (MSAS) batteries operated at a sub&#8208;water&#8208;boiling temperature are attractive for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of the low costs along with moderate energy density. However, the sulfur positive electrode is plagued by the sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfides, which hampers the rate and cycling performance. Herein, carbon materials integrated with single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are utilized as the model sulfur hosts for MSAS batteries and comprehensively investigate the active modes of these SACs on cell performance. Results show that the cell utilizing cobalt&#8208;SACs shows an initial specific capacity of 1064&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.5C, retaining 88.5% capacity after 100 cycles. Even at 3C, the cell achieves a specific capacity of 533&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 and demonstrates record&#8208;long cycle performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of only 0.0014% per cycle over 6000 cycles. By combining theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations, a new mechanism is undercovered wherein &#8211; owed to differentiated binding toward varied Al&#8208;polysulfides &#8211; the cobalt&#8208;SAC tunes down the conversion of long&#8208;chain to short&#8208;chain polysulfides while accelerating that from short&#8208;chain polysulfides to solid Al2S3. This mechanism alleviates polysulfide accumulation in the molten salt electrolyte, mitigates the shuttle effect, and enhances the overall sulfur reaction kinetics.

         <title>A Perspective on Pathways Toward Commercial Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 46, November 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive analysis of the existing and prospective sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) systems unveils that a wider application of SIBs should primarily focus on i) regulating the composition, morphology, surface chemistry, safety performance, and production feasibility of mainstream cathodes, ii) enhancing the high&#8208;voltage stability, film formation ability, and cost effectiveness of electrolytes, and iii) reducing irreversible capacity loss and interphase growth of hard carbon anodes based on well&#8208;understood sodium&#8208;ion storage mechanisms.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely adopted in the automotive industry, with an annual global production exceeding 1000&#160;GWh. Despite their success, the escalating demand for LIBs has created concerns on supply chain issues related to key elements, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a promising alternative due to the high abundance and low cost of sodium and other raw materials. Nevertheless, the commercialization of SIBs, particularly for grid storage and automotive applications, faces significant hurdles. This perspective article aims to identify the critical challenges in making SIBs viable from both chemical and techno&#8208;economic perspectives. First, a brief comparison of the materials chemistry, working mechanisms, and cost between mainstream LIB systems and prospective SIB systems is provided. The intrinsic challenges of SIBs regarding storage stability, capacity utilization, cycle stability, calendar life, and safe operation of cathode, electrolyte, and anode materials are discussed. Furthermore, issues related to the scalability of material production, materials engineering feasibility, and energy&#8208;dense electrode design and fabrication are illustrated. Finally, promising pathways are listed and discussed toward achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, stable, cost&#8208;effective SIBs.

High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes via Rapid Joule Heating
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202508602), Hyun&#8208;Wook Lee, Rodney S. Ruoff, Won Kyung Seong, Sunghwan Jin, and co&#8208;workers synthesize high&#8208;nickel cathodes via rapid Joule heating, achieving robust microstructures that resist cracking and maintain compact morphology after extended cycling. This approach preserves electrochemical performance, extends cycle life, and offers a generalizable method for controlling microstructural evolution in oxide&#8208;based electrodes through precise thermal processing.

Implantable Reinforced Cardiac Tissue Patches
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202504765), Lewis S. Jones, Robert K. Katzschmann, and co&#8208;workers introduce the reinforced cardiac patch (RCPatch) for intraventricular myocardial repair. The multimaterial design integrates a stiffness&#8208;tuned, cardiomyocyte&#8208;infiltrated 3D metamaterial with a hydrogel&#8208;filled melt&#8208;electrowritten mesh. In a large&#8208;animal model, the RCPatch sealed a myocardial defect, prevented bleeding, and restored hemodynamic stability, providing a surgically implantable and regenerative platform for cardiac repair.

Light&#8208;Harvesting Nanomaterials
Light harvesting in plants inspires researchers to develop nanomaterials mimicking this fascinating process. In the Review by Andrey S. Klymchenko, Deep Sekhar Biswas, and Pascal Didier (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202501237), light&#8208;harvesting nanomaterials based on organic dyes are reviewed, highlighting fundamental challenges on aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and exciton migration. Owing to efficient energy transfer from light&#8208;harvesting ensemble of dyes to a single acceptor, these materials enable signal amplification (antenna effect) important for (bio)sensing and molecular diagnostics.

High Entropy Alloy HER Electrode
The proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) stands out for its high efficiency, yet its catalysts still face an inherent trade&#8208;off between activity and stability. In Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202510703), Xiongjun Liu, Rui Li, Zhaoping Lu, and co&#8208;workers report a porous (FeCoNiPt)2Nb high&#8208;entropy alloy HER electrode that breaks the trade&#8208;off via dissolution&#8211;deposition dynamic equilibrium. The electrode delivers exceptional performance and stability, operating continuously&#8212;and intermittently&#8212;for at least 2,200 h at 1 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Progress and Perspective on Heterogeneous Catalysis of Liquid Formic Acid Dehydrogenation: Coordination Structure Design, Activity Improvement, and Mechanism Insights</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation from perspectives of coordination structure design, catalytic performances, and reaction mechanisms. The design strategies, characterization technologies, activity evaluation and mechanism insights are presented in detail. These contents will provide a guidance for precise design of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts to enhance catalytic performance towards FA decomposition.








Abstract
Formic acid (FA) has attracted significant interest as a renewable liquid&#8208;phase hydrogen carrier. Hydrogen generation from FA decomposition is essential for the development of hydrogen economy. Designing highly efficient catalysts with different coordination environments for FA dehydrogenation is crucial for fuel&#8208;cell applications. Here, FA dehydrogenation from the perspectives of coordination structure design, activity evaluation, and mechanisms is focused. In particular, the structural design of active sites and dominant factors that determine the catalytic activity/selectivity and reaction mechanism are highlighted. Strategies to design catalysts are proposed based on the aspects of electronic effects, component regulation and synergistic effects, interface effects, and reaction active site design to boost the catalytic activity, selectivity, stability, rate&#8208;determining step activity, and overall performance. Simultaneously, it is important to investigate the structure&#8211;activity relationship during hydrogen generation. In addition, the experimental protocol (hydrogen generation from FA or FA&#8208;SF, SF: sodium formate), calculation of reaction parameters, and determination of products during hydrogen generation are summarized. Finally, challenges, conclusions, and developments based on FA decomposition are presented. Here, guidance for the precise design of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts is provided to enhance catalytic performance toward FA decomposition and satisfy the requirements for hydrogen generation in the future.

         <title>Interactions Between Active Matters and Endogenous Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review synthesizes endogenous field information and computational methods in contexts such as cancer, wounds, and biofilms. It organizes NAMs and AAMs by sensing, transmitting, and executing functions, compares their limitations, and from these contrasts proposes design strategies for next&#8208;generation AAMs, offering perspectives to foster interdisciplinary dialogue and future research.








Abstract
Active matter, encompassing both natural and artificial systems, utilizes environmental energy to sustain autonomous motion, exhibiting unique non&#8208;equilibrium behaviors. Artificial active matter (AAM), such as nano/micromotors, holds transformative potential in precision medicine by enhancing drug delivery and enabling targeted therapeutic interventions. Under the demand for increasing intelligence in AAM, controlling their non&#8208;equilibrium processes within complex in vivo environments presents significant challenges. Endogenous fields&#8212;biological fields generated within living systems&#8212;play a pivotal role in guiding natural active matter's (NAM) directional migration and collective transformations, offering a strategy for in vivo control of non&#8208;equilibrium systems. Research in NAMs&#8208;inspired AAMs spans biology, chemistry, materials science, engineering, and physics, yet communication barriers among disciplines often impede progress. This review seeks to bridge these gaps by summarizing the key characteristics of chemical and physical endogenous fields in biological contexts such as tumors, wounds, and inflammation. It explores how natural and artificial active matter sense, transmit, and execute responses to these fields, and discusses how insights from natural systems can inform the design of synthetic counterparts. Potential issues and prospects of this research direction are also discussed. It is hoped that this review fosters interdisciplinary collaborations and propels the development of intelligent active matter for biomedical applications.

         <title>Toward Rational Electrocatalyst Design: Dynamic Insights from Liquid Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing efficient electrocatalysts relies on a deep understanding of electrocatalytic processes under realistic reaction conditions&#8212;an area that has long remained a &#8220;black box.&#8221; This review highlights how liquid environmental transmission electron microscopy (LETEM) addresses fundamental challenges in electrocatalytic research. By bridging &#8220;material and environmental gaps&#8221;, LETEM provides unprecedented insights into the underlying mechanism and dynamic structure&#8208;activity relationship for electrocatalysis.









Abstract
Electrocatalysis, a pivotal field at the intersection of physical chemistry and materials science, plays a crucial role in advancing energy conversion and storage technologies through rational catalyst design. However, understanding reaction mechanisms at the atomic level remains a great challenge due to the intricate interplay between catalysts, reactants, and complex environments (e.g., electric fields, liquid electrolytes). This complexity has led to persistent &#8220;material&#8221; and &#8220;environment&#8221; gaps between conventional electrocatalytic research and the practical behavior of catalysts under realistic operating conditions. The emergence of liquid environmental transmission electron microscopy (LETEM) enables the characterization of the electrocatalysts coupled with precise electrochemical measurements under operando conditions with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. Recent breakthroughs in atomic&#8208;scale characterization of dynamic processes of electrocatalysts under realistic reaction environments have demonstrated the exceptional potential of LETEM for elucidating the nature of electrocatalysis and establishing robust atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity relationships. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the research progress in the dynamic evolution of electrocatalysts via LETEM, with a particular focus on the structural evolution of electrocatalysts under electro&#8208;liquid coupled environments. This review is expected to provide insights for unlocking fundamental mechanisms and the rational design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>From Carbon Nitrides to COFs: Opportunities and Prospects in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To underscore the potential of polymeric photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction&#8212;from carbon nitrides to covalent organic frameworks&#8212;the table of contents graphic presents recent breakthroughs in the design of light&#8208;responsive organic photocatalysts. These include strategies such as junction engineering, non&#8208;metallic site tuning, enhancement of crystallinity, metal incorporation, structural modulation, and optimization of molecular linkages.








Abstract
The continuing increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), a major greenhouse gas and accelerating climate change are driving demand for innovative mitigation strategies. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCO2RR) presents a promising and sustainable route to convert CO2 into useful hydrocarbons and fuels utilizing sunlight, thereby mitigating CO2 emissions. This review examines the developmental aspects of light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion using organic polymeric photocatalysts, focusing on carbon nitrides (CNs), covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). These materials are verified to possess great potential for PCO2RR, because they offer tunable band gaps, large surface areas, efficient light absorption, and remarkable activity and selectivity in photocatalysis. In this review, the comprehensive analysis of photocatalytic materials (e.g., CNs, CTFs, and COFs) are thoroughly discussed, along with their mechanisms, historical advancements, and urgent roles in PCO2RR. Strategies for enhancing the CO2 photoreduction efficiency of CNs, CTFs, and COFs are also highlighted. Each organic material brings distinct advantages. The review also addresses critical challenges, such as improving efficiency and managing charge transport dynamics for PCO2RR. Finally, the review underscores the need to develop scalable CO2 conversion applications, advance organic photocatalyst material science, and support sustainable energy conversion technologies.

         <dc:description>
An ideal implant should mimic native tissues such that it can integrate, sense, heal, and continue to function, i.e., be autonomous. Although early, there are good steps taken in this way, e.g., the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, self&#8208;powering, self&#8208;actuating, self&#8208;healing, self&#8208;regenerating, and self&#8208;aware implants. This forward&#8208;looking review outlines the research done thus far in this direction and efforts to assemble individual aspects of smart implants into a multifunctional implant in the future.








Abstract
With the increasing aging population, more implants are being used in the body. However, these implants often fail, and they suffer from a lack of integration or proper function. Efforts have been made to generate implants by employing bioactive materials, adding cellular components, and integrating smart characteristics such as self&#8208;healing properties. The vision is, however, to develop an implant that can mimic native tissues in their way of doing things, responding to challenges and remodeling. Such automated implants require the integration of advances made in various fields of science. Although early, there are good steps taken in this way, e.g., the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, self&#8208;powering, self&#8208;actuating, self&#8208;healing, self&#8208;regenerating, self&#8208;aware implants. Attempts to combine more than one smart property into these implants are still at the beginning, e.g., the integration of such special characteristics requires a new set of skills and thinking, which presents new challenges that warrant exploration and investment. Such an implant evolution is expected to be in stages, where the first implant will be able to communicate with doctors and hospitals; then, in the next stage, with patients, and later, they will be independent, sense any disturbances and aberrations from normal early on, and correct themselves before damage becomes irreversible. This forward&#8208;looking review looks at the research done thus far in this direction and efforts to assemble individual aspects of smart implants into multifunctional implants in the future. The stages of material, in vitro, and in vivo testing and clinical application, if any, are critically reviewed. In addition, the challenges facing the development of autonomous smart implants are discussed, and research directions and ideas are suggested.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Based Oxygen Electrocatalysts: Mechanistic Insights, Property Tuning Strategies, and Prospects toward Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights MXene&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis, emphasizing intrinsic properties, general principles for modulation strategies, and mechanistic understanding by in situ characterizations. 








Abstract
MXene delivers promising features that are highly compatible with oxygen electrocatalysis, such as excellent electroconductivity, high specific surface area, superhydrophilicity, and tailorable chemically functionalized surfaces, thus being recognized as the ideal platform for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for practical applications in industrial devices. A comprehensive understanding of oxygen catalytic mechanism on MXene ontology and a systematic refining of the general principles toward various physicochemical property regulation strategies are, respectively, the basis and effective alleyway to hitting the target, yet it is currently insufficient and need to be further explored in&#8208;depth. Herein, the fundamental effects of MXene on oxygen catalytic activity are sorted out thoroughly, and on this basis, the current mainstream strategies for tuning the property of MXene&#8208;based electrocatalysts are classified into four categories, including anion&#8208;tuning, cation&#8208;tuning, defect/vacancy regulation, and heterometallic dual&#8208;site collaboration, where the intrinsic mechanism of each strategy affecting the structure&#8211;activity relationship of catalysts is revealed accordingly. Particularly, the indispensability of advanced in situ characterizations in establishing the dynamic process of oxygen electrocatalysis, including real&#8208;time structural evolution and reaction pathways is emphasized. Finally, the latest advances of MXene&#8208;based electrocatalysts are reviewed from the viewpoint of the metal&#8211;support interactions effect, along with forward&#8208;looking perspectives on addressing the present thorny challenges.

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Nanomaterials Based on Dyes for Energy Transfer and Amplified Biosensing</title>

Light harvesting (LH) in plants inspires researchers to develop artificial LH nanomaterials. Here, LH nanomaterials based on organic dyes are reviewed, considering fundamental challenges on aggregation&#8208;caused quenching, excitation energy transfer, and exciton migration length. The efficient energy transfer from LH nanomaterial to an acceptor leads to signal amplification (antenna effect) important for sensing.








Abstract
Fascinating process of light harvesting (LH) in plants and bacteria leads to photosynthesis of oxygen and organic matter on the planet. It inspires researchers in the last decades to develop synthetic analogues &#8211; artificial LH nanomaterials. Here, LH nanomaterials based on dyes (organic chromophores) are reviewed. The fundamental aspects of LH include dye assembly into materials with minimal energy losses (i.e., high fluorescence quantum yield with minimized aggregation&#8208;caused quenching) and fast excitation energy transfer with large exciton migration length. The efficient energy transfer from LH nanomaterial to an acceptor leads to an amplification of acceptor emission &#8211; antenna effect, which constitutes the key performance parameter of LH nanoantenna. Individual classes of dye&#8208;based LH nanomaterials are analyzed: covalent molecular arrays of dyes (e.g., dendrimers and macrocycles), aggregates of &#8220;classical&#8221; dyes, aggregation&#8208;induced emission nanomaterials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks, ion&#8208;associated nanomaterials, and hybrid dye&#8208;based organic systems, such as dye&#8208;biomolecule hybrids, micelles and supramolecular polymers, dye&#8208;loaded silica and polymeric nanoparticles. The design principles and key performance characteristics of their selected (non&#8208;exhaustive) examples are analyzed. Due to their capacity to amplify the acceptor fluorescence signal, LH nanomaterials are particularly suitable for amplified sensing of small molecules, ions, biomolecules, which is particularly attractive for biomedical applications.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Light Emission From Single Chiral Hedgehog Particles Coated with Nanofilms of Achiral Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) is observed from chiral &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; particles (CHIPs) coated with a nanofilm of achiral perovskite, with spectroscopic bands specific to the perovskites and chirality specific to the template CHIPs. Careful analysis of optical activity indicates that the CPLE of perovskite luminescence is dominated by post&#8208;emission scattering from the chiral surfaces of the same CHIPs.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites are known for their strong and tunable luminescence. However, the synthesis of perovskite&#8208;based particles with circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) remains challenging due to the complex interplay of metal&#8208;ligand chemistries, crystallization patterns, and chirality transfer mechanisms. Achiral perovskites can be deposited on chiral &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; particles (CHIPs) with twisted spikes, producing chiroptically active materials with spectroscopic bands specific to the perovskite and chirality specific to the template CHIPs.

     alt="Circularly Polarized Light Emission From Single Chiral Hedgehog Particles Coated with Nanofilms of Achiral Perovskites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left- and right-handed circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) is observed from chiral &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; particles (CHIPs) coated with a nanofilm of achiral perovskite, with spectroscopic bands specific to the perovskites and chirality specific to the template CHIPs. Careful analysis of optical activity indicates that the CPLE of perovskite luminescence is dominated by post-emission scattering from the chiral surfaces of the same CHIPs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-halide perovskites are known for their strong and tunable luminescence. However, the synthesis of perovskite-based particles with circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) remains challenging due to the complex interplay of metal-ligand chemistries, crystallization patterns, and chirality transfer mechanisms. Achiral perovskites can be deposited on chiral &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; particles (CHIPs) with twisted spikes, producing chiroptically active materials with spectroscopic bands specific to the perovskite and chirality specific to the template CHIPs. Left- and right-handed CPLE is engineered into complex particles comprised of a layer of perovskite deposited onto CHIPs coated with an intermediate silica layer. The spectral position of chiroptical bands, the optical asymmetry &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-factors, and single-particle circularly polarized microscopy indicate that the observed CPLE is dominated by the post-emission scattering from the twisted spikes of the parent particle. Templating luminescent nanofilms on CHIPs provides a simple pathway to a wide range of complex chiroptical materials; the dispersibility of the CHIPs in various solvents and the tunability of their chiral geometry enable their applications as single-particle emitters with strong and controllable polarization rotation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Imaging of Hydrogen&#8208;Driven Dislocation and Strain Field Evolution in a Stainless Steel Grain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ Bragg coherent X&#8208;ray diffraction imaging, 3D nanoscale strain maps of a stainless steel grain were&#160;measured during hydrogen charging. Results show dislocation relaxation and climb, elucidating the role of point defects in hydrogen&#8208;modified deformation behavior. Detailed strain measurements reveal shielding of dislocation strain fields. These experimental results validate theoretical predictions and provide new insights into embrittlement mechanisms.








Abstract
Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron&#8208;transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen&#8208;induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X&#8208;ray diffraction imaging to track three&#8208;dimensional (3D) dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen&#8208;enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen&#8208;induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen&#8208;driven dislocation behavior. The quantified nanoscale phenomena serve as critical inputs for multiscale modeling frameworks to predict bulk material responses and accelerate the development of HE&#8208;resistant&#160;alloys.

         <title>Role of Amorphous Phases in Mixed Conduction of Conjugated Regioblock Copolymers for Organic Electrochemical Synaptic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Critical roles of amorphous and crystalline phases in polymer&#8208;based mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors for organic electrochemical synaptic transistors using conjugated regioregular&#8208;block&#8208;regiorandom copolymers are demonstrated. Amorphous phases contribute to gradual polaron formation and strong ion trapping by bipolarons, leading to improved synaptic state modulation. The synaptic transistors with appropriate amorphous content exhibited low power consumption in the neuromorphic learning process.








Abstract
Growing interest in organic electrochemical synaptic transistors (OECT&#8208;STrs) based on conjugated polymer mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (CP&#8208;MIECs) has intensified, leading to the need to establish clear design rules and fundamentally understand the distinct roles of crystalline and amorphous domains in the electrochemical doping behavior of CP&#8208;MIEC films. Here, OECT&#8208;STrs based on regioregular&#8208;block&#8208;regiorandom (regioblock) conjugated copolymers with precisely controlled crystallinity are demonstrated. The crystallinity of a poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) regioblock copolymer is systematically tuned by varying the fraction of regiorandom blocks without altering the geometry or orientation of the crystalline phase. It is shown that incorporating an amorphous phase into the active channel of OECT&#8208;STrs significantly enhances the neuromorphic learning efficiency by improving modulation uniformity. This improvement results from sequential polaron formation in the amorphous regions and bipolaron formation in the crystalline domains during potentiation. Additionally, crystalline phases provide better state retention at low potentiation states, while amorphous phases contribute to improved long&#8208;term retention at high potentiation states by enhancing charge carrier localization through stronger Coulombic interactions. Neural network simulations based on actual device conductance demonstrate that OECT&#8208;STrs with a high amorphous fraction consume only 18% of the power required by devices with a highly crystalline film, owing to the need for fewer repetitive learning cycles.

         <title>Implantable Light&#8208;Powered Human Designer Cells for Electrical Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the eel's electric organ, a miniature implantable biohybrid device is developed to generate electricity under light activation. The device utilizes a light&#8208;dependent ion gradient formation that induced by genetically engineered human designer cells that express light&#8208;sensitive membrane ion channels and proton pumps, working in synergy with the device to generate electrical potential and deliver electrical energy.








Abstract
Herein, an implantable, miniature biohybrid device has been developed that utilizes light&#8208;dependent ion&#8208;gradient formation by genetically engineered human designer cells, expressing light&#8208;activated ion channels and proton pumps to generate electrical potential and deliver electrical energy. These designer cells are cultured in custom&#8208;designed polycarbonate chambers, connected by electrodes and separated from an ion reservoir by a proton&#8208;selective Nafion membrane. Upon illumination, the light&#8208;activated channels and pumps on the designer cells establish a sustained proton gradient across the Nafion membrane, which drives an electrical current in the external circuit. When exposed to simulated ambient sunlight of 3&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 of intensity, a single solar collection device (SCD), containing these designer cells, appropriately sized for subcutaneous implantation in mice, generates an electrical potential of &#8776;0.4&#160;V. By connecting multiple SCDs in series and increasing the cell suspension volume, the output can be scaled up sufficiently to power a commercial light&#8208;emitting diode. Thus, this study demonstrates the feasibility of a photovoltaic system based on optogenetically engineered mammalian cells for powering bioelectronic implants or wearable devices.

         <title>Anomalous Reconfigurable&#8208;Transport in MoS2 Transistors by Electrically&#8208;Switchable van der Waals Interfacial Dipole</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a tunable insulator&#8208;semiconductor heterostructure of BiOCl and MoS2, where interfacial charge transfer forms a strong dipole. By switching the dipole polarity with an electric field, reconfigurable transport characteristics are achieved in MoS2 transistors, including n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, anti&#8208;ambipolar, and &#8220;W&#8221;&#8208;shaped behaviors. A dual&#8208;gate configuration enables multi&#8208;state switching, offering potential for negative differential resistance and scalable 2D transistor applications.








Abstract
Interfacial charge transfer leads to the formation of an electric dipole at the interface of a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. The switching of dipole polarity using an electric field provides an effective method for modulating the electronic properties of vdW systems. However, the experimental observation of switched vdW dipoles is challenging, as it is concealed by the electrostatic gating effect. In this work, the significant electrical tunability of the strong interfacial dipole formed in an insulator&#8208;semiconductor heterostructure of high&#8208;work&#8208;function BiOCl and MoS2 are demonstrated. The heterostructured device essentially operates as a planar tunneling transistor, where band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling occurs within the vdW doping&#8208;defined junction, resulting in a subthreshold swing significantly lower than that of typical field effect transistors. More importantly, the anomalous reconfiguration of electronic transports is observed in MoS2 transistors due to the switching of vdW dipole and its competition with the electrostatic gating. By varying the BiOCl thickness, the n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, anti&#8208;ambipolar, and &#8220;W&#8221;&#8208;shaped transfer characteristics are achieved. Furthermore, a dual&#8208;gate configuration further enhances functionality of the device, enabling multi&#8208;state switching, which is of particularly interest for these applications requiring negative differential resistance. This work offers a scalable, versatile, and non&#8208;destructive strategy for tuning reconfigurable two&#8208;dimensional&#160;transistors.

Epigenetic nanoagonist for multilevel T cell activation. a) DPM@iCARM1@siPVR assembly. b) Actions of the nanoagonist against PD&#8208;L1 &#8208; resistant tumors: 1) iCARM1 released in tumor cells activates cGAS&#8208;STING signaling for dendritic cell maturation, aiding T cell priming; 2) In T cells, iCARM1 facilitates their recruitment by upregulating CXCR3; 3) SiPVR silences pvr to reinvigorate T cells.








Abstract
Inefficient priming, poor recruitment, and inadequate reinvigoration of T cells challenges the therapy of PD&#8208;L1&#8208;resistant tumors. Herein, a pH&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;reversal nanoplatform integrating coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) inhibitor (iCARM1) and poliovirus receptor siRNA (siPVR) is developed. Upon tumor penetration, iCARM1 released in tumor cells facilitates T cell priming by epigenetically activating cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling&#8208;mediated dendritic cell maturation. Meanwhile, in T cells, iCARM1 facilitates their recruitment by upregulating CXC&#8208;chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) expression. The released siPVR silences pvr to reinvigorate T cells. This epigenetic nanoagonist induces a robust immune response, dramatically suppresses tumor growth, metastasis, and relapse, and confers durable protection against secondary tumor challenge. Multiple PD&#8208;L1&#8208;resistant models demonstrate the broad applicability of this strategy. This study thus represents an innovative approach for facilitating multilevel T cell responses to combat PD&#8208;L1&#8208;resistant tumors.

         <title>Interlayer Switching of NiO6 Octahedra Tilt via Interstitial Oxygen in Lan + 1NinO3n + 1 (n = 1, 2, 3)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research presents an anti&#8208;parallel interlayer tilt coupling of NiO6 octahedra induced by interstitial oxygen in high&#8208;pressure oxygen annealing Lan + 1NinO3n + 1(n = 1,2, 3). The new coupling pattern brings new symmetry along the caxis, alters the electronic structure, and hinders the superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, directing a micro&#8208;structural route to investigate and tune the novel functionalities in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite nickelates.








Abstract
Oxygen octahedra tilt, an important knob to tune properties of perovskite oxides and their derivatives, determines the coupling patterns and emergent states. Conventional methods, such as strain and doping, are primarily employed to modulate the magnitude of the octahedra tilt. The switching of the tilt, however, is challenging due to the intrinsic interlocked coupling. Here, we achieve the interlayer switching of NiO6 octahedral tilting via interstitial oxygen insertion in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Lan + 1NinO3n + 1 (n = 2). Interstitial oxygen with an alternative occupation in the rock&#8208;salt (LaO) layers induces completely opposite tilt patterns of NiO6 octahedra in neighboring perovskite (LaNiO3) layers. EELS reveals a lower unoccupied UHB and a spectral&#8208;weight transfer, which may contribute to the suppression of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 as confirmed by our high&#8208;pressure transport experiments. This mechanism of NiO6 octahedral tilt switching is further validated in Lan + 1NinO3n + 1 (n = 1 and 3), offering a promising strategy for regulating the properties of layered perovskite oxides.

         <title>A Bioinspired Piezoelectric Stress Buffer Layer for SiOx&#8208;Based Electrodes Toward High&#8208;Energy Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Breviceps adspersus epidermis in nature, a novel piezoelectric stress buffer layer is introduced to address challenges faced by SiOx electrodes. This innovative design significantly mitigates excessive volume expansion and stabilizes solid electrolyte interface of SiOx electrodes, yielding remarkable improvements in battery cycling and rate performance. These advances open pathways for achieving high&#8208;energy lithium battery applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;specific&#8208;capacity silicon suboxide (SiOx, 0 &lt; x &lt; 2) anodes have long faced the problems of huge volume expansion, fast capacity decay and unsatisfied rate performance. To overcome these bottlenecks, the volume expansion resistance and electrogenic Na+ transport functions of common rain frog (Breviceps adspersus) epidermis are introduced into the design philosophy of stress buffers for SiOx electrodes. Thereupon, a mechanically robust, piezoelectric (MP) stress buffer layer comprised of ferroelectric tetragonal BaTiO3 nanoparticles and a novel homopolymer (PCM) binder of cyanoethyl carbamate&#8208;containing methacrylate is developed. It is demonstrated that MP stress buffer layer with superior mechanical properties effectively inhibits excessive volume expansion and stabilizes the solid electrolyte interface along with much suppressed electrolyte decomposition. Meanwhile, MP stress buffer layer helps expedite the dealloying reaction kinetics of SiOx electrodes in half&#8208;cells, mainly owing to the generation of a stress&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field within MP stress buffer layer, conducive to improving battery rate performance. As a result, unprecedented cycling and rate performance can be realized in coin and home&#8208;made soft package cells with SiOx and SiOx/graphite composite electrodes. Such a design philosophy of stress buffer layers marks an important milestone in developing high&#8208;energy lithium batteries with SiOx&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Decoupling Transport of Salt Ions and Water in Hierarchically Structured Hydrogel for High Salinity Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically structured hydrogel evaporator enables controlled decoupling of salt&#8208;ion and water transport pathways for efficient solar desalination in hypersaline environments. Engineered radial and vertical channels direct salt away from the evaporative interface, enhancing water evaporation and ambient energy harvesting via a cold&#8208;surface effect. This integrated design supports a scalable zero&#8208;liquid&#8208;discharge desalination platform.








Abstract
Global water scarcity demands next&#8208;generation desalination technologies that transcend the limitations of energy&#8208;intensive processes and salt accumulation. Herein, a groundbreaking interfacial solar steam generation system capable of simultaneous hypersaline desalination and ambient energy harvesting is introduced. Through hierarchical hydrogel architecture incorporating a central vertical channel and radial channels with gradient apertures, the design effectively decouples salt transport and water evaporation: solar&#8208;driven fluid convection directs water outward for evaporation, while inward salt migration prevents surface crystallization and redistributes excess heat. The heat dissipation induces a sub&#8208;ambient &#8220;cold evaporation&#8221; effect, lowering the evaporative interface temperature and enhancing ambient energy utilization. The system achieves a remarkable water evaporation rate exceeding 12&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 in a 20 wt% hypersaline environment and operates continuously for 15 h without salt accumulation. Outdoor testing demonstrates a daily water production of 67.2 L m&#8722;2, with scalable potential for sustainable desalination and industrial brine treatment.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Compact Topological Photonic Crystal Rainbow Nanolasers Operating in the 1550 nm Telecom Band with Wavelength&#8208;Scale Mode Volumes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale rainbow light trapping for lasing emission in the 1550 nm telecom band is experimentally demonstrated. Ultra&#8208;compact 1D and 2D topological rainbow nanolasers are presented, featuring ultra&#8208;small mode volumes, ultra&#8208;low lasing thresholds, and remarkable robustness against fabrication imperfections and defects.








Abstract
Topological rainbow trapping, spatially separating and confining multiple topologically protected light frequencies, offers a prospective scheme for achieving robust multi&#8208;wavelength single&#8208;mode coherent emission within a single nanodevice. Here, ultra&#8208;compact topological photonic crystal rainbow nanolasers&#160;operating in the 1550 nm telecom band are experimentally demonstrated. Specifically, rainbow&#8208;like single&#8208;mode emission with a controllable free spectral range and a wavelength&#8208;scale mode volume is presented in a one&#8208;dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser, exhibiting robust rainbow spectral emission across a wide temperature range and a spectral tuning capability of approximately 70 nm. Additionally, an ultra&#8208;compact two&#8208;dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser is demonstrated in an exceptionally small footprint, featuring a broad rainbow spectrum with 64 continuously tuned single&#8208;mode lasing peaks. This work provides a promising approach for realizing robust and nanoscale multi&#8208;wavelength single&#8208;mode coherent emission within a single device, paving the way for numerous potential applications in ultra&#8208;compact high&#8208;throughput data processing systems, including on&#8208;chip wavelength&#8208;division&#8208;multiplexing and optical&#160;interconnects.

         <title>All&#8208;3D&#8208;Printed Multi&#8208;Environment Modular Microrobots Powered by Large&#8208;Displacement Dielectric Elastomer Microactuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully 3D&#8208;printed modular microrobots capable of performing a broad range of tasks across diverse environments are demonstrated. The key breakthrough lies in the development of a large&#8208;displacement microactuator for multi&#8208;environment navigation and a mesoscale multimaterial 3D printing platform for on&#8208;demand module fabrication. Together, these innovations advance the adaptability, versatility, and scalability of microrobotic systems.








Abstract
Microrobots are expected to push the boundaries of robotics by enabling navigation in confined and cluttered environments due to their sub&#8208;centimeter scale. However, most microrobots perform best only in the specific conditions for which they are designed and require complete redesign and fabrication to adapt to new tasks and environments. Here, fully 3D&#8208;printed modular microrobots capable of performing a broad range of tasks across diverse environments are introduced. For multi&#8208;environment navigation, large&#8208;displacement dielectric elastomer microactuators with a soft&#8208;stiff hybrid structure are developed, capable of powering microrobots to stride over obstacles on various terrestrial terrain and rapidly propel themselves across aquatic terrain. To further expand their capabilities beyond mere navigation, ten task&#8208;specific modules for the microrobots are developed. All modules are fabricated using a digital light processing multimaterial 3D printer capable of simultaneously printing multiple photocurable resins, providing a broadly applicable platform for fabricating mesoscale robotic components. The microrobots navigate across smooth, rough, granular, and aquatic environments, demonstrating tasks such as controlling the movements of nearby robots, interacting with humans to avoid collisions, and collaboratively dragging heavy objects through multi&#8208;unit operation. The study addresses key limitations hindering the integration of modular design into microrobots, enabling adaptation to new environments and tasks.

A bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical (PEC) upcycling system integrating bi&#8208;functional nickel&#8208;iron&#8208;phosphorus (Ni&#8208;Fe&#8208;P) catalysts with organic semiconductor (OS)&#8208;based dual photoelectrodes is reported. The system enables simultaneous solar&#8208;driven conversion of nitrate to ammonia and glycerol to formic acid with high efficiency and stability. This work demonstrates one of the highest&#8208;performing OS&#8208;based bias&#8208;free PEC systems reported to date.








Abstract
The sustainable management of biodiesel byproducts, nitrate (NO3&#8722;) and glycerol, remains a critical environmental challenge, disrupting global nitrogen and carbon cycles. Addressing this issue from a materials science perspective, a bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical (PEC) upcycling system based on the integration of functional energy materials is presented. A nickel&#8208;iron&#8208;phosphorus (Ni&#8208;Fe&#8208;P) electrocatalyst exhibits synergistic bi&#8208;functional activity for selective NO3&#8722; reduction and glycerol oxidation, driven by the redox dynamics of Ni and Fe and electronic modulation by phosphorus incorporation. Through a metal&#8208;foil encapsulation strategy, the catalyst is integrated with organic semiconductor (OS)&#8208;based photoanodes and photocathodes, forming a highly efficient OS&#8208;based PEC system capable of stable operation under continuous solar illumination. The individual photoelectrodes demonstrate photocurrent densities of +15.7 and&#8722;14.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under AM 1.5G conditions, while exhibiting remarkable stability with over 96% of initial performance retained after 60 h. To enable bias&#8208;free solar upcycling, a dual&#8208;photoelectrode PEC configuration is constructed, delivering a high reaction current of 11.04&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 along with &gt;95% Faradaic efficiencies and excellent selectivity for both ammonia (NH3) and formic acid (FA) production. This work underscores the potential of materials&#8208;driven PEC platforms for selective solar chemical upcycling.

         <title>Upgrading Natural Ores for Efficient Photothermal Polyester Recycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers a solar&#8208;driven plastic upcycling system using thermally activated natural pyrite minerals as photothermal catalysts. It overcomes key industrial challenges by utilizing abundant, low&#8208;cost minerals to achieve high&#8208;efficiency polyester waste conversion into valuable monomers. This innovation enables scalable, sustainable plastic valorization, accelerating the transition toward circular economies.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical upcycling of polyester waste into monomers represents a critical pathway to mitigate the global environmental crisis posed by plastic pollution. However, reconciling atomic&#8208;scale catalyst design with industrial manufacturing demands remains a fundamental challenge for addressing the &gt;80 million tons of polyester waste generated annually. Here, a solar&#8208;driven glycolysis platform is reported using thermally activated natural pyrite minerals (FeS2) as photothermal catalysts. Unlike conventional catalysts requiring complex synthesis, this mineral&#8208;derived system leverages low&#8208;cost, abundant raw materials, a green synthesis process, and easy scale&#8208;up. The activated pyrite exhibits a monomer yield 51.2&#8208;fold higher than pristine pyrite. Structural and mechanistic studies reveal that thermal activation generates iron&#8208;sulfur cooperative sites via topological transformation, which synergistically enhance the adsorption of polyester and ethylene glycol, boosting the subsequent nucleophilic substitution depolymerization reaction. The findings may catalyze innovations in polymer regeneration technologies and establish scalable pathways for plastic waste valorization, accelerating global transition to circular economies.

Fe&#8208;doped H2TiO3 anchored on rGO (rGO/H2TiO3&#8208;x&#8208;Fe) is designed as a novel separator modifier for Li&#8208;S battery. Fe&#8208;doping induces OVs with Lewis acidity, which causes sieving effect via the differentiated adsorption regulated by the Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. The optimized electronic structure and enhanced electronic conductivity promote the catalytic effect for the LiPSs redox to accelerate fast conversion of the blocked LiPSs.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have been hindered by the low active material utilization, sluggish kinetics and Li anode corrosion caused by the dissolution of Li polysulfides (LiPSs) intermediates. To solve these problems simultaneously, Fe&#8208;doped H2TiO3 anchored on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO/H2TiO3&#8208;x&#8208;Fe) is designed via dopant selection and doping content optimization as a novel separator modifier. Tunable Fe&#8208;doping induces the controllable generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs), endowing rGO/H2TiO3&#8208;x&#8208;Fe with suitable Lewis acid character, which causes a sieving effect via the differentiated adsorption between OVs and various LiPSs. All the long&#8208;chain LiPSs are blocked, while partial Li2S4 passes over the separator to react with the Li anode for forming robust SEI, which could ease the Li corrosion from LiPSs and suppress Li dendrite. Furthermore, the optimized electronic structure and the enhanced electronic conductivity from Fe&#8208;doping promote the catalytic effect for the LiPSs redox to accelerate the conversion of the blocked LiPSs. Consequently, with the synergistic effect between sieving effect and enhanced catalysis, rGO/H2TiO3&#8208;x&#8208;Fe modified separator provides Li&#8208;S battery remarkable cycling (fading rate: 0.035%@5 C during 1000 cycles), power, and shelving performances. This strategy, based on rational dopant selection and OVs regulation, offers a universal separator design for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries toward industrialization.

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been hindered by the low active material utilization, sluggish kinetics and Li anode corrosion caused by the dissolution of Li polysulfides (LiPSs) intermediates. To solve these problems simultaneously, Fe-doped H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; anchored on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;-Fe) is designed via dopant selection and doping content optimization as a novel separator modifier.

         <title>Copper Catalysts Inherit and Retain Precatalyst Morphology in Extended CO Electroreduction to n&#8208;Propanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash Joule heating enables the formation of quenched Cu oxide precatalysts with intragrain&#8208;in&#8208;grain architectures. These hierarchical structures are inherited after electroreduction, suppressing reconstruction even at high current densities in an MEA cell. The high intragrain boundary density enhances CO adsorption and C1&#8211;C2 coupling, leading to selective n&#8208;propanol formation &#8776;35%. This approach achieves both structural durability and improved C3 selectivity.








Abstract
Copper catalyst morphology, faceting, and oxidation state are each known to impact selectivity in the electroreduction of CO. Copper oxide precatalysts are synthesized using flash Joule heating and rapid cooling, and it is observed that temperature ramp rates can be used to control morphology, enabling us to implement &#8776;10&#160;nm&#8208;sized intragrain features within &#8776;35 nm grains. It is found that the structural features of the precatalysts are substantially transferred to Cu catalysts that are formed when they are employed in CO electroreduction in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The catalysts achieve &#8776;35% faradaic efficiency to n&#8208;propanol, among the highest selectivities to C3 from monometallic Cu. Both selectivity and morphology are retained following 330 h of operation at 100 mA cm&#8722;2. CO dilution studies reveal that catalysts with similar faceting, but smaller grain sizes, exhibit n&#8208;propanol selectivity that increases with CO concentration, suggesting that grain interfaces contribute to CO coverage and C1&#8211;C2 coupling. Complementary operando Raman spectroscopy shows that reducing grain size enables higher CO coverage, suggesting that structural features enhancing linear CO adsorption are correlated with improved selectivity to C3.

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Induced Ferroelectric Switching in Wurtzite/Fluorite Bilayers for High&#8208;Performance Ferroelectric Field&#8208;Effect Transistor</title>

Proximity&#8208;induced switching in AlScN/HfZrO2 and AlN/HfZrO2 bilayers enables a novel combination of low remanent polarization and high coercive field. A ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor incorporating an AlN/HfZrO2 gate stack yields a wide memory window, superior retention, and endurance characteristics. This work pioneers a new strategy for engineering ferroelectric response through integrating distinct ferroelectric materials.








Abstract
Proximity ferroelectricity, wherein polarization switching in one ferroelectric layer with a lower energy barrier can trigger switching in an adjacent ferroelectric with a higher energy barrier, has been demonstrated only in bilayers composed of structurally similar wurtzite&#8208;structured materials. This work demonstrates proximity&#8208;induced ferroelectric switching across a heterostructure composed of crystallographically and functionally dissimilar materials, wurtzite&#8208;structured AlScN and fluorite&#8208;structured HfZrO2. The AlScN/HfZrO2 and AlN/HfZrO2 bilayers exhibit cooperative switching dynamics despite their contrasting symmetry and polarization behaviors. This interfacial coupling produces a unique ferroelectric response, characterized by low remanent polarization and a high coercive field. Using the AlN/HfZrO2 bilayer, a ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor is fabricated on a p&#8208;type Si substrate with phosphorus&#8208;doped source and drain regions. The device shows a wide memory window with excellent retention and endurance. These results establish a versatile materials design strategy for engineering ferroelectricity via structural and functional heterogeneity.

         <title>Upcycling PET Coupled with Energy&#8208;Saving H2 Production from Seawater at Asymmetric Active Center</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses the challenge of selectively oxidizing a single hydroxymethyl group while preserving the C&#9472;C bond during ethylene glycol electro&#8208;oxidation (EGOR). By integrating oxyphilic transition metals with noble metals, the Ru&#8208;(CoCu)2V2O7@Cu2O electrocatalyst featuring asymmetric active centers is designed to induce dynamic electron delocalization. This breaks EG molecular symmetry, enabling directed adsorption of key intermediates (*OCCH2OH and *OH), oriented deprotonation of hydroxymethyl, and timely desorption of C2 products.








Abstract
Electrochemically upcycling polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate (PET)&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) into high&#8208;value glycolic acid (GA) with H2 production elegantly addresses the dual challenges of clean energy production and plastic recycling. Herein, an electrocatalyst of Ru&#8208;(CoCu)2V2O7@Cu2O is reported, where the Co&#9472;O&#9472;Ru asymmetric active center triggers the dynamic electronic delocalization is constructed. Such innovative design facilitates the designated bonding of key intermediates for *OCCH2OH and *OH at the Ru and Co sites during EG oxidation reactions (EGOR), respectively, while maintaining the integrity of C&#9472;C bond. As a result, the Ru&#8208;(CoCu)2V2O7@Cu2O demonstrates remarkable performance for EGOR, requiring only 0.68 V@RHE to reach 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, reducing energy consumption by 60.1% compared to the traditional oxygen evolution. Notably, under industrial conditions (1.0 V@RHE, &#8776;600&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), it still maintains a Faraday efficiency of 96.6% and a selectivity of 93.5% for GA, breaking through the performance bottleneck of existing catalytic systems. Implemented at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell, this system converts PET hydrolysate into GA (0.0299&#160;mmol&#160;min&#8722;1) and produces H2 (1.531 mL&#160;min&#8722;1) from natural seawater simultaneously, with exceptional stability of &lt;12% decay after 120&#160;h at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work establishes an innovative paradigm for synergistic plastic upcycling and green hydrogen production.

         <title>Atomical&#8208;Rippled&#8208;Nanodomains Stabilized Large Polarization in BiSmCo2O6 Double&#8208;Perovskite Films</title>

         <dc:description>
Here, an atomical&#8208;rippled&#8208;nanodomains are introduced to BiCoO3 and SmCoO3 solid solution double&#8208;perovskite film due to its ferroelectric single&#8208;domain coupling. By engineering triaxial tensile strain, the ferroelectric ARNs are robustly formed in BiSmCo2O6 double&#8208;perovskite films, leading to a large ferroelectric polarization and ultra&#8208;enduring ferroelectric fatigue. These results represent a significant enhancement in the performance boundaries of orthorhombic type&#8208;II multiferroics.








Abstract
Double&#8208;perovskite ferroelectrics have attracted increasing attention due to their highly tunable structures, multifunctional coupling effects, and potential applications in next&#8208;generation nonvolatile ferroelectric semiconductor devices. Here, an atomical&#8208;rippled&#8208;nanodomains (ARNs) are introduced to BiCoO3 and SmCoO3 solid solution double&#8208;perovskite film due to its ferroelectric single&#8208;domain coupling. By engineering triaxial tensile strain, the ferroelectric ARNs are robustly formed in BiSmCo2O6 double&#8208;perovskite films, leading to a large ferroelectric polarization (&#8776;23.1 &#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2) and ultra&#8208;enduring ferroelectric fatigue resistance exceeding 1012 cycles without degradation. These results represent a significant enhancement in the performance boundaries of orthorhombic type&#8208;II multiferroics. The ferroelectric switching dynamics reveal the intrinsic correlation between the continuous switchable ARNs and the outstanding ferroelectric behavior. These findings underscore the effectiveness of nanodomain&#8208;coupling strategy for realizing high&#8208;performance ferroelectrics and offer a promising pathway toward designing correlated oxide&#8208;based ferroelectric semiconductor devices with exotic functionalities.

         <title>Converting Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode into Non&#8208;Shrinking Sacrificial Prelithiation Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode is converted into a lithium&#8208;rich disordered rocksalt (LRDO) prelithiation agent by structural reconstruction. The voltage&#8208;compatible characteristics and phase&#8208;transition&#8208;free nature of LRDO during lithium compensation enable its function as a non&#8208;volumetric&#8208;shrinkage sacrificial agent, which eliminates cathode architecture failure and interfacial degradation induced by conventional prelithiation processes, thereby enhancing practical lithium&#8208;ion battery energy density.








Abstract
To improve the energy density of Li&#8208;ion batteries, conventional sacrificial prelithiation agents (Li5FeO4, Li2O and Li2CO3, etc.) are introduced to compensate for active lithium loss, but they undergo serious volumetric shrinkage during decomposition, generating voids that compromise electrode architecture integrity and deteriorate electrochemical performance. Herein, the typical Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode is converted into Li&#8208;rich disordered rocksalt oxide (LRDO) prelithiation agent, achieving 330 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 charge capacity and retaining 130 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 reversible capacity (contributing 200 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 irreversible prelithiation capacity). Compared with the layered structure, the cation&#8208;disordered structure in LRDO tunes the local oxygen environment, completely activating oxygen&#8208;related anionic oxidation activity at lower potential (&lt;4.5&#160;V). Moreover, coupled with a fluorinated electrolyte additive, the nucleophilic oxygen species released during de&#8208;lithiation of LRDO are synergistically utilized, constructing a gradient cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase architecture with enhanced interfacial stability during the cell formation process. Most importantly, the phase&#8208;transition&#8208;free nature of LRDO during prelithiation completely eradicates volume shrinkage, effectively preventing electrode architecture degradation. Furthermore, a long&#8208;life graphite||LiFePO4 pouch cell with high discharge capacity of 150.02 mAh (7.59% higher than without prelithiation) are achieved, maintaining 91.33% capacity after 1800 cycles.

         <title>Delineating the Triphasic Side Reaction Products in High&#8208;Energy Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphasic side reaction products&#8212;gaseous, soluble, and solid CEI&#8212;formed at the interface between high&#8208;Ni cathodes and carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes have been quantitatively analyzed with online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), systematically elucidating the interrelationships among the reaction products, especially under elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Unwanted cathode&#8208;electrolyte side reactions remain a major challenge to the stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, especially at high temperatures. This study presents a quantitative analysis on gaseous, soluble, and solid byproducts generated by reactions between LiNiO2 and carbonate electrolytes. Online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) outgassing profiles reveal the emergence of a pre&#8208;plateau region as temperature increases, characterized by two small plateaus at 3.7 and 4.0&#160;V, which are attributed to catalytic ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) decomposition and ethylene carbonate (EC) hydrolysis, respectively. Activation energies for electrolyte oxidation reactions are quantified with OEMS, confirming that the main outgassing event is driven by direct oxygen&#8208;electrolyte chemical reactions. Nuclear magnetic resonance and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses show that EC decomposition yields both soluble and solid byproducts, while EMC produces mainly solid species, leading to a thicker, organic&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase; the presence of LiPF6 further accelerates solvent degradation. Additionally, the effectiveness of various dopants in suppressing gas evolution is evaluated across a broad temperature range, with magnesium&#8208;doped cathodes exhibiting the most effective suppression by stabilizing lattice oxygen. Overall, this work establishes a clear correlation among triphasic side&#8208;reaction products, guiding rational design of cathode materials and electrolyte formulations for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Waste&#8208;Free Closed&#8208;Loop&#8208;Recyclable and Thermally Superinsulating Polyimide Aerogels Utilizing Diels&#8208;Alder Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol for thermally recyclable poly(amide&#8208;imide) aerogels based on Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry is presented. Prepared from furan&#8208;modified poly(amide&#8208;imide) and bismaleimide, these aerogels offer thermal superinsulation and excellent thermo&#8208;mechanical performance. Notably, they can be depolymerized into soluble oligomers at elevated temperatures, which can be reconstructed into fresh aerogels&#8212;enabling efficient, waste&#8208;free, closed&#8208;loop recycling.








Abstract
Organic aerogels are an advanced class of lightweight materials with ultralow thermal conductivity and high porosity, widely used in applications such as thermal insulation, energy storage, and aerospace engineering. Among them, polyimide aerogels stand out for their excellent thermal stability, mechanical strength, and chemical resistance. However, their permanently cross&#8208;linked networks make them non&#8208;recyclable, posing a significant sustainability challenge. Here, a novel closed&#8208;loop recycling approach for polyimide aerogels based on dynamic Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry is presented, utilizing an aerogel&#8211;sol&#8211;aerogel (ASA) process. Matrimid, a commercial polyimide, is post&#8208;functionalized with furfurylamine to form a furan&#8208;modified poly(amide&#8208;imide) (PAI&#8208;FU), which reacts with bismaleimide via a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to create a thermally reversible cross&#8208;linked aerogel network. The resulting poly(amide&#8208;imide) aerogels (PAIAs) exhibit low bulk density (&#8776; 0.15 g cm&#8722;3), high porosity (&gt; 87%), ultralow thermal conductivity (16.0 mWm&#8722;1K&#8722;1), excellent thermal stability (Td5% &#8776; 400&#160;&#176;C), and remarkable mechanical strength (&#8776; 3.4 MPa). More importantly, PAIAs can be depolymerized at elevated temperatures into soluble oligomers that can be reconstructed into fresh aerogels without catalysts or purification steps. The recycled PAIAs retain their nanostructural morphology and key aerogel&#8208;specific properties, demonstrating efficient closed&#8208;loop recycling. This approach paves the way for advanced and sustainable thermally superinsulating materials.

         <title>Bionic Nanogel Interfaces Unlock Long&#8208;Term Stability in Zn Metal Electrodeposition&#8208;Based Electrochromic Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;layer bionic nanogel interlayer is introduced on Zn and transparent electrodes. Each layer has unique functions: the top hydrophobic layer mitigates water corrosion and suppresses by products, the middle fluorinated layer ensures uniform Zn ion transport, and the bottom colloidal layer dynamically adapts to the substrate. This design greatly enhances electrochemical performance and stability for advanced electrochromic windows.

Abstract
Aqueous zinc (Zn) metal electrodeposition&#8208;based electrochromic windows (AZWs) are a promising dynamic window technology due to their use of low&#8208;cost, nonflammable, nontoxic, and highly conductive aqueous electrolytes. However, their development is hindered by issues such as poor reversibility, byproduct formation, and hydrogen evolution, which limit the optical window and cycling lifespan. Herein, a bionic transparent nanogel interlayer (TGI) in triple&#8208;layer structure introduced on both Zn electrode and indium tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode is demonstrated to achieve highly reversible electrochemical reaction. In the spontaneously formed triple&#8208;layer nanogel architecture, the top hydrophobic protective layer effectively mitigates water corrosion and suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions as well as byproduct formation. The middle layer incorporates internal fluorinated functional groups to promote uniform and rapid Zn ion transport. The bottom colloidal adhesion layer dynamically adapts to the substrate surface, preventing detachment due to morphology changes during cyclic Zn deposition/stripping processes. Consequently, the AZWs incorporating TGI@Zn and TGI@ITO glass electrodes exhibit excellent electrochemical properties and solar heat modulation abilities, which are attributed to their enhanced reversibility and uniform deposition of Zn ions. Compared with the single&#8208;layer interlayer, the three&#8208;layer structure design significantly improves the electrode's stability and performance, providing new ideas for designing next&#8208;generation AZW electrodes.

         <title>Dual Vacancy Engineering in Alloyed Ga&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cu&#8208;Se Quantum Dots for Photocatalytic 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Diformylfuran Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered strategy is developed to construct Ga&#8208;Zn co&#8208;doped CuSe quantum dots (GZC QDs) via cation exchange using CuSe as a template. By precisely introducing Cu and Se vacancies, the optimized sample efficiently facilitates the selective photocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), achieving an HMF conversion rate of 89% and a DFF selectivity of up to 91%.








Abstract
Highly &#8208;active/&#8208;selective photocatalytic biomass conversion is of great importance for achieving remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. However, serious challenges, e.g., limited photon utilization, high charge recombination, and sluggish/uncontrolled reaction kinetics, remain for further development in this area. Herein, a dual&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineering strategy is employed to regulate the Ga&#8208;Zn co&#8208;doped Ga&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cu&#8208;Se (GZC) quantum dots (QDs) by a cation exchange route utilizing the CuSe template. The optimized GZC QDs exhibit excellent photocatalytic performances for the selective oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), with 89% HMF conversion and 91% DFF selectivity. Advanced ex situ/in situ characterizations, together with theoretical calculations, reveal the origins of the excellent performance: i) Zn doping enhances charge carrier mobility, thereby promoting the HMF&#8208;to&#8208;DFF conversion rate; ii) Ga doping introduces intermediate states in electronic structure, facilitating better charge separation/transfer; iii) Ga/Zn co&#8208;introduction results in formation of Se/Cu vacancies, which play a critical role in charge separation and reactive oxygen species generation. Overall, the research exhibits a rational strategy for designing vacancy&#8208;engineered photocatalysts, offering a promising approach for selective biomass conversion.

         <title>Advanced Thermal Interface Materials: Insights into Low&#8208;Temperature Sintering and High Thermal Conductivity of MgO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MgO has emerged as a promising candidate for improving thermal management in battery systems owing to its high thermal conductivity. In this study, it is demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of MgO is historically underestimated due to previously overlooked material behaviors. Furthermore, MgO&#8208;based TIMs can make a significant contribution to EV safety due to their excellent heat dissipation properties.








Abstract
The escalating frequency of electric vehicle (EV) fires has underscored the critical importance of effective thermal&#8208;management in battery package (TMBP). A key challenge in current TMBP lies with the low thermal conductivity (TC, 3&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) of commercial alumina&#8208;polymer composite (thermal interface materials, TIM). While magnesia (MgO) TIMs, which show high TC (8&#8211;10&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, this study) and low cost, are emerging as an alternative heat&#8208;dissipation material (HDM), their full potential remains untapped. Here, the development of novel MgO (&#8805; 80&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and MgO TIMs is presented as next&#8208;generation HDMs, designed to outperform conventional alumina (20&#8211;30&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and alumina TIMs. Crucially, the fundamental mechanisms enabling our new MgO to achieve an unprecedented TC of &#8805; 80&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 are elucidated, significantly surpassing the previously reported range of 40&#8211;60&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. This study provides fundamental insights into achieving such high thermal conductivity in MgO. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this novel MgO TIM cools EV batteries three times faster than commercial alternatives, offering a robust solution for effective EV fire prevention. Consequently, this high&#8208;TC MgO is poised to contribute significantly to enhancing EV safety.

         <title>Visualization of Thermal&#8208;Induced Degradation Pathways of High&#8208;Ni Cathode: a Comparative Study in Solid Chloride and Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes face challenges like oxygen release and thermal instability at high temperatures. In&#8208;situ heating STXM&#8208;ptychography reveals opposite degradation pathways in solid and liquid electrolytes: core&#8208;to&#8208;surface in solids and surface&#8208;to&#8208;core in liquids. Degradation correlates with particle size, with solid electrolytes stabilizing smaller particles. These findings emphasize electrolyte chemistry's role in thermal stability and safer battery design.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;rich&#8208;layered oxide cathodes are promising candidates for enhancing the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Higher energy density leads to severe oxygen release, poor thermal stability, and safety risks, as exothermic side reactions induce complex structural and chemical transformations at elevated temperatures. Herein, in&#8208;situ heating scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM)&#8208;ptychography to directly investigate the thermal degradation pathways of charged LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 in both solid chloride and liquid electrolytes is employed. A key finding is the opposite spatial degradation behavior: in solid electrolytes, oxygen loss and Ni reduction occur from the core to surface, while in liquid electrolytes, the degradation proceeds from surface to core. These observations are closely linked to the local structural disorder around Ni atoms, as oxygen loss directly weakens the Ni&#9472;O bonding environment, promoting the reduction of Ni and accelerating lattice instability at high temperatures. Additionally, the extent of degradation is found to correlate with particle size, with solid electrolytes effectively stabilizing smaller particles. These results reveal strong spatial heterogeneity in thermal degradation and highlight the critical role of electrolyte chemistry in dictating thermal stability. Our study provides new insights into the structural and chemical evolution of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes under thermal stress, offering valuable guidance for the design of safer, high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity in Ultra&#8208;Thin p&#8208;Type BiCuSeO Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D BiCuSeO films, grown using molecular beam epitaxy, demonstrate a well&#8208;defined crystal structure and robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity. Intrinsic ferroelectric transitions have been uncovered through piezoelectric force microscopy signals, which exhibit typical butterfly curves in amplitude and 180&#176; phase switching. This is further corroborated by the processes involved in writing and reading ferroelectric domains within the BiCuSeO films.








Abstract
Atomically thin 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductors, where polarization switching transpires within the channel material itself, are pivotal to advancing the next generation of high&#8208;performance electronics. Nevertheless, the challenge remains in either the controllable synthesis of films or the manipulation of associated ferroelectricity. Here, 2D p&#8208;type BiCuSeO (BCSO) films with a thickness down to &#8776;3 nm are successfully synthesized using molecular beam epitaxy. The room&#8208;temperature (RT) out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity is confirmed by piezoelectric force microscopy, showing robust ferroelectric switching capability. Insights derived from density functional theory, coupled with the ferroelectric dipole map in cross&#8208;sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy images, suggest that the polar displacement of [CuSe] layers under electric fields primarily contributes to ferroelectricity in the BCSO film. Furthermore, the switching behavior of the BCSO&#8208;based ferroelectric tunnel junction has been clarified, exhibiting distinct ON and OFF states. Our results illustrate that such an ultrathin RT ferroelectric semiconductor could serve as a versatile material for future multifunctional electronic devices.

         <title>Dimensional Crossover Engineering in MoS2/Organic Superlattices Breaks the zT Barrier for 2D Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered microelectronics require thermoelectric devices (TEDs) with high efficiency and silicon compatibility. This study overcomes these challenges using dimensionally engineered MoS2/organic superlattices that facilitate electrical transport and reduce thermal conductivity. A record zT of 0.6 at 373 K is achieved&#8212;12 times higher than monolayer MoS2&#8212;enabling integration of high&#8208;performance 2D TEDs into microchips for Internet of things and wearables.








Abstract
The rapid development of self&#8208;powered microelectronics demands thermoelectric devices (TEDs) that can simultaneously achieve high energy conversion efficiency and silicon micro&#8208;fabrication compatibility. While for conventional bulk TEs, their incompatibility with silicon micro&#8208;manufacturing restricts microelectronic integration. 2D materials, though CMOS&#8208;fabrication&#8208;friendly and widely explored for microelectronic devices, face critical limitations in thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency due to their low zT values (&lt;0.2) stemming from unfavorable thermal conductivity&#8208;power factor tradeoffs. These challenges are overcome through orbital&#8208;property&#8208;driven dimensional engineering of hybrid MoS2/organic superlattices, which synergistically enhances electrical transport while suppressing thermal conductivity. Strain&#8208;adaptive intercalation of tert&#8208;butylamine (TBA) molecules creates MoS2 bilayer superlattices exhibiting an electronic structure crossover between monolayer&#8208;like and bulk&#8208;like characteristics, thereby maximizing the density of states near the Fermi level. The optimized MoS2 bilayer/TBA hybrid superlattice achieves a breakthrough zT of 0.6 at 373 K &#8211; 12&#8208;fold higher than monolayer counterparts and 100&#215; surpassing bulk crystals. This represents the highest experimentally reported zT for 2D material&#8208;based TEDs, approaching performance benchmarks of commercial bulk TEs. The work establishes a paradigm of dimensional engineering in hybrid superlattices, thus enabling integration of high&#8208;efficiency 2D materials&#8208;based TEDs into silicon microelectronics&#8211;a critical step toward self&#8208;powered IoT systems and wearable technologies.

         <title>High Latent&#8208;Heat, Soft yet Robust Crystalline Salogels via Dual&#8208;Network Design and Solvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;network and solvent engineering strategy utilizing in situ polymerization in salt hydrates achieves flexible crystalline salogels with high latent heat, overcoming challenges of crystalline rigidity for flexible application. The soft yet robust salogels PCMs exhibit long&#8208;term thermal cycling stability, proving an efficient, cost&#8208;effective platform for thermal and temperature management systems.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;liquid phase change materials (PCMs) hold great promise for addressing challenges in thermal energy storage and temperature management. Yet, they suffer from severe issues of melting leakage and crystalline rigidity in practical applications. Here, an approach is proposed to achieve flexible, high&#8208;latent heat PCMs with intrinsic softness and toughness in the crystalline state through the combination of dual polymer networks and inorganic salt hydrates. This strategy constructs salogels via in situ polymerization, leveraging strong polymer&#8211;ion&#8211;water interactions and introducing excess water to form a solvated polymer network embedded within crystalline salt hydrates. The prepared crystalline salogels demonstrated high energy density (&#8710;Hm, 179&#8211;209 J g&#8722;1) with ultra&#8208;soft (E, 0.05&#8211;5&#160;MPa) yet strong (&#963;b, 1&#8211;3&#160;MPa) and tough (&#915;, 2&#8211;6&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) mechanical performance, along with low contact thermal resistance (Rc = 0.03 cm2 K W&#8722;1). The fabricated thermal management devices present both phase&#8208;change&#8208;driven heat absorption and hygroscopicity&#8208;driven moisture absorption, enabling highly efficient thermal regulation, with a 10&#160;&#176;C reduction observed in a lab suit fitted with a 25 &#215; 15 &#215; 0.5&#160;cm3 salogel patch over 1&#160;h compared to one without the patch. This work provides guidelines for designing crystalline&#8208;flexible yet robust salogels from cost&#8208;effective salt hydrates for advanced thermal management applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision 3D Doping of Fused Silica Glass Derived from Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local integration of dopants enables the selective modification of color, luminescence or refractive index within a three&#8208;dimensionally shaped glass with micron resolution. Following the fabrication of porous glass preforms and infusion with a dopant mixture, the dopant is immobilized by lithographic techniques and subsequently debinded and sintered. This enables to integrate functions in complex&#8208;shaped glass components.








Abstract
Glasses are utilized for their outstanding optical, mechanical, and thermal properties. However, conventional production methods mostly yield in glasses with uniform compositions and material properties. Here a novel lithographic approach is presented for high&#8208;resolution 3D dopant integration at defined positions, which enables property modifications in specific regions. For this, a porous glass matrix derived from nanocomposites is shaped using 3D printing or injection molding. Using volumetric 3D printing like computed axial or two&#8208;photon lithography, doping is performed within the porous glass using photocurable metal oxide precursors. The dopant is then permanently integrated within the glass during a final sintering step. The local integration of dopants like Ti4+, Co2+, Eu3+ or Tb3+ allow to selectively change the color, luminescence or refractive index within a 3D&#8208;shaped glass with micron resolution. The process enables a wide range of novel applications from integrated optics and photonics to mass customization, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information storage.

         <title>Dynamic Regulation for the Well&#8208;Distribution of Electrons and Zn2+ Ions Achieving Uniform Zn Redox in Ah&#8208;Scale Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneer a strategy to dynamically regulate electrons and Zn2+ ions for uniform Zn redox, in which a series of additive molecules with varying electron delocalized spaces are designed to verify this dynamic regulation mechanism. Thanks to the dynamic regulation, Zn&#8208;halogen and Zn&#8208;manganese Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells exhibit favorable rate performance and cycle stability.








Abstract
Uneven distribution of the electric field and zinc ion (Zn2+), and crosstalk effects all lead to irreversible redox of Zn, eventually accelerating the failure of various Zn&#8208;metal energy storage devices, especially Ah&#8208;scale pouch batteries. This study pioneers a strategy to dynamically regulate electrons and Zn2+ ions for uniform Zn redox, in which a series of additive molecules with varying electron delocalized spaces is designed to verify this dynamic regulation mechanism. Due to the large electron delocalized space, the additives with delocalized &#960;&#8208;bonds and &#8210;COOH form a stable molecular layer for the Zn anode. This layer can effectively prevent side reactions and dynamically regulate the arrangement of electrons and Zn2+ ions by driving electrons to flow among conjugated atoms and functional groups, ultimately evening out the electric field and reaction sites of Zn2+ ions during the Zn redox process. Thanks to this dynamic regulation, the Ah&#8208;scale Zn//I2 pouch cell exhibits a high capacity of 1.473 Ah (188.7 Wh kg&#8722;1) at 2 mA cm&#8722;2 and outstanding rate performance. This dynamic regulation also presents great compatibility with Zn&#8208;manganese pouch cells and Zn&#8208;bromine cells. This work deepens the understanding of the regulation mechanism for highly reversible Ah&#8208;scale AZIBs.

         <title>Soft Robotic Engines with Non&#8208;Reciprocal Motion by Physical Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Movement is vital, and it requires breaking symmetry. This study introduces a hydrogel engine that achieves non&#8208;reciprocal motion through kinetic asymmetry in repeated actuation cycles. This approach for breaststroke&#8208;swimming&#8208;like motion is embedded inside the material and establishes a new paradigm of physical intelligence for soft robotics.








Abstract
Movement is essential for living systems, enabling access to food, habitats, or escape from threats. Across scales, a key unifying principle is symmetry breaking to achieve non&#8208;reciprocal motion and accumulate work. In soft robotics, many actuators mimic biological responsiveness, but they typically exhibit reciprocal motion, where forward work is canceled in the return stroke &#8211; preventing work accumulation in cyclic operation. Here, a simple and broadly applicable hydrogel engine concept is presented that overcomes this limitation by encoding kinetic asymmetry into swelling and deswelling transitions. This hard&#8208;coded asymmetry yields non&#8208;reciprocal motion trajectories, enabling continuous mechanical work extraction under a single, uniform stimulus &#8211; without complex external control. The strategy embodies a material&#8208;based ratchet mechanism rooted in physical intelligence, independent of geometry or scale, and generalizable across stimuli. This hydrogel engine is implemented in soft robotic systems, including artificial cilia for fluid pumping and conveyor belts for object transport. Starting from macroscopic thermoresponsive systems, the design is extended to microscale formats via 3D printing and to other stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. This approach shifts the paradigm in soft robotics &#8211; from increasing chemical complexity to leveraging intrinsic material properties for emergent function &#8211; paving the way for scalable, autonomous systems driven by physical intelligence.

         <title>Linear and Symmetric Artificial Synapses Driven by Hydrogen Bonding for Accurate and Reliable Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven interface engineering enables highly linear and symmetric artificial synapses based on CsPbI3&#8211;PVA hybrids. This strategy suppresses trap states and guides directional ion migration, yielding stable optoelectronic plasticity. The devices achieve ultralow power operation and human&#8208;like learning in neuromorphic networks, offering a scalable route for edge AI and cognitive computing systems.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing addresses the von Neumann bottleneck by integrating memory and processing to emulate synaptic behavior. Artificial synapses enable this functionality through analog conductance modulation, low&#8208;power operation, and nanoscale integration. Halide perovskites with high ionic mobilities and solution processabilities have emerged as promising materials for such devices; however, inherent stochastic ion migration and thermal instability lead to asymmetric and nonlinear characteristics, ultimately impairing their learning and inference capabilities. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface engineering strategy to stabilize CsPbI3 artificial synapses. Density functional theory calculations and experimental analyses indicate that the hydroxyl groups in PVA form robust O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I&#8722; bonds with surface iodides, promoting vertical lattice ordering. This suppresses grain boundary defects and enables directional ion migration, resulting in extremely linear and symmetric optoelectronic conductance modulation (&#945;p = 0.004, &#945;d = 0.020), over eight fold reduction in interfacial trap density, and high&#8208;temperature retention (&gt;104 s). When integrated into a neural network, artificial synapses show large&#8208;scale image classification accuracy within 1.62% of the theoretical limit. The proposed strategy provides a scalable pathway toward overcoming the existing limitations of artificial synapses, exhibiting high potential for application in edge AI, autonomous systems, and material&#8208;based cognitive modeling.

         <title>Flexible Living Artificial Dura Mater for Efficient Therapy of Central Nervous System Injury Based on Neuronal Differentiation and Neuroprotective A2 Astrocyte Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
A flexible living artificial dura mater, which composed of &#8220;living&#8221; neural stem cell coating and flexible Au nanostrips patch, shows optimal interface integration with tissue, improves the immune microenvironment of defect site, promotes the survival and differentiation of NSCs in harsh inflammatory environment, and exerts positive therapeutic effects on the recovery of sensory and motor neural circuits after spinal cord injury.








Abstract
Central nervous system (CNS) injury is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. To prevent secondary cascade damages to CNS caused by dural defects, the repair of dural defects is an essential step in CNS injury treatment. Although various artificial dura maters have been developed, unfortunately, no one exerting positive therapeutic effects for CNS injury repair. Here, we suggested a flexible &#8220;living&#8221; artificial dura mater as a general strategy for CNS injury treatment by integrating the neural stem cells (NSCs) therapy and electrical stimulation. Under a rotating magnetic field based on magnetoelectric induction, NSCs seeded on a specially designed flexible patch with Au nanostrips produced therapeutic benefits to CNS injury. In vitro experiments prove that the magnetic field&#8208;driven Au nanostrips&#8208;mediated wireless electrical stimulation not only effectively accelerates NSCs differentiating into mature neurons with complex synaptic connections, but also induces astrocytes directionally activating into neuroprotective A2 reactive astrocytes. In vivo experiments with traumatic brain or spinal cord injury models confirm that the flexible living artificial dura mater shows optimal interface integration with tissue, effectively improving the immune microenvironment of the defect site, promoting the survival and differentiation of NSCs, and aiding the recovery of motor neural circuits after injury.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Mechano Symbiosis Dual&#8208;Mode Janus Bioaerogel for Context&#8208;Adaptive Atmospheric Water Harvesting Beyond Solar Reliance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar&#8208;mechano symbiosis dual&#8208;mode bio&#8208;based Janus aerogel (DBJA), capable of efficient atmospheric water harvesting beyond solar dependency, is created. The inherent hygroscopicity from the bio&#8208;based matrix and strongly anchored LiCl endow DBJA with excellent moisture harvesting capacity. The DBJA demonstrates outstanding advantages in solar&#8208;independent operation, adsorption, desorption, sustainability, and scalability.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SS&#8208;AWH) offers promise for addressing global freshwater scarcity. However, the SS&#8208;AWH heavily relies on favorable and sustained solar irradiation; yet real&#8208;world solar irradiation exhibits significant spatiotemporal fluctuations, limiting its sustainable application, as non/low&#8208;light conditions sharply reduce water productivity. This constraint is fundamentally due to the singleness of the water release pathway via photothermal desorption. Here, a novel dual&#8208;mode bio&#8208;based Janus aerogel (DBJA) is presented, enabling efficient, all&#8208;weather, multi&#8208;scenario atmospheric water harvesting via selectively solar&#8208;driven and compression&#8208;activated water release.

     alt="Solar-Mechano Symbiosis Dual-Mode Janus Bioaerogel for Context-Adaptive Atmospheric Water Harvesting Beyond Solar Reliance"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solar-mechano symbiosis dual-mode bio-based Janus aerogel (DBJA), capable of efficient atmospheric water harvesting beyond solar dependency, is created. The inherent hygroscopicity from the bio-based matrix and strongly anchored LiCl endow DBJA with excellent moisture harvesting capacity. The DBJA demonstrates outstanding advantages in solar-independent operation, adsorption, desorption, sustainability, and scalability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar-driven sorption-based atmospheric water harvesting (SS-AWH) offers promise for addressing global freshwater scarcity. However, the SS-AWH heavily relies on favorable and sustained solar irradiation; yet real-world solar irradiation exhibits significant spatiotemporal fluctuations, limiting its sustainable application, as non/low-light conditions sharply reduce water productivity. This constraint is fundamentally due to the singleness of the water release pathway via photothermal desorption. Here, a novel dual-mode bio-based Janus aerogel (DBJA) is presented, enabling efficient, all-weather, multi-scenario atmospheric water harvesting via selectively solar-driven and compression-activated water release. The Janus structure optimizes mass/heat transfer between hygroscopic and photothermal domains, achieving the most balanced adsorption&#8211;desorption kinetics and compression-recovery strength for solar-mechano symbiosis. Under favorable sunlight, DBJA demonstrates a competitive water release efficiency of 1.32 g g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; outdoors. Crucially, without solar irradiation, DBJA achieves a total water productivity of 12.80 g g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over 5-cycle adsorption-compression with 98% volume recovery and is stable within 50 cycles. Enhanced physical inlay and multiple chemical interactions ensure limited leakage of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions during compression, and the collected water easily conforms to the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water standards. This work provides a flexible approach for sustainable atmospheric water harvesting beyond solar reliance through multi-mode synergy and gradient architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This research proposes a unique high&#8208;entropy perovskite&#8208;based (HEP) tri&#8208;phase composite, (La0.2Sr0.2Pr0.2Ba0.2Ce0.2)0.7CoO3&#8208;&#948;, using a one&#8208;pot sol&#8208;gel method. This marks the first demonstration of a HEP material functioning as an active and durable air electrode in large&#8208;area (10&#215;10 cm2) solid oxide cells, demonstrating high performance and stability and underscoring its substantial potential for energy conversion and storage applications.








Abstract
Reversible solid oxide cells (R&#8208;SOCs) are promising for energy applications but face limitations due to poor durability and slow oxygen&#8208;reduction/evolution reactions at air electrodes. Here, a high&#8208;entropy perovskite&#8208;based (HEP) tri&#8208;phase composite, (La0.2Sr0.2Pr0.2Ba0.2Ce0.2)xCoO3&#8208;&#948;, comprising an A&#8208;site deficient La0.2Sr0.2Pr0.2Ba0.2Ce0.2CoO3&#8208;&#948;, doped&#8208;CeO2, and Co3O4 phases are presented. The HEP phase provides catalytic sites and robust frameworks, the doped&#8208;CeO2 phase enhances oxygen&#8208;ion transport; and the Co3O4 nanoparticles offer additional active sites. The optimized (La0.2Sr0.2Pr0.2Ba0.2Ce0.2)0.7CoO3&#8208;&#948; electrode exhibits promising electrochemical performance: a low area&#8208;specific resistance of 0.058 &#937; cm2 at 700&#160;&#176;C and enhance stability (a 2&#8208;fold improvement in ambient air, a 6&#8208;fold enhancement in moisture resistance, and a 3&#8208;fold increase in Cr tolerance compare to (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#120575;). When applied as an air electrode for R&#8208;SOCs, it delivers excellent performance at 800&#160;&#176;C: a peak power density of 1.68&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in fuel cell (FC); a current density of 1.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.2&#160;V in electrolysis cell (EC). Significantly, this work represents the first application of a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;oxide&#8208;based material as an air electrode in large&#8208;area R&#8208;SOCs (10&#215;10 cm2). The assembled R&#8208;SOC achieves an output of 61&#160;W in FC and 66 A at 1.18&#160;V in EC at 800&#160;&#176;C, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

         <title>A Shape&#8208;Recovery Polycationic Fibroin for Hemostasis&#8208;Regeneration Transition by Recapitulating Natural Coagulation Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by fibrin's characteristics during coagulation, an artificial polycationic fibroin (pCSF/&#946;) recapitulates natural coagulation networks by replicating the aggregation state and maturation process of fibrin through intermolecular interaction and subsequent strain hardening originating from ethanol&#8208;inducing &#946;&#8208;sheet, which achieves hemostasis&#8208;regeneration transition.









Abstract
Large&#8208;scale and deep trauma restricts the effective hemostasis and tissue regeneration management, even causing death. The formation of the fibrin network is the initial stage of wound control. Inspired by Fn's characteristics during coagulation, an artificial polycationic fibroin (pCSF/&#946;) is designed to achieve hemostasis&#8208;regeneration transition. pCSF/&#946; replicates the aggregation state and maturation process of Fn through intermolecular interaction and subsequent strain hardening originating from ethanol&#8208;inducing &#946;&#8208;sheet to recapitulate natural coagulation networks, achieving mechanical reinforcement and shape recovery. Proteomics and transcriptomics analyses reveal that pCSF/&#946; connects hemostasis and regeneration through platelet contents&#8217; release and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The results of incompressible hemostasis, large&#8208;area skin repair, and penetrating liver regeneration in animal models such as minipigs confirm pCSF/&#946; is superior to clinical products in rapid hemostasis and synchronous tissue regeneration. The molecular design of pCSF/&#946; provides new insights for developing biomaterials in rapid hemostasis and simultaneous regeneration.

n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs, utilizing Cu self&#8208;doping and DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 modified, can achieve decoupling and optimize thermal and electrical transport properties, thereby enhancing the TEC effect. Additionally, the presence of Cu at the Zn sites increases carrier concentration and enhances POD&#8208;like activity. When combined with ferroptosis, these features lead to efficient ROS generation and GSH depletion, resulting in satisfactory therapeutic efficacy.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technology, a rapidly advancing field in medical therapy, encounters challenges in achieving efficient thermal and electrical transport properties within the limited thermal range compatible with biological systems. This study presents a high&#8208;performance thermoelectric catalytic therapy (TECT) utilizing Cu self&#8208;doped Cu2+xZn1&#8208;xSnSe4 nanosheets synthesized with non&#8208;stoichiometric ratios modified with DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 (n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs). Under 808 nm laser irradiation, n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs demonstrate an impressive photothermal conversion efficiency of 47.62%, rapidly establishing a significant local temperature gradient. This increase in temperature initiates thermoelectric catalysis (TEC), effectively generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are toxic to cancer cells. The thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs at room temperature is observed to be 45.45% higher than that of pure phase CZTSe. Experimental results, supported by density functional theory calculations, reveal that lattice disorder and the presence of highly degenerate electronic bands at the band edges decouple thermal and electrical transport, enhancing the TEC effect. The additional copper ions at zinc sites increase carrier concentration, hole conductivity, and peroxidase&#8208;like activity, thereby enhancing ROS production, depleting glutathione, accelerating lipid peroxidation, and inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4, ultimately inducing ferroptosis in cancer cells. Consequently, a synergistic TECT and ferroptosis effect is achieved, resulting in significant anti&#8208;cancer efficacy.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Bi Catalytic Pair Enables Selective Superoxide Radical Generation for Simultaneous Removal of Organic Pollutants and Heavy Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new oxygen activation regulation catalyst, with a Zn&#8208;Bi catalytic pair with a double d10 electronic configuration, and a model for the synergistic treatment of complex water pollutants, is constructed. This catalytic system can selectively activate O2 to generate superoxide radicals, thereby achieving efficient synergistic removal of Cr(VI) and ciprofloxacin.








Abstract
Manipulating exciton dissociation and charge&#8208;carrier transfer processes to selectively generate redox&#8208;capable superoxide (O2&#8226;&#8722;) for the removal of antibiotic&#8208;heavy metal&#8208;combined pollutants is challenging. To address this issue, a Zn&#8208;Bi catalytic pair with a dual d10 electronic configuration is constructed. The incorporation of Zn atoms into the lattice results in the formation of a Zn&#8208;Ov&#8208;Bi defect structure, thereby enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field by 5.1 times. This synergistically promotes exciton dissociation at oxygen vacancies and the directional migration of carriers. This strategy achieves an excellent charge mobility (3.76 ps) and selective activation of O2 to O2&#8226;&#8722; (selectivity: 86.6%, 2.01 mmol L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, an increase of 2.57 times). Owing to the unique charge separation mechanism, ZBOB performs excellently in the treatment of complex environmental pollutants, with simultaneous removal rates of ciprofloxacin and Cr(VI) reaching 0.55 and 0.41 min&#8722;1, respectively, which are four and three times higher than those of the unmodified catalyst, respectively. The catalyst exhibits excellent cycling performance and stability for the simultaneous removal of ciprofloxacin and Cr(VI). These findings highlight the mechanisms underlying the charge transfer and selective generation of free radicals and provide valuable insights for the design of more efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>Robust Flexible Superhydrophobic Film with Skin&#8208;Inspired Gradient Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable, robust, flexible superhydrophobic film with skin&#8208;inspired gradient design is successfully proposed by utilizing a force&#8208;engineered wool rolling technique, which facilitates the nanoparticle engulfment in polymer by pressure, electrostatic force, and enhanced capillary force. The resulting superhydrophobic film demonstrates excellent freestanding flexibility, mechanical robustness, weather resistance, and anti&#8208;icing performance.








Abstract
Flexible superhydrophobic materials are attractive in separation technology, thermal management, anti&#8208;icing, and wearable electronics since their adaptability to curved surfaces and deformation. However, their fragility and high susceptibility to abrasion, caused by the destruction of micro/nano structures, remain significant challenges. A skin&#8208;inspired gradient design is proposed to combine flexibility and superhydrophobicity by facilitating the nanoparticle engulfment in polymer through pressure, electrostatic forces, and enhanced capillary forces. The resulting freestanding superhydrophobic film demonstrates remarkable flexibility and robust superhydrophobicity against strain (70%), stretching or bending (&gt;5000 cycles), Taber abrasion (400 cycles), UV aging (&gt;1500 h), and salt spray corrosion (&gt;40 days). Combined with the low thermal conductivity, it exhibits high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;icing (icing delay time of &#8776;320 s) and durable de&#8208;icing (ice adhesion strength of &#8776;45 kPa, with no significant alterations over 20 icing/de&#8208;icing cycles). Additionally, its skin&#8208;like breathability and sensing support underwater electronics. This skin&#8208;inspired gradient strategy offers a promising paradigm for engineering freestanding, flexible, robust superhydrophobic materials design.

         <title>Near&#8208;Field Energy Transmission Mechanism of Switchable Quasi&#8208;Dipole Distribution in Triboelectric Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency near&#8208;field electrostatic energy transmission system is developed based on a switchable quasi&#8208;dipole distribution charge model at the triboelectric interface, enabling applications in a wireless air purification and conductive pattern mapping.








Abstract
Near&#8208;field energy transmission is important for wireless power supply in separated or isolated space. Electrostatic energy generated by triboelectrification is typically confined to the triboelectric interface and is hard to transmit in distance due to limited understanding of tribo&#8208;charge distribution and transfer behavior. Here, it is found that positive and negative tribo&#8208;charges spontaneously form a switchable quasi&#8208;dipole distribution at the dynamic triboelectric interface. Driven by the strong electric field of this quasi&#8208;dipole configuration, the extraction of electrostatic energy breaks traditional limitations and enables short&#8208;distance transmission through dielectric and air media, without the need for any auxiliary circuits. A high transmission efficiency of 65.2% is achieved through a 5&#160;mm dielectric medium by efficiently matching the electric field distribution with a collector structure and minimizing transmission loss. Finally, an air purification system and a conductor pattern mapping platform are developed by utilizing the wireless transmitted electrostatic energy, achieving air purification and diverse conductor pattern imaging under mechanical stimuli. This work provides an insight into the distribution and transmission of electrostatic energy, promoting its evolution from interfacial research toward spatial applications.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Modulated Asymmetric Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on MOF&#8208;Derived Carbon Enabling Durable Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric cobalt single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring Co&#8722;N3P1 active sites anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;phosphorus co&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Co&#8722;N&#8722;PC) derived from MOFs is rationally designed as an iodine cathode host, demonstrating enhanced iodine redox kinetics and cycling stability through synergistic electronic modulation and confinement effects, thus offering insights for long&#8208;life aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.








Abstract
The rational design of catalytic host materials with optimized electronic structures and confined architectures is crucial for addressing the shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics in aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. In this study, an asymmetric cobalt single&#8208;atom catalyst is developed by anchoring Co&#8722;N3P1 sites on a nitrogen&#8208;phosphorus co&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Co&#8722;N&#8722;PC) derived from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). The coordination engineering of Co centers via phosphorus incorporation disrupts the symmetry of conventional Co&#8722;N4 configurations, enhancing charge redistribution and reducing the energy barrier for iodine dissociation as confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Systematic optimization reveals that moderate Co and P doping balances active sites and electronic conductivity, achieving strong chemical adsorption of polyiodides while maintaining structural stability. In situ Raman and UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopies confirm effective confinement of iodine species and reversible iodine conversion. The optimized C3/I2 cathode exhibits exceptional cyclability, retaining a specific capacity of 100.6 mA h g&#8722;1 after 50,000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. Furthermore, practical applicability is demonstrated in flexible soft&#8208;pack batteries and 3D&#8208;printed/screen&#8208;printed micro&#8208;batteries, showing its potential for scalable energy storage. This work presents a heteroatom&#8208;modulation strategy for designing efficient catalytic hosts in conversion&#8208;type batteries.

Isoquinoline (C9H7N, 500 mg L&#8722;1) stabilizes Zn plating/stripping via surface adsorption and solvation shell modification in strongly acidic chloride&#8208;based electrolytes, enabling stability over 3650 cycles for electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 full batteries. It also facilitates a zinc metal anode&#8208;free design with &#8776;8 mAh cm&#8722;2 area capacity and &#8776;1.9 V discharge voltage, highlighting its critical role in advancing high&#8208;performance electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries hold great promise for energy storage applications owing to their high theoretical electromotive force and energy density. However, the zinc anode suffers from severe corrosion in strongly acidic electrolytes, leading to hydrogen evolution, low zinc utilization, and premature battery failure. To address these challenges, isoquinoline is introduced as an additive in a chloride&#8208;based acidic electrolyte. Isoquinoline molecules preferentially adsorb on the Zn surface and incorporate into the Zn2+ solvation sheath, thereby effectively suppressing zinc corrosion and enhancing Zn plating/stripping reversibility in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell configurations. At an optimized concentration of 500 mg L&#8722;1 isoquinoline, the modified electrolyte enables the electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 battery to achieve outstanding cycling stability, delivering 3650 cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of 98%, demonstrating highly competitive cycling performance among reported electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 systems. Furthermore, this electrolyte modulation supports the development of a zinc metal anode&#8208;free full cell, which delivers a high areal discharge capacity of &#8776;8 mAh cm&#8722;2 and maintains a stable discharge voltage plateau of &#8776;1.9 V. These findings underscore the pivotal role of isoquinoline in stabilizing the zinc interface and advancing the performance of electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries.

         <title>TriMag Microrobots: 3D&#8208;Printed Microrobots for Magnetic Actuation, Imaging, and Hyperthermia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TriMag microrobots are two&#8208;photon polymerized hydrogel structures embedded with in situ synthesized Fe3O4 and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, enabling magnetic actuation, high&#8208;resolution magnetic particle imaging (MPI), and efficient magnetothermal heating for deep&#8208;tissue biomedical interventions including tracking, navigation, and tumor ablation.








Abstract
Microrobots hold immense potential in biomedical applications, including drug delivery, disease diagnostics, and minimally invasive surgeries. However, two key challenges hinder their clinical translation: achieving scalable and precision fabrication, and enabling non&#8208;invasive imaging and tracking within deep biological tissues. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI), a cutting&#8208;edge imaging modality, addresses these challenges by detecting the magnetization of nanoparticles and visualizing superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs) with sub&#8208;millimeter resolution, free from interference by biological tissues. This capability makes MPI an ideal tool for tracking magnetic microrobots in deep tissue environments. In this study, &#8220;TriMag&#8221; microrobots are introduced: 3D&#8208;printed microrobots with three integrated magnetic functionalities&#8212;magnetic actuation, magnetic particle imaging, and magnetic hyperthermia. The TriMag microrobots are fabricated using an innovative method that combines two&#8208;photon lithography for 3D printing biocompatible hydrogel structures with in situ chemical reactions to embed the hydrogel scaffold with Fe3O4 nanoparticles for good MPI contrast and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles for efficient magnetothermal heating. This approach enables scalable, precise fabrication of helical magnetic hydrogel microrobots. The resulting TriMag microrobots, with the synergistic effects of Fe3O4 and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, demonstrate efficient magnetic actuation for controlled movement, precise imaging via MPI for imaging and tracking in biological fluid and organs, including porcine eye and mouse stomach, and magnetothermal heating for tumor ablation in a mouse model. By combining these capabilities, the fabrication and imaging approach provides a robust platform for non&#8208;invasive monitoring and manipulation of microrobots for transformative applications in medical treatment and biological research.

         <title>Design of Electrified Fiber Sorbents for Direct Air Capture with Electrically&#8208;Driven Temperature Vacuum Swing Adsorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through in&#8208;depth investigation of structure&#8208;performance interaction of air contactor material and process optimization, electrified fiber sorbent system capable of Joule heating is rationally designed for energy&#8208;efficient electrically&#8208;driven temperature vacuum swing adsorption for direct air capture.








Abstract
Joule heating is becoming accepted as a highly efficient regeneration technique for temperature vacuum swing adsorption in direct air capture (DAC). This acknowledgment arises from its ability to rapidly generate and transfer heat, along with the&#160;convenience of obtaining electrical power from renewable sources. This study presents a unique electrified fiber&#160;sorbent (i.e., e&#8208;fiber) design&#160;that facilitates Joule heating, enabling energy&#8208;efficient electrically&#8208;driven temperature&#8208;vacuum swing adsorption (e&#8208;TVSA) for DAC. The e&#8208;fiber sorbent is produced via a dip coating technique, in which a silver composite solution is applied to the surface of an open&#8208;porous polymer matrix. The resulting ultra&#8208;thin, interconnected porous conductive layer on the fiber surface not only minimizes the increase in diffusion resistance even after the surface coating process but also offers exceptionally low electrical resistance (0.5 &#937;&#160;cm&#8722;1). The e&#8208;fiber sorbent module achieves a desorption temperature of 110&#160;&#176;C in 80 s at 3&#160;V. Notably, only a 5% reduction in capacity is recorded following repeated&#160;cycles of e&#8208;TVSA at a CO2 concentration of 400&#160;ppm. The complicated nature of heat transfer processes is clarified caused by Joule heating in the e&#8208;fiber sorbent module through detailed case studies conducted with computational simulations, offering insights for design optimization and system engineering.

         <title>Stiffening Liquid Crystal Elastomers with Liquid Crystal Inclusions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of low molecular weight liquid crystals (LC) into liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) leads to a significant increase in their stiffness and output work density. Such remarkable stiffening is attributed to nanoscale phase&#8208;separation and the formation of induced&#8208;smectic domains in polydomain and monodomain LC&#8208;LCEs, respectively.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are promising building blocks for soft robots, given their large, programmable, reversible, and stimuli&#8208;responsive shape change. Enhancing LCEs&#8217; stiffness and toughness has been a longstanding desire previously explored by reinforcing them with fillers, crystalline microdomains, and interpenetrating polymer networks. While promising, these methods adversely affect molecular order and thermal strain. Here, a significant enhancement of the&#160;stiffness of LCEs is reported by loading them with low molecular weight liquid crystals (LMWLCs) without sacrificing thermal strain and molecular order. While pristine LCEs rapidly transition to a soft elastic plateau when strained from poly&#8208; to monodomain, LC&#8208;loaded samples (LC&#8208;LCEs) first experience a pronounced linear elasticity, followed by a soft elastic plateau at higher stresses. Further thermomechanical and X&#8208;ray analysis confirm the emergence of an additional mesophase in polydomain LC&#8208;LCEs, which evolves to short&#8208;range smectic (cybotactic) during the poly&#8208; to monodomain transition. Monodomain LC&#8208;LCEs show between 6.5&#8208; and 9.0&#8208;fold stiffness enhancement with improved molecular order and thermal strain. Their work densities are more than double that of pristine LCEs, with active thermal stroke of up to 25% under loads of over 2000 times their weight. Such remarkable behaviors are attributed to the interplay between post&#8208;polymerization phase separation of LCs and their strain&#8208;enhanced smectic ordering. The results suggest that LMWLC inclusion can be a simple yet robust method to significantly improve the mechanical properties of LCEs.

The design integrates tunable stiff polymer structures&#160;with soft, cell&#8208;laden hydrogels. The RCPatch withstands suturing, intraventricular pressure, and cardiac contraction in a large animal myocardial defect model. The patch prevents bleeding and enables partial hemodynamic restabilization, demonstrating its potential for myocardial repair.








Abstract
Cardiac patches to repair myocardial defects require mechanically stable materials that prevent bleeding and can be implanted via suturing. The current clinical standard, bovine pericardial patches (BPPs), serve this purpose but do not degrade or integrate with the myocardium, limiting their long&#8208;term effectiveness. Here, we present the reinforced cardiac tissue patch (RCPatch). This multimaterial patch comprises a stiffness&#8208;tuned, cardiomyocyte&#8208;infiltrated 3D metamaterial and a suturable, hydrogel&#8208;infiltrated mesh to reduce permeability and bleeding. Anisotropic metamaterials are designed and computationally optimized using a generative modeling approach and fabricated from poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) via volumetric 3D printing (VP). The metamaterial supports the infiltration of cardiomyocytes, which are viable and contract in vitro. The implantability and low blood permeability of the patch is enabled&#160;by adding a melt&#8208;electrowritten (MEW) mesh infiltrated with a fibrin hydrogel. In an acute large animal trial, the RCPatch was applied on an induced myocardial defect, where it withstood intraventricular blood pressure, prevented bleeding, and enabled hemodynamic restabilization (intraventricular pressure of 81 mmHg before, vs 66 mmHg after implantation). These findings establish a scalable framework for fabricating cardiac tissue patches that integrate mechanical reinforcement with biological function, offering a surgically implantable&#160;and future regenerative solution for intraventricular myocardial repair.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Thick&#8208;Film All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by a Blade&#8208;Coating Process Assisted by a Direct Nonuniform Electric Field</title>

         <dc:description>
This study addresses the challenge of fabricating efficient thick&#8208;film all&#8208;polymer solar cells for industrial production by introducing a non&#8208;contact DC field method during blade coating. The technique optimizes bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology with enhanced vertical phase separation, eventually achieving a record efficiency of 17.59%.








Abstract
The incorporation of thick active layers (&gt;300&#160;nm) is an essential requirement for wide&#8208;scale industrial production of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it is still challenging to achieve efficient thick film devices, in particular for all&#8208;polymer OSCs, which are generally considered the most stable type of OSCs. In this study, a simple yet effective method is introduced by using a direct current (DC) field to manipulate the morphology of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films within all&#8208;polymer OSCs during a blade coating process. By utilizing this method, a favorable vertical phase distribution is achieved, thereby effectively reducing the electron percolation threshold and enhancing the overall device performance. With this, an outstanding efficiency of 17.59% is achieved for thick&#8208;film all&#8208;polymer devices by blade&#8208;coating, which is the best performance in this category. This study introduces a non&#8208;contact DC field method aimed at mitigating the fabrication challenges encountered when transitioning thick&#8208;film all&#8208;polymer systems from laboratory to manufacturing settings, and will potentially contributing to the advancement of the OSC industrialization.

         <title>Band Structure Engineering to Optimize Spin&#8208;Wave Propagation in Weyl ferromagnet Co2MnGa1&#8208;xGex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Band structure engineering in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co2MnGa1&#8208;xGex enables deterministic control over spin&#8208;wave propagation with ultra&#8208;low magnetic damping. Compositional tuning of the Fermi level yields an optimum Gilbert damping of 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and a spin&#8208;wave decay length over 100 &#181;m. This work unlocks the magnonic dimension of Weyl semimetal Co2MnGa1&#8208;xGex, developing a multi&#8208;functional and versatile materials platform for magnonics.








Abstract
Spin waves, the quantized excitations of magnetic order, have been widely explored as low&#8208;power information carriers in conventional metallic systems (e.g., NiFe) and insulating materials like yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Recently, magnetic Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have emerged as a novel platform for magnonics, leveraging their unique band structures, strong spin&#8208;orbit interactions, and fertile topological behavior. Despite this potential, spin&#8208;wave dynamics in magnetic WSMs remain largely uncharted. In this work, this gap is addressed by investigating spin&#8208;wave propagation in epitaxial Co2MnGa1&#8208;xGex (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 1) thin films, a prototypical magnetic WSMs system. By changing the ratio between Ga and Ge, how band&#8208;structure engineering, specifically tuning the Fermi level into the minority&#8208;spin pseudogap is demonstrated, systematically modulates the electronic and magnetic properties to achieve ultralow Gilbert damping (&#8776;1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3) alongside long spin&#8208;wave decay lengths over 100 &#181;m. These results establish a generalizable strategy for optimizing spin&#8208;wave media while unlocking a materials platform to probe intertwined charge, spin and orbit, with profound implications for next&#8208;generation spintronic and magnonic technologies.

         <title>Engineered Biomimetic Nanovesicles Derived From Bone Marrow Stromal Cells With Innate Homing Capability for Targeted Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>

The biomimetic nanovesicles (mNVs) coated bone marrow targeted delivery system actively delivers core drugs into bone marrow.








Abstract
Precise delivery of pharmaceuticals administered to bone marrow for various bone diseases is challenging, given the bone marrow&#8208;blood barrier (MBB). Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) derived from bone marrow can naturally infiltrate the MBB and home to bone tissue. Here, biomimetic nanovesicles (namely mNVs) engineered with the extracted cell membrane from BMSCs are reported for homing delivery of different core nanomedicines to bone marrow. The cargo&#8208;loaded mNVs exhibited excellent bone targeting in crossing natural barriers is demonstrated to augment drug concentrations in bone marrow, and the bio&#8208;function of mNVs is verified in typical models of chronic metabolic bone disease and metastatic carcinoma. In the induced osteoporosis model, engineered mNVs deliver the nanocore of teriparatide&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid), forming a sustained&#8208;release system of teriparatide, which can significantly slow bone loss, maintain bone mass, and alleviate osteoporosis indicators. In osseous and systematic metastatic breast carcinoma models, the mNVs are employed to deliver DNA tetrahedron embedded doxorubicin and efficiently inhibit tumor progression and osteolytic lesions. This work suggests that high&#8208;efficiency bone marrow delivery of medications can be camouflaged by the cell membrane derived from BMSCs, initiating a new platform for bone targeting drug delivery for developing more effective therapeutics for bone diseases.

A biphasic Ni&#8208;MXene quantum&#8208;confined nanostructure (Ni&#8208;MJQD) serves as a Janus platform, simultaneously achieving high&#8208;performance energy storage and efficient catalytic oxidation. The unique architecture enables superior energy storage performance and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation&#8208;symbolizing &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; for sustainable energy and catalysis.








Abstract
The demand for sustainable energy storage and ecofriendly catalysts has intensified the search for advanced multifunctional materials. Herein, this work presents the synthesis and characterization of Janus Ni&#8208;MXene quantum dot (Ni&#8208;MJQD), a novel material architecture that exhibits high performance in supercapacitor and catalytic applications.

         <title>3D Ordered Macroporous Superstructures of High Entropy Hydroxide with Strong Orbital Coupling Enhancing Water/Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensionally ordered macroporous high&#8208;entropy hydroxides enhances mass transfer and active sites exposure, and enhance local OH&#8722; concentration and electric field strength, and the strong coupling between atomic orbitals facilitates electron transfer and promotes electrical activity, which shows high durability and corrosion resistance in water/seawater electrolysis with high current density.








Abstract
The water splitting performance is strongly influenced by intrinsic properties of the catalyst and the accessibility of the active center. Herein, high&#8208;entropy hydroxides (HEH) with 3D ordered macroporous (3DOM) structure are prepared by chemical etching method with rational design. The 3DOM structure can maximize the exposure of the active sites and also facilitates bubble transport. As demonstrated by finite element analysis, the 3DOM structure modifies the spatial curvature of the catalyst, resulting in the enrichment of OH&#8722;. Moreover, the strong orbital coupling of transition metals significantly regulates the electronic structure of the catalyst, selectively adsorbs OH&#8722; at Fe sites, and inhibits the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. Thanks to these characteristics, 3DOM&#8208;HEH&#8208;300 shows the best oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in 1 m KOH (182 mV@100 mA cm&#8722;2, 211 mV@500 mA cm&#8722;2), and stables operation of more than 400 h. Besides, in natural seawater, it also exhibits the best catalytic activity (245 mV@100 mA cm&#8722;2, 278 mV@500 mA cm&#8722;2), which is better than similar catalysts without 3DOM structure. This work verifies the great synergistic effect of high entropy and mass transfer on the performance of OER, which also provides a new idea for constructing high&#8208;performance electrodes.

         <title>Body&#8208;Coupled&#8208;Driven Object&#8208;Oriented Natural Interactive Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;mode 2D/3D interaction is realized through body&#8208;coupled energy transfer, achieving 200 &#181;m&#8208;resolution 2D calligraphy reconstruction and 200 mm&#8208;range 3D tracking with sub&#8208;millisecond mode switching for seamless cross&#8208;dimensional control. Meanwhile, an object&#8208;oriented human machine interaction (HMI)&#160;framework is proposed to enable multi&#8208;device interoperability by detecting electromagnetic signatures, resolving device isolation through bioinspired face&#8208;to&#8208;face interaction adaptable to metaverse digital twins.








Abstract
The metaverse progressively demands heightened sophistication in human&#8208;multi&#8208;machine collaboration, accelerating development of hybrid immersive 2D tactile and 3D spatial perception interfaces. However, current interfaces struggle with the precision and adaptability in complex human&#8208;multi&#8208;machine interaction scenarios. This paper presents a transparent stretchable sensing interface synergizing 2D tactile and 3D spatial perception through body&#8208;coupled electromagnetic coupling. Its bi&#8208;modal coupling (resistive coupling and capacitive coupling) mechanism enables micrometer&#8208;scale 2D tactile sensing alongside broad 3D spatial perception (200&#160;mm range). The contact mode achieves calligraphy&#8208;grade trajectory reconstruction (200 &#181;m precision) with force tactile sensing, while the non&#8208;contact mode recognizes 38 gestures at 97.11% accuracy. The interface's mechanical transparency and elasticity permit seamless integration on curved surfaces (e.g., gloves and clothes) without perceptual interference. An object&#8208;oriented human&#8208;machine interaction (HMI) framework is developed to enable single&#8208;interface control of multiple devices through electromagnetic signature recognition, enhancing collaborative efficiency. This work can inspire designs of smart interfaces in intelligent healthcare monitoring, industrial robotics coordination, and cross&#8208;domain augmented reality applications.

         <title>Microstructural Evolution Dynamics in Rapid Joule Heating Densification of High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of high&#8208;temperature rapid Joule heating combined with two&#8208;step sintering drives full densification while suppressing grain coarsening in high&#8208;Ni cathodes. By activating lattice and grain boundary diffusion over surface diffusion, this approach achieves dense microstructures without excessive grain growth, offering insights into the relationship between sintering dynamics and microstructural evolution, and guiding the synthesis of fully densified, high&#8208;energy density materials.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy density materials are essential for the advancement of next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which power a wide range of applications from portable electronics to electric vehicles. Among them, high&#8208;Nickel (Ni)&#160;layered oxide cathodes have emerged as promising candidates due to their high capacity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, pores and excessive grain growth in high&#8208;Ni layered oxides compromise energy density and mechanical integrity, while oversized grains hinder lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics, necessitating a sintering strategy that promotes densification without inducing abnormal grain growth. Here, a rapid Joule heating technique combined with two&#8208;step sintering is introduced that significantly improves the microstructural integrity of high&#8208;Ni cathodes. This approach enables fast densification while suppressing grain growth, resulting in cathodes with higher density, reduced porosity, and enhanced mechanical strength. Through in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), and 3D ptychography analysis, it is found that the rapid Joule&#8208;heated cathodes exhibit mitigated phase separation, suppressed pore evolution, and improved resistance to crack propagation. They deliver superior cycling stability, coulombic efficiency, and rate performance. These results provide insights into the relationship between sintering dynamics and microstructural evolution, offering guidelines for synthesizing fully densified, high&#8208;energy density materials.

         <title>Tailoring Solvation Structures via Precise Diluent Engineering for High&#8208;Rate 500 Wh kg&#8722;1 Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring solvation structures via precise diluent engineering, this electrolyte design enhances both energy density and rate capability for practical lithium metal batteries (LMBs). As a result, a 2.95 Ah Li&#8208;NCM811 pouch cell with an energy density of 518 Wh kg&#8722;1/985 Wh L&#8722;1 retains &gt;92% of the initial capacity over 107 cycles at 0.2&#160;&#160;C charge/1 C discharge.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs), featuring lithium metal anodes (LMAs) paired with high&#8208;voltage cathodes, are promising candidates for achieving energy densities exceeding 500 Wh kg&#8722;1. However, their commercialization is hindered by unstable interphases and insufficient Li+ transport kinetics, especially under high&#8208;rate conditions. Here, a hybrid diluent strategy is reported for diluted high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (DHCEs) that decouples Li+ solvation from interfacial stabilization by combining fluorinated aromatics with fluorinated ethers. Fluorinated aromatics promote efficient Li+ desolvation and fast transport, while fluorinated ethers provide high oxidative stability and robust interphase formation. Their combination produces a synergistic solvation environment, simultaneously enhancing ion transport, extending voltage tolerance, and stabilizing electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. The tailored electrolyte enables 0.78 Ah Li&#8208;NCM622 pouch cells to achieve over 300 cycles at 0.33C charge/0.66C discharge under practical conditions (Li: 50 &#181;m; NCM622: 20 mg cm&#8722;2; electrolyte: 3 g Ah&#8722;1). Furthermore, a 2.95 Ah Li&#8208;NCM811 pouch cell demonstrates an energy density of 518 Wh kg&#8722;1/985 Wh L&#8722;1 and retains over 92% of its initial capacity after 107 cycles at 0.2C charge/1C discharge.

&lt;p&gt;Tailoring solvation structures via precise diluent engineering, this electrolyte design enhances both energy density and rate capability for practical lithium metal batteries (LMBs). As a result, a 2.95 Ah Li-NCM811 pouch cell with an energy density of 518 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/985 Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; retains &amp;gt;92% of the initial capacity over 107 cycles at 0.2&#160;&#160;C charge/1 C discharge.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium metal batteries (LMBs), featuring lithium metal anodes (LMAs) paired with high-voltage cathodes, are promising candidates for achieving energy densities exceeding 500 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. However, their commercialization is hindered by unstable interphases and insufficient Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport kinetics, especially under high-rate conditions. Here, a hybrid diluent strategy is reported for diluted high-concentration electrolytes (DHCEs) that decouples Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation from interfacial stabilization by combining fluorinated aromatics with fluorinated ethers. Fluorinated aromatics promote efficient Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation and fast transport, while fluorinated ethers provide high oxidative stability and robust interphase formation. Their combination produces a synergistic solvation environment, simultaneously enhancing ion transport, extending voltage tolerance, and stabilizing electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. The tailored electrolyte enables 0.78 Ah Li-NCM622 pouch cells to achieve over 300 cycles at 0.33C charge/0.66C discharge under practical conditions (Li: 50 &#181;m; NCM622: 20 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;; electrolyte: 3 g Ah&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, a 2.95 Ah Li-NCM811 pouch cell demonstrates an energy density of 518 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/985 Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and retains over 92% of its initial capacity after 107 cycles at 0.2C charge/1C discharge. This work establishes a scalable and cost-effective electrolyte design strategy that directly addresses the key failure mechanisms of LMBs, offering a viable pathway toward practical high-energy and high-rate applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generalizable Porous Aromatic Framework&#8208;Included Polymer Membranes for Diffusion&#8208;Enhanced Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work contains a generalizable procedure for enhancing the gas permeability and aging resistance of polymer membranes without compromising selectivity by incorporating robust porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs). The PAF fillers are highly dispersible in a wide range of solvents, and amine&#8208;functionalization of the PAF enhances the plasticization resistance of the mixed&#8208;matrix membranes.








Abstract
Industrial separation processes account for 10&#8211;15% of global energy consumption. Membrane&#8208;based processes are less energy&#8208;intensive than traditional gas separation technologies; however, enhanced material separation performance and stability for numerous gas mixtures are needed for widespread industrial adoption. This work presents a generalizable strategy for preparing mixed&#8208;matrix gas separation membranes exceeding the performance upper bounds of existing polymer membranes for a wide variety of industrial gases. By incorporating robust porous aromatic framework (PAF) particles into various dense commercial polymer matrices, gas diffusivity and solubility can be enhanced. For diverse gas mixtures (e.g., CO2/N2, O2/N2, He/CH4, H2/N2, and C2H4/C2H6), the resulting composite membranes exhibit enhanced gas permeabilities&#8212;by as much as 520%&#8212;and largely unchanged selectivities even after 6 years of aging under simulated flue gas conditions. These improvements arise from the ultrahigh porosity, excellent chemical compatibility, and unique physicochemical properties of the embedded PAF particles. Functionalizing the PAFs with polyamines also enables composite membranes that achieve among the highest reported performances against plasticization, a common obstacle in commercializing gas separation membranes. Significantly, the PAF&#8208;1 particles are readily dispersible in various common membrane casting solvents, suggesting their broader utility as a filler for designing high&#8208;performance membranes for many industrial gas separations.

         <title>Universal NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Emitting Unimolecular Micelles with Tailorable Pharmacokinetic and Optical Properties for Adaptive Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses a long&#8208;standing challenge in optimizing the pharmacokinetics of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated phototheranostic materials by disrupting &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in polymer brush&#8208;engineered unimolecular micelles. Besides reducing nonspecific uptake, the blood circulation can be adjusted half&#8208;life over a 60&#8208;fold range and enhance the fluorescence emissions by unimolecular micelle designs, facilitating flexible imaging applications from detecting kidney dysfunction to identifying tumors.








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated fluorophores show great potential for NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;imaging owing to their superior brightness and photostability, yet their clinical translation has been hindered by suboptimal pharmacokinetics. To address this issue, a strategy is developed to tailor the in vivo behavior of &#960;&#8208;conjugate fluorophores by breaking &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in polymer brush&#8208;engineered unimolecular micelles. This approach marks a significant shift from traditional methods of tuning micelles, which rely on varying the hydrophilic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrophobic ratios and are often ineffective for &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems due to the dominance of &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. By disrupting &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in the unimolecular micelles, pharmacokinetics and photophysical properties can be precisely controlled by systematically varying the molecular weight and composition of the polymer brushes. Accordingly, the blood circulation half&#8208;life can be adjusted across a 60&#8208;fold range, and fluorescence emissions are improved by 47&#8208;fold, facilitating adaptive fluorophore applications from kidney dysfunction detection to tumor imaging. Additionally, the engineered unimolecular micelles exhibit reduced nonspecific uptake and improved tumor targeting efficiency, resulting in a 5&#8208;fold higher tumor&#8208;to&#8208;liver ratio than conventional &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked nano&#8208;aggregates. These findings offer a solid solution to the pharmacokinetic optimization issues and provide a new design principle for &#960;&#8208;conjugated phototheranostic materials.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Fe3+&#8208;Doped Dendritic Mesoporous Organosilica Nanocomposites as Ferroptosis Inducers for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>

The designed TME&#8208;responsive nanocomposites, based on Fe&#8208;DMOS NPs as a novel ferroptosis inducer and cornerstone to deliver CaO2&#8208;HA NPs, which enable release Fe3+, Ca2+, and H2O2 rapidly in TME for the activation of ferroptosis&#8208;mediated ICD. With the assistance of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1, the long&#8208;term anti&#8208;tumor immune response will be activated and effectively suppress the growth and metastasis of tumors.








Abstract
Dendritic mesoporous organosilica (DMOS) nanoparticles are widely used to transport therapeutic agents to cancer sites and rapidly release them owing to their rapid biodegradability in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the role of these DMOS nanoparticles as nanocarriers is limited, and their applications remain relatively simple. In this study, Fe3+&#8208;doped dendritic mesoporous organosilica (Fe&#8208;DMOS) nanoparticles are designed as a new type of ferroptosis inducer and are combined with sodium hyaluronate&#8208;modified calcium peroxide to form TME&#8208;responsive nanocomposites. The nanocomposites can effectively generate a large number of hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction between the released Fe3+ and self&#8208;compensated hydrogen peroxide, and mitochondrial injury caused by Ca2+ overload further promotes this process. Both Fe3+ and disulfide bonds can induce glutathione depletion, thus downregulating the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 and triggering lethal levels of lipid peroxidation products, further facilitating ferroptosis in tumor cells. Additionally, the ferroptosis&#8208;mediated process of immunogenic cell death promotes a long&#8208;term antitumor immune response to prevent metastasis of tumor cells with the assistance of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1). Fe&#8208;DMOS nanoparticles are synthesized with ferroptosis&#8208;inducing capabilities and established TME&#8208;responsive nanocomposites combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor to effectively improve tumor immunotherapy.

AlF3&#8208;PBI membranes with Lewis acid&#8208;modulated electronic structure enable high&#8208;performance alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow batteries. By reducing electron density on benzimidazole rings, AlF3 weakens interactions between charge&#8208;balance ions and polymer, achieving enhanced ionic conductivity. The optimized membrane delivers a high power density of 1000 mW cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over cycles at 140 mA cm&#8722;2, offering a novel strategy for durable grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow batteries (AZIFBs) are one of the promising aqueous redox chemistries for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, the energy efficiency (EE) and power density of batteries with low&#8208;cost polybenzimidazole (PBI) membranes are still limited due to the relatively poor ionic conductivity of PBI in an alkaline medium. Here, this study proposes a novel chemical approach for regulating the chemical environment of the PBI membrane. Specifically, AlF3, as a representative Lewis acid, is employed to reduce the electron cloud density of the benzimidazole (BI) ring, weaken the electrostatic interactions between the BI ring and charge&#8208;balancing ions, and thereby accelerate the diffusion of charge&#8208;balancing ions. Characterizations on the AlF3&#8208;PBI membranes reveal that the enhanced ion transport can be ascribed to decreased electron cloud density of BI rings and reduced ion diffusion resistance. Charge density difference analysis further illustrates the electron&#8208;withdrawing feature of AlF3 as a Lewis acid. AZIFBs using AlF3&#8208;PBI membrane demonstrate excellent rate capability from 40 to 240 mA cm&#8722;2 with EE of more than 80%, and an outstanding power density of nearly 1000 mW cm&#8722;2. The battery also performs decent cycle stability of 500 cycles at a high current density of 140 mA cm&#8722;2 with EE over 80%, resulting from the robust stability of the AlF3&#8208;PBI membrane and the reliability of the strategy. This study highlights the potential of Lewis acid&#8208;based chemical regulation to optimize PBI&#8208;based membranes, offering a new perspective for enhancing the performance of AZIFBs.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Optoelectronic Memristor with All&#8208;Optical Modulation for Microscopic Biological Motion Recognition</title>

         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared all&#8208;optical modulated optoelectronic memristor is constructed by combining upconversion nanoparticles with ZnO. Under the ultraviolet (350 nm) and near&#8208;infrared (980 nm) light stimulation, the device exhibits bidirectional synaptic plasticity, encompassing both excitatory and inhibitory responses. A series of logical functions with fault&#8208;tolerance capability and microscopic biological motion recognition is demonstrated here.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) synaptic devices are characterized by unique optical sensitivity and synaptic plasticity, possessing high potential to significantly broaden the visual spectrum accessible to humans. Moreover, these devices seamlessly integrate neuro&#8208;morphological computing with infrared optical communication, attracting significant attention for future low&#8208;power, high&#8208;efficiency neuromorphic visual systems. However, the irreversible optical response of most optical synapses under short&#8208;wavelength infrared light severely restricts the practical application of these devices. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a NIR optoelectronic memristor with all&#8208;optical modulation based on ZnO&#8208;upconversion nanoparticles (ZnO&#8208;UCNPs) nanocomposite film. The proposed device exhibits bidirectional light response characteristics under 350&#160;and 980&#160;nm light stimulations. The memristive mechanism can be attributed to the photothermal effect of upconversion nanoparticles in the nanocomposite film in conjunction with optical excitation in ZnO. Due to the all&#8208;optical plasticity, a series of logical functions with fault&#8208;tolerance capability, including are demonstrated in the proposed synaptic device. In addition, by leveraging the tissue&#8208;penetrating capability of NIR light, the proposed device can be used in microscopic biological motion detection tasks and edge detection functions. This work introduces a promising method for developing fully optically controlled memristors and advancing the field of neuromorphic vision.

         <title>Anchoring Redox Mediator on COFs for Efficient Solar to Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, Fe ions are first fixed on COFs skeleton to construct a novel 2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction (BWO/Fe/TP1C). The cycling of Fe3+/Fe2+ significantly improves the electron transfer rate. In addition, the construction of 2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction not only promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers but also ensures its high redox activity. As a result, 25% BWO/Fe/TP1C demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic performance, achieving a hydrogen evolution rate of 6.31 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, which surpasses most COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
To address severe carrier recombination in Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, redox mediators such as IO3&#8722;/I&#8722; or Fe3&#8314;/Fe2&#8314; are often introduced, yet their dispersion in solution causes instability, low electron transport efficiency and side reactions. Herein, an innovative Fe&#8208;coordinated 2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction composed of TpPa&#8208;1&#8208;COF (TP1C) and Bi2WO6 (BWO) is developed for efficient photocatalytic H2 production. Unlike traditional indirect Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, the Fe3+/Fe2+ mediator is firmly anchored on the skeleton of COFs, thus enhancing recyclability, charge migration and long&#8208;lasting stability, which is supported by extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and a range of electrochemical tests. In addition, the formation of 2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions not only retains high redox properties but also provides abundant active sites for photocatalytic reactions. Consequently, the photocatalytic H2 production rate of 25% BWO/Fe/TP1C reaches up to 6.31 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 without the addition of co&#8208;catalysts, being about 28.68 times as high as that of pure COFs and 2.3 folds over that of 25% BWO/TP1C, exceeding a host of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. The findings of this research highlight the potential of novel indirect Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions for advanced photocatalytic applications, offering a new pathway to overcome the limitations of traditional COF&#8208;based systems in hydrogen production.

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Brightness NIR&#8208;II Emission: Molecular Locking and Wrapping Strategies in Fluorescent Material Design for in Vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a molecular design strategy for bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores by addressing fluorescence quenching and low absorption in aggregates. Through structural optimization of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor small molecules (DTTD, DMTTD, DETTD), high NIR&#8208;II brightness is achieved. DETTD nanoparticles enabled high&#8208;resolution in vivo imaging, establishing a general paradigm for enhancing NIR&#8208;II fluorescence performance.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging has transformed biomedical imaging by providing low autofluorescence, deep tissue penetration, and superior spatial resolution, essential for precise in vivo biological visualization. However, developing NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting molecular fluorophores with high brightness remains challenging due to the difficulty in simultaneously achieving high absorption coefficients and excellent fluorescence emission in aggregated states. This study addresses these challenges at both the molecular and aggregate levels through a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) configured small molecules. The initial twisted molecule, DTTD, exhibits low absorption and significant fluorescence quenching upon aggregation. To mitigate these issues, DMTTD is synthesized with a planarized backbone by locking the &#960; bridge with the phenylene ring of donor, resulting in a higher absorption coefficient and reduced quenching due to its rigid structure and bulky donors. Further enhancement is achieved by incorporating branched alkyl chains into DMTTD for wrapping the molecular skeleton, creating DETTD, which maintains a high absorption coefficient and improved resistance to quenching in aggregated states. DETTD nanoparticles (NPs) with high NIR&#8208;II brightness of 117.5&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1 enabled high&#8208;resolution imaging of mice vasculature and gastrointestinal tract. This study establishes a general paradigm for simultaneously mitigating fluorescence quenching and improving absorption coefficients to achieve bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.

         <title>Dynamic Dissolution&#8208;Deposition Equilibrium Enables Unprecedented HER Stability in Acidic PEMWE</title>

Hydrogen energy is key to achieving carbon neutrality. Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) enables efficient green hydrogen production but faces catalyst instability issues. This work introduces a low&#8208;platinum catalyst with a dynamic equilibrium mechanism, balancing durability and activity. The catalyst achieves industrial&#8208;grade stability (&gt;2&#160;200&#160;h) and high performance, offering a scalable solution for cost&#8208;effective, durable electrolyzers and advancing renewable energy storage.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) holds substantial promise for effectively utilizing renewable energy to produce green hydrogen. However, it faces critical durability challenges due to acid&#8208;driven catalyst degradation under intermittent renewable power. Here, this study reports a dynamic dissolution&#8208;deposition equilibrium that achieves exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) stability through rational design of a high&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;derived architecture. Dealloying FeCoNiNbPt HEA creates a porous scaffold with dual&#8208;functional components: an amorphous NbOx buffer suppressing metal dissolution, while multicomponent Pt3(FeCoNi) nanocrystals synergistically enhancing HER activity (137 mV@1 A cm&#8722;2, 2.5 &#215; lower than Pt/C) that thermodynamically favors redeposition. This dynamic self&#8208;adaptive mechanism maintains equilibrium under harsh operating conditions, demonstrating exceptional durability (&gt;2200&#160;h @1 A cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles). The self&#8208;supported catalysts can be easily mass&#8208;produced with 8.87&#160;wt.% Pt loading (60% reduction vs Pt/C), indicating its industrial applicability. The equilibrium&#8208;driven design paradigm opens new avenues for industrial proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane devices operating under fluctuating power.

         <title>CsPbBr3 Perovskite Planar Detectors Surpass CdZnTe in High&#8208;Energy Gamma&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CZT and CsPbBr3 differ primarily in charge transport. CZT's much lower hole &#181;&#964; leads to charge trapping and broader high&#8208;energy peaks. In contrast, CsPbBr3 has balanced electron and hole &#181;&#964; products, reducing trapping and producing sharper photopeaks. As a result, planar detectors of CsPbBr3 deliver superior spectral resolution above 500&#160;keV.








Abstract
The detection of high&#8208;energy gamma radiation (&gt;1 MeV) at room temperature requires large&#8208;volume semiconductor crystals with high absorption efficiency, charge transport properties, and stability. The CsPbBr3 perovskite is a promising candidate due to its congruent melting growth, high defect tolerance, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication. In this study, the performance of CsPbBr3 is evaluated as a gamma&#8208;ray detector across a wide energy range and up to 1332 keV and compare its efficacy to commercial CdZnTe (CZT) detectors of similar crystal thickness. The CsPbBr3 detectors demonstrate high energy resolution, superior spectral fidelity for high&#8208;energy gamma peaks (&gt;1 MeV), and long&#8208;term operational stability over 225 days without performance loss. Notably, CsPbBr3 resolves closely spaced gamma lines with an excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, including weak emissions from depleted uranium sources. Its more balanced charge transport compared to CZT minimizes signal distortion, even in thick detectors, and enables precise spectral peak definition without complex correction algorithms. Comparative measurements on planar detectors demonstrate that CsPbBr3 achieves comparable energy resolution to CZT at energies &lt;0.5 MeV and outperforms at high energies, making it a strong alternative for next&#8208;generation radiation detection applications.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired MXene Electrode with the Highly Interconnected Gradient Nanoconfined Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a bamboo&#8208;inspired gradient nanoconfined MXene (GNC&#8208;MX) electrode is designed. Combining the multiscale architecture, in situ deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation for tunable interlayer channels, and scalable group&#8208;welding strategies, the thick GNC&#8208;MX electrodes achieved an ultra&#8208;high area&#8208;specific capacitance of 20.7 F cm&#8722;2, which surpassing conventional MXene systems and validating the potential of gradient&#8208;confined architectures in practical energy storage applications.








Abstract
Achieving efficient ion transport in thick electrodes remains a fundamental challenge in electrochemical systems with high energy density, primarily due to prolonged diffusion pathways and poorly integrated architectures. Leveraging the nanoconfinement effect, (sub)nanoscale channels can significantly accelerate ion transport kinetics to maximize electrochemical performance. Inspired by the hierarchical network structure of bamboo membrane, a gradient nanoconfined MXene electrode (GNC&#8208;MX) is designed, where multiscale interlayer spacing is coupled with in&#8208;plane mesopores that bridge adjacent nanoconfined channels, enabling synergistic vertical and horizontal ion migration. Finite element simulations and density functional theory calculations reveal the synergistic optimization mechanism of ion transport via the gradient nanoconfined channels and in&#8208;plane mesopores. Compared to pristine MXene, GNC&#8208;MX electrodes exhibit substantially enhanced ion transport kinetics and charge storage performance. To optimize the nanoconfined channels, an in situ deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation strategy is introduced to strengthen electrostatic repulsion and weaken hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions of the MXene interlayer, enabling quasi&#8208;permanent expansion of ion transport channels. Furthermore, a scalable group&#8208;welding method is developed to fabricate 400 &#181;m&#8208;thick electrodes with an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 20.7 F cm&#8722;2, surpassing current MXene&#8208;based electrodes. This work provides a scalable and tunable biomimetic platform for advanced ion nanoconfinement in energy storage systems.

An unconventional high&#8208;entropy oxide prepared by a reduction&#8208;oxidation method with inner metallic coordination and surface medium&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;OH realizes durable PEM water electrolysis at 2 A cm&#8722;2 for over 1500 h.








Abstract
The multicomponent synergistic effect has become increasingly important for electrocatalysis; however, there remain large unexplored compositional and structural spaces. Here, an unconventional high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) with inner metallic coordination interactions and surface medium&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;OH for durable proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) is presented. The metallic clusters inside the HEO particles generate the inner metallic coordination interactions that reserve electrons, with a multicomponent effect, to inhibit Ru/Ir overoxidation and switch reaction mechanisms toward an exclusive adsorbate evolution mechanism for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Surface medium&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;OH groups enable adaptive interfacial water networks to trap reactive water and promote proton transfer, reducing mass transport resistance at large current densities. Resultantly, this RuIrNiCoCrO2&#8208;incorporated PEMWEs achieve the ultralow voltages of 1.71 V@2.0 A cm&#8722;2 and 2.03 V@5.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 80&#160;&#176;C, and unprecedented durability &gt;1500 h@2.0 A cm&#8722;2. Thus, the dual engineering of inner multicomponent coordination environments and surface functional groups overcomes the activity&#8208;stability dilemma in the PEMWEs.

Tailored phase transitions reveal key insights into the mechanoluminescent mechanisms of Mn/Cu&#8208;doped ZnS. A reversible wt&#8208;ZnS &#8596; sp&#8208;ZnS phase transition is achieved through low&#8208;pressure pressing and thermal annealing. Screw dislocation movement drives the phase transition and mediates enhanced mechanoluminescece in ZnS:Mn and suppressed emission in ZnS:Cu. This work provides a foundation for designing next&#8208;generation luminescent materials and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Mn/Cu&#8208;doped ZnS has emerged as a highly promising self&#8208;recoverable mechanoluminescent (ML) materials with significant potential in intelligent sensing, dynamic displays, and artificial intelligence. However, the exact ML mechanism remains elusive, and the energy transfer processes governed by complex interactions remain unknown. This study finds dislocation&#8208;mediated ML enhancement in ZnS:Mn and ML suppression in ZnS:Cu under easily tailored the phase transition. By precisely increasing uniaxial machine pressure (0&#8211;30&#160;MPa), the study achieves for the first time a gradual phase transition from hexagonal wurtzite (wt&#8208;ZnS) to cubic sphalerite (sp&#8208;ZnS) at room temperature, which can be reversibly tuned through thermal annealing. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy results show that screw dislocation slip under uniaxial pressure induces sp&#8208;ZnS stacking faults within the wt&#8208;ZnS lattice, with fault density dependent on pressure and dopant concentration. Spectroscopic analyses indicate that the phase transition enhances ML emission but suppresses photoluminescence (PL) in ZnS:Mn, reflecting distinct dislocation&#8208;mediated energy transfer behaviors in ML and PL processes. This work establishes a powerful strategy for controllable phase transition engineering to tailor and enhance the ML properties, provides fundamental insights into the ML mechanisms, and offers a practical design strategy for the development of advanced luminescent materials and optoelectronic devices.

A machine learning&#8208;guided strategy identifies 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an effective electrolyte additive for aqueous Zn batteries. By regulating interfacial kinetics and suppressing side reactions, DMAP enables uniform Zn deposition and exceptional cycling stability. This study offers a data&#8208;driven approach to interfacial engineering for durable and scalable aqueous energy storage systems.








Abstract
Dendritic growth and parasitic reactions severely hinder aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to interfacial instability and uncontrolled charge transfer. Here, a machine learning&#8208;accelerated strategy for rational additive screening, establishing a predictive framework that links the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to the adsorption and reduction behavior of Zn2+, is reported. An interpretable machine learning model (Adaptive Boosting), trained on a curated molecular dataset, achieves high accuracy (Mean Squared Error = 0.2977, Pearson Correlation Coefficient = 0.8032) in HOMO prediction. Guided by this model, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine is identified as a high&#8208;performance additive, which can suppress Zn dendrite formation by slowing interfacial charge transfer and mitigating local ion starvation through kinetic matching between mass transport and deposition. Moreover, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine effectively excludes interfacial H2O molecules, significantly inhibiting parasitic reactions. Consequently, Zn anode delivers high reversibility of plating/stripping with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.85% over 1600 cycles. The 0.3&#8208;Ah NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O|Zn pouch cell delivers stable cyclability for 70 days, with a capacity retention of 73% after 250 cycles. This work pioneers the integration of machine learning with interfacial electrochemistry, offering a generalizable approach for additive discovery and electrolyte design, and sets a new paradigm for achieving dendrite&#8208;free metallic anodes in aqueous systems.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Engineered Carbon Scaffold for Interface&#8208;First Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;carbon&#8208;fiber symmetric architecture based on oxygen&#8208;doped carbon fibers enables dual&#8208;interface regulation, uniformly plating Na at the anode while anchoring and catalyzing polysulfides at the cathode, effectively eliminating dendrite formation and shuttle migration for long&#8208;life, high&#8208;rate room&#8208;temperature Na&#9472;S batteries.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#9472;S) batteries offer high theoretical energy density (1274&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and low&#8208;cost, abundant materials, making them promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, commercialization is hindered by multiple challenges: polysulfide shuttling and sluggish kinetics at the cathode, coupled with dendrite growth and interfacial failure at the anode. Here, an oxygen&#8208;doped carbon fiber (OCF) framework is designed and employed as a bifunctional host within a symmetric all&#8208;carbon&#8208;fiber cell architecture to simultaneously address these issues. The 3D porous OCF framework chemically anchors polysulfides, catalyzes their redox reactions, and guides uniform sodium nucleation/deposition. This synergy suppresses polysulfide shuttling and dendrite growth. Performance tests demonstrate an extremely low Na nucleation overpotential (27&#160;mV at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and stable, dendrite&#8208;free cycling exceeding 3600 h. In full Na&#9472;S cells, this design delivers a specific capacity of 753 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 C, retains &#8776;85% capacity after 2000 cycles at 0.5 C, and exhibits excellent rate performance (5 C). Mechanistic studies reveal OCF enhances Na&#8314; transport and interfacial kinetic stability. This work presents a generalizable, interface&#8208;first design paradigm for safe, long&#8208;lasting, low&#8208;cost Na&#9472;S batteries free from shuttling and dendrites.

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloy/intermetallic compound heterostructure with a bicontinuous nanoporous architecture as bifunctional electrocatalyst is constructed by a facile and scalable alloying/dealloying approach for hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted water electrolysis. It exhibits exceptional activities and durability by virtue of strain engineering of multicomponent intermetallic compound core, which enables high&#8208;entropy NiFeCoCuCrMn alloy surface with multiple active centres for *N2Hx intermediate spillover to lower kinetic barriers.








Abstract
Configuring integrative catalytic heterostructures is an efficient strategy to circumvent the universal linear scaling relationships for accelerating multiple&#8208;intermediate redox reactions. Here this study reports nonprecious metal&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy alloy/intermetallic compound heterostructure with a 3D nanoporous architecture as a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for hydrazine oxidation reaction. By making use of strain engineering of hexagonal close&#8208;packed multicomponent intermetallic compound core, high&#8208;entropy NiFeCoCuCrMn alloy surface is comprised of multiple active centers with undulatory adsorption energies, which enable *N2Hx intermediate spillover to adjust rate&#8208;determining step and lower kinetic barriers. As a consequence of nanoporous architecture endowing abundant multiple active surfaces, this heterostructure mediates hydrazine electrooxidation of as high as ampere&#8208;level current densities at &gt;0.08&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, showing genuine potential to replace sluggish oxygen evolution reaction for hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Its hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted water electrolyser delivers 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at ultralow cell voltage of 0.87&#160;V, and maintains exceptional stability for 1000 h.

Abstract
Nitrate and formaldehyde, which are substantial wastes in industrial and agricultural effluents, pose significant hazards to the human health and ecosystem. Current purification technologies remain great challenges due to the unsatisfactory energy&#8208;intensive, time&#8208;consuming and noticeably costly reasons. Herein, a bifunctional electrocatalysts of Pd single&#8208;atoms doped Cu3P quantum dots (Pd&#8208;Cu3P SA&#8208;QDs) are reported to moderately optimize the H* sorption behaviors for accelerating the kinetics of nitrate reduction (NO3RR) and formaldehyde oxidation (FOR) reactions in a dual&#8208;directional way, thus realizing the high activity and selectivity for both cathodic ammonia (NH3) synthesis and anodic H2 production concurrently. Specifically, a very positive onset potential of +0.36 V (versus RHE) is recorded for NO3RR with a high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99 % for NH3 at &#8722;0.3V (versus RHE), while the FOR can be initialized at a very low onset potential of &#8722;0.07 V (versus RHE) with &gt; 90 % FE for formate and &gt; 95 % FE for H2 at 0.3 V (versus RHE). Notably, a self&#8208;powered galvanic system can be triggered by integrating the above two electrode&#8208;based reactions, thus exhibiting an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.892 V, a peak power density of 12.1 mW cm&#8722;2, and capable of generating 8.8 KWh kg&#8722;1 of electrical energy.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Ionic Liquid Structured Polymer Electrolytes with Multi&#8208;Channel Ion Transport Pathways for Wide&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the wide&#8208;temperature performance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries, a novel PEO&#8208;based electrolyte is developed. This electrolyte incorporates amino&#8208;functionalized MOF nanoparticles, encapsulated with ionic liquids (ILs) and dispersed within a PEO&#8208;filled electrospun membrane. The MOFs facilitate rapid Li+ interfacial hopping, while the encapsulated ILs improve bulk&#8208;phase transport. Together, these components establish a multi&#8208;channel conduction pathway ensuring both high Li+ conductivity and robust structural stability across a broad temperature range (&#8722;10 to 120&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) enhanced with ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, offering advantages in interfacial compatibility and processability. However, their application across a broad temperature range has been hindered by a fundamental trade&#8208;off between mechanical robustness and ionic conductivity. To overcome this limitation, the study designs an innovative poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based CPE architecture to decouple these properties. This architecture utilizes amino&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles to encapsulate and immobilize ILs within PEO&#8208;filled electrospun membranes, establishing stable multi&#8208;channel ion pathways across wide temperatures. Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that the functionalized MOF enables fast Li&#8314; hopping at interfaces, and the MOF&#8208;confined IL boosts bulk ion transport. This multi&#8208;path mechanism ensures high Li&#8314; conductivity and structural stability from &#8722;10 to 120&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the optimized CPE facilitates the formation of a LiF&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interphase and an inorganic&#8208;dominated cathode electrolyte interphase, significantly enhancing interfacial stability. Consequently, LiFePO4||Li cells exhibit excellent cyclability, retaining 96.8% capacity after 1000 cycles at 3 C, and demonstrate stable operation for over 400 cycles at both &#8722;10 and 120&#160;&#176;C. These results establish a novel strategy for decoupling the intrinsic compromise between mechanical and electrochemical performance in CPEs.

         <title>Polydopamine&#8208;Polyoxometalate Composites in Neutral pH Enable High&#8208;Efficiency and Ultra&#8208;Stable Organic Solar Cells via Mutual Doping Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine&#8208;polyoxometalate composites (PDA&#8208;PMA and PDA&#8208;PMA(N))&#160;enable ultrahigh doping densities through distinct pathways: PMA&#8208;initiated polymerization yields PDA&#8208;PMA with&#160;organic/inorganic mutual doping, while ammonia&#8208;neutralized PDA&#8208;PMA(N) shifts to&#160;organic&#8208;dominated doping&#160;via structural rearrangement. The neutral&#8208;pH PDA&#8208;PMA(N) eliminates energy barriers by enabling&#160;quantum tunneling, delivering&#160;OSCs with record 20.29% efficiency&#160;and&#160;exceptional stability, surpassing PEDOT:PSS.








Abstract
Heavy doping critically minimizes depletion region widths for efficient charge transport in organic solar cells (OSCs), yet systematic studies elucidating its underlying mechanisms remain scarce. To address this, two polydopamine&#8208;polyoxometalate composites (PDA&#8208;PMA and PDA&#8208;PMA(N)) are designed via innovative mutual doping pathways. PDA&#8208;PMA achieved ultrahigh doping density (1.17 &#215; 1023 cm&#8722;3) through H3[P(Mo3O10)4] (PMA) initiated oxidative polymerization of dopamine, where electron transfer simultaneously induced p&#8208;doped PDA and n&#8208;doped PMA. Remarkably, neutralization with ammonia yielded PDA&#8208;PMA(N), which retained even higher doping density (3.74 &#215; 1023 cm&#8722;3) via structural rearrangement&#8208;driven organic doping. XPS/ESR studies revealed distinct pathways: dual organic/inorganic doping in PDA&#8208;PMA versus organic&#8208;dominated doping in PDA&#8208;PMA(N). This deep doping compressed depletion region widths from 44.42&#160;nm in undoped controls (the blend of PDA and PMA) to 0.052&#160;nm (PDA&#8208;PMA(N)), surpassing PEDOT:PSS (0.238&#160;nm) and enabling barrier&#8208;free hole transport. Consequently, PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs with PDA&#8208;PMA and PDA&#8208;PMA(N) achieved exceptional power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 20.02% and 20.29%, respectively. Furthermore, the neutralized PDA&#8208;PMA(N) demonstrated superior stability (86.2% PCE retention after 1800&#160;h illumination) by suppressing interfacial corrosion. This work elucidates structure&#8208;dependent doping mechanisms and provides a universal strategy for developing high&#8208;performance hole transport layers through tailored doping, advancing OSC commercialization.

         <title>Size&#8208;Induced High Entropy Effect for Optimized Electrolyte Design of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A size&#8208;induced high&#8208;entropy effect has been demonstrated for electrolyte design. The proposed small&#8208;sized system exhibits higher entropy and increased configurational diversity, leading to smaller Li&#8314; solvation clusters and enhanced cluster mobility. As a result, Li&#8314; conductivity, the de&#8208;solvation process, and the interfacial layer configuration are optimized, endowing lithium&#8208;ion batteries with exceptional fast&#8208;charging/discharging capability and superior low&#8208;temperature performance.








Abstract
Electrolyte design is critical for high energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) but is struggling with the trade&#8208;offs between conductivity and stability. Increasing electrolyte entropy can improve the conductivity without compromising stability. A size&#8208;induced high entropy effect is identified for electrolyte design, which increases configurational entropy and is more pronounced than conventional number&#8208;induced high entropy effect. The developed size&#8208;induced high&#8208;entropy electrolyte (HEE) with small&#8208;sized esters exhibits enhanced configurational diversity and entropy, resulting in smaller Li+ solvation clusters, a lower freezing point (&#8722;96.6 &#176;C), threefold higher ionic conductivity at &#8722;60 &#176;C, improved wettability and facilitated Li+ de&#8208;solvation compared to conventional number&#8208;induced HEE. These advantages contribute to more uniform Li deposition and the formation of a robust and thin cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811). Consequently, Li || NCM811 employing the small&#8208;sized HEE (SHEE) demonstrates superior cycling stability for 2000 cycles at a decay rate of 0.0162%/cycle under 10 C, and an exceptional rate capability under ultralow temperatures, i.e., capacity retention of 84.3% at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. A 1.0 Ah graphite || NCM811 pouch cell further exhibits 97.7% capacity retention for 300 cycles. The size&#8208;induced high entropy design strategy of electrolyte promises practical operation of LIBs under extreme conditions.

         <title>Characterizing Emerging Detector Materials for Low&#8208;Dose X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray medical imaging requires detectors that deliver images at as low as reasonably possible dose. This perspective outlines a universal characterization framework of X&#8208;ray imaging detectors, suitable for both emerging semiconductor and scintillator materials, introduces a novel unified figure of merit that links dose with resolution, and offers an open&#8208;access calculator, enabling fair benchmarking of detector prototypes at early technology&#8208;readiness levels.








Abstract
Modern clinical diagnostics significantly rely on X&#8208;ray medical imaging detectors, which play a key role in obtaining high&#8208;quality images while ensuring patient radiation exposure adheres to the &#8220;as low as reasonably achievable&#8221; principle. The last decade has seen a renewed exploration of promising materials for X&#8208;ray detection, foremost focusing on lead&#8208;based perovskites and other metal halides as direct&#8208;conversion semiconductors and scintillators. However, the reported performance characteristics, particularly X&#8208;ray sensitivity and the limit of dose rate detection, are often incomplete or misleading for assessing the practical utility of materials. This perspective surveys various approaches to the X&#8208;ray detector characterization of emerging materials, specifically focusing on Detective Quantum Efficiency within the context of low&#8208;dose medical imaging applications. Guidelines are provided for choosing, estimating, and presenting the relevant figures of merit, encompassing Detection Efficiency, Noise Equivalent Dose, response time, and spatial resolution, accompanied by ready&#8208;to&#8208;use computational tools, including a MATLAB application, a Mathcad worksheet, and an interactive website.

         <title>Interface Engineering and Optimization Strategies for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries Based on Polymer Composite Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the interface challenges of composite polymer electrolytes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries are delved into, innovative improvement strategies are explored, and their future industrialization is envisioned. By offering comprehensive insights, it serves as a valuable reference for researchers and engineers in the energy storage domain.








Abstract
Polymer composite electrolytes (PCEs) offer significant advantages in enhancing the safety, stability, and energy density of batteries, making them a crucial component for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage systems. However, one of the primary bottlenecks in improving the performance of PCEs lies in the interface challenge, which can be exacerbated and manifested in interface instability, side reactions, and poor interface compatibility, ultimately leading to a significant decline in ion conduction efficiency and overall battery performance of high&#8208;voltage or high&#8208;energy&#8208;density systems. Therefore, systematically analyzing the critical technical narrowing and proposing targeted solutions under high&#8208;energy&#8208;density conditions is of great significance for advancing the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. Although existing strategies have shown promising results, their applicability in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries remains uncertain. In this work, a comprehensive analysis of the interface challenges associated with high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer batteries is performed, the feasibility of existing approaches is evaluated, and practical optimization strategies are proposed to address these critical issues.

&lt;p&gt;Polymer composite electrolytes (PCEs) offer significant advantages in enhancing the safety, stability, and energy density of batteries, making them a crucial component for achieving high-energy-density energy storage systems. However, one of the primary bottlenecks in improving the performance of PCEs lies in the interface challenge, which can be exacerbated and manifested in interface instability, side reactions, and poor interface compatibility, ultimately leading to a significant decline in ion conduction efficiency and overall battery performance of high-voltage or high-energy-density systems. Therefore, systematically analyzing the critical technical narrowing and proposing targeted solutions under high-energy-density conditions is of great significance for advancing the development of next-generation energy storage systems. Although existing strategies have shown promising results, their applicability in high-energy-density batteries remains uncertain. In this work, a comprehensive analysis of the interface challenges associated with high-energy-density polymer batteries is performed, the feasibility of existing approaches is evaluated, and practical optimization strategies are proposed to address these critical issues. Moreover, the insights presented here provide valuable guidance for the industrial-scale production of PCEs, helping to bridge the gap between laboratory innovations and practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advances in &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Healing Materials: Molecular Design and Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the design and development of self&#8208;healing materials mediated by host&#8211;guest (HG) interactions, with particular emphasis on cyclodextrins (CDs). Furthermore, this review highlights cutting&#8208;edge applications of &#946;CD&#8208;based self&#8208;healing materials in sensors, 3D printing, tissue engineering, anti&#8208;corrosion coating, shape memory devices, and composites, demonstrating their adaptability to modern technological demands.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;healing (SH) materials have gained considerable attention for their ability to autonomously repair damage, thereby improving the longevity and performance of various systems. This review focuses on the design and development of SH materials mediated by host&#8211;guest (HG) interactions, with particular emphasis on cyclodextrins (CDs). Owing to their biocompatibility and excellent inclusion complexation capabilities, CDs&#8212;especially &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;CD)&#8212;play a key role in constructing HG&#8208;based SH systems. Recent progress in &#946;CD&#8208;based SH hydrogels for biomedical applications such as drug delivery, wound healing, and tissue engineering is discussed. In addition to healthcare, their application in smart coatings&#8212;including anti&#8208;fogging, fresh&#8208;keeping, and anti&#8208;corrosion layers&#8212;is reviewed. These materials are also integrated into sensors, demonstrating adaptability for real&#8208;time environmental and physiological monitoring. Emerging strategies involving 3D printing and shape memory functionalities further broaden their design potential. Despite these advances, challenges remain&#8212;particularly in scalability, environmental sensitivity, and achieving a balance between mechanical strength and healing efficiency. This review critically examines these limitations and highlights future directions, emphasizing the need for innovative fabrication approaches and interdisciplinary collaboration. By leveraging the unique properties of supramolecular interactions, &#946;CD&#8208;based SH materials offer promising solutions for a wide range of biomedical, industrial, and environmental applications.

         <title>Failure Mechanisms and Practical Optimizations for Ah&#8208;Scale Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, a comparative dissection of coin cells versus pouch cells is systematically conducted, identifying key challenges when scale&#8208;up. Furthermore, the multiscale failure mechanisms in pouch cells are deeply analyzed. Based on these insights, the practicality&#8208;oriented strategies are proposed to address the practical demands of Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are emerging as a key technology for the safe, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. While the research on coin cells has achieved significant advancements, the failure mechanisms and design strategies of pouch cells that hold great practical potentiality, remain relatively underexplored. This review aims to fill this gap via providing an in&#8208;depth exploration of the failure mechanisms and practical optimizations of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion pouch cells. A comparative analysis between coin cells and pouch cells is conducted in terms of the research status, bridging principles, and configuration&#8208;specific distinctions. Further interpretation of failure mechanisms at both electrodes and device is systematically discussed; these include the instability associated with cathode and anode, and the device&#8208;scale failures such as current collector and binder degradation, interfacial mismatch, and packaging&#8208;induced defects. The practicality&#8208;oriented strategies for Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells are further proposed. The final section advocates that future research should emphasize high&#8208;loading and large&#8208;area design, enhancement of kinetic performance, and tolerance to extreme operating conditions. This review contributes the theoretical insight and practical guidance to Ah&#8208;scale aqueous zinc&#8208;ion pouch cell technologies, which are expected to promote their application in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems.

         <title>A Ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Bottle Strategy: Crosslinking Amines and Epoxides inside MOF Pores for Enhanced CO2 Capture Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; strategy is used to grow oligomers inside of a MOF by crosslinking alkylamines with epoxides within the pores of Cr&#8208;BDC. When tested in postcombustion carbon capture applications, the composites show excellent performance with high CO2 adsorption capacity, exceptional CO2/N2 selectivity, and enhanced stability over 100 adsorption/desorption cycles. The crosslinking strategy effectively prevents amine leaching and degradation, making the composites more stable than the MOF containing non&#8208;crosslinked alkylamines amines.








Abstract
This study introduces a &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; technique to impregnate porous supports with amines via a straightforward in situ polymerization process. Specifically, alkylamines&#8212;tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TAEA) and tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA)&#8212;are crosslinked with epoxides&#8212;trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether (TMPTE) and 1,3&#8208;butadiene diepoxide (BDE)&#8212;within the pores of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) Cr&#8208;BDC (also MIL&#8208;101(Cr), where BDC = 1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate), producing four distinct MOF&#8208;polymer composites. These composites are subsequently evaluated for their efficacy in postcombustion carbon capture, examining metrics such as CO2 capacity, CO2/N2 selectivity, isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption, kinetic breakthrough times, and cyclability. Among the composites, Cr&#8208;BDC&#8208;TAEA&#8208;BDE (branched&#8208;linear) demonstrates the most promising results, achieving a CO2 capacity of 2.2&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 0.15&#160;bar and 313 K, a CO2/N2 selectivity of 301, and an isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption of &#8722;110&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1. This composite also exhibits superior breakthrough performance, with N2/CO2 separation times of 103 and 143 min per gram under dry and humid conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the four MOF&#8208;polymer composites are subjected to up to 100 temperature swing adsorption/desorption&#160;cycles (at 313 and 393 K, respectively), revealing minimal amine leaching or degradation over time. Notably, the composites also show significantly enhanced cyclability compared to Cr&#8208;BDC impregnated with amines without epoxide crosslinking agents; this indicates that crosslinking inhibits amine leaching.

         <title>A Generalizable Fluorescence Sensor Platform for Sample Preparation&#8208;Free Protein Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular fluorescence sensor platform enables single&#8208;step, sample preparation&#8208;free detection of protein analytes in complex samples. The design uses HaloTag to tether a fluorogenic dye to a nanobody, where target binding promotes dye activation and fluorescence. This generalizable system achieves picomolar sensitivity across diverse targets and offers a simple, plug&#8208;and&#8208;play format for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.








Abstract
Modern molecular detection assays such as enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) offer excellent sensitivity and specificity, but typically require multiple reagents and extensive sample preparation, limiting their usefulness as rapid diagnostics. A generalizable biosensor platform is introduced that enables single&#8208;step, sample preparation&#8208;free detection of protein analytes with high sensitivity in complex samples. The NanoFluor system employs Janelia Fluor dyes coupled to a nanobody via HaloTag conjugation with a flexible glycine&#8208;serine linker, where the dye undergoes a switch from a non&#8208;fluorescent to a fluorescent state when the coupled nanobody binds to its target.

     alt="A Generalizable Fluorescence Sensor Platform for Sample Preparation-Free Protein Detection"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A modular fluorescence sensor platform enables single-step, sample preparation-free detection of protein analytes in complex samples. The design uses HaloTag to tether a fluorogenic dye to a nanobody, where target binding promotes dye activation and fluorescence. This generalizable system achieves picomolar sensitivity across diverse targets and offers a simple, plug-and-play format for point-of-care diagnostics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern molecular detection assays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) offer excellent sensitivity and specificity, but typically require multiple reagents and extensive sample preparation, limiting their usefulness as rapid diagnostics. A generalizable biosensor platform is introduced that enables single-step, sample preparation-free detection of protein analytes with high sensitivity in complex samples. The NanoFluor system employs Janelia Fluor dyes coupled to a nanobody via HaloTag conjugation with a flexible glycine-serine linker, where the dye undergoes a switch from a non-fluorescent to a fluorescent state when the coupled nanobody binds to its target. It is demonstrated that the NanoFluor design achieves detection limits as low as picomolar concentrations across diverse protein targets. Molecular dynamics simulations, coupled with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics computational models, reveal the mechanistic basis for the fluorescence change, and demonstrate the feasibility of multiplexed detection in complex samples including undiluted serum. This versatile, simple biosensor design can prove valuable for point-of-care diagnostics and other molecular detection applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Hydrogel Sensors Induced by Intermolecular Mechanical Interlocking of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Non&#8208;Invasive Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust hydrogel sensors have been constructed using covalent organic frameworks and polyacrylamide; the intermolecular mechanical interlocking promotes energy dissipation and ion transport, resulting in superior strength, high toughness, and high ionic conductivity, holding great promise for non&#8208;invasive health monitoring.








Abstract
The compromise of tensile strength and toughness is essential for conductive hydrogels to enhance their cycling stability and mechanical durability in wearable strain sensors. It is effective but challenging to balance energy dissipation. Herein, a new strategy based on the intermolecular mechanical interlocking of the hydrogels has been proposed for improving their tensile strength and toughness. The hydrogels are readily fabricated through non&#8208;covalently threading linear polymer chains into covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The mechanical interlocking between polyacrylamide and COFs significantly promotes the energy dissipation with synchronous increment of ion transport, which endows hydrogels with superior mechanical performance and high conductivity. The tensile strength, toughness, and ionic conductivity are as high as 0.19 &#177; 0.03 MPa, 2.11 &#177; 0.33 MJ m&#8722;3 and 2.30 &#177; 0.55 S m&#8722;1, respectively, which greatly surpass those in the polyacrylamide counterpart and rank the top in the reported hydrogels. The resultant hydrogel sensor achieves a fast strain response of 4.8 ms and high cyclic stability over 100 cycles, and could non&#8208;invasively monitor human health. This work provides one promising approach to the construction of robust hydrogels based on COFs for the development of advanced wearable sensors.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Monolayer p&#8208;Type Semiconductor Films Toward High&#8208;Performance Electrical Device Arrays</title>

         <dc:description>
Tunable nucleation growth of large&#8208;area monolayer p&#8208;type semiconductor films is achieved by controlling the precursor evaporation area via atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition. The device array fabricated with as&#8208;grown monolayer film exhibits high electrical performance of 48&#160;&#177;&#160;16&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 mobilities and &#8776;108 on/off ratio, exhibiting competitive electrical performance compared with most of the reported TMDC&#8208;based transistors.








Abstract
2D semiconductors open new avenues in the post&#8208;Moore era for semiconductor technologies immune from the short&#8208;channel effect due to their atomic&#8208;scale thicknesses and dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces. However, it still remains a big challenge to obtain large&#8208;area and high&#8208;quality monolayer p&#8208;type semiconductors so far. Herein, a controlled nucleation is realized by tuning the evaporation areas of Se precursors during the p&#8208;type WSe2 growth. By optimizing the nucleation density, centimeter&#8208;scale uniform monolayer WSe2 and Nb&#8208;incorporated WSe2 films are synthesized. The field effect transistor array based on WSe2 film exhibits p&#8208;type behavior with hole mobilities of 34&#160;&#177;&#160;17&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 and an average on/off ratio of 4&#160;&#215;&#160;107, which can be further improved by Nb incorporation with much higher hole mobility of 48&#160;&#177;&#160;16&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 with an average on/off ratio of &#8776;108. The work paves the way for synthesizing large&#8208;scale uniform 2D p&#8208;type semiconductors for electrical devices and integrated circuits.

         <title>Nonlinear Optical Response in Layer&#8208;Stacked Gallenene with Ferroelectric Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metals are utilized in applications ranging from soft robotics to conductive inks, owing to their physical properties providing distinct mechanical, electrical, and thermal advantages. This work uses classical material science techniques to characterize ferroelectric polarization in supercooled liquid gallium and utilizes second harmonic generation imaging for further perturbation analysis.








Abstract
Polar metals are very rare and challenging to realize due to the incompatibility of ferroelectricity and metallicity. Mobile electrons in polar metals effectively screen the static electric field and dipoles. Recent studies show that 2D van der Waals metals without an inversion center can have polar order due to specific layer stacking. However, room temperature reversible ferroelectricity and nonlinear second harmonic generation in non&#8208;centrosymmetric polar metals remain unrealized. Here, the experimental realization of AB&#8208;stacked gallenene (a100) nanocrystals with a room temperature ferroelectric polarization in a liquid gallium environment is reported. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, the origin of spontaneous polarization (Ps) due to a broken symmetry in multilayer gallenene structures, resulting in P1 (space group) and C1 (point group) symmetry is explained. The reversible polarization switching is characterized using piezoresponse force microscopy. This results demonstrate the reversible nonlinear optical response of the AB&#8208;stacked gallenene crystal through second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. The intensities of SHG signals are controlled via angular rotations and thermal heating, which indicate a phase transition at high temperatures. Furthermore, electrical perturbation enables the tunability of SHG intensity. Bipolar resistive switching is demonstrated in a two&#8208;terminal device. These findings open avenues for advancements in 2D ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and topological superconductivity.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Forbidden Rectification via Dynamic Phase Transitions in the Weyl Metallic State of ZrTe5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite preserving inversion symmetry, ZrTe5 exhibits rectification and high harmonic generation through a current&#8208;driven dynamic phase transition. This symmetry&#8208;breaking bifurcation enables forbidden nonlinear responses, unveiling a new regime of topological transport. The work establishes ZrTe5 as a benchmark platform for studying nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, with broad implications for terahertz technologies, energy harvesting, and next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Weyl metals, known for their topological structure and chiral anomaly, exhibit nonlinear transport that defies conventional theory. In this study, ZrTe5, an inversion&#8208;symmetric Dirac semimetal tunable to a Weyl state by magnetic field, is investigated, and rectification (alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) conversion) and third harmonic generation in longitudinal configurations is revealed. Despite its bulk inversion symmetry, symmetry&#8208;forbidden rectification and a dynamic phase transition arising from the chiral anomaly are observed. Rectification shows threshold behavior at a critical current density (&#119869;&#119888;) and temperature (&#119879;* &#8776; 30 K), while third&#8208;harmonic generation remains threshold&#8208;free. In transverse setups, even harmonics up to sixth order and a DC response, also symmetry&#8208;forbidden and threshold&#8208;sensitive, are detected. These results highlight the role of topology and dynamic symmetry breaking in enabling nonlinear responses and establish ZrTe5 as a model for terahertz and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Driven 3D Open Fluidic Networks for Versatile Continuous Flow Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capillary&#8208;driven 3D open fluidic networks (OFNs), composed of connected polyhedral frames, enable precise, programmable, and versatile manipulation of unary, binary, and multiple continuous flows in both spatial and temporal dimensions. OFNs represent a significant leap beyond conventional microfluidics, unlocking new possibilities for selective metallization, programmable mixing, spatiotemporal control of multi&#8208;step reactions, and enhanced mass and heat transfer.








Abstract
Human civilization hinges on the capability to manipulate continuous flows. However, continuous flows are often regulated in closed&#8208;pipe configurations to address their instability, isolating the flows from the environment and considerably restricting their functionality. Manipulating continuous flows in open systems remains challenging. Here, capillary&#8208;driven 3D open fluidic networks (OFNs) composed of connected polyhedral frames are reported. Each frame acts as a fluid chamber with free interfaces that enable fluid entry and exit; the connecting rods function as valves, allowing precise control over the direction, velocity, and path of the flow. The OFNs seamlessly adapt to various fluid systems, enabling precise 3D manipulation of multiple flows. Leveraging these distinctive features, a series of applications, including selective metallization, programmable mixing and diagnostics, and spatiotemporal control of multi&#8208;step reactions, are achieved. The OFNs&#8217; free fluid interfaces also facilitate controlled drug release and efficient heat exchange. These versatile OFNs will significantly advance technological innovations in engineering, microfluidics, interfacial chemistry, and biomedicine.

         <title>Exploiting Brownian Motion of Plasmonic Nanoparticles Using Optical Printing Approach for on&#8208;Demand Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stochastic&#8208;to&#8208;deterministic transformation of the optical printing approach is exploited as a robust and physically grounded entropy source for on&#8208;demand physical unclonable function (PUF) fabrication at mesoscopic scales. The designed ternary PUF consisting of as few as 25 gold nanoparticles provides ample security and high encoding density, demonstrating its feasibility for integration into microelectronic systems.








Abstract
An on&#8208;demand fabrication method for additive physical unclonable functions (PUFs), a hardware&#8208;based security primitive, is inevitably required, especially considering increasingly miniaturized microelectronic devices. An optical printing approach is regarded as an alternative method to fabricate functional nano/microscale patterns against conventional methods due to its superior fabrication flexibility. However, owing to the Brownian motion of nanoparticles, achieving highly precise and selective printing persists an ongoing obstacle for the applicability of optical printing methods. Here, it is shown that the optical printing approach possesses plenty of room to fabricate on&#8208;demand PUFs by exploiting the obstacle from the perspective of randomness. To demonstrate this, an optical PUF based on a mesoscopic lattice pattern consisting of optically printed gold nanoparticles is proposed. Comprehensive analyses on physical features occurring naturally and multi&#8208;modal keys generated from them reveal that both exhibit randomness. Through a ternary bit system and key integration approach, the capability of the physical unclonable function using as few as 25 nanoparticles can be ensured in terms of the amount of information, complexity, uniqueness, and encoding capacity. The versatility of optical printing regarding the usability of a broad range of substrates and the ability to create arbitrary patterns with tunable dimensions are also shown.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Regulated Interface Chemistry Enables Depolarization for Ultra&#8208;High Capacity LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4) forms interfacial atomic&#8208;scale adsorption bonding with the highly delithiated LiCoO2 surface during electrochemical processes, enabling in situ HF/H2O scavenging, and constructing a cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) rich in Si&#8208;based components and polymers with enhanced Li+ conductivity. Consequently, the CEI's depolarization effect allows the LiCoO2 cathode to achieve a ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 220 mA h g&#8722;1 at 4.55 V.








Abstract
Unlocking the capacity potential of mainstream LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode materials for stable cycling at a high upper cut&#8208;off voltage is undoubtedly one of the most economical approaches to achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, significant polarization issues induced by interfacial and interphase degradation during high&#8208;voltage cycling remain well known. This study demonstrates the efficient depolarization effects of cyclic organosiloxane additive 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4) at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface, facilitating interfacial charge transfer and enhancing the capacity of LCO||Li cells to 220&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 even at 4.55&#160;V (vs Li/Li+). Specifically, V4D4 tends to adsorb onto the surface of highly delithiated LCO cathodes, and its preferential oxidation intermediates help stabilize lattice oxygen, eliminate harmful HF/H2O, and form an ultrathin cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) that reduces interface resistance to Li+ diffusion and stabilizes the surface structure. Additionally, with the assistance of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), long&#8208;term cycling produces a homogeneous, chemo&#8208;mechanically stable CEI enriched in organic silicon&#8208;containing compounds and LiF. This CEI suppresses excessive bulk electrolyte decomposition, reinforces the reversibility of the significantly enhanced O3&#8212;H1&#8208;3 phase transition, and enables capacity retention of &#8776;97% after 200 cycles.

2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs (dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based TPE&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF) with Kagome (kgm) topology are synthesized using imine&#8208;linked dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based COF (DBC&#8208;Imine&#8208;COF) as the template. DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits an impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 172.93&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in water, especially 105.30 and 80.04&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 3 wt.% saltwater and natural seawater, respectively. This work provides a rational strategy for the construction of COFs to enhance the photocatalytic HER.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have emerged as prominent photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, the exquisite design of linkage and topological structures is crucial for efficient charge generation, separation, and transfer in the planar periodic framework. Here, an imine&#8208;linked dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based COF (DBC&#8208;Imine&#8208;COF) is presented as a template for topology&#8208;templated synthesis of two 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs (dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based TPE&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF) with Kagome lattice to boost photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The fully conjugated DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF is highly luminescent and exhibits topology&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;electron transmission and charge carrier mobility. Significantly, DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits an impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 172.93&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and excellent reusability in the presence of 0.8 wt.% Pt under light irradiation, with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 14.9% at 420&#160;nm. More importantly, DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF demonstrates a hydrogen evolution rate of 105.30 and 80.04&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 3 wt.% saltwater and natural seawater, respectively, highlighting its potential in real&#8208;world scenarios. DFT calculations and various spectroscopic analyses reveal that the highly coplanar structure of DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF strengthens donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, facilitating charge generation and separation. In summary, this work provides an effective strategy to construct highly planar and full &#960;&#8208;conjugated dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COF as a promising platform for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

Significantly, DBC-sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c-COF exhibits an impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 172.93&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent reusability in the presence of 0.8 wt.% Pt under light irradiation, with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 14.9% at 420&#160;nm. More importantly, DBC-sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c-COF demonstrates a hydrogen evolution rate of 105.30 and 80.04&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 3 wt.% saltwater and natural seawater, respectively, highlighting its potential in real-world scenarios. DFT calculations and various spectroscopic analyses reveal that the highly coplanar structure of DBC-sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c-COF strengthens donor-acceptor interactions, facilitating charge generation and separation. In summary, this work provides an effective strategy to construct highly planar and full &#960;-conjugated dibenzo[g,p]chrysene-based 2D sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon-linked COF as a promising platform for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Subnanosecond Field&#8208;Free Switching of a Wafer&#8208;Scalable van der Waals Ferromagnet at Room Temperature</title>

Du et&#160;al. demonstrate field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit torque switching down to 0.8 ns in wafer&#8208;scale van der Waals ferromagnet/Pt heterostructures. By engineering coexisting perpendicular and in&#8208;plane anisotropies via Fe composition gradient, robust and deterministic switching is achieved at room temperature, offering a scalable route toward ultrafast and energy&#8208;efficient 2D spintronic memory devices.








Abstract
Electrical manipulation of magnetism in 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet (FM) holds promise for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. Investigating field&#8208;free, ultrafast switching at room temperature in wafer&#8208;scalable vdW heterostructures can advance the development of faster memories and enhance the understanding of magnetization switching mechanisms in 2D FMs. In this study, field&#8208;free, room temperature spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) switching at subnanosecond timescales in a wafer&#8208;scalable Fe3GaTe2/Pt heterostructure by epitaxial growth engineering is demonstrated. The introduction of a variable concentration gradient of Fe is used to establish the coexistence of in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) within the ferromagnetic layer. The field&#8208;free switching, driven by the SOT from Pt, is achieved by using the IMA component to break the in&#8208;plane symmetry during the switching process. This work paves the way for the integration of efficient 2D vdW materials in advanced spintronic devices and faster memory technologies.

         <title>Ionoelastomer Synapses With Configurable Synaptic Plasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic heterostructures of polycationic chains and anions and semiconducting polymers form artificial synapses that update their synaptic weights via anion redistribution under electrical stimulation. Memory effects depend on anion species, enabling synaptic plasticity modulation. Continuously programmable nonvolatile conductance states are utilized to emulate a neural network, achieving handwritten digit and fashion image recognitions with high accuracies by using only 16 discrete device states.








Abstract
An organic heterostructure, composed of an ionoelastomer that comprises polycationic chains and mobile anions, and a semiconducting polymer, forms a new class of artificial synapses. These ionoelastomer synapses update their synaptic weights by modifying device conductance through the spatial redistribution of anions in response to electrical stimuli. The memory effect of these synapses is highly dependent on the specific anion species present, providing a unique means to modulate synaptic plasticity simply through anion selection. The continuously programmable and nonvolatile states of the selected ionoelastomer synapse are harnessed to emulate a soft neural network and perform the handwritten digit and fashion image recognition tasks, which achieve high recognition accuracies comparable to ideal numeric model but only using 16 discrete device states.

Schematic illustration of MBSLS design and its application in spinal cord injury (SCI) treatment.








Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) repair represents an immense challenge globally. Despite various beneficial strategies having been attempted for SCI repair, the ideal therapy has not yet been achieved. In this study, a multidimensional biomimetic spinal cord&#8208;like scaffold (MBSLS) is designed with a hierarchical structure and embryonic neurogenetic microenvironment and neural regeneration in SCI repair. MBSLS successfully regulated the neural differentiation of loaded neural stem cells (NSCs) and regenerated spinal cord&#8208;like tissue in vitro by promoting neurogenesis, gliogenesis, axonogenesis, axon ensheathment, synapse organization, and calcium homeostasis. Moreover, the NSC&#8208;loaded scaffold achieves exceptional SCI repair through highly efficient axonal regeneration and neural circuit reconstruction, which significantly improves the recovery of motor function, sensory function, and autonomic function in vivo. Importantly, the MBSLS scaffold achieves seamless integration with the host spinal cord in only 5 min, allowing early cell infiltration and repair. Finally, the feasibility of the minimally invasive implantation of human&#8208;sized MBSLS in a pig SCI model is confirmed, demonstrating its potential and prospects for clinical translation to treat SCI.

         <title>Double Heterostructures for Monolayer Materials with Record Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a lateral double&#8208;heterostructure leveraging type&#8208;I band alignment in a double&#8208;gate design, where carriers transport through a wide indirect&#8208;bandgap WSe2 multilayer and are confined in a narrow direct&#8208;bandgap MoTe2 monolayer for efficient emission. The device achieves record 1% external quantum efficiency among TMDC p&#8208;n junctions and 24&#8208;fold power efficiency that of single MoTe2 counterpart, enabling silicon&#8208;integrated light sources.








Abstract
2D semiconductor materials have shown great potential and advantages for a wide variety of optoelectronic devices, especially compact and integrated light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers. However, the lack of a type&#8208;I double&#8208;heterostructure has severely hindered the development of efficient LEDs and lasers based on 2D materials. In this article, a lateral double&#8208;heterostructure is proposed based on a single type&#8208;I heterostructure composed of multilayer WSe2 and monolayer MoTe2 with double back&#8208;gates. This design synergizes the high mobility of the multilayer and the direct bandgap of the monolayer: carrier injection and transport are facilitated in the WSe2 barrier layer, while they are transferred and confined in the MoTe2 well layer for efficient radiative recombination through type&#8208;I band alignment. Therefore, the double&#8208;heterostructure reaches an external quantum efficiency of 1% level, a new record for p&#8208;n junctions based on transition metal dichalcogenides. Additionally, the heterostructure device achieves a 40&#8208;fold enhancement of the maximum electroluminescent intensity and a 24&#8208;fold enhancement of power efficiency compared with the single monolayer MoTe2 counterpart at room temperature. This promising strategy can also be extended to other 2D&#8208;semiconductor LEDs and could bring 2D&#8208;materials devices into practical applications of micro&#8208;LED displays, electrically injected 2D&#8208;materials lasers, and silicon&#8208;based on&#8208;chip light sources.

This study presents an Ir1@FA@MOFs nanocomposite that exploits copper&#8208;coordination and glutathione reduction to trigger an in situ Type II&#8208;to&#8208;Type I photodynamic switch, effectively alleviating tumor hypoxia while simultaneously inducing cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and PANoptosis, thereby potentiating immunogenic cell death for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract
The clinical translation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces dual challenges of tumor hypoxia and antioxidant defense mechanisms. To address these limitations, herein tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;adaptive nanoparticles are rationally designed that enable oxygen&#8208;independent PDT while reprogramming immunosuppressive TME. An Ir(III) complex (Ir1) is engineered to achieve copper&#8208;mediated and glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activated switching of photodynamic modes from oxygen&#8208;dependent Type II to hypoxia&#8208;tolerant Type I PDT via coordination&#8208;induced modulation of electron transfer. This dynamic photosensitizer is precisely integrated into folate receptor&#8208;targeted azomidazole&#8208;bridged Cu(II)&#8208;MOFs, creating an &#8220;AND logic&#8221; responsive nanoplatform (Ir1@FA@MOFs) that simultaneously depletes GSH and generates hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8210;) under light irradiation. Mechanistic studies reveal that Ir1@FA@MOFs orchestrate multimodal cell death induction including cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and PANoptosis through mitochondrial damage. In 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice, Ir1@FA@MOFs demonstrate high tumor growth inhibition while converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors to immunogenic hotspots. The work pioneers a TME&#8208;responsive photodynamic modality switching strategy that overcomes traditional PDT limitations through metal&#8208;coordination and GSH&#8208;activating immunogenic death programming, offering new dimensions for precision photo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Containing Bilayer Polymers With Programmable Wrinkling Dynamics Coherent With Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilayer polymers comprising lanthanide&#8208;coordinated skins and polyurethane substrates exhibit programmable wrinkling dynamics during relaxation. The evolving surface topography modulates visible light, enabling transitions among scattering, iridescence, and transparency. Independently, the metallopolymer layer emits multicolor luminescence under UV light. These features offer a durable, rewritable, dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with high adaptability and spatiotemporal control.








Abstract
A family of lanthanide metallopolymer/polyurethane bilayer polymers exhibiting multicolor luminescence and tunable wrinkling behavior are engineered to combat escalating challenges in information forgery and data leakage. These architectures are fabricated by spin&#8208;coating a lanthanide&#8208;coordinated metallopolymer skin layer onto a polyurethane substrate, facilitating strained&#8208;induced topographical transformations through a tensile&#8208;release process. During dynamic relaxation, the emergent wrinkled topographies modulate optical diffraction, yielding three distinct states: diffuse scattering (frosted glass effect), constructive interference (iridescent rainbow effect), and optical transparency. The metallopolymer skin layer demonstrates high&#8208;efficiency luminescence with broad&#8208;spectrum chromatic emission, while the polyurethane substrate confers exceptional mechanical robustness, optical transparency, and intrinsic self&#8208;healing properties. Consequently, a dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform integrating luminescence and structural coloration is realized, offering facile activation, immediate visual verification, and enhanced durability with recyclability. These multifunctional materials exhibit superior performance metrics in encryption and hierarchical anti&#8208;counterfeiting paradigms, surpassing contemporary security technologies in adaptability and functional sophistication.

         <title>Modulating Interfacial Solvent Aggregation Chemistry to Enable Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries is hindered by solvent aggregation in the inner Helmholtz plane, leading to sluggish Na+ diffusion. This study reveals that a free&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, in which polarization interactions induced by orbital overlap between solvent molecules and free radicals, disrupts solvent alignment. This strategy enhances cycling stability, maintaining performance at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C for 2400 cycles.








Abstract
The capability of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) to operate under extreme temperatures is highly desirable; however, achieving stable performance remains challenging due to limitations in interfacial dynamics. Here, it is revealed that at low temperatures, linear solvents tend to aggregate within the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), leading to the formation of a solvent&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) with sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics. To address this issue, it is proposed to leverage the polarization interaction induced by the orbital overlap between the solvent molecules and free radicals as an effective approach to breaking solvent aggregation. This interaction leads to a redistribution of electron density, reducing the electron cloud density and lowering molecular polarity. Significantly, the reduced polarity weakens intermolecular ordering, promoting interfacial restructuring that enhances mass transfer and facilitates the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Herein, trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTF) is identified as an optimal electric double&#8208;layer regulator, which generates radicals in situ and interacts with the solvent to reconstruct the IHP layer. Consequently, commercial hard carbon paired with the TMSOTF&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits superior cycling stability, achieving a lifespan over 2400 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, whereas the conventional electrolyte fails to sustain cycling. This study provides critical insights into interfacial design strategy for advancing low&#8208;temperature battery technologies.

         <title>Off&#8208;the&#8208;Shelf Granular Microtissue Bioinks: Long&#8208;Term Preserved Cellularized Porous Microgels with Enhanced Cell Activity for Shelf&#8208;Ready Biofabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces long&#8208;term preserved cellularized porous microgels that 1) achieve a considerably long preservation duration (up to 14&#160;months); 2) enable better cell and tissue growth due to the presence of internal interfaces; and 3) allow for injectable and 3D bioprinting use as a novel granular bioink. It advances the form of bioinks and represents a future trend of tissue engineering toward ready&#8208;to&#8208;use products.








Abstract
Off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf cellularized products greatly advance the therapeutic practice for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, it remains a challenge to achieve long&#8208;term preservation and superior biological outcomes. Here, the cryo&#8208;gelation methodology is optimized to develop a cellularized porous microgel platform that allows for long&#8208;term cryopreservation on the shelf (up to 14&#160;months) and favors tissue growth due to the presented subvoxel interfaces. The modular granular microtissues serve as an injectable formulation for non&#8208;invasive therapy and innovative printable bioinks for precise biofabrication, free of on&#8208;site operations on cell isolation and preparation. The internal biomaterial interfaces down to the microtissue building blocks significantly enhance cell growth and function, compared to the conventional bulk counterpart. The ready&#8208;to&#8208;use potential of months&#8208;preserved hMSC&#8208;laden modules is demonstrated through subcutaneous injection and critical&#8208;sized skull defect repair in rats, which confirms the benefits of subvoxel interfaces for tissue regeneration. These off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf granular cellularized blocks enable highly accessible and on&#8208;demand use in cell&#8208;based regenerative medicine.

         <title>Host Cell Membrane&#8208;Cloaked Nanomedicine Reprograms Endothelial Surface for Enhanced Patency in Allogeneic Vascular Grafts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed a host red blood cell membrane&#8208;cloaked nanomedicine loaded with a TGF&#8208;&#946; signaling inhibitor for metabolically&#8208;guided cell surface reprogramming to enhance the patency of allogeneic vascular grafts via the synergistic combination of localized steric immune shielding and in situ therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
The endothelium serves as the first point of contact following the implantation of allogeneic vascular grafts (AGs) or organs. Rapid endothelial injury triggered by immunocytotoxicity, combined with subsequent endothelial dysfunction during vascular tissue remodeling, collectively exacerbates complications, including thrombosis, inflammation, and intimal hyperplasia, ultimately leading to graft failure. In this study, a nanomedicine, R&#8208;SB@PLGA, is developed for use in metabolically guided cell surface reprogramming (CSR) in AGs.

&lt;p&gt;This work developed a host red blood cell membrane-cloaked nanomedicine loaded with a TGF-&#946; signaling inhibitor for metabolically-guided cell surface reprogramming to enhance the patency of allogeneic vascular grafts via the synergistic combination of localized steric immune shielding and in situ therapeutic delivery.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endothelium serves as the first point of contact following the implantation of allogeneic vascular grafts (AGs) or organs. Rapid endothelial injury triggered by immunocytotoxicity, combined with subsequent endothelial dysfunction during vascular tissue remodeling, collectively exacerbates complications, including thrombosis, inflammation, and intimal hyperplasia, ultimately leading to graft failure. In this study, a nanomedicine, R-SB@PLGA, is developed for use in metabolically guided cell surface reprogramming (CSR) in AGs. R-SB@PLGA is fabricated by encapsulating SB431542 (SB)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles within host red blood cell membranes (RBCM). Upon immobilization, this nanomedicine reprograms the epitope presentation of endothelial cells (ECs), establishing localized steric immune shielding to preserve endothelial integrity without the need for systemic immunosuppression. Concurrently, the nanomedicine releases SB to inhibit the transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF-&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;)-mediated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), thereby preventing endothelial dysfunction during vascular tissue remodeling. In animal models of allogeneic carotid artery transplantation, R-SB@PLGA showed significant efficacy in enhancing graft patency by reducing vascular inflammation and intimal hyperplasia. By integrating site-specific immune shielding with in situ therapeutic delivery, a novel paradigm is established for improving transplant outcomes through localized intervention, which is highly promising for promoting the success of allogeneic vascular or organ transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Structure Determination of Superconducting La4Ni3O10&#8208;&#948; under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade of structural transitions from P21/a to Bmab and to I4/mmm is reported in the nickelate superconductor La4Ni3O10, revealing a correlation between I4/mmm and the emergence of superconductivity. These results demonstrate that ambient&#8208;pressure grown nickelate single crystals can superconduct under high pressure, and reveal a new intermediate structure under high pressure, providing new insights into the physics of nickelate superconductivity.








Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper nickelates have attracted enormous attention since the discovery of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity in bilayer La3Ni2O7 under high pressure. However, the crystal structure under high pressure remains elusive due to the lack of single crystal diffraction data. Here, high&#8208;pressure superconductivity with a superconducting onset temperature approaching 30K and a zero&#8208;resistance state at 7K at 53.8 GPa is reported in high&#8208;quality single crystals of trilayer La4Ni3O10&#8208;&#948; grown at ambient pressure. A cascade of structural transitions from P21/a at 5.7 GPa to Bmab at 11.0 GPa and to I4/mmm at 16.6 GPa is unambiguously determined via synchrotron X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction, revealing a correlation between the tetragonal I4/mmm and the emergence of superconductivity. These results not only demonstrate that ambient&#8208;pressure grown nickelate single crystals can superconduct under high pressure but also reveal an intermediate structure that was not reported under high pressure, providing new insights into the physics of nickelate superconductivity.

         <title>Fast, Reconfigurable Domain&#8208;Wall Logic in a Magnetic Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructures of magnetic insulator TbIG and ultrathin Co layers enable field&#8208;free current&#8208;driven domain&#8208;wall motion over 1.4 km&#160;s&#8722;1. All 16 two&#8208;input Boolean logic operations are experimentally demonstrated within a single domain&#8208;wall device via current density and initial magnetization state adjustment, holding the potential for energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;density in&#8208;memory computing architectures.








Abstract
Conventional computing systems, based on silicon transistors, face challenges in meeting the growing demand for high computing efficiency in applications such as big data and artificial intelligence. Spin&#8208;based logic devices, particularly those utilizing chiral domain walls, offer a promising alternative due to their potential for high&#8208;performance and integration with high&#8208;density memory. Here, heterostructures composed of magnetic insulator TbIG and ultrathin Co layers are created, enabling field&#8208;free current&#8208;driven domain&#8208;wall motion at speeds exceeding 1.4&#160;km s&#8722;1. Based on the unique velocity phase diagram with respect to the in&#8208;plane field and current density, the implementation of all 16 two&#8208;input Boolean logic operations, including NAND, AND, XOR, and XNOR, is experimentally demonstrated by adjusting the current density and initial magnetization state. The results highlight the feasibility of multifunctional logic gates in spintronic systems and show the potential for energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;density in&#8208;memory computing architectures.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Bioinspired Meta&#8208;Structural Perovskite Catalysts for Dry Reforming of CH4 and CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed bioinspired meta&#8208;structural perovskite catalyst (LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3/pseudo&#8208;boehmite) with gradient woodpile channels (0.5&#8211;3 mm) is developed, achieving 82.13% CH4 conversion and 9.69 mmol g&#8722;1 syngas yield in DRM. Mass transfer and catalytic performance are synergistically coupled by configuring gradient hierarchical pores and tailored flow dynamics, providing a design paradigm for robust, high&#8208;performance catalysts applicable to diverse processes.








Abstract
Conventional packed&#8208;bed catalysts suffer from single&#8208;scale porosity, insufficient mechanical strength, and suboptimal mass transfer efficiency. Inspired by the fractal structure of the lung bronchi, a design and 3D printing method for gradient meta&#8208;structural catalysts is proposed by integrating synthesized LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3 (LFN) perovskite with pseudo&#8208;boehmite, achieving ultralow pressure drop and high catalytic efficiency.&#160;Computational fluid dynamics and reaction simulations guide the design of uniform and gradient&#8208;structured catalysts with hierarchical woodpile channels (0.5&#8211;3&#160;mm). Compared with homogeneous catalysts, the gradient design theoretically exhibits 1.5&#8208;fold and 1.1&#8208;fold increases in flow velocity and hydrogen production, respectively. Meta&#8208;structural catalysts are fabricated with gradient multi&#8208;peak pore distribution (9.32&#160;nm, 103.75&#160;nm) by regionally modulating unit cell sizes and LFN content (11&#8211;35%) combined with the dehydroxylation of pseudo&#8208;boehmite. 3D&#8208;printed perovskite catalysts demonstrate a 78.7&#8208;fold increase in specific surface area (102.26 m2 g&#8722;1) and compressive strength of 8.48&#160;MPa. In dry reforming of methane (DRM) tests, it achieves 82.13% CH4 conversion, and 9.69&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 syngas yield, outperforming conventional powder&#8208;packed beds by 10% efficiency. This study achieves mass transfer and catalytic performance coupling by tuning gradient hierarchical pores and tailoring flow dynamics, offering a paradigm for robust, high&#8208;efficiency catalyst design across diverse applications.

Mass transfer and catalytic performance are synergistically coupled by configuring gradient hierarchical pores and tailored flow dynamics, providing a design paradigm for robust, high-performance catalysts applicable to diverse processes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional packed-bed catalysts suffer from single-scale porosity, insufficient mechanical strength, and suboptimal mass transfer efficiency. Inspired by the fractal structure of the lung bronchi, a design and 3D printing method for gradient meta-structural catalysts is proposed by integrating synthesized LaFe&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LFN) perovskite with pseudo-boehmite, achieving ultralow pressure drop and high catalytic efficiency.&#160;Computational fluid dynamics and reaction simulations guide the design of uniform and gradient-structured catalysts with hierarchical woodpile channels (0.5&#8211;3&#160;mm). Compared with homogeneous catalysts, the gradient design theoretically exhibits 1.5-fold and 1.1-fold increases in flow velocity and hydrogen production, respectively. Meta-structural catalysts are fabricated with gradient multi-peak pore distribution (9.32&#160;nm, 103.75&#160;nm) by regionally modulating unit cell sizes and LFN content (11&#8211;35%) combined with the dehydroxylation of pseudo-boehmite. 3D-printed perovskite catalysts demonstrate a 78.7-fold increase in specific surface area (102.26 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and compressive strength of 8.48&#160;MPa. In dry reforming of methane (DRM) tests, it achieves 82.13% CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion, and 9.69&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; syngas yield, outperforming conventional powder-packed beds by 10% efficiency. This study achieves mass transfer and catalytic performance coupling by tuning gradient hierarchical pores and tailoring flow dynamics, offering a paradigm for robust, high-efficiency catalyst design across diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trojan Horse&#8208;Inspired Biomimetic Lipoprotein Nanocarrier for Noninvasive Anti&#8208;VEGF Therapy of Ocular Fundus Neovascularization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article&#160;presents a Trojan horse&#8208;inspired biomimetic lipoprotein nanocarrier (A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP) that electrostatically binds aflibercept to phosphatidic acid (PA) and incorporates an apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1)&#8208;mimetic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#160;via self&#8208;assembly. This nanocarrier enables noninvasive delivery through corneal and conjunctival&#8211;scleral&#8211;choroidal pathways and effectively suppresses choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a laser&#8208;induced mouse model.








Abstract
Pathological neovascularization is a major cause of vision loss in various ischemic and inflammatory ocular fundus diseases, with current anti&#8208;VEGF therapies requiring invasive and frequent intravitreal injections. In this study, a Trojan horse&#8208;inspired biomimetic lipoprotein nanocarrier (A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP) is developed for noninvasive anti&#8208;VEGF therapy via topical administration. Utilizing phosphatidic acid (PA), specifically 1,2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate (DOPA), as the sole phospholipid, the nanocarrier enables electrostatic tethering of aflibercept, with a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;functionalized apoA1 mimetic peptide (&#945;CPP) incorporated through self&#8208;assembly. Molecular dynamics simulations and intermolecular interaction experiments confirm effective PA&#8211;protein interactions and &#945;CPP incorporation. The nanocarrier demonstrates high encapsulation efficiency, size uniformity, and long&#8208;term stability. It enhances transcellular and paracellular transport by promoting cellular uptake, bypassing lysosomal degradation, and modulating tight junctions. When topically administered, A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP efficiently delivers to the posterior segment via corneal and conjunctival&#8211;scleral&#8211;choroidal pathways. In a laser&#8208;induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) mouse model, A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP eye drops show therapeutic efficacy comparable to a single intravitreal injection, while maintaining excellent ocular and systemic biocompatibility. This biomimetic platform highlights the potential of PA&#8208;mediated protein binding in nanocarrier design, offering a promising strategy for home&#8208;based anti&#8208;VEGF therapy and extending the potential to other protein&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>A Wideband Multimodal Flexible Sensor Integrating Vertical Graphene and Sea Urchin&#8208;Like Nanoparticles for Post&#8208;Stroke Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a speech reconstruction framework based on a dual&#8208;sensor system that collects wideband signals from vocal vibrations and throat muscle movements. An encoder&#8208;cycle&#8208;consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) model maps the signals to speech without requiring a large&#8208;scale paired training dataset. The system achieves over 95% intent recognition accuracy and generates natural&#8208;sounding speech with a mean opinion score of 2.9.








Abstract
Stroke is a leading cause of long&#8208;term disability worldwide, with post&#8208;stroke aphasia significantly impairing communication and social interaction. Traditional rehabilitation devices are often bulky, expensive, and impractical for daily use, particularly in speech recovery, where accessible and effective solutions remain limited. To address this challenge, this study introduces a portable and wearable sensor system for stroke&#8208;induced aphasia rehabilitation. The proposed sensor integrates a flexible, ultrasensitive, and durable dual&#8208;sensor system comprising an Ag&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based sea&#8208;urchin&#8208;like nanoparticle pressure sensor to detect high&#8208;frequency vocal vibrations and a vertical graphene/polydimethylsiloxane (VGr/PDMS) strain sensor to capture low&#8208;frequency muscular movements. The sensors, integrated into a flexible circuit, employ an encoder&#8208;cycle&#8208;consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN)&#160;model that recognizes users' intent and recovers voice, significantly reducing dependency on large&#8208;scale labelled datasets. Experimental results demonstrate accurate intent recognition with accuracies for certain commands exceeding 95%. The reconstructed speech exhibits improved naturalness based on objective and perceptual evaluations, highlighting potential clinical utility in enhancing daily communication and interaction for stroke survivors.

         <title>3D Acoustic Imaging Hitting the Diffraction Limit via Fully Parameter&#8208;Optimized Meta&#8208;Lens and Frequency&#8208;Domain Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article employs a binary genetic algorithm to design an ultra&#8208;fine ultrasonic meta&#8208;lens, achieving lateral super&#8208;resolution imaging in the far field (&gt;20&#955;&#8320;). Building on this, longitudinal resolution is effectively restored through frequency domain reconstruction. Additionally, the nonlinear effect of sound waves in the medium is leveraged to significantly enhance both lateral and longitudinal resolutions, reaching &#8776;0.2&#955;&#8320; and 0.68&#955;&#8320;.








Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution imaging is the long&#8208;sought goal pursued in acoustics. In the past decade, many solutions have been proposed by utilizing various metamaterial devices. For example, in acoustics, the holographic meta&#8208;lens is employed to improve the lateral resolutions of ultrasonic imaging. However, the filtering effect of meta&#8208;lens broadens the acoustic wave pulses, which severely degrades longitudinal resolutions, making the high&#8208;resolution 3D imaging hitherto quite challenging. Here, an innovative solution is proposed by designing and implementing a fully parameter&#8208;optimized meta&#8208;lens. At the fundamental frequency, this meta&#8208;lens can achieve a lateral resolution of 80&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;0.37&#955;0), successfully breaking the diffraction limit. Through the frequency&#8208;domain reconstruction, the longitudinal resolution is increased to 296&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;1.36&#955;0). Utilizing the nonlinear effect of ultrasound in water, the acoustic meta&#8208;lens can furtherly optimize its imaging quality at the harmonic frequency, where the lateral resolution is increased to 44&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;0.2&#955;0) with the longitudinal resolution to 148&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;0.68&#955;0). The work breaks the bias on meta&#8208;lenses with deteriorated longitudinal resolution for broad applications in functional ultrasonic imaging.

         <title>Multimodal Super&#8208;Cooling Textiles for All&#8208;Scenario Passive Hygrothermal Comfort</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a multimodal supercooling textile that integrates radiative, conductive, and evaporative functions by a 3D cladding strategy of nanosheets for all&#8208;scenario personal cooling. With high solar reflectance, a 3D thermally conductive network, and a Janus wetting structure, it cools 2&#160;&#176;C lower than cotton in a hot and humid environment, offering a new perspective for highly efficient human hygrothermal management.








Abstract
Radiative cooling textiles hold great promise for achieving personal thermal comfort amidst the rising global temperatures while enhancing productivity and saving energy. However, despite extensive research, most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art radiative cooling textiles possess solely radiative functions, failing to achieve highly efficient cooling across all scenarios, particularly as high temperatures and high humidity diminish non&#8208;radiative cooling power. This work presents a multimodal super&#8208;cooling textile that integrates radiative, conductive, and evaporative mechanisms through a 3D cladding strategy to enhance the cooling effect in various scenarios without compromising radiative performance. This method enables the surfaces of all 1D single fibers to be closely 3D clad with 2D boron nitride nanosheets, thereby achieving ultra&#8208;high solar reflectivity (97.30%), omnidirectional heat dissipation (in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 2.40 and 0.33&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, respectively), and unidirectional moisture&#8208;wicking properties (transport index of 1547%) through high backscattering efficiency, a 3D thermal conductivity network structure, and a Janus wetting structure. Enabled by the multi&#8208;cooling mechanisms, MST drops temperature by 20&#160;&#176;C versus cotton in outdoor sunlight. Even in hot, humid circumstances, it still provides a 2&#160;&#176;C cooling advantage over cotton. This work thereby provides a promising strategy for personal thermal and moisture management textiles across various complex environments.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents a multimodal supercooling textile that integrates radiative, conductive, and evaporative functions by a 3D cladding strategy of nanosheets for all-scenario personal cooling. With high solar reflectance, a 3D thermally conductive network, and a Janus wetting structure, it cools 2&#160;&#176;C lower than cotton in a hot and humid environment, offering a new perspective for highly efficient human hygrothermal management.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiative cooling textiles hold great promise for achieving personal thermal comfort amidst the rising global temperatures while enhancing productivity and saving energy. However, despite extensive research, most state-of-the-art radiative cooling textiles possess solely radiative functions, failing to achieve highly efficient cooling across all scenarios, particularly as high temperatures and high humidity diminish non-radiative cooling power. This work presents a multimodal super-cooling textile that integrates radiative, conductive, and evaporative mechanisms through a 3D cladding strategy to enhance the cooling effect in various scenarios without compromising radiative performance. This method enables the surfaces of all 1D single fibers to be closely 3D clad with 2D boron nitride nanosheets, thereby achieving ultra-high solar reflectivity (97.30%), omnidirectional heat dissipation (in-plane and out-of-plane thermal conductivity of 2.40 and 0.33&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively), and unidirectional moisture-wicking properties (transport index of 1547%) through high backscattering efficiency, a 3D thermal conductivity network structure, and a Janus wetting structure. Enabled by the multi-cooling mechanisms, MST drops temperature by 20&#160;&#176;C versus cotton in outdoor sunlight.

         <title>Inverted PAINT for Material&#8208;Specific Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence Imaging of Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents Inverted PAINT, a label&#8208;free super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging method optimized for thick and non&#8208;transparent semiconductor materials. By employing electrostatic dye&#8211;surface interactions in an inverted geometry, the technique enables material&#8208;specific, multicolor, and 3D nanoscale imaging, with applications in semiconductor metrology, defect detection, and analysis of various inorganic nanomaterials.








Abstract
Recent advances in super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy have extended its application beyond traditional biological samples to include various organic materials such as polymers and lipid layers. However, its application to inorganic materials, including semiconductor substrates, still remains limited due to technical challenges associated with their thickness, optical opacity, and the lack of effective fluorophore labeling methods. To overcome these challenges, a label&#8208;free Inverted point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) imaging method is developed for thick and non&#8208;transparent inorganic nanomaterials by addressing the limitations of conventional PAINT imaging. By placing the sample in an inverted orientation and utilizing electrostatic interactions to control dye movement against gravity, silica&#8208;specific and silicon&#8208;specific nanoimaging of silica&#8211;silicon line&#8208; and hole&#8208;patterned semiconductor wafers, respectively is achieved. Through systematic optimization of polymer coating, dye charge, pH, refractive index, and dye concentration, it is demonstrated that the Inverted PAINT imaging method successfully visualizes sub&#8208;100&#160;nm line patterns with a resolution of &#8776;12&#160;nm, as well as enables multi&#8208;color and 3D nanoimaging. The method is anticipated to serve not only as a non&#8208;destructive and material&#8208;specific nanoimaging technique for a variety of inorganic nanomaterials, but also as a next&#8208;generation tool for semiconductor metrology and defect inspection.

         <title>Flexible Photovoltaic Neurostimulator for Analgesia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible photovoltaic Neurostimulator for Analgesia. This study introduces a fully implantable, wireless photovoltaic neurostimulator that integrates flexible self&#8208;rolling cuff electrodes with biocompatible Cu(In,Ga)Se2 photovoltaic cells. This adaptive optoelectronic system enables near&#8208;infrared&#8208;triggered nerve electrical stimulation, showing significant pain reduction in neuropathic conditions.








Abstract
Chronic neuropathic pain remains a significant clinical challenge, often requiring prolonged opioid use and exposing patients to associated complications. Current nerve electrical stimulation (ES) techniques show promise for analgesia but are constrained by their invasive nature and the potential risk of iatrogenic nerve injury. In this study, a novel approach is introduced to managing chronic pain through the development of a fully implantable, wireless, and self&#8208;adaptive photovoltaic neurostimulator (PVNS). This innovative device combines flexible, self&#8208;rolling cuff electrodes with biocompatible flexible Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin&#8208;film photovoltaics, enabling near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered nerve ES. In vivo neuralgia models demonstrate significant analgesic effects, while mechanistic studies reveal the involvement of inflammatory pathway regulation and modulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1). The PVNS eliminates the difficulty for tethered stimulation and reduces the risk of peripheral nerve injury, offering a groundbreaking and minimally invasive solution for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.

         <title>A Nanobiocatalyst&#8208;Driven Hybrid System for Efficient and Sustainable Hydrogen Production via Electron Flow Optimization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermetallic nanobiocatalyst LPBC, featuring an ordered atomic structure and defined electronic properties, is designed and integrated with Clostridium pasteurianum to construct an efficient, sustainable biohydrogen hybrid system. LPBC stimulates transcriptional enhancement for biohydrogen production, and targets NADH and [FeFe] hydrogenase to catalyze intracellular tandem reactions for directional electron modulation, achieving a 103% production rate increase with 30&#8208;day long&#8208;lasting performance.








Abstract
Biohydrogen production offers a promising pathway for developing clean and renewable energy sources. However, its practical application has been hindered by low efficiency and sustainability issues. Here, it is introduced an energy&#8208;efficient and output&#8208;sustainable hybrid system (LPBC/CH system) for biohydrogen production by integrating self&#8208;assembling intermetallic (L10) FePt@polypyrrole nanobiocatalysts (LPBC) with Clostridium pasteurianum. The engineered LPBC, characterized by optimal atomic structures and defined electronic properties, demonstrates robust transcriptional enhancement efficiency and biocatalytic capability, leading to an &#8776;103% increase in hydrogen production rate and a 57% enhancement in hydrogen yield to the bare C. pasteurianum system. Within the LPBC/CH system, the nanobiocatalysts target NADH and [FeFe] hydrogenase, triggering efficient tandem biocatalytic reactions for proton reduction. Notably, the LPBC achieves sustained performance for at least 30 days &#8211; a benchmark unmatched by other reported nanobiocatalysts. This study not only advances the frontiers of biohydrogen production but also establishes a universal framework for constructing hybrid systems with superior efficiency and sustainability.

         <title>Unravelling Microstructure Selection in an Additively Manufactured Eutectic High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Processing&#8211;microstructure&#8211;property relationships in additively manufactured high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are studied, showing&#160;how increasing solidification rate drives solidification morphology from coupled eutectic to anomalous eutectic and eventually to single&#8208;phase structures, enabling tunable strength&#8211;ductility combinations. Integrated thermodynamic modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and multiscale characterization clarify the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic factors in microstructure selection of additively manufactured HEAs.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are promising candidates for advanced structural applications due to their excellent mechanical properties. Additive manufacturing (AM), with its rapid solidification conditions, enables the creation of unique nonequilibrium microstructures. To fully leverage the synergy between AM and HEAs, understanding how processing affects structure and properties is essential. Here, how solidification rate influences microstructure evolution and phase transformation pathway in laser additively manufactured AlCrFe2Ni2 eutectic HEAs is investigated. By increasing the laser scan speed and hence the solidification rate, distinct solidification modes evolving from coupled eutectic to anomalous eutectic and eventually to single&#8208;phase solidification are revealed. These transitions result in distinct microstructures and a wide range of mechanical properties. Thermodynamic modeling and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that low cooling rates allow for sufficient atomic diffusion and phase separation, facilitating coupled eutectic growth. In contrast, rapid cooling suppresses diffusion and destabilizes the solid&#8211;liquid interface, promoting anomalous or single&#8208;phase solidification. This integrated experimental and computational approach provides a multiscale understanding of solidification mechanisms in HEAs and underscores how kinetic effects can over&#8208;ride thermodynamic predictions under nonequilibrium conditions. These results demonstrate that AM can serve as a powerful tool to design HEAs with tailored microstructures and properties.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Perfect Pt Cocatalyst with a Spatially Oriented Distribution of Pt2+/Pt0 for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;perfect Pt cocatalyst is developed featuring a near&#8208;zero proton reduction barrier and isolated O2 adsorption by precisely regulating the Pt2+/Pt0 ratio. This work underscores the critical role of spatial orientation distribution of Pt valence states in photocatalytic reactions, demonstrating generalizable design principles applicable to photoelectrocatalysis, organocatalysis, and environmental catalysis.








Abstract
Loading the cocatalyst, e.g., Pt, is a promising strategy for photocatalytic overall water splitting, in which metallic state Pt&#176; facilitates proton reduction and positive valence state Pt2+ inhibits H2/O2 recombination. However, simultaneously leveraging the advantages of Pt0 and Pt2+ in Pt&#8208;photocatalyst hybrids for photocatalytic water splitting is challenging. Herein, a universal strategy is demonstrated for modulating Pt valence state, obtaining a spatially oriented distribution of Pt2+/Pt3 and a close to zero proton reduction barrier, along with isolated O2 adsorption. As a proof of concept, Pt undergoes electron transfer to ZnIn2S4, accompanied by partial oxidation from Pt0 to Pt2+ through the introduction of electron&#8208;deficient centers in ZnIn2S4 via vanadium doping and sulfur vacancy (V&#8208;Sv&#8208;ZIS). Reverse electron transfer induces Pt2+ dominating 83% of the region near the Pt/V&#8208;Sv&#8208;ZIS interface and Pt0 dominating in the remaining 17% near the Pt cluster center, which can be extended to other Pt&#8208;based catalyst systems. The dominant Pt2+ inhibits O2 adsorption and induces the lowest H2/O2 recombination rate of 4%, and the minimal Pt0 obtains a 152.2&#8208;fold increase in photogenerated electron density, ultimately realizing a 45.4&#8208;fold increase in photocatalytic activity. A 10 m2 large&#8208;area photocatalytic system is fabricated, producing 6.4 L of H2 per day under natural sunlight.

In this work, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hybrid flow machine learning (HFML) framework is designed to efficiently discover HEO compositions. The factors affecting structural stability, including s&#8208;block metal ions, Cu2+, high&#8208;valence d0 and d10 metal ions are further verified. In conclusion, this work accomplishes the full chain study from artificial intelligence material prediction, and performance verification to pilot application.








Abstract
How to proficiently and accurately explore the vast compositional space of materials and accelerate the development of new materials with outstanding properties, especially structurally complex high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), remains a challenge in materials science. To address this, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hybrid flow machine learning (HFML) framework is proposed, which combines ensemble learning, unsupervised learning, and Bayesian optimization, enabling efficient discovery of hidden patterns and comprehensive exploration of the component space. Based on the proposed HFML, a new HEO cathode material is screened out from over 2 million candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (Na0.95Li0.06Ni0.25Cu0.05Fe0.1Co0.05Mn0.44Ti0.05O2), which shows excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 83.6% after 1200 cycles) and high&#8208;rate performance (110 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, and 96 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 C). Key factors affecting structural stability are identified, including s&#8208;block metal ions, Cu2+, high&#8208;valence d0 and d10 metal ions, and are verified by electrochemical tests and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Additionally, pilot&#8208;scale production is achieved, and 2 Ah pouch cells based on this cathode demonstrate 95.0% capacity retention after 600 cycles. This work accomplishes the full chain study from artificial intelligence material prediction, creation, and performance verification to pilot application (mass production and pouch sodium batteries).

         <title>Origin of Synergy in Bicomponent Metal Nitride&#8211;Metal Single Atom Catalysts for Advanced Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive coupling model for metal nitride (MN) and metal single atoms (M&#8722;SA) is proposed to optimize the behavior of polysulfides, and elucidate the principles by which the hybrid catalyst facilitates the conversion of polysulfides. W&#8722;SA/WN as the model prepared and dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon sheets rendered batteries the increased capacity, superior rate performance, and enhanced cycling stability.








Abstract
To catalyze the sulfur redox kinetics of lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries (LSBs) can well enhance the capacity and longevity. However, the synergistic essence of bicomponent electrocatalysts for LSBs remains obscure. Here, this work introduces standardized descriptors to describe the underlying origin of catalysts&#8217; synergy for LSBs. Specifically, it pertains to the bi&#8722;functional electrocatalysts comprising a series of metal nitrides (MN) and partner metal single atoms (M&#8722;SA) for the conversion and migration of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The M&#8722;SA with higher eg/t2g promotes the conversion of Li2S4&#8722;dominated decisive steps, alleviating the shuttling. Concurrently, MN with abundant bonding facilitates the migration of lithium sulfide, which significantly reduces the accumulation of insulating sulfide. Such independent but synergistic hybridization makes the bicomponent MN/M&#8722;SA possess improved catalysis over the S electrochemistry compared to their single components, which is also experimentally verified with W&#8722;SA/WN as the representative. The batteries provide considerable sulfur utilization, superior rate capability, and the assembled 6.31 Ah pouch&#8722;pack battery even has an ultra&#8722;high incipient energy density of 506.2&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 under high sulfur loading and lean&#8722;electrolyte. A thorough comprehension of the catalytic properties from both electronic and structural standpoints provides a novel viewpoint for understanding and designing LSBs&#8217; catalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Mechanoluminescent Haptic Sensor via Dual&#8208;Functional Chromatic Filtration by a Conjugated Polymer Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;resolution mechanoluminescence (ML) platform is achieved through&#160;chromatic filtration strategy using a conjugated polymer shell (F8BT) on copper&#8208;doped zinc sulfide microparticles. This shell narrows the emission bandwidth, selectively filtering out blue noise, while simultaneously boosting intensity via ML photon recycling process. The dual action significantly enhances signal clarity and stability, enabling precise multi&#8208;signal differentiation in haptic sensors and advanced stress&#8208;sensing technologies.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence materials have emerged as promising candidates for haptic interface sensors due to their mechanically driven luminescent property. However, the inherently broad emission spectra of most mechanoluminescence materials hinder sharp signal generation and high spectral resolution. Here, a chromatic filtration strategy is suggested employing poly(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;alt&#8208;benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) as a conjugated polymer shell on copper&#8208;doped zinc sulfide to achieve a highly refined and intensified signal. By selectively suppressing spectral components below 490&#160;nm, the F8BT shell effectively narrows the emission bandwidth, yielding a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#160;nm during the mechanoluminescence process. In particular, F8BT shell efficiently mitigates signal intensity loss, which can be ascribed to the chromatic filtration ability, through mechanoluminescence photon recycling performance. This dual functionality significantly reduces spectral noise in the blue region with high intensity, enhancing the resolution in actual powerless haptic controllers. The novel approach establishes a scalable framework for high&#8208;resolution mechanoluminescence platforms, providing a versatile pathway toward next&#8208;generation, power&#8208;free stress&#8208;sensing applications with unprecedented spectral precision and optical fidelity.

Here, a chromatic filtration strategy is suggested employing poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) as a conjugated polymer shell on copper-doped zinc sulfide to achieve a highly refined and intensified signal. By selectively suppressing spectral components below 490&#160;nm, the F8BT shell effectively narrows the emission bandwidth, yielding a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#160;nm during the mechanoluminescence process. In particular, F8BT shell efficiently mitigates signal intensity loss, which can be ascribed to the chromatic filtration ability, through mechanoluminescence photon recycling performance. This dual functionality significantly reduces spectral noise in the blue region with high intensity, enhancing the resolution in actual powerless haptic controllers. The novel approach establishes a scalable framework for high-resolution mechanoluminescence platforms, providing a versatile pathway toward next-generation, power-free stress-sensing applications with unprecedented spectral precision and optical fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prelithiation of Alloy Anodes via Roll Pressing for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general prelithiation method is developed for alloy&#8208;type negative electrodes via solid&#8208;state lithiation using roll&#8208;pressing with thin lithium foil. This mechanical prelithiation method is compatible with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll processing and allows for a controlled extent of prelithiation. Prelithiated Si, Al, and Sn anodes, as well as multi&#8208;component foil anodes, exhibit improved Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability in solid&#8208;state batteries with sulfide&#8208;based electrolytes.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries with alloy&#8208;type negative electrodes can feature enhanced energy density and safety compared to conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, diffusional Li trapping within Li alloys often causes low initial Coulombic efficiency and leads to capacity loss with cycling. Here, a general roll&#8208;pressing prelithiation method compatible with a variety of alloy&#8208;type negative electrodes (silicon, aluminum, tin, and multi&#8208;phase alloys) is introduced, which is shown to improve performance in solid&#8208;state batteries. By warm&#8208;rolling lithium foil of controlled thickness with various alloy&#8208;type electrodes, both slurry&#8208;cast and foil&#8208;type electrodes can be uniformly prelithiated via direct chemical reaction. The prelithiated electrodes exhibit enhanced specific capacity and extended cycle life in batteries with Li6PS5Cl solid&#8208;state electrolyte. Prelithiated multi&#8208;phase foil electrodes with a tailored interface are shown to exhibit superior cycling stability down to 2&#160;MPa stack pressure. This prelithiation technique offers a pathway to overcome intrinsic challenges in alloy anodes for solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Biovision&#8208;Inspired Perovskite Intelligent Camera for Panchromatic and Metameric Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biovision&#8208;inspired intelligent imaging system combines perovskite photodetectors, single&#8208;pixel imaging and deep learning&#8211;driven color fusion to emulate the best of mantis shrimp&#8208;like multispectral vision and human color perception. With multispectral channels in a compact filter&#8208;free setup, the system enables full&#8208;color imaging and metamerism resistance, portending a new paradigm in adaptive color vision technology.








Abstract
Biological vision systems excel at acquiring and processing information, but there is often a trade&#8208;off between these capabilities. For instance, mantis shrimp possess exceptional spectral sensing but poor color perception due to limited neural processing. Taking the best of both worlds, the mantis shrimp's spectral detection ability and the human&#8208;like visual processing power are integrated to achieve full&#8208;color perception. Using an aerosol&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid spraying technique, an array of high&#8208;quality, excess ion migration enhanced perovskite narrowband photodetectors spanning the ultraviolet to visible spectrum is developed. These detectors enable a computational multispectral imaging system that captures seven spectral images in one shot. A deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based color fusion network is designed to efficiently translate multispectral inputs into an RGB representation, significantly enhancing color recognition of these mantis shrimp&#8208;inspired multispectral cameras and affording the capability to overcome metamerism. These perovskite intelligent camera leverages the strengths of biological vision and demonstrate a novel approach to multispectral imaging that could advance applications in machine vision, remote sensing, and medical imaging.

         <title>Color Tuning in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals using Triptycene/Hydrazone Chiral Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF*LCs)&#160;have been obtained by doping a polar liquid crystal host (DIO) with chiral triptycene/hydrazone&#8208;based bistable photoswitches. Upon irradiation with 442 and 340&#160;nm light sources, the pitch of the NF*LCs can be reversibly phototuned at 50&#160;&#176;C, resulting in the reflection and locking&#8208;in of the primary colors, red, green, and blue.








Abstract
The development of light&#8208;tunable ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NFLCs) will allow for the multi&#8208;stimuli control over the properties of this newly discovered LC phase. Here on the development of photoresponsive chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF*LCs) is reported by incorporating chiral triptycene/hydrazone&#8208;based bistable photoswitchable dopants into the polar liquid crystal mesogen DIO. The propeller&#8208;like dopants exhibit high helical twisting powers with values of 13.5 &#181;m&#8722;1 in DIO, with a further increase in value to 31.0 &#181;m&#8722;1 upon 442&#160;nm light&#8208;induced Z &#8594; E photoisomerization. This process results in the tuning of the NF*LC's reflection color from near infrared, to red, green, and finally blue at 50&#160;&#176;C. The reverse color transition can be induced by 340&#160;nm light irradiation, which drives the E&#8594;Z photoisomerization of the hydrazone. The ferroelectric nature of the NF*LC phase is confirmed by applying an alternating current electric field (0.67&#160;V/ &#181;m, 10&#160;Hz, square wave), which initiated azimuthal deformations of the ferroelectric helix.

A photo&#8208;patternable solid&#8208;state electrolyte based on &#120580;&#8208;carrageenan (&#120580;&#8208;CGN) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) is developed to enable high&#8208;performance complementary OECT circuits.

Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are crucial for next&#8208;generation (bio&#8208;)electronic devices but are often constrained by the use of aqueous electrolytes, which introduce crosstalk, hinder miniaturization, and limit circuit integration. Here, a photo&#8208;patternable solid&#8208;state electrolyte based on &#120580;&#8208;carrageenan (&#120580;&#8208;CGN) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) is presented, enabling high&#8208;performance OECTs and complementary circuits. The &#120580;&#8208;CGN electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity (&gt;10 mS cm&#8722;1), comparable to a 0.1 m NaCl aqueous electrolyte, while supporting precise patterning down to 15 &#181;m, fast transient response times, minimal hysteresis, and excellent stability in both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type OECTs. Compact solid&#8208;state NAND/NOR gates (500 &#215; 800 &#181;m2), 4&#8208;input NAND gates (1600 &#215; 800 &#181;m2, 8 OECTs), and half&#8208;adders (2 &#215; 1 mm2, 18 OECTs) are demonstrated, all exhibiting correct logic functions and low&#8208;voltage operation. To highlight its potential for implantable bioelectronics, solid&#8208;state spiking circuits, monolithically integrated with flexible cuff electrodes, are developed for vagus nerve stimulation in mice. These findings establish &#120580;&#8208;CGN&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes as a promising platform for scalable, implantable circuits, paving the way for next&#8208;generation bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Solvation Design of an Interfacial Self&#8208;Compatible Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte for High&#8208;Loading Sodium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

This work proposes an additive&#8208;induced solvation strategy toward an interface self&#8208;compatible quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte for high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries. The additive exhibits stronger coordination with anion than EMC molecules, preventing solvent co&#8208;intercalation, and decomposes preferentially to form a thin and robust CEI. Consequently, the in situ fabricated quasi&#8208;solid SDIBs with high loading demonstrate stable cycling performance and a commendable rate capability.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) attract extensive attention in stationary energy storage for their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high working voltage. However, traditional liquid electrolytes for SDIBs undergo solvent co&#8208;intercalation and severe oxidation decomposition at high voltage, causing unstable cathode structure and low Coulombic efficiency, especially with high loading (&gt;5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Herein, an interfacial self&#8208;compatible quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte (ACPE) is developed via an additive&#8208;induced solvation design strategy. The additive exhibits stronger coordination with Hexafluorophosphate anion (PF6&#8722;) than ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) molecules, prevents solvent co&#8208;intercalation, and decomposes preferentially to form a thin and robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI). ACPE offers a high oxidation stability (5.5&#160;V) and effectively curbs solvent co&#8208;intercalation at the graphite cathode. On the sodium anode, an ACPE&#8208;derived robust interphase enables stable sodium plating/stripping for over 300&#160;h. Consequently, for the first time, an in situ fabricated quasi&#8208;solid SDIB with high loading (&gt;6.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) demonstrates stable cycling performance (above 900 cycles) and a commendable rate capability (84.6% capacity retention at 10&#160;C), among the best quasi&#8208;solid DIBs. Even with an ultra&#8208;high&#8208;loading cathode (&gt;16.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), the SDIB maintains a stable capacity for 300 cycles. This solvation strategy of electrolytes paves a new way for developing high&#8208;loading DIBs.

         <title>Unlocking Dual Functionality in Triazine&#8208;Based Emitters: Synergistic Enhancement of Two&#8208;Photon Absorption and TADF&#8208;OLED Performance with Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational molecular design strategy is presented for simultaneously enhancing two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) by incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing units into a CzTRZ scaffold. The resulting materials exhibit high 2PA cross&#8208;sections, efficient reversed intersystem crossing, and excellent OLED performance, opening new possibilities for advanced imaging probes and organic semiconductors.








Abstract
The simultaneous realization of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in a single molecular system remains challenging due to an inherent trade&#8208;off in their molecular design requirements. In this study, we present a strategy to enhance both properties by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents into the CzTRZ scaffold, thereby leveraging an electron&#8208;withdrawing&#8208;enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (EWICT) character. The incorporation of TRZCF3 and TRZCN units effectively enhances the charge transfer (CT) character of CzTRZ, resulting in high 2PA cross&#8208;sections (156 GM for CzTRZCF3 and 200 GM for CzTRZCN) and a reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST = ES1 &#8211; ET1). Computational and experimental studies reveal that incorporating TRZCF3 and TRZCN units selectively stabilizes the S1 state and reduces &#916;EST, significantly facilitating the reversed intersystem crossing (RISC) process. Notably, 1c exhibits the fastest RISC rate (kRISC), leading to superior TADF properties and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.5% in OLEDs. Moreover, a relatively high two&#8208;photon brightness of 174 GM is estimated for 1c. These findings demonstrate a rational molecular design strategy for the synergistic enhancement of 2PA cross&#8208;sections and excellent OLED performance, paving the way for applications in advanced imaging probes and organic semiconductors.

This work presents narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (BTT&#8208;DTPn and BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F) for SWIR organic photodetectors. The optimized devices through solvent vapor annealing suppress dark current and enhance detectivity while enabling high&#8208;quality blood&#8208;pressure monitoring and real&#8208;time optical communication.

Abstract
The limited noise&#8208;responsivity balance in Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) organic photodetectors (OPDs) restricts their biomedical and optoelectronic applications. In this study, this challenge is addressed through molecular&#8208;device co&#8208;engineering by designing two fluorinated narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (BTT&#8208;DTPn and BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F) coupled with solvent vapor annealing (SVA), achieving low noise and high detectivity in SWIR OPDs. The optimized devices based on BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F, which features enhance &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking due to terminal fluorination, extend its absorption capability to 1300&#160;nm. Under &#8722;0.1&#160;V bias, the SVA&#8208;processed BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F devices demonstrate an ultra&#8208;low dark current (Jd) of 4.93 &#215; 10&#8722;8 A cm&#8722;2 and exhibit a suppressed trap density of states (tDOS) reduced by an order of magnitude, achieving a shot&#8208;noise limited detectivity (Dsh&#8727;$D_{{\mathrm{sh}}}^*$) of 7.19 &#215; 1011 Jones at 1200&#160;nm. The synergy of molecular design and post&#8208;processing enables an ultra&#8208;fast response time (1.44/1.20 &#181;s rise/fall) and a record&#8208;high &#8722;3&#160;dB cutoff frequency (f&#8722;3&#160;dB) of 648&#160;kHz, demonstrating remarkable performance for SWIR OPDs. These advancements facilitate two groundbreaking applications: deep&#8208;tissue photoplethysmography (PPG) for cuff&#8208;less blood pressure monitoring and high&#8208;speed, real&#8208;time SWIR optical communication. This methodology presents a general strategy to harmonize molecular design with device fabrication in SWIR OPDs.

Developing a single&#8208;source, multi&#8208;emissive perovskite with better control over excited&#8208;state manifold splitting is a key challenge. Here, unique 2D Sb3+&#8208;doped halide double perovskites are developed, exhibiting triplet symmetry breaking through organic cation driven structural distortions, in concert with spin&#8208;orbit coupling and Jahn&#8208;Teller interactions. This enables a selective population of emissive non&#8208;degenerate states, a key step toward spin&#8208;polarized emission.








Abstract
The spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect (JTE) alter the orbital degeneracy in materials, leading to unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties essential in spintronics, quantum computing, and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, the study employs luminescent p&#8208;xylylenediammonium (PXA) instead of Cs+ in Cs2NaInCl6 to yield 2D Sb3+&#8208;doped (PXA)2NaInCl8 double perovskite and demonstrates a non&#8208;degenerate triplet state resulting from enhanced JTE in the strong SOC regime, featuring distinct emission centers. Consequently, a broadband emission from both PXA and [SbCl6]3&#8722; spans the entire spectrum (350&#8211;750&#160;nm), representing a rare single&#8208;source multi&#8208;emissive 2D perovskite. With in&#8208;depth comparative structural, temperature&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;physical, and theoretical studies, it is elucidated that the synergistic effect of SOC and JTE on the Eg and T2g lattice modes modulate the electronic structure of [SbCl6]3&#8722; by splitting the doubly degenerate E levels of 3T1u&#8727;$^{3}{\mathrm{T}}_{1u}^*$ into non&#8208;degenerate states. The physical model, supported by theoretical studies, explains the energy level splitting required to realize two kinds of radiative minima in the relaxed excited state.

         <title>Pyridocarbene&#8208;Based Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes for Long Device Lifetime over 500 h in Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8211;Emitting Diodes</title>

Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy exhibit external quantum efficiencies of 24.5% and 27.4% at the 3&#160;wt.% doping concentration, respectively. In particular, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy doped blue PhOLEDs optimized for stability demonstrate a device lifetime of up to 95% of the initial luminance of 543 and 228 h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which has never been achieved in the blue PhOLEDs.








Abstract
Blue phosphorescent organic light&#8211;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) face challenges in achieving high efficiency, color purity, and long device lifetime due to exciton quenching and high energy requirements. In this study, two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy, are designed and synthesized by incorporating pyridocarbene in their ligands. Pyridocarbene enhances the electrochemical stability, strengthens triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer characteristics, and improves the spin&#8211;orbit coupling, effectively shortening the exciton lifetime and minimizing the quenching effects. Additionally, the introduction of a methyl group as a conformation manager in Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy further improves the color purity by blue&#8208;shifting and narrowing the emission spectrum. As a result, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy exhibit external quantum efficiencies of 24.5% and 27.4% at the 3&#160;wt.% doping concentration, respectively. In particular, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy doped blue PhOLEDs optimized for stability demonstrate a device lifetime of up to 95% of the initial luminance of 543 and 228&#160;h at 1,000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which has never been achieved in the blue PhOLEDs. This study demonstrates that the synergistic combination of pyridocarbene and the methyl conformation manager is an effective strategy for improving blue PhOLED performance, enhancing their potential for practical applications.

         <title>A Universal Orientation&#8208;Engineering Strategy for Enhancing Mechano&#8208;Electric Conversion Performance in Semi&#8208;Crystalline Biopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a systematic design of high&#8208;charge&#8208;output triboelectric biopolymers through multiscale orientation engineering. The triboelectric output performance of silk fibroin is systematically analyzed for the first time from the perspective of interfacial charge transfer and bulk charge transport. The enhanced mechano&#8208;electric conversion mechanism of orientation&#8208;optimized semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers is further explored based on molecular dynamic simulations and first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
High&#8208;charge&#8208;density triboelectric materials are the key to developing high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerators. However, most semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers exhibit low triboelectric output performance due to the limitations in their intrinsic structure and physicochemical properties. Herein, orientation&#8208;regulated silk fibroin nanofibers (SFNs) with phase transition polarization and enhanced carrier migration are developed through high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;speed synergistic electrospinning technology. To analyze the molecular and aggregation structural changes of SFNs during high&#8208;voltage electric fields and stress&#8208;induced orientation processes, a multiscale structural evolutionary model is constructed from microscopic molecular chains to mesoscopic aggregation structures, and then to macroscopic fiber arrangements. It is found that as the orientation coefficient increases, the molecular conformation shifts from disordered &#945;&#8208;helices to ordered stacked &#946;&#8208;sheets. The aggregated molecular chains gradually slip, recombine, and arrange in an orderly manner along the direction of the stress field, which contributes to regulating the charge capture and carrier migration properties. The orientation&#8208;regulated SFNs significantly enhance the interfacial charge transfer and bulk charge transport capacity, thereby greatly improving the triboelectric performance. This work not only provides new insights into the mechano&#8208;electric conversion mechanisms of semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers but also offers guidance for the design of high&#8208;charge&#8208;density triboelectric materials.

         <title>Exceptional n&#8208;Type Ionic Thermoelectric Hydrogels by Synergistic Hydrophobic and Coordination Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
A poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based n&#8208;type ionic thermoelectric hydrogel is developed by synergistic coordination and hydrophobic interactions. This strategy yields a high negative Seebeck coefficient (&#8722;38.6&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1) and excellent stretchability (382.5%). The hydrogel powers flexible sensors and harvests low&#8208;grade heat, offering a new approach for stretchable ionic thermoelectrics in wearable sensors and heat conversion devices.








Abstract
Ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) materials show promise for flexible energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing due to their high ionic Seebeck coefficients (Si). However, achieving both high thermoelectric performance and mechanical stretchability, especially in n&#8208;type systems, remains a critical challenge. Herein, a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based n&#8208;type i&#8208;TE hydrogel is presented that exhibits both large negative Si (&#8722;38.6&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1) and excellent stretchability (382.5%) through synergistic effect of coordination and hydrophobic interactions. Leveraging the amphiphilic nature of PVA, its hydrophilic hydroxyl groups form coordination bonds with Cu2+ ions from copper chloride (CuCl2), while its hydrophobic backbone interacts with water&#8208;soluble conjugated polymer (poly(3&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;triethylammonium&#8208;1&#8242;&#8208;propy&#8208;loxy)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;thiophene chloride (PMNT). Meanwhile, hydrophobic associations also occur among PMNT chains due to strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and backbone hydrophobicity. This dual&#8208;interaction strategy approach enhances the thermophoretic difference between chloride anions (from both CuCl2 and PMNT) and cations, enabling the giant ionic thermopower. Besides, the long&#8208;range hydrophobic interactions contribute to the overall mechanical robustness. The developed hydrogels are successfully implemented in self&#8208;powered temperature sensors and low&#8208;grade heat harvesting systems, such as powering a cooling fan by utilizing the waste heat from a working tablet. This work offers an alternative pathway toward developing high&#8208;performance i&#8208;TE materials for wearable electronics and low&#8208;grade heat harvesting applications.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Assisted Rapid Gelation and Foaming of Gradient Hydrogel as Human&#8208;Machine Interfaces with Regulated Charge Accumulation/Dissipation and Enhanced Tactile Sensing Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy is proposed to improve the performance of hydrogel&#8208;based tactile sensors through manipulating the interfacial properties and ion transport kinetics rather than barely enlarging the contact area. The phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced hydrogel foam with gradient porous structure and interfacially accumulated MXene nanosheets simultaneously achieves high sensitivity of 4267 kPa&#8722;1 and a wide detectable range up to 100 kPa.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based tactile sensors, typically featuring a sandwiched structure of electrode/hydrogel/electrode with charges (electrons and ions) accumulated at both interfaces forming electrical double layers (EDLs), are considered promising candidates as human&#8208;machine interfaces (HMIs); however, the continuous dense structure limits the deformability of bulk hydrogels, hindering the achievement of high&#8208;sensitivity and wide detectable range. Moreover, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for enhancing sensitivity predominantly focus on enlarging the changes of hydrogel/electrode contact area upon external force, while overlooking the design of interfacial properties and ion transport kinetics. Herein, polyacrylamide/chitosan/MXene (PAM/CS/MXene, PCM) hydrogels with gradient porosity and tailorable softness are developed following the phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced foaming mechanism. Ti3C2TX MXene plays critical roles in promoting rapid gelation, stabilizing bubbles, regulating ion transport kinetics, and modulating charge accumulation/dissipation at the hydrogel/electrode interfaces. As a consequence, the obtained PCM foam (PCMF) tactile sensor exhibits an optimal sensitivity of 4267 kPa&#8722;1 together with a wide detectable pressure range up to 100 kPa. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications are demonstrated for acquiring and identifying gesture commands to control a robotic arm for swab sampling and the movement of an electric car in a maze game by integrating PCMF sensors with a digital camera for visual feedback and machine learning for accurate recognition, respectively.

         <title>Nonresonant Raman Control of Ferroelectric Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonresonant Raman excitation with mid&#8208;infrared pulses induces large&#8208;amplitude lattice motion and ultrafast ferroelectric reversal in lithium niobate. A suite of spectroscopic techniques uncovers the underlying dynamics, establishing a low&#8208;energy route to reshape complex energy landscapes and synthesize hidden material phases with unique functionalities on ultrafast timescales.








Abstract
Important advances is recently made in the search for materials with complex multi&#8208;phase landscapes that host photoinduced metastable collective states with exotic functionalities. In almost all cases so far, the desired phases are accessed by exploiting light&#8211;matter interactions via the imaginary part of the dielectric function through above&#8208;bandgap or resonant mode excitation. Nonresonant Raman excitation of coherent modes is experimentally observed and proposed for dynamic material control, but the resulting atomic excursion is limited to perturbative levels. Here, this challenge is overcome by employing nonresonant ultrashort pulses with low photon energies well below the bandgap. Using mid&#8208;infrared pulses, ferroelectric reversal is induced in lithium niobate, and the large&#8208;amplitude mode displacements are characterized through femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering and second harmonic generation. This approach, validated by first&#8208;principle calculations, defines a novel method for synthesizing hidden phases with unique functional properties and manipulating complex energy landscapes at reduced energy consumption and ultrafast&#160;speeds.

         <title>Pyrazinoquinazoline&#8208;Based Eu&#8208;MOF Ratiometric Fluorescence Sensing: Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Meat Spoilage Enabled by Dynamic Regulation of LMCT/LLCT Triggered by Biogenic Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a dual&#8208;emission Eu&#8208;MOF ratiometric platform using pyrazinoquinoxaline ligands, achieving biogenic amine detection via LMCT/LLCT&#8208;regulated fluorescence color shifts, integrated with hydrogel&#8208;encapsulated smartphone RGB analysis for real&#8208;time shrimp/chicken spoilage monitoring.








Abstract
This study develops a dual&#8208;emission Eu&#8208;MOF ratiometric fluorescence sensor for biogenic amine detection in food spoilage monitoring. The sensor exhibits dual emission at 495 nm (ligand &#960;&#8594;&#960;* transition) and 615 nm (ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, LMCT) through the antenna effect. Biogenic amines specifically regulate the intensity ratio (I495nm/I615nm) by adsorbing into MOF pores via hydrogen bonding, triggering a dynamic equilibrium switch between LMCT and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (LLCT), causing fluorescence color shift from orange to green. Theoretical calculations reveal this response mechanism for the first time. Encapsulating Eu&#8208;MOF in agarose hydrogel&#8208;based portable tags with smartphone RGB analysis enables rapid quantitative detection of biogenic amines (detection limit: 3.7&#8211;9.1 &#181;M, response time &lt;10 min). The sensor allows real&#8208;time tracking of spoilage in shrimp and chicken stored at 0&#8211;25 &#176;C, with visual fluorescence color transitions reflecting amine accumulation levels. This work provides molecular insights into dynamic charge transfer regulation and establishes a high&#8208;sensitivity, visual, wearable solution for on&#8208;site food safety detection, advancing smart sensing technology in the food industry.

         <title>Ternary Strategy and Molecular Electrostatics Collaboratively Optimize Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Polymer Donor Organic Solar Cells: Over 20% Efficiency and High Scalability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inefficient low&#8208;molecule&#8208;weight LWPM6&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs) using trimeric acceptor TYT&#8208;S are optimized, enhancing power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. LWPM6 flexible devices show excellent mechanical stability and solution&#8208;processability, offering new insights for OSCs commercialization.








Abstract
Achieving consistent performance across polymer donor batches is crucial for the commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs). Compared with high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PM6 (HWPM6), low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PM6 (LWPM6) has lower efficiency but better stress&#8208;dispersion characteristics and solution&#8208;processability, making its performance improvement vital for practical applications. Here, LWPM6&#8208;based OSCs are optimized by introducing a trimeric guest (TYT&#8208;S). TYT&#8208;S improves PM6:Y6 compatibility, achieving a finer phase separation and a favorable interpenetrating network morphology. A ternary strategy, leveraging molecular electrostatic potential differences, promotes LWPM6 pre&#8208;aggregation, extends film&#8208;formation time, and enhances molecular ordering. The LWPM6&#8208;based ternary system exhibits an optimized vertical phase distribution, with maximum exciton dissociation occurring near the cathode, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.23% (LWPM6&#8208;based binary with a low PCE of 17.35%). When BTP&#8208;eC9 replaces Y6, the LWPM6&#8208;based ternary devices achieve a PCE of 20.12% (LWPM6&#8208;based binary with a low PCE of 17.64%). Additionally, LW polymers can dissipate stress via segmental motion. After 3000 bending cycles, LWPM6&#8208;based flexible devices retain higher initial efficiency than HWPM6&#8208;based one, demonstrating better mechanical stability. In mini&#8208;modules, they also have good solution&#8208;processability. This work demonstrates that a trimer guest strategy can significantly enhance the photovoltaic performance of low&#8208;efficiency LWPM6, offering new insights for OSCs commercialization.

Strong aromatic conjugated ammonium salt (PyPAI) spacers spontaneously form self&#8208;assembled columnar stacks via synergistic cation&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This simultaneously regulates crystallization and establishes a continuous charge transport pathway through a robust &#960;&#8208;conjugated network, overcoming dielectric confinement. Resultant 2D/3D PSCs achieve 26.41% efficiency with enhanced stability.








Abstract
2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions exhibit simultaneous improvement of efficiency and stability to meet commercial applications. However, dielectric confinement and an intrinsically uncontrollable crystallization process in 2D perovskites typically lead to large exciton binding energies and poor film quality, hindering charge dissociation, carrier transport, and ultimately device performance. Here, a strong aromatic conjugated ammonium salt spacer (PyPAI) that can spontaneously form self&#8208;assembled columnar stacks via synergistic cation&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions is introduced, thereby simultaneously regulating crystal growth and enhancing charge transfer for high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The in situ generated 2D perovskite phases effectively modulate nucleation and crystallization kinetics, yielding superior films with vertically oriented crystals and reduced grain boundary density. Concurrently, the robust aromatic &#960;&#8208;conjugated network establishes continuous energy bands, enabling highly efficient carrier shuttling between the inorganic Pb&#8208;I framework and the cationic organic layers. Consequently, PyPAI&#8208;optimized PSCs achieve a remarkable PCE of 26.41% with superior environmental and operational stability.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Selective Defects Engineering in A&#8208;Site Ordered Layered Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance Reversible Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation&#8208;selective defects strategy is proposed to decouple and optimize activity and durability of A&#8208;site ordered layered perovskites air electrode for reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs). A specific cations&#8208;deficient Pr(Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.95Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; displays superior activity and stability when used as an RPCCs air electrode, accelerating its commercialization.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic cells facilitate efficient chemical&#8208;electrical energy interconversion, advancing renewable energy utilization. Commercial viability, however, demands intermediate&#8208;to&#8208;low temperatures (ILT, 400&#8211;600&#160;&#176;C) operation, currently constrained by air electrode performance. A&#8208;site ordered layered perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) promises, yet faces activity and stability issues at ILT. Cation defects effectively tune defect structures in simple perovskites, boosting electrochemical performance, but their specific effects in A&#8208;site ordered perovskites with dual A&#8208;site environments remain unexplored. Here, A&#8208;site cation&#8208;selective defects are engineered to tune PBSCF's performance, with Pr&#8208;deficient (Pr0.95Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948;, p&#8208;PBSCF) and Ba/Sr&#8208;deficient (Pr(Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.95Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948;, bs&#8208;PBSCF) variants revealing distinct defects&#8208;performance relationships. Pr defects weaken Co&#9472;O covalency to activate Co sites, enhancing oxygen electrocatalytic activity. Concurrently, it lowers oxygen vacancy concentration, inhibiting hydration&#8208;induced lattice expansion. This stabilizes Ba&#9472;O/Sr&#9472;O bonds and mitigates Ba/Sr segregation, enhancing stability. However, the reduced oxygen vacancy concentration inhibits the material's hydration, lowering proton conduction and thus restricting activity enhancement. In contrast, Ba/Sr defects not only weaken Co&#9472;O covalency to activate Co sites, but also increase oxygen vacancy concentration, promoting proton and oxygen&#8208;ion transport, thereby significantly enhancing electrode activity. Furthermore, despite increased hydration, bs&#8208;PBSCF's larger&#8208;radius cation defects yield a smaller unit cell versus p&#8208;PBSCF, further strengthening Ba&#9472;O/Sr&#9472;O bonds and inhibiting Ba/Sr segregation, thus leading to superior stability.

         <title>Hydrogen Storage in Magnesium Hydride at Room Temperature Enabled by Graphene&#8208;Stabilized Multivalent Niobium Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene&#8208;stabilized multivalent niobium oxides catalyst enables rapid and reversible hydrogen storage in MgH2, even under room&#8208;temperature or subzero conditions. The in situ formation of multivalent Nb species (Nb0/Nb2+/Nb4+) facilitates barrierless H2 dissociation and enhances H diffusion. This work offers critical insights into low&#8208;temperature hydrogen storage via a synergistic electronic and catalytic mechanism.








Abstract
Reversible hydrogen storage in magnesium hydride (MgH2) remains hindered by intrinsic, complicated kinetic barriers associated with both hydrogen release and uptake, particularly under mild conditions. In this work, graphene&#8208;confined, low&#8208;crystallinity niobium oxide nanoparticles are developed to optimize the kinetic barriers across all stages of hydrogen absorption and desorption in MgH2. This is realized by the synergistic effect of in situ&#8208;generated stable multivalent niobium oxide (NbOx) and the electronically modulating graphene. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that Nb2+ enhances H2 dissociation and diffusion, while Nb4+ facilitates Mg&#9472;H bond cleavage and recombination of H2. Graphene serves a dual function by modulating the electronic environment at NbOx interfaces to facilitate charge transfer, while confining nanoparticles to prevent aggregation and hence maintain the catalytic stability of NbOx. Moreover, graphene suppresses the excessive hydrogen binding tendency of over&#8208;reduced Nb0, which otherwise traps H and impedes hydrogen diffusion. This integrated structure ensures the stabilization of active Nb species and lowers energy barriers across all key steps of hydrogen storage. As a result, an effective hydrogen absorption even at 0&#160;&#176;C and an onset hydrogen desorption temperature of 155.9&#160;&#176;C is realized. This provides a versatile strategy for engineering multivalent oxides for promoting hydrogen storage of MgH2.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Omnidirectional Wind Domain Energy Harvesting Based on Dual&#8208;Mode Complementary Strategy of Wind&#8208;Induced Vibration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;mode complementary strategy of wind&#8208;induced vibration realizes broadband breeze vibration energy harvesting and optimizes wind energy collection in a wide range of wind speed and direction, filling the gap in energy collection when the transmission line does not vibrate due to wind direction changes.








Abstract
The harvesting and utilization of vibration energy from transmission lines can effectively advance the development of smart grids. However, variations in wind direction significantly affect the vibration status of transmission lines&#8208;a problem often overlooked in research. This paper clarifies the gap problem of wind&#8208;induced vibration energy harvesting in transmission lines for the first time, and presents a dual&#8208;mode complementary strategy of wind&#8208;induced vibration for transmission lines. The core innovation is to achieve self&#8208;adaptive omnidirectional wind domain energy harvesting by wind&#8208;vibration energy collaborative response, which overcomes the limitation of single vibration energy harvesting in transmission lines that depend on a specific wind direction. The designed wind&#8208;vibration hybrid nanogenerator (W&#8208;VHNG) ingeniously integrates two different TENG mechanisms to achieve broadband breeze vibration energy capture (vibration frequency range of 5&#8211;60&#160;Hz), wide wind speed and direction adaptability (wind speed range of 4.2&#8211;14 m&#160;s&#8722;1 and the wind direction range of &#177;30&#176;), and mW&#8208;scale power output (maximum mean power of 1.33&#160;mW). Finally, the potential of the W&#8208;VHNG for self&#8208;powered sensing of transmission lines is highlighted through three application strategies. This research provides a new solution for the sustainable harvesting of complex and variable high&#8208;entropy energy in transmission lines.

         <title>Breaking the Efficiency&#8208;Stability&#8208;Sustainability Trilemma in all&#8208;perovskite Tandem Solar Modules via Oxidative Blockchain Molecular Engineering</title>

This study presents an oxidation&#8208;triggered blockchain molecular&#8208;assisted buried interface engineering strategy for achieving comprehensive lifecycle management of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules and breaking the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;sustainability trilemma for practical applications.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites are vital for all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules (TSMs), yet their commercialization remains limited by challenges in balancing efficiency, stability, and sustainability. Here, we presented an oxidation&#8208;triggered blockchain molecular (BCM) interface engineering strategy, which modified the poly (3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) surface and constructed a dynamic functional layer at the buried PEDOT:PSS/Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite interface through synergistic effects of biocompatible rutin molecules and their oxidation derivatives. This approach enabled full&#8208;cycle optimization from film formation to operational longevity via sequential regulation of crystallization and carrier dynamics, along with persistent defect passivation through synergistic coordination and hydrogen bonding. Resulting NBG devices achieved champion efficiencies of 23.50% (0.045 cm2) and 17.10% (10.4 cm2), respectively. The all&#8208;perovskite TSMs (10.4 cm2) attained a 23.00% aperture efficiency (an active&#8208;area efficiency of 24.30%) and retained &#8764;90% efficiency after 640 h of continuous illumination (extrapolated TPCE80 lifetime of 3900 h) and after 15 cycles of day&#8208;night fatigue tests. Additionally, BCM's dual protection effects (physical barrier and chemical chelation) reduced lead leakage of severely damaged TSMs by 90% under simulated heavy rainfall, demonstrating strong environmental resilience. This work offers a scalable molecular strategy for advancing perovskite photovoltaics from lab&#8208;scale innovation to industrial viability.

         <title>Superstructure Engineering Enables NASICON&#8208;Type Phosphate Cathodes with Increased Working Voltage and Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the calcination temperature during synthesis, the Fe3+ is preferentially migrated to Na+ vacancies to generate Fe/Na_v superstructure ordering in monoclinic Na3VFe(PO4)3 (NVFP&#8208;S), which can increase Fe&#9472;O ionic characters due to electronic structure arrangement, finally elevating the Fe2+/Fe3 redox potential from 2.37 to 2.82&#160;V, corresponding to the energy density increase from 325 to 350&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 versus the conventional Na3VFe(PO4)3 (NVFP).








Abstract
Na+ Super Ionic CONductor (NASICON)&#8208;type iron&#8208;based phosphate cathode has attained extensive research interest due to its green, low cost, and superior rate capability for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, owing to strong Fe&#9472;O covalent character in the NASICON frameworks, the low Fe2+/Fe3+ redox potential (&lt;2.5&#160;V vs Na+/Na) has led to an undesirable energy density of phosphate cathode. Herein, superstructure engineering is employed to increase the ionic characteristics of Fe&#9472;O bonds and the working voltage of Fe2+/Fe3 redox couples. The combined analysis of advanced structural characterization and theoretical calculation indicates that the Fe3+ ions can migrate to Na+ vacancies to generate Fe/Na_v superstructure ordering by manipulating calcination temperature during synthesis. The Fe delocalization and electronic structure rearrangement can enlarge the energy gap between antibonding orbital and the Fermi energy level. As a concept proof, the as&#8208;prepared Na3VFe(PO4)3 cathode with Fe/Na_v superlattice structure enables an increase in Fe2+/Fe3 redox couples from 2.37 to 2.82&#160;V, accompanied by the energy density increase from 325 to 350&#160;W h kg&#8722;1, compared with the conventional Na3VFe(PO4)3 electrode. This work paves the way for increasing the working voltage and energy density of NASICON type iron&#8208;based phosphate cathodes for SIBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Single&#8208;Atom Evaporator: Collaborative Omnibearing Light Trapping Stereo Structures for Efficient Water Transport Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D conical cone array evaporators is prepared based on high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom composite thermal management materials which only contain 3 wt.%. This design achieves a water evaporation rate of 2.86 kg&#160;m&#8722;2 along with an evaporation efficiency of 94.5% under 1.0 sunlight irradiation. The absorbed energy of cone array evaporators improved 18% and the evaporation rate is increased by 58.7% compared to the flat structure evaporator, offering significant insights for the progression of solar interface evaporation technology.








Abstract
Achieving efficient photothermal evaporation requires a synergistic integration of thermal management, water transport dynamics, and light trapping&#8212;key elements often challenging to harmonize. Herein, A high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atomic metal doped porous carbon (HESA) with ultra&#8208;low metal content of 1.77 wt.% is designed as a new type of photothermal material through a green and convenient routine, which displays tunable hierarchical nano/micro/macro&#8208;porous structure. By integrating molecular dynamics simulations with a 3D light capture structure, a HESA cone evaporator is prepared, utilizing only 3 wt.% of photothermal content. Under 1.0 sun illumination, the cone evaporator demonstrates an outstanding water evaporation rate of 2.86&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and photothermal evaporation efficiency of 94.5%. Compared to conventional flat evaporators, the cone increases absorbed energy by 18% and enhances the evaporation rate by 58.7%. Molecular dynamics analyses reveal that the evaporator significantly improves water transfer kinetics, achieving an intermediate water content nearly twice that of pure water. Complementary COMSOL simulations further validate that the conical array structure enhances light absorption and optimizes water evaporation and diffusion. This meticulously designed evaporator leverages adaptive thermal and light management strategies, offering an effective solution to longstanding challenges in solar interfacial evaporation.

         <title>A p&#8208;Type Liquid&#8208;Crystal Semiconductor with Synergistic Morphological and Charge&#8208;Dynamic Modulation Enables 20.3%&#8208;Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A classical p&#8208;type liquid crystalline organic semiconductor, 2&#8208;decyl&#8208;7&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzothienobenzothiophene (Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10), is incorporated into the organic photovoltaic active layer as a dual&#8208;functional additive. Its incorporation optimizes the blend morphology with favorable phase separation, extends exciton diffusion length, and significantly improves charge transport dynamics. The binary device based on D18:L8&#8208;BO processes using Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10 yields an impressive power conversion efficiency of 20.3%.








Abstract
Solid additives serve as an effective strategy for modulating the morphology of organic solar cell (OSC) active layers, which critically linked to devices performance. However, current solid additives primarily focus on morphological control, while their inherently weak electrical characteristics may limit improvements in carrier mobility and other electrical properties. This study innovatively introduces a p&#8208;type rod&#8208;like liquid crystalline (LC) organic&#8208;semiconductor, 2&#8208;decyl&#8208;7&#8208;phenylbenzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene (Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10), as a multifunctional additive in D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based binary OSCs. Benefiting from its strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and high intrinsic mobility, Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10 enables precise morphological control while simultaneously improving electrical properties. This dual effect synergistically extends exciton diffusion length, enhances charge separation, suppresses recombination, and significantly boosts hole mobility in blend films. Consequently, the optimized binary devices attained a competitive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.3%, alongside a short&#8208;circuit current density of 27.28&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and fill factor of 80.5%. To the best of knowledge, this performance ranks among the highest reported for binary systems exceeding the 20% PCE threshold. This work demonstrates that p&#8208;type LC semiconductors function as multifunctional additives capable of concurrently regulating morphology and boosting intrinsic electrical properties by establishing expanded charge&#8208;transport networks, presenting a promising new paradigm for advancing OSC performance.

The binary device based on D18:L8-BO processes using Ph-BTBT-10 yields an impressive power conversion efficiency of 20.3%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid additives serve as an effective strategy for modulating the morphology of organic solar cell (OSC) active layers, which critically linked to devices performance. However, current solid additives primarily focus on morphological control, while their inherently weak electrical characteristics may limit improvements in carrier mobility and other electrical properties. This study innovatively introduces a p-type rod-like liquid crystalline (LC) organic-semiconductor, 2-decyl-7-phenylbenzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene (Ph-BTBT-10), as a multifunctional additive in D18:L8-BO-based binary OSCs. Benefiting from its strong &#960;-&#960; stacking and high intrinsic mobility, Ph-BTBT-10 enables precise morphological control while simultaneously improving electrical properties. This dual effect synergistically extends exciton diffusion length, enhances charge separation, suppresses recombination, and significantly boosts hole mobility in blend films. Consequently, the optimized binary devices attained a competitive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.3%, alongside a short-circuit current density of 27.28&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and fill factor of 80.5%. To the best of knowledge, this performance ranks among the highest reported for binary systems exceeding the 20% PCE threshold. This work demonstrates that p-type LC semiconductors function as multifunctional additives capable of concurrently regulating morphology and boosting intrinsic electrical properties by establishing expanded charge-transport networks, presenting a promising new paradigm for advancing OSC performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redefining PbS Quantum Dot Photovoltaics: p&#8208;i&#8208;n Devices with Superior Efficiency and Reproducibility</title>

Report a NiOx/SAM/PbS&#8208;SAM composite hole transporting layer (HTL) is reported for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PbS QD solar cells, achieving a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching 14% (certified 13.62%), surpassing the previous 9.70% p&#8208;i&#8208;n record and exceeding the certified PCE of n&#8208;i&#8208;p architecture in both efficiency and reproducibility.








Abstract
Developing diverse photovoltaic device architectures is essential not only for improving power conversion efficiency (PCE) but also for enabling seamless integration with other photovoltaic materials in high&#8208;performance tandem configurations. While n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectures have historically dominated the development of PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) solar cells, p&#8208;i&#8208;n counterparts have significantly lagged behind in efficiency, limiting their potential for further advancement. In this work, the advantage of the surface tunability of CQDs is taken by anchoring the classical self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) molecule MeO&#8208;2PACz onto PbS CQDs via ligand exchange, forming a PbS&#8208;SAM bridging&#8208;layer, which is inserted between NiOx/SAM and the CQD active layer, resulting in a NiOx/SAM/PbS&#8208;SAM composite hole transporting layer (HTL). This structure effectively passivates the buried interfacial traps and enhances hole extraction. As a result, a record PCE approaching 14% is achieved, with a certified value of 13.62%, which is not only largely surpassing the previous highest value of 9.70% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PbS QD solar cells, but also exceeds the current PCE record set by n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectures. Moreover, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n configuration exhibits excellent reproducibility, providing a robust and scalable platform for future applications, particularly as a narrow&#8208;bandgap subcell in monolithic tandem devices with wide&#8208;bandgap materials such as perovskites.

An amorphous iron&#8208;based oxyhalide CAM breaks the conductivity&#8208;capacity trade&#8208;off associated with the MCl6 anionic framework, achieving both high ionic conductivity and high discharge capacity.








Abstract
Halide cathode active materials (CAMs) with high ionic conductivities have attracted significant attention. However, their capacity and energy density are limited by the large molar weight of the Li&#8314; transport&#8208;dependent MCl6 anionic framework. In this study, a low&#8208;cost amorphous iron&#8208;based oxyhalide LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM is introduced that overcomes the conductivity&#8208;capacity trade&#8208;off between high ionic conductivity and low discharge capacity associated with the MCl6 framework. LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM achieves dual breakthroughs, exhibiting an impressive ionic conductivity of 0.26 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, and a high specific capacity of 586 mAh g&#8722;1 via an intercalation&#8208;conversion reaction at 60&#160;&#176;C. Due to its superior ionic conductivity and capacity, LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM enables a catholyte&#8208;free electrode to achieve an exceptional energy density of &#8776;1100&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1cathode and a power density of 2185&#160;W kg&#8722;1cathode at 60&#160;&#176;C, surpassing reported halide&#8208; and oxide&#8208;based CAMs by 1.5 to 3 times. Additionally, LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM is highly cost&#8208;effective ($9.3 kg&#8722;1) and exhibits remarkable humidity stability, retaining 100% of its capacity after 12 h of exposure to 5 &#177; 1% humidity. The multifunctional iron&#8208;based oxyhalide CAMs open new avenues for advancing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Frequency Switching Neuristor for Realizing Intrinsic Plasticity and Enabling Robust Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A frequency switching (FS) neuristor is proposed, comprising a Mott memristor and a valence change mechanism (VCM) memristor. The FS neuristor exhibits a multi&#8208;level frequency&#8211;voltage (f&#8211;V) characteristics, enabling the implementation of neuronal intrinsic plasticity transfer functions. By leveraging the FS neuristor's intrinsic plasticity, a more reliable and robust sparse neural network can achieve, well&#8208;suited for edge neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The human brain's efficiency and adaptability in processing information is largely attributed to spatiotemporal spiking activities and intrinsic plasticity&#8212;the ability of neurons to autonomously modulate their excitability. Mott memristors, with their threshold switching characteristics, have been effectively utilized as artificial neurons, or neuristors, to generate spiking activities. However, the implementation of intrinsic plasticity and its significance in neuromorphic computing has yet to be systematically explored. Here, a frequency switching (FS) neuristor is presented that emulates neuron's intrinsic plasticity characteristics. By combining a volatile Mott memristor with a non&#8208;volatile valence change memory (VCM) memristor, the FS neuristor achieves programmable multi&#8208;level frequency&#8211;voltage (f&#8211;V) characteristics analogous to the transfer functions of neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Through device&#8208;based simulations of sparse neural networks, it is proposed that this intrinsic plasticity acts as memory and processor itself, enhancing network performance and reducing energy consumption. Additionally, intrinsic plasticity endows the network with structural plasticity, enabling full recovery of the network's performance after random neuron damage, suggesting a pathway toward more adaptive and resilient neuromorphic computing systems.

         <title>Biomimetic 3D&#8208;Printed Adaptive Hydrogel Bioadhesives Featuring Superior Infection Resistance for Challenging Tissue Adhesion, Hemostasis, and Healthcare</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel bioadhesives (PTLAs) are designed to address the limitations of existing bioadhesives, offering solutions for challenging tissue adhesion and enhanced healthcare. These PTLAs feature robust wet/underwater tissue adhesion/sealing, superior freeze/pressure and infection resistance, and adaptive self&#8208;healing/gelling capacity, presenting transformative potential as bio&#8208;tapes, bio&#8208;bandages, bio&#8208;sealants, bio&#8208;carriers, etc., and inspiring next&#8208;generation bioadhesives design.








Abstract
Conventional suturing and stapling cause additional trauma, pain, and cost for patients. As alternatives, existing bioadhesives suffer from imprecise fabrication, limited wet tissue adhesion, and insufficient biological functionalities for effective wound management. This work proposes biomimetic hydrogel bioadhesives composed of modified natural tannic acid (TA), hyperbranched polylysine (HPL), and acrylic acid (AA), abbreviated PTLAs, to offer solutions for tissue adhesion under challenging environments (underwater, body fluids, cold, pressure), and for enhanced healthcare. These PTLAs are fabricated via 3D printing, enabling the precise and controlled production of bioadhesives that are customized in a personalized manner with great reproducibility. Inspired by molluscs, developed PTLAs exhibit robust wet and underwater tissue adhesion, outperforming commercial and many recently reported bioadhesives. Ex vivo lamb and in vivo rat models demonstrate ultrafast (5&#160;s) and efficient sealing and hemostasis. Exceptional freeze resistance and pressure resistance further expand their applicability to extreme environments. Meanwhile, coupled with superior infection resistance, PTLAs ensure enhanced wound healthcare while sealing and hemostasis. Further, their self&#8208;gelling feature supports dry powder adhesion/sealing applications, practical packaging, and long&#8208;term storage. Overall, adaptive tissue&#8208;like PTLAs present transformative potential as bio&#8208;tapes, bio&#8208;bandages, bio&#8208;sealants, bio&#8208;carriers, etc., paving the way for next&#8208;generation bioadhesives design and enhanced healthcare solutions.

&lt;p&gt;Biomimetic 3D-printed hydrogel bioadhesives (PTLAs) are designed to address the limitations of existing bioadhesives, offering solutions for challenging tissue adhesion and enhanced healthcare. These PTLAs feature robust wet/underwater tissue adhesion/sealing, superior freeze/pressure and infection resistance, and adaptive self-healing/gelling capacity, presenting transformative potential as bio-tapes, bio-bandages, bio-sealants, bio-carriers, etc., and inspiring next-generation bioadhesives design.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional suturing and stapling cause additional trauma, pain, and cost for patients. As alternatives, existing bioadhesives suffer from imprecise fabrication, limited wet tissue adhesion, and insufficient biological functionalities for effective wound management. This work proposes biomimetic hydrogel bioadhesives composed of modified natural tannic acid (TA), hyperbranched polylysine (HPL), and acrylic acid (AA), abbreviated PTLAs, to offer solutions for tissue adhesion under challenging environments (underwater, body fluids, cold, pressure), and for enhanced healthcare. These PTLAs are fabricated via 3D printing, enabling the precise and controlled production of bioadhesives that are customized in a personalized manner with great reproducibility. Inspired by molluscs, developed PTLAs exhibit robust wet and underwater tissue adhesion, outperforming commercial and many recently reported bioadhesives. Ex vivo lamb and in vivo rat models demonstrate ultrafast (5&#160;s) and efficient sealing and hemostasis. Exceptional freeze resistance and pressure resistance further expand their applicability to extreme environments. Meanwhile, coupled with superior infection resistance, PTLAs ensure enhanced wound healthcare while sealing and hemostasis. Further, their self-gelling feature supports dry powder adhesion/sealing applications, practical packaging, and long-term storage. Overall, adaptive tissue-like PTLAs present transformative potential as bio-tapes, bio-bandages, bio-sealants, bio-carriers, etc., paving the way for next-generation bioadhesives design and enhanced healthcare solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steep&#8208;Slope CuInP2S6 Ferroionic Threshold Switching Field&#8208;Effect Transistor for Implementation of Artificial Spiking Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of an energy&#8208;efficient and biologically inspired spiking neuron device based on a CuInP2S6 (CIPS) ferroionic threshold switching field&#8208;effect transistor TS&#8208;FET is reported. The device demonstrates essential neuronal behaviors, such as leaky integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire dynamics, a tunable firing threshold, and spatiotemporal processing, all without requiring auxiliary reset circuitry. Furthermore, a spiking neural network (SNN) is implemented by integrating CIPS&#8208;based synaptic and neuron devices.








Abstract
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered considerable attention as energy&#8208;efficient and biologically inspired computing paradigms. However, despite the growing interest, the development of hardware&#8208;based SNNs has remained limited, primarily because of insufficient research on hardware&#8208;based spiking neuron devices. In this study, a CuInP2S6 (CIPS)&#8208;based threshold switching field&#8208;effect transistor (TS&#8208;FET) is presented, featuring steep switching characteristics, and demonstrate its potential as an energy&#8208;efficient spiking neuron device. The proposed device exhibits outstanding characteristics: ultra&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS &#8776;7.5 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), high on/off current ratio (&gt;107), and ultra&#8208;low off current (&#8776;0.3 pA) due to the ferroionic properties of CIPS. The tunable dynamics for Cu+ ion migration induce a phase transition, leading to sharp resistance switching and efficient spiking. This device successfully mimics key neuronal dynamics, including leaky integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire, threshold tuning, and spatiotemporal dynamics, without requiring auxiliary reset circuits. Furthermore, SNN is constructed by integrating CIPS&#8208;based synaptic and neuron devices and evaluate face classification performance using an unsupervised learning approach, achieving a recognition accuracy of 95.83% via the lateral inhibition function of the neuron device. The findings highlight the potential of CIPS TS&#8208;FET as energy&#8208;efficient spiking neuron device applications for next&#8208;generation SNN&#8208;based neuromorphic computing systems.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop and Sustainable 4D Printing of Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Sulfur&#8208;Rich Polymer Composites for Autonomous Task Execution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Closed&#8208;loop and sustainable 4D printing of sulfur&#8208;rich polymer composites is demonstrated for the first time using loosely crosslinked poly(phenylene polysulfide) networks (PSNs) and their magnetic composites (MPSNs). 3D&#8208;printed PSNs and MPSNs exhibit shape&#8208;morphing capabilities and can be directly reprinted into new form factors and magneto&#8208;responsive soft robots. 3D&#8208;printed MPSNs can serve as an on&#8208;demand catalyst&#8208;releasable stirring bar for chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;programmable polymer networks derived from waste elemental sulfur hold great potential for diverse applications such as 4D printing and soft robotics. However, their crosslinked nature makes it challenging to 3D print complex geometry for soft robots. Herein, a closed&#8208;loop 4D printing strategy is reported of poly(phenylene polysulfide) networks (PSNs) and their magnetic particle composites (MPSNs) to fabricate multi&#8208;functional soft robots with programmable shape&#8208;morphing capabilities. The dynamic S&#9472;S bonds within the loosely crosslinked PSNs impart shear&#8208;thinning behavior, enabling hot&#8208;melt extrusion of both PSNs and MPSNs into complex architectures. After shape&#8208;programming, 3D&#8208;printed PSN and MPSN structures exhibit heat&#8208; or light&#8208;triggered shape recovery and allow modular assembly for spatially selective shape&#8208;morphing governed by the distinct glass transition temperatures of the PSN series. These architectures can be readily reprinted into new form factors, demonstrating a closed&#8208;loop and sustainable 4D printing. With multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness and solvent resistance provided by the PSN composites, the MPSN capsule serves as an on&#8208;demand catalyst&#8208;releasing magnetic stirring bar in a reagent&#8208;containing solution, autonomously releasing catalysts at a preset temperature to facilitate carbamate synthesis. The 4D printable MPSNs offer a sustainable platform not only for adaptable shape&#8208;morphing and dynamic actuation but also for autonomous task execution in next&#8208;generation soft robotic applications.

         <title>Regular Tandem Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with over 51% External Quantum Efficiency for Next&#8208;Generation Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a regular tandem quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diode achieving over 51% external quantum efficiency through systematic optimization of both charge injection balance and light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Thanks to the fast response of this device, the obtained 8 &#215; 8 passive&#8208;matrix displays can present flicker&#8208;free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness.








Abstract
Despite excellent efficiency and stability achieved in regular single&#8208;unit quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), regular tandem QLEDs still suffer from limited device performance, lagging far behind the inverted tandem QLEDs. Here, novel regular tandem QLEDs are demonstrated with an ultrathin (&#8776;4 nm) indium tin oxide (ITO) charge generation layer (CGL). Through systematic optimization of charge injection balance and light out&#8208;coupling efficiency, the resulting tandem QLEDs can exhibit a record&#8208;breaking EQE of 51.2%, an exceptional T95 lifetime of &#8776;31383 h (at 1000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2), and an ultralow turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.8 V, which represent the highest performance metrics reported to date for regular tandem QLEDs. Thanks to the fast response of this tandem device (&#8776;4.8 &#181;s), the first&#8208;ever fabricated 8 &#215; 8 passive&#8208;matrix displays can present flicker&#8208;free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness, demonstrating that the achievable color display capability and driving scheme of QLED displays can be expanded by using the tandem architecture. It is believed the results will significantly promote the development of regular tandem QLEDs, which will lead to unprecedented improvements in device efficiency and stability, accelerating their application in next&#8208;generation displays and lighting.

         <title>Reducing Structural Distortion by Tailoring Orbital Interactions in High&#8208;Voltage Polyanionic Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main structural distortion of the KVPO4F cathode is attributed to the V5+ octahedral distortion. Low energy&#8208;level Mn is introduced into V site to enhance the matching of the central transition metal ion's 3d orbitals with the ligands&#8217; 2p orbitals in &#963; and &#960; symmetry. The strong orbital interactions suppress octahedron distortion and structure degradation to endure steady&#160;ion extraction.








Abstract
The structural distortion of electrode materials in battery systems usually results in the structure degradation and capacity fading upon cycling. However, the fundamental mechanism about the structural distortion remains elusive. A critical issue has emerged concerning the utilization of high&#8208;voltage potassium vanadium fluorophosphate compound (KVPO4F) as a competitive cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion battery applications. In this work, it is initially identified that the primary distortion in KVPO4F cathode is octahedra distortion. The weak orbital interactions among central transition metal ions with ligands in an octahedron play a pivotal role in the structural distortion, resulting in an accumulation of microstrain during the cycles. This cognition serves as the foundation for the introduction of low energy&#8208;level Mn into the V sites to suppress the structure distortion and lattice microstrain. The multi&#8208;electron 3d orbitals of Mn sites tend to interact with the &#963; and &#960; symmetry&#8208;matched 2p orbitals of ligands, thereby facilitating the formation of stable octahedrons to endure ion extraction steadily in high voltage. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of structure degradation based on the octahedral distortion, thereby facilitating the enhancement of stability in high&#8208;voltage cathodes.

The strong orbital interactions suppress octahedron distortion and structure degradation to endure steady&#160;ion extraction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural distortion of electrode materials in battery systems usually results in the structure degradation and capacity fading upon cycling. However, the fundamental mechanism about the structural distortion remains elusive. A critical issue has emerged concerning the utilization of high-voltage potassium vanadium fluorophosphate compound (KVPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F) as a competitive cathode material for potassium-ion battery applications. In this work, it is initially identified that the primary distortion in KVPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F cathode is octahedra distortion. The weak orbital interactions among central transition metal ions with ligands in an octahedron play a pivotal role in the structural distortion, resulting in an accumulation of microstrain during the cycles. This cognition serves as the foundation for the introduction of low energy-level Mn into the V sites to suppress the structure distortion and lattice microstrain. The multi-electron 3d orbitals of Mn sites tend to interact with the &#963; and &#960; symmetry-matched 2p orbitals of ligands, thereby facilitating the formation of stable octahedrons to endure ion extraction steadily in high voltage. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of structure degradation based on the octahedral distortion, thereby facilitating the enhancement of stability in high-voltage cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmable Active Phase Reconstruction in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Toward High&#8208;Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study harnesses multimetallic synergy to program dynamic evolution of 2D nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks to architect high&#8208;activity oxyhydroxides phase for oxygen evolution. The cascade control of reconstruction dynamics, terminated structure state, and catalytic pathways deciphers &#8220;reconstruction&#8208;catalysis&#8221; programming principles. This paradigm shift enables on&#8208;demand design of efficient electrocatalysts through proactive reconstruction steering.








Abstract
Orchestrated manipulation of the dynamic structural evolution of catalytic materials in service represents an effective approach to rationally architect the active phase for highly efficient catalysis. Herein, this study reports a 2D ultrathin nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) pre&#8208;catalyst, where multimetallic electronic cooperativity enables on&#8208;demand hierarchical regulation of the structural evolution as well as the catalytic process of the reconstruction&#8208;derived active phase, delivering oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance superior to benchmark RuO2. Tailored cobalt&#8208;iron co&#8208;substitution in nickel&#8208;based MOF strategically engineers the overall structural flexibility, controllably promoting the reconstruction process in alkaline media into ligand&#8208;anchored nickel oxyhydroxide active phases. Crucially, the controlled modulation of the structural state of reconstructed phases induces targeted metal&#8208;oxygen electronic interplay, steering active oxygen intermediate reconfiguration and reducing the thermodynamic bottleneck of the rate&#8208;determining step, ultimately achieving optimized catalytic pathways. This work precisely constructs MOF&#8208;derived reconstructed active phases and elucidates a programmed optimization mechanism governed by multimetallic electronic interplay, which dynamically bridges structural transformation and catalytic activity enhancement. A promising approach is showcased to accurately design high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts through programming dynamic structural evolution.

         <title>Diamond&#8208;Inspired DNA Hydrogel Based on Tetrahedral Framework Nucleic Acids for Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by diamond, this study introduces a DNA hydrogel formulated with tetrahedral DNA nanostructure, which exhibits enhanced mechanical strength. It exhibits multiple functionalities, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, hemostatic performance, etc. Single&#8208;cell sequencing indicates this hydrogel disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cascade, promotes extracellular matrix formation and re&#8208;epithelialization, ultimately facilitating burn wound healing.








Abstract
Burn wounds frequently pose high risks of a prolonged healing process and even death due to the persistent reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated inflammatory cascade. There is an urgent requirement for advanced dressings modulating the immune microenvironment surrounding the wound. DNA hydrogels have been preliminarily investigated in tissue regeneration due to their excellent permeability, editability, and biocompatibility. However, their broader applications have been limited by poor mechanical properties, and their roles in tissue regeneration remain insufficiently explored. Inspired by diamond, this study introduces a DNA hydrogel formulated with tetrahedral framework DNA, which exhibits enhanced mechanical strength due to its stable structure. Additionally, it exhibits multiple functionalities, including ROS scavenging, hemostatic performance, adhesion, injectability, shear&#8208;thinning behavior, and self&#8208;healing capability. Single&#8208;cell sequencing analysis indicates that this hydrogel disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cascade and promotes the transformation of pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophages into an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. This effect promotes extracellular matrix formation and re&#8208;epithelialization with changes in the communication between macrophages, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes, ultimately facilitating burn wound healing on the skin of mice. In summary, this study not only presents a novel approach to bolstering the mechanical strength of pure DNA hydrogels but also marks a systematic evaluation of DNA hydrogels in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Density in Dielectric Polymers Near Glass Transition Temperature by Molecular Twisting Conformation Locking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel molecular twisting conformation locking strategy is proposed and demonstrated to simultaneously suppress intrachain and interchain electron migration pathways in high glass transition temperature (Tg) dielectric polymers, addressing their compromised electrical insulation at elevated operating temperatures near their Tg. A novel dielectric polymer featuring molecular twisting conformation locking maintains stable operation at 250&#160;&#176;C while achieving ultrahigh discharge energy density of 4.3 J cm&#8722;3.








Abstract
Dielectric polymers with high operating temperatures (To) for capacitive energy storage applications are urgently needed in new energy vehicles and power electronics. Polymers with high glass transition temperatures (Tg), such as Kapton polyimide (Tg&#8776;360&#160;&#176;C), suffer low To (&lt; 150&#160;&#176;C) due to electron delocalization between donor and acceptor units. Here, a molecular twisting conformation&#8208;locking strategy is proposed for high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers to block intrachain and interchain electron migration pathways. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the elevated leakage current in polyimides originates from enhanced electron delocalization induced by intrachain imide ring planarization and interchain donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking. The molecular twisting conformation&#8208;locking disrupts intrachain imide ring planarization and the face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking of interchain D&#8208;A units. As a result, the designed polymer exhibits an ultrahigh resistivity of 6.8 &#215; 1013 &#937; m&#8722;1 at 250&#160;&#176;C (close to its Tg), surpassing the 2.8 &#215; 1013 &#937; m&#8722;1 of PEI at 50&#160;&#176;C. Simultaneously, it achieves an ultrahigh discharge energy density of 4.3 J cm&#8722;3, outperforming existing high&#8208;Tg dielectric polymers. This study introduces a design paradigm to address the challenge of dielectric polymers that do not function properly as ambient temperatures approach their Tg.

         <title>Multispectrum Electromagnetic Response in FeNiHo/C Heterodimensional Structure for Microwave Absorption and Multimode Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a novel FeNiHo/C hierarchical heterodimensional structured with multispectrum&#8208;coupling electromagnetic response. Through multi&#8208;scale polar heterointerface engineering, the heterodimensional structure achieves ultra&#8208;broadband microwave absorption, in situ microwave frequency&#8208;agile property, and multimode photodetections. These results inspire the development of electromagnetic multifunctional materials.








Abstract
Multispectrum response technology is the key to developing multifunctional electromagnetic devices in cross&#8208;field applications. Traditional methods rely on integrating complex multi&#8208;material systems, leading to bulkier and costlier devices. Here, a hierarchical heterodimensional structure composed of FeNiHo alloy and carbon matrix achieves autonomous multispectrum&#8208;coupling electromagnetic response between microwave and ultraviolet through polar interface engineering. In the microwave band, the heterodimensional structure exhibits outstanding microwave absorption performance with high reflection loss of &#8722;46.87 dB and ultra&#8208;wide absorption bandwidth of 8.96 GHz. Furthermore, the antenna arrays based on the heterodimensional structure demonstrate in situ microwave frequency&#8208;agile property by a coupled ultraviolet stimulation, where the largest frequency modulation range reaches 5.05 GHz in Ku&#8208;band. In the ultraviolet band, multimode photodetectors constructed by the heterodimensional structure possess excellent responsivity and accurate decoding ability for anti&#8208;interference ultraviolet communication. Particularly, the metamaterial detector achieves analog signal communication for the first time by microwave&#8208;ultraviolet coupling response. This work pioneers a novel approach to developing multifunctional electromagnetic materials for multispectrum applications.

         <title>Sustainable Clay Electrolytes for Aqueous Batteries: All&#8208;Temperature Single&#8208;Ion Conductor with Nanoconfined Hydration Shell Reorganization Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A specifically designed clay&#8208;based single&#8208;ion conductor with unique hydration&#8208;shell reconfiguration mechanism is utilized as the all&#8208;temperature electrolyte to endow the working temperature range of the aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries from &#8722;60 to 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Ion transport property and water structure of electrolytes are two of the most important issues for aqueous batteries, especially when operated at extreme temperatures. To this end, a sepiolite&#8208;based clay electrolyte (SCYE) with nanoconfined channels as single&#8208;ion conductor is proposed. The inner Zn2+ and anions solvation shells exhibit fascinating hydration&#8208;shell reconfiguration behavior compared to the conventional Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous electrolytes. The bond&#8208;orientational order of the Zn2+ and anions is broken and highly developed, respectively, thus improving the Zn2+ transference number to 0.97. Moreover, free water molecules are dramatically reduced in the SCYE, contributing to improved anti&#8208;freezing ability and thermal stability. The single&#8208;ion transport property of the SCYE endows the PANI||Zn full cells with excellent rate performances, with an &#8776;84% capacity retention from 1 to 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Besides, full cells with the SCYE achieve 17,000 cycles under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C with a specific capacity of 130 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and considerable performances even at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, while they can operate over 3000 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C with 87% capacity retention. This attracting effect can be expanded to several other clay materials, all presenting improved ion transport capability, which paves a road for future aqueous batteries across extreme temperatures.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Production Through Hierarchically Ordered Porous Carbon for Self&#8208;Sustaining Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green hydrogen production through a coupled self&#8208;sustaining solar&#8208;enabled system that couples atmospheric water harvesting with PEM water electrolysis (AWH&#8208;PEMWE), offering a novel pathway for clean water generation and green hydrogen production. The system operates without the need for carrier gases or external energy input accessories, enabling a fully solar&#8208;driven process with zero carbon emission throughout the hydrogen production cycle.








Abstract
Green hydrogen production by proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) powered by clean energy is a promising and environmentally friendly technology. However, it relies on a high&#8208;purity water source, which is limited in regions facing water scarcity. Here, a coupled self&#8208;sustaining solar&#8208;enabled system is reported that couples atmospheric water harvesting with PEM water electrolysis (AWH&#8208;PEMWE), offering a novel pathway for clean water generation and green hydrogen production. The atmospheric water harvester (AWH) component utilizes N and O co&#8208;doped hydrophilic ordered porous carbon, engineered with an interconnected hierarchical porous structure with prosperous channels for efficient mass transport. It enables effective interfacial solar evaporation for water release, achieving a record&#8208;high water harvesting capacity of 0.49 L kg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 40% relative humidity (RH). During outdoor tests, the AWH&#8208;PEMWE system reaches a peak green hydrogen production rate of 204 mL h&#8722;1 at midday using only atmospheric water as feedstock. Remarkably, the system remains operational under ultra&#8208;low humidity conditions down to 20% RH, addressing the challenge of water availability in arid environments. Importantly, the system operates without the need for carrier gases or external energy input accessories, enabling a fully solar&#8208;driven process with zero carbon emission throughout the hydrogen production cycle.

         <title>Decoupling of Carrier Pathways in Au/Cu&#8208;Zn3In2S6 Through Bulk Hole Trapping and Surface Hot Electron Accumulation Enhances Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and implement Au&#8208;Cu co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 catalyst with spatially decoupling charge carriers across bulk and surface sites, which effectively suppresses carrier recombination, drives surface hot electron accumulation and stabilizes intermediates for photocatalytic oxygen reduction. The optimized catalyst achieves an H2O2 evolution rate of 94.2 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 using pure water without any sacrificial agents, far exceeding most reported photocatalysts. 








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis offers a sustainable route to H2O2 production but is hindered by charge recombination and non&#8208;selective reactive species generation, resulting in parasitic reactions that reduce selectivity and yield. Here, Au&#8208;Cu co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 (Au/Cu&#8208;d/ZIS) is presented, a catalyst that spatially decouples charge carriers across bulk and surface sites, suppressing recombination and stabilizing intermediates for photocatalytic oxygen reduction. Cu doping introduces trap states that localize holes in the bulk and improve the separation and transportation of bulk photogenerated carriers. Plasmonic Au nanoparticles drive surface hot electron accumulation and further contribute to the oxygen reduction reaction. The optimized catalyst achieves an H2O2 evolution rate of 94.2 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 using pure water without any sacrificial agents, outperforming pristine Zn3In2S6 by nearly threefold. DRIFTS identifies stabilized oxygenated species on the catalyst surface, and DFT calculations demonstrate that Cu trap states lower energy barriers for &#8226;O2&#8722; formation, while Au NPs enhance the charge transfer and ORR reaction between ZIS and O2. The catalyst maintains stability and reusability, producing 2300 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 of H2O2 under natural sunlight over 4 h with consistent performance across multiple cycles. Furthermore, it is successfully applied for bacterial sterilization and pharmaceutical pollutant degradation, demonstrating its potential for environmental remediation.

         <title>Competitive Crystallization Modulated Phase&#8208;Homogeneous Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for Monolithic Perovskite&#8208;Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenyl phosphate is utilized to modulate Br/I competitive crystallization for improving compositional distribution, efficiency, and stability in wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) PSCs. The homogeneous WBG perovskite boosts the efficiencies up to record values of 21.39% (1.72&#160;eV) and 19.64% (1.84&#160;eV), and maintains 95% of its initial efficiency for 1100&#160;h. The resulting PO&#8208;TSCs achieve champion efficiencies of 26.11% (certified 25.07%).








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites with tunable bandgaps can be integrated into organic solar cells to construct tandem solar cells (TSCs), enabling the device to exceed the Shockley&#8208;Queisser efficiency limit. However, ionic mismatches and crystallization kinetics in WBG perovskites trigger inhomogeneous phase distribution and defects. In this work, a triphenyl phosphate (Tri&#8208;PyPA) is utilized to modulate Br/I competitive crystallization and compositional distribution. The preferential coordination of Tri&#8208;PyPA with PbBr2 reduces the effective charge on Pb2+ and changes the electrostatic interaction between Pb2+ and Br&#8722;/I&#8722; ions. It suppresses the rapid migration of highly diffusive (Br&#8208;rich) components during crystallization. Meanwhile, Tri&#8208;PyPA forms a six&#8208;membered hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring structure with formamidinium cations by H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O&#9552;P interaction to immobilize cations. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation allows Tri&#8208;PyPA to form a compact molecular coverage on the (100) facet, significantly reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination and elevating the ion migration energy barriers. The homogeneous WBG perovskites boost the efficiency up to record values of 21.39% and 19.64% for 1.72&#160;eV and 1.84&#160;eV devices, respectively. The unencapsulated device can maintain 95% of its initial efficiency after illumination for 1100&#160;h. The champion perovskite&#8208;organic TSC shows an efficiency of 26.11% (certified 25.07%) and retains 80% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation for 1000&#160;h.

&lt;p&gt;Wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskites with tunable bandgaps can be integrated into organic solar cells to construct tandem solar cells (TSCs), enabling the device to exceed the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit. However, ionic mismatches and crystallization kinetics in WBG perovskites trigger inhomogeneous phase distribution and defects. In this work, a triphenyl phosphate (Tri-PyPA) is utilized to modulate Br/I competitive crystallization and compositional distribution. The preferential coordination of Tri-PyPA with PbBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduces the effective charge on Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and changes the electrostatic interaction between Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions. It suppresses the rapid migration of highly diffusive (Br-rich) components during crystallization. Meanwhile, Tri-PyPA forms a six-membered hydrogen-bonded ring structure with formamidinium cations by H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O&#9552;P interaction to immobilize cations. The &#960;-&#960; conjugation allows Tri-PyPA to form a compact molecular coverage on the (100) facet, significantly reducing non-radiative recombination and elevating the ion migration energy barriers. The homogeneous WBG perovskites boost the efficiency up to record values of 21.39% and 19.64% for 1.72&#160;eV and 1.84&#160;eV devices, respectively. The unencapsulated device can maintain 95% of its initial efficiency after illumination for 1100&#160;h. The champion perovskite-organic TSC shows an efficiency of 26.11% (certified 25.07%) and retains 80% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation for 1000&#160;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Stress Engineering of Dense Dislocations in Brittle Superconductors for Strong Vortex Pinning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stress&#8208;engineering strategy enables the direct formation of ultra&#8208;dense dislocations in rigid crystals through extrusion&#8208;induced asymmetric stress fields. These tilted dislocation arrays act as efficient pinning centers for magnetic vortices, leading to a fivefold enhancement in the current&#8208;carrying capacity of iron&#8208;based superconductors under high magnetic fields. The method provides a general, scalable pathway for dislocation design in brittle materials.









Abstract

Large lossless currents in high&#8208;temperature superconductors (HTS) critically rely on dense defects with suitable size and dimensionality to pin vortices, with dislocations being particularly effective due to their 1D geometry to interact extensively with vortex lines. However, in non&#8208;metallic compounds such as HTS with rigid lattices, conventional deformation methods typically lead to catastrophic fracture rather than dislocation&#8208;mediated plasticity, making it a persistent challenge to introduce dislocations at high density. Here, an asymmetric stress field strategy is proposed using extrusion to directly nucleate a high density of dislocations in HTS by activating shear&#8208;driven lattice slip and twisting under superimposed hydrostatic compression. As demonstrated in iron&#8208;based superconductors (IBS), atomic displacements of &#8776;1 &#197; trigger the formation of tilted dislocation lines with a density approaching that of metals. With further structural refinement, these dislocations serve as strong pinning centers that lead to a fivefold enhancement in the current&#8208;carrying capacity of IBS at 33 tesla (T), along with low anisotropy and a large irreversibility field. This work not only establishes a scalable route to engineer pinning landscapes in HTS but also offers a generalizable framework for manipulating dislocation structures in rigid crystalline systems.

         <title>Robust Sustainable Interfacial Evaporators from Lignin for Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developes a series of sustainable metal&#8208;lignin composites via a one&#8208;pot reaction between lignin and heavy metal ion&#8208;containing wastewater. The resulting metal&#8208;lignin composites demonstrates significantly enhanced light absorption and photothermal conversion performances compared to unmodified lignin, which are originated from the synergistic effects of oxidation, coordination, and the formation of metal oxides. The metal&#8208;lignin composites are architecturally structured into evaporators, with the optimized evaporator demonstrating an elevated evaporation rate of 2.88&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, also with long&#8208;term stability, efficient wastewater and seawater purification capacities, and notable economic benefits.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation technology has emerged as a promising solution for heavy metal&#8208;containing wastewater treatment, owing to its environmentally friendly and sustainable energy input advantages. However, the development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;efficiency photothermal agents with enhanced heavy&#8208;metal ion tolerance remains a significant challenge for advancing practical solar&#8208;powered wastewater treatment. Herein, we developed a series of metal&#8208;lignin composites, through a one&#8208;pot reaction involving lignin and heavy metal&#8208;contained wastewater, which demonstrated outstanding light&#8208;harvesting efficiency and photothermal conversion properties. The resulting metal&#8208;lignin composites can be efficiently fabricated into evaporators via 3D printing technology for wastewater treatment. The optimized evaporator achieves an exceptional water evaporation rate of 2.88&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation while demonstrating outstanding performance in both seawater and heavy metal&#8208;containing wastewater systems. Moreover, the evaporator exhibits no significant decline in evaporation rate during continuous wastewater treatment over 7 days, highlighting its exceptional durability and long&#8208;term stability. Finally, techno&#8208;economic analysis estimates the production cost of clean water by the evaporator at 0.372&#160;$&#160;m&#8722;3, below the industry average and even approaching the globally reported lowest threshold for reverse osmosis desalination. This work is believed to offer valuable insights into achieving cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient solar&#8208;driven wastewater purification technologies from lignin.

         <title>Bioinspired Polyimide/Carbon Nanotube Aerogels With Core&#8208;Radiating and Omasum&#8208;Like Morphology toward Excellent Electromagnetic Shielding and Superior Elasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A morphogenetic approach is established to precisely coordinate the precursor thermodynamics by tuning the carbon nanotube (CNT) content and precursor concentration in the framework of the freeze&#8208;drying method. Consequently, polyimide/CNT aerogels with unprecedented triaxial hierarchical architectures (macroscopic core&#8208;radiating patterns, microscopic omasum&#8208;like folds, and nanoscopic CNT bridges) are obtained.








Abstract
Lightweight polymer&#8208;based electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials exhibiting good mechanical adaptability and thermal stability are pivotal for next&#8208;generation electronics. However, conventional approaches utilized to enhance the EMI shielding efficiency (SE) through porous architectures often compromise the structural integrity of the material or its EMI shielding performance under dynamic deformation. Herein, a morphogenetic approach is proposed to precisely coordinate the precursor thermodynamics by tuning the carbon nanotube (CNT) content and precursor concentration in the framework of the freeze&#8208;drying method. With this method, polyimide/CNT aerogels with unprecedented triaxial hierarchical architectures (macroscopic core&#8208;radiating patterns, microscopic omasum&#8208;like folds, and nanoscopic CNT bridges) are obtained. The synergy between these multiscale structures extends the dissipation pathways of electromagnetic waves by inducing multiple reflections, yielding an EMI SE of 71&#160;dB and an ultrahigh specific efficiency (6470&#160;dB cm2 g&#8722;1). Remarkably, the C67&#8208;5.0 aerogels also exhibit enhanced EMI shielding performance with temperature (5.0% improvement at 350&#160;&#176;C), a negative Poisson's ratio (around &#8722;0.28), and structural stability (&#8776;90% height retention after 500 compression cycles). This unique combination of a high EMI SE, outstanding mechanical properties, and excellent structural compressibility opens new avenues for designing adaptive EMI shielding systems for application to aerospace and electronics industries.

         <title>Optimizing the Electron Density of PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;Based Solid Polymer Electrolyte by Donor&#8211;Acceptor COF Toward High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Br&#8208;COF with D&#8208;A characteristic is incorporated into PVDF&#8208;HFP, which can optimize electron density to create electron&#8208;rich environments, further promoting Li+ migration and LiF&#8208;rich SEI formation. The D and A units of Br&#8208;COF are confined in particular locations to create independent electron&#8208;hole transference channels, achieving rapid electron transfer dynamics to optimize electron density around TFSI&#8722; to promote its decomposition for the formation of high LiF content SEI. Furthermore, the Br&#8208;groups as electron&#8208;rich sites can promote Li salt dissociation through electrostatic interaction, resulting in rapid Li+ transference.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries equipped with solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices due to their excellent safety and good interfacial contact. However, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and sluggish Li+ transport kinetics inhibit their practical application. Herein, a bromine&#8208;modified covalent organic framework (Br&#8208;COF) with donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) characteristics is designed and incorporated into PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;based SPEs to regulate electron density for promoting Li+ migration and high stability LiF&#8208;rich SEI formation to solve these problems. The D and A units of Br&#8208;COF are confined in particular locations to create independent electron&#8208;hole transference channels, achieving rapid electron transfer dynamics, thereby promoting TFSI&#8722; decomposition to obtain high LiF content SEI. Meanwhile, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing Br&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from tetra(p&#8208;amino&#8208;phenyl)porphyrin (TAPP) to create an electron&#8208;rich environment, resulting in the regulation of the Li+ local coordination environment to facilitate Li+ transference. Consequently, Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP exhibits high ionic conductivity (9.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.78). Li|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li cells achieve excellent cycling life (3000 h) at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2, and LFP|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li and NCM90|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li cells can cycle steadily over 2000 cycles and 250 cycles, respectively. This study provides a reference basis for regulating the electron density of PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;based SPEs to enhance the performance of solid&#8208;state LMBs.

     alt="Optimizing the Electron Density of PVDF-HFP-Based Solid Polymer Electrolyte by Donor&#8211;Acceptor COF Toward High-Performance Solid-State Lithium Metal Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Br-COF with D-A characteristic is incorporated into PVDF-HFP, which can optimize electron density to create electron-rich environments, further promoting Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration and LiF-rich SEI formation. The D and A units of Br-COF are confined in particular locations to create independent electron-hole transference channels, achieving rapid electron transfer dynamics to optimize electron density around TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to promote its decomposition for the formation of high LiF content SEI. Furthermore, the Br-groups as electron-rich sites can promote Li salt dissociation through electrostatic interaction, resulting in rapid Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state lithium metal batteries equipped with solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices due to their excellent safety and good interfacial contact. However, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and sluggish Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport kinetics inhibit their practical application. Herein, a bromine-modified covalent organic framework (Br-COF) with donor (D)-acceptor (A) characteristics is designed and incorporated into PVDF-HFP-based SPEs to regulate electron density for promoting Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration and high stability LiF-rich SEI formation to solve these problems. The D and A units of Br-COF are confined in particular locations to create independent electron-hole transference channels, achieving rapid electron transfer dynamics, thereby promoting TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; decomposition to obtain high LiF content SEI. Meanwhile, the strong electron-withdrawing Br-group can adsorb the electron from tetra(p-amino-phenyl)porphyrin (TAPP) to create an electron-rich environment, resulting in the regulation of the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; local coordination environment to facilitate Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference. Consequently, Br-COF@PVDF-HFP exhibits high ionic conductivity (9.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number (0.78). Li|Br-COF@PVDF-HFP|Li cells achieve excellent cycling life (3000 h) at 0.1 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and LFP|Br-COF@PVDF-HFP|Li and NCM90|Br-COF@PVDF-HFP|Li cells can cycle steadily over 2000 cycles and 250 cycles, respectively. This study provides a reference basis for regulating the electron density of PVDF-HFP-based SPEs to enhance the performance of solid-state LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
