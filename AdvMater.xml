         <title>Photo&#8208;Controllable Elongation Actuation of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Films with Well&#8208;Defined Crease Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Although liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have demonstrated various applications in artificial muscles and soft robotics, their inherent flexibility and orientation&#8208;dependent forces limit their functions. For instance, LCEs can sustain a high actuation force when they contract but cannot elongate to drive loads with large displacements. In this study, we demonstrate that photo&#8208;controllable elongation actuation with a large strain can be achieved in polydomain LCEs by programming the crease structures in a well&#8208;defined order to couple the actuation forces generated in the creases. Efficient photo&#8208;actuation without overheating&#8208;induced damage to the materials is favored, based on the well&#8208;designed photosensitive molecular switch crosslinker via the synergy of photochemical and photothermal effects. The LCE actuator can jack up heavy loads, elongate freely, and contract back to manipulate distant objects. Theoretical analysis based on a finite element simulation of the deformation energy during the actuation process reveals a trade&#8208;off between the abilities of jacking&#8208;up and withstanding load. More importantly, this study simplifies the design of a single material with functions inherent only in other soft robotic devices based on the assembly of individual modules, thus providing a design strategy for surpassing instinctive properties of conventional soft materials to expand and enhance the functions of soft robotics.

         <title>Copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin Nanosheet as A Specific Pyroptosis Inducer for Robust Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pyroptosis has been increasingly considered as a new weathervane in cancer immune therapy. However, triggering specific pyroptotic tumor cell death while preserving normal cells still remains a major challenge. Herein, for the first time, we&#160;designed a bran&#8208;new pyroptosis inducer, copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin nanosheet (Cu&#8208;TBB). The synthesized Cu&#8208;TBB could&#160;be activated to an &#8220;on&#8221; state in tumor microenvironment with glutathione (GSH) overexpression, leading to the release of Cu+ and TBB, respectively. Intriguingly, the released Cu+ could&#160;drive cascade reactions to produce O2&#8722;&#8226; and highly toxic &#183;OH in cells. Additionally, the released TBB could&#160;also generate O2&#8722;&#8226; and 1O2 upon 750&#160;nm laser irradiation. Encouragingly, the both Cu+&#8208;driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy pathways resulted in potent pyroptosis along with dendritic cell maturation and T cell priming, thus simultaneously eliminating the primary tumors and inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases. Conclusively, the well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;TBB nanosheet has been shown to trigger specifical pyroptosis in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo, leading to enhanced tumor immunogenicity and antitumor efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects.

         <title>Linker Engineering of Sandwich&#8208;Structured Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Composites for Optimized Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While the microenvironment around catalytic sites is recognized to be crucial in thermocatalysis, its roles in photocatalysis remain subtle. Herein, a series of sandwich&#8208;structured metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) composites, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X means functional groups), have been rationally constructed for visible&#8208;light photocatalytic H2 production. By varying &#8208;X groups of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X shell, the microenvironment of Pt sites and photosensitive UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 core can be simultaneously modulated. Significantly, the MOF composites with identical light absorption and Pt loading present distinctly different photocatalytic H2 production rates, following &#8208;X group sequence of &#8208;H &gt; &#8208;Br &gt; &#8208;NA (naphthalene) &gt; &#8208;OCH3 &gt; &#8208;Cl &gt; &#8208;NO2. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H demonstrates H2 production rate up to 2708.2&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, &#8764;222 times that of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2. Mechanism investigations suggest that the variation of &#8208;X group can balance the charge separation of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 core and proton reduction ability of Pt, leading to the optimal activity of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H at the equilibrium point.

         <title>Exciton&#8208;Scissoring Perfluoroarenes Trigger Photomultiplication in Full Color Organic Image Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report an unprecedented but useful functionality of perfluoroarenes to enable exciton scissoring in photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiodes (PM&#8208;OPDs). Perfluoroarenes that are covalently connected to polymer donors via photochemical reaction enable us to demonstrate high external quantum efficiency and B&#8208;/G&#8208;/R&#8208;selective PM&#8208;OPDs without the use of conventional acceptor molecules. We investigated the operation mechanism of the suggested perfluoroarene&#8208;driven PM&#8208;OPDs, &#8220;How can covalently bonded polymer donor:perfluoroarene PM&#8208;OPDs perform as effectively as polymer donor:fullerene blend&#8208;based PM&#8208;OPDs?&#8221;. By employing a series of arenes and conducting steady&#8208;state/time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy analyses, we find that interfacial band bending between the perfluoroaryl group and polymer donor is responsible for exciton scissoring and subsequent electron trapping, which induces photomultiplication. Owing to the acceptor&#8208;free and covalently interconnected photoactive layer in the suggested PM&#8208;OPDs, superior operational and thermal stabilities were observed. Finally, we demonstrated finely patterned B&#8208;/G&#8208;/R&#8208;selective PM&#8208;OPD arrays that enable the construction of highly sensitive passive matrix&#8208;type organic image sensors.

         <title>A Monolayer High&#8208;Entropy Layered Hydroxide Frame for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolayer high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxide (HELH) frame is prepared by in situ conversion from Zn,Co&#8208;ZIF under a mild environment. The HELH with tailored geometric structure provides a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. It also provides a new insight into the field of fine regulation of high&#8208;entropy material structure.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials with tailored geometric and elemental compositions provide a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are the most efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. However, due to the huge difference in ionic solubility product, an extremely strong alkali environment is necessary to prepare high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxides (HELHs), which results in an uncontrollable structure, poor stability, and scarce active sites. Here, a universal synthesis of monolayer HELH frame in a mild environment is presented, regardless of the solubility product limit. Mild reaction conditions allow this study to precisely control the fine structure and elemental composition of the final product. Consequently, the surface area of the HELHs is up to 380.5&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1. The current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved in 1&#160;m KOH at an overpotential of 259&#160;mV, and, after 1000&#160;h operation at the current density of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, the catalytic performance shows no obvious deterioration. The high&#8208;entropy engineering and fine nanostructure control open opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, very few active sites, instability, and low conductance during OER for LDH catalysts.

Mild reaction conditions allow this study to precisely control the fine structure and elemental composition of the final product. Consequently, the surface area of the HELHs is up to 380.5&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH at an overpotential of 259&#160;mV, and, after 1000&#160;h operation at the current density of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the catalytic performance shows no obvious deterioration. The high-entropy engineering and fine nanostructure control open opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, very few active sites, instability, and low conductance during OER for LDH catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Neonatal&#8208;Tissue&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicle Therapy (NEXT): A Potent Strategy for Precision Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large amounts of extracellular vesicles (EVs) can be produced from desired tissues with high yield/purity and low time/cost. Tissue&#8208;derived EVs exert tissue repair effects in an age&#8208; and donor tissue type specific manner, and neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EVs have favorable repair potential in diverse forms of tissue injury. Neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EV therapy (NEXT) may provide a new avenue for precision tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;based therapies have emerged as a promising means in regenerative medicine. However, the conventional EV therapy strategy displays some limitations, such as inefficient EV production and lack of tissue&#8208;specific repair effects. Here, it is reported that neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EV therapy (NEXT) is a potent strategy for precision tissue repair. In brief, large amounts of EVs with higher yield/purity can be readily isolated from desired tissues with less production time/cost compared to the conventional cell&#8208;culture&#8208;based method. Moreover, source factors, such as age and tissue type, can affect the repair efficacy of such tissue&#8208;derived EVs in different tissue injury models (skin wounds and acute kidney injury), and neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EVs show superior tissue repair potency compared with adult&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EVs. Different age&#8208; or tissue&#8208;type&#8208;derived EVs have distinct composition (e.g., protein) signatures that are likely due to the diverse metabolic patterns of the donor tissues, which may contribute to the specific repair action modes of NEXT in different types of tissue injury. Furthermore, neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EVs can be incorporated with bioactive materials for advanced tissue repair. This study highlights that the NEXT strategy may provide a new avenue for precision tissue repair in many types of tissue injury.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Based Robotics Approach for Targeting Fungal Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microrobotic platform is developed using iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based nanozymes to achieve precise spatial targeting and localized catalysis for rapid fungal killing. These nanozyme&#8208;microrobots demonstrate programmable motions, controllable catalysis, and selective binding to fungi. Using tissue infection models, localized delivery of nanozymes and targeted fungal eradication is shown, providing a unique antifungal modality for pathogen killing at the infection site.








Abstract
Fungal pathogens have been designated by the World Health Organization as microbial threats of the highest priority for global health. It remains a major challenge to improve antifungal efficacy at the site of infection while avoiding off&#8208;target effects, fungal spreading, and drug tolerance. Here, a nanozyme&#8208;based microrobotic platform is developed that directs localized catalysis to the infection site with microscale precision to achieve targeted and rapid fungal killing. Using electromagnetic field frequency modulation and fine&#8208;scale spatiotemporal control, structured iron oxide nanozyme assemblies are formed that display tunable dynamic shape transformation and catalysis activation. The catalytic activity varies depending on the motion, velocity, and shape providing controllable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Unexpectedly, nanozyme assemblies bind avidly to fungal (Candida albicans) surfaces to enable concentrated accumulation and targeted ROS&#8208;mediated killing in situ. By exploiting these tunable properties and selective binding to fungi, localized antifungal activity is achieved using in vivo&#8208;like cell spheroid and animal tissue infection models. Structured nanozyme assemblies are directed to Candida&#8208;infected sites using programmable algorithms to perform precisely guided spatial targeting and on&#8208;site catalysis resulting in fungal eradication within 10 min. This nanozyme&#8208;based microrobotics approach provides a uniquely effective and targeted therapeutic modality for pathogen elimination at the infection site.

         <title>Cancer Models on Chip: Paving the Way to Large&#8208;Scale Trial Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ToC devices may become state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art models for pharmaceutical oncology trials. To achieve this, the ToC should present reliability in mimicking the TME and monitoring biophysical and chemical signals using sensors and actuators. The translation of this technology to the industrial scale must take into consideration scalability and the standardization of the materials/biomaterials, architectures, actuators, and integration with analytical tools.








Abstract
Cancer kills millions of individuals every year all over the world (Global Cancer Observatory). The physiological and biomechanical processes underlying the tumor are still poorly understood, hindering researchers from creating new, effective therapies. Inconsistent results of preclinical research, in vivo testing, and clinical trials decrease drug approval rates. 3D tumor&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (ToC) models integrate biomaterials, tissue engineering, fabrication of microarchitectures, and sensory and actuation systems in a single device, enabling reliable studies in fundamental oncology and pharmacology. This review includes a critical discussion about their ability to reproduce the tumor microenvironment (TME), the advantages and drawbacks of existing tumor models and architectures, major components and fabrication techniques. The focus is on current materials and micro/nanofabrication techniques used to manufacture reliable and reproducible microfluidic ToC models for large&#8208;scale trial applications.

         <title>Oxidized Activated Charcoal Nanozymes: Synthesis, and Optimization for In Vitro and In Vivo Bioactivity for Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes synthesized via the oxidation of coconut&#8208;derived activated charcoal afford markable protection against oxidative injury in an in vivo rat model of mild traumatic brain injury. By tuning the oxidation process, smaller, more homogeneous nanomaterials containing free&#8208;radical&#8208;quenching quinone active sites are targeted for enhanced bioactivity. Such findings highlight the features that drive the oxidative power of these nanozymes.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic nanozymes have recently been employed as promising antioxidant nanotherapeutics due to their distinct properties. The structural features responsible for the efficacy of these nanomaterials as antioxidants are, however, poorly understood. Here, the process&#8211;structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance properties of coconut&#8208;derived oxidized activated charcoal (cOAC) nano&#8208;SOD mimetics are studied by analyzing how modifications to the nanomaterial's synthesis impact the size, as well as the elemental and electrochemical properties of the particles. These properties are then correlated to the in vitro antioxidant bioactivity of poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;functionalized cOACs (PEG&#8208;cOAC). Chemical oxidative treatment methods that afford smaller, more homogeneous cOAC nanoparticles with higher levels of quinone functionalization show enhanced protection against oxidative damage in bEnd.3 murine endothelioma cells. In an in vivo rat model of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and oxidative vascular injury, PEG&#8208;cOACs restore cerebral perfusion rapidly to the same extent as the former nanotube&#8208;derived PEG&#8208;hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG&#8208;HCCs) with a single intravenous injection. These findings provide a deeper understanding of how carbon nanozyme syntheses can be tailored for improved antioxidant bioactivity, and set the stage for translation of medical applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Metastable Hidden Skyrmion Phase in the Mott Insulator Cu2OSeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored laser pulses are found to drive the multiferroic insulating material Cu2OSeO3 into a metastable hidden phase hosting magnetic skyrmions. Such a phase cannot be accessed otherwise, via adiabatic protocols sweeping temperature or magnetic fields. These results highlight the potential of non&#8208;adiabatic stimuli to control magnetism by directly modifying the free energy landscape at ultrafast timescales.








Abstract
The discovery of a novel long&#8208;lived metastable skyrmion phase in the multiferroic insulator Cu2OSeO3 visualized with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy for magnetic fields below the equilibrium skyrmion pocket is reported. This phase can be accessed by exciting the sample non&#8208;adiabatically with near&#8208;infrared femtosecond laser pulses and cannot be reached by any conventional field&#8208;cooling protocol, referred as a hidden phase. From the strong wavelength dependence of the photocreation process and via spin&#8208;dynamics simulations, the magnetoelastic effect is identified as the most likely photocreation mechanism. This effect results in a transient modification of the magnetic free energy landscape extending the equilibrium skyrmion pocket to lower magnetic fields. The evolution of the photoinduced phase is monitored for over 15 min and no decay is found. Because such a time is much longer than the duration of any transient effect induced by a laser pulse in a material, it is assumed that the newly discovered skyrmion state is stable for practical purposes, thus breaking ground for a novel approach to control magnetic state on demand at ultrafast timescales and drastically reducing heat dissipation relevant for next&#8208;generation spintronic&#160;devices.

Such a phase cannot be accessed otherwise, via adiabatic protocols sweeping temperature or magnetic fields. These results highlight the potential of non-adiabatic stimuli to control magnetism by directly modifying the free energy landscape at ultrafast timescales.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of a novel long-lived metastable skyrmion phase in the multiferroic insulator Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OSeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; visualized with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy for magnetic fields below the equilibrium skyrmion pocket is reported. This phase can be accessed by exciting the sample non-adiabatically with near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses and cannot be reached by any conventional field-cooling protocol, referred as a hidden phase. From the strong wavelength dependence of the photocreation process and via spin-dynamics simulations, the magnetoelastic effect is identified as the most likely photocreation mechanism. This effect results in a transient modification of the magnetic free energy landscape extending the equilibrium skyrmion pocket to lower magnetic fields. The evolution of the photoinduced phase is monitored for over 15 min and no decay is found. Because such a time is much longer than the duration of any transient effect induced by a laser pulse in a material, it is assumed that the newly discovered skyrmion state is stable for practical purposes, thus breaking ground for a novel approach to control magnetic state on demand at ultrafast timescales and drastically reducing heat dissipation relevant for next-generation spintronic&#160;devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fundamentals of Skin Bioimpedances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multilayer structure of skin and the electrically insulating nature of the stratum corneum, which is the outermost layer of skin, complicate the electrical characterization of skin. In this work,&#160;the theoretical framework and the design strategies for overcoming these long&#8208;standing issues are established. The results may advance bioimpedance for skin cancer diagnosis or for assessing type&#8208;2 diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular risk.








Abstract
The bioimpedances of tissues beyond the stratum corneum, which is the outermost layer of skin, contain crucial clinical information. Nevertheless, bioimpedance measurements of both the viable skin and the adipose tissue are not widely used, mainly because of the complex multilayered skin structure and the electrically insulating nature of the stratum corneum. Here, a theoretical framework is established for analyzing the impedances of multilayered tissues and, in particular, of skin. Then, strategies are determined for the system&#8208;level design of electrodes and electronics, which minimize 4&#8208;wire (or tetrapolar) measurement errors even in the presence of a top insulating tissue, thus enabling non&#8208;invasive characterizations of tissues beyond the stratum corneum. As an example, non&#8208;invasive measurements of bioimpedances of living tissues are demonstrated in the presence of parasitic impedances which are much (e.g., up to 350 times) higher than the bioimpedances of the living tissues beyond the stratum corneum, independently on extreme variations of the barrier (tape stripping) or of the skin&#8211;electrode contact impedances (sweat). The results can advance the development of bioimpedance systems for the characterization of viable skin and adipose tissues in several applications, including transdermal drug delivery and the assessment of skin cancer, obesity, dehydration, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk, and multipotent adult stem cells.

         <title>Plasmonic Coupling on an Optical Microfiber Surface: Enabling Single&#8208;Molecule and Noninvasive Dopamine Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical microfiber biosensor for dopamine (DA) detection based on the DA&#8208;binding&#8208;induced aptamer conformational transitions that occur at plasmonic coupling sites on a double&#8208;amplified nanointerface is demonstrated. The sensor exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity when detecting DA molecules at the single&#8208;molecule level. It provides an approach for overcoming optical device sensitivity limits, extending optical fiber single&#8208;molecule detection to a small molecule range.








Abstract
Optical fibers can be effective biosensors when employed in early&#8208;stage diagnostic point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices as they can avoid interference from molecules with similar redox potentials. Nevertheless, their sensitivity needs to be improved for real&#8208;world applications, especially for small&#8208;molecule detection. This work demonstrates an optical microfiber biosensor for dopamine (DA) detection based on the DA&#8208;binding&#8208;induced aptamer conformational transitions that occur at plasmonic coupling sites on a double&#8208;amplified nanointerface. The sensor exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity when detecting DA molecules at the single&#8208;molecule level; additionally, this work provides an approach for overcoming optical device sensitivity limits, further extending optical fiber single&#8208;molecule detection to a small molecule range (e.g., DA and metal ions). The selective energy enhancement and signal amplification at the binding sites effectively avoid nonspecific amplification of the whole fiber surface which may lead to false&#8208;positive results. The sensor can detect single&#8208;molecule DA signals in body&#8208;fluids. It can detect the released extracellular DA levels and monitor the DA oxidation process. An appropriate aptamer replacement allows the sensor to be used for the detection of other target small molecules and ions at the single&#8208;molecule level. This technology offers alternative opportunities for developing noninvasive early&#8208;stage diagnostic point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices and flexible single&#8208;molecule detection techniques in theoretical research.

         <title>Mechanochemical Degradation of Poly(vinyl chloride) into Nontoxic Water&#8208;Soluble Products via Sequential Dechlorination, Heterolytic Oxirane Ring&#8208;Opening, and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical degradation of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) into water&#8208;soluble biocompatible products is demonstrated. The solid&#8208;state mechanochemical dechlorination followed by epoxidation offers a more environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional solution&#8208;based reaction. This work exploits the force&#8208;induced heterolytic oxirane ring&#8208;opening which aids PVC degradation into smaller fragments upon hydrolysis.








Abstract
As one of the most widely used commodity plastics, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is extensively used worldwide, yet is difficult to recycle and is often discarded immediately after use. Its end&#8208;of&#8208;life treatment often generates toxic hydrogen chloride and dioxins that pose a critical threat to ecosystems. To address this challenge, the mechanochemical degradation of PVC into water&#8208;soluble biocompatible products is presented herein. Oxirane mechanophores are strategically introduced into the polymeric backbone via sequential dechlorination followed by epoxidation. The oxirane mechanophore in the polymer backbone undergoes a force&#8208;induced heterolytic ring&#8208;opening to carbonyl ylide intermediates, which eventually generates acetals during the course of the reaction. The subsequent hydrolysis of the backbone acetals affords the scission of the polymeric chain into water&#8208;soluble low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fragments. Combined with its low cytotoxicity and phytotoxicity, this solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical degradation process offers a green alternative for the degradation of PVC.

         <title>Does Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolyte Subdue Issues of Zn Batteries?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to wide electrochemical stability window, water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes (WISEs) are attracting considerable interest. WISEs display distinctive physical and electrochemical properties compared to conventional electrolyte that makes them a promising electrolyte to be used in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZnBs). This review provides overview about issues in ZnBs, a historical, basic, thermodynamic, and kinetic overview about WISEs and finally discusses their use in ZnBs.









Abstract
Zn&#8208;metal batteries (ZnBs) are safe and sustainable because of their operability in aqueous electrolytes, abundance of Zn, and recyclability. However, the thermodynamic instability of Zn metal in aqueous electrolytes is a major bottleneck for its commercialization. As such, Zn deposition (Zn2+ &#8594; Zn(s)) is continuously accompanied by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (2H+ &#8594; H2) and dendritic growth that further accentuate the HER. Consequently, the local pH around the Zn electrode increases and promotes the formation of inactive and/or poorly conductive Zn passivation species (Zn + 2H2O &#8594; Zn(OH)2 + H2) on the Zn. This aggravates the consumption of Zn and electrolyte and degrades the performance of ZnB. To propel HER beyond its thermodynamic potential (0&#160;V vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at pH 0), the concept of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8208;electrolyte (WISE) has been employed in ZnBs. Since the publication of the first article on WISE for ZnB in 2016, this research area has progressed continuously. Here, an overview and discussion on this promising research direction for accelerating the maturity of ZnBs is provided. The review briefly describes the current issues with conventional aqueous electrolyte in ZnBs, including a historic overview and basic understanding of WISE. Furthermore, the application scenarios of WISE in ZnBs are detailed, with the description of various key mechanisms (e.g., side reactions, Zn electrodeposition, anions or cations intercalation in metal oxide or graphite, and ion transport at low temperature).

         <title>Tunable Donor Aggregation Dominance in Ternary Matrix of All&#8208;polymer Blends with Improved Efficiency And Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Using two structurally similar polymer acceptors in constructing high&#8208;efficiency ternary all&#8208;polymer solar cells is a widely acknowledged strategy. However, the focus thus far has not been on how polymer acceptor(s) tune the aggregation of polymer donors, thus furthering film morphology and device performance (efficiency and stability). Herein, w e report that matching the celebrity acceptor PY&#8208;IT and donor PBQx&#8208;TCl results in enhanced H&#8208;aggregation in PBQx&#8208;TCl, which can be finely tuned by controlling the amount of the second acceptor PY&#8208;IV. Consequently, the efficiency&#8208;optimized PY&#8208;IV weight ratio (0.2/1.2) leads to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power conversion efficiency of 18.81%, wherein light&#8208;illuminated operational stability is also enhanced along with well&#8208;protected thermal stability. Such enhancements in the efficiency and operational and thermal stabilities of solar cells can be attributed to morphology optimization and desired glass transition temperature of the target active layer based on comprehensive characterization. In addition to being a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency case for all&#8208;polymer solar cells, these enhancements are also a successful attempt for using combined acceptors to tune donor aggregation toward optimal morphology, which provides a theoretical basis for the construction of other types of organic photovoltaics beyond all&#8208;polymer solar cells.

         <title>Liquid Metal Combinatorics Toward Materials Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid metals and their derivatives provide several opportunities for fundamental and practical exploration worldwide. However, the increasing number of studies and shortage of desirable materials to fulfill different needs also pose serious challenges. Herein, to address this issue, we systematically presented a generalized theoretical frame that was termed as &#8220;Liquid Metal Combinatorics&#8221; (LMC), and summarized promising candidate technical routes toward new generation material discovery. The major categories of LMC were defined, and eight representative methods for manufacturing advanced materials were outlined. It has been illustrated that abundant targeted materials can be efficiently designed and fabricated via LMC through deep physical combinations, chemical reactions, or both among the main bodies of liquid metals, surface chemicals, precipitated ions, and other materials. This represents a large class of powerful, reliable, and modular methods for innovating general materials. The achieved combinatorial materials not only maintained the typical characteristics of liquid metals but also displayed distinct tenability. Furthermore, the fabrication strategies, wide extensibility, and pivotal applications of LMC are classified. Finally, by interpreting the developmental trends in the area, a perspective on the LMC was provided, which warrants its promising future for society.

         <title>Engineering and Characterization of an Artificial Drug&#8208;carrying Vesicles Nanoplatform for Enhanced Specifically Targeted Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment is hindered by complex pathologies and the need to cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) during drug delivery. Although exosomes have great potential for GBM treatment, these alone cannot fully meet the therapeutic requirements, owing to their limitations in targeting and delivery. Herein, we developed an engineered artificial vesicles (EAVs), ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs, which was constructed using a liposome extruder from HEK293T cells expressing ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 peptides. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 is a fusion peptide of Angiopep&#8208;2 fused to the N&#8208;terminus of TRP&#8208;PK1, to present Angiopep&#8208;2 on the EAVs. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs had similar characteristics to the secreted exosomes, but a much higher yield. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs had efficient BBB&#8208;penetration and GBM&#8208;targeting abilities in a mock BBB model in vitro and orthotopic GBM mouse models in vivo. Doxorubicin loading EAVs (ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@DOX) did not alter the characteristics of the EAVs, which could cross the BBB, reach the GBM, and kill tumor cells in orthotopic GBM mouse models. Our engineered drug&#8208;loaded artificial vesicles showed better therapeutic effects on GBM than temozolomide in mice, with very few side effects. In conclusion, EAVs can be inserted different targeting ligands and packed different drug, which may serve as a unique and efficient nanoplatform for drug delivery and the tumor promise therapy.

         <title>Reconstructed Hierarchically&#8208;Structured Keratin Fibers with Shape&#8208;Memory Features Based on Reversible Secondary Structure Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biocompatible and biodegradable shape&#8208;memory polymers have gained popularity as smart materials, offering a wide range of applications and environmental benefits. Herein, we investigate the possibility of fabricating regenerated water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers from wool and cellulose in a more effective and environmentally friendly manner. The regenerated keratin fibers exhibit comparable shape&#8208;memory performance to other hydration&#8208;responsive materials, with a shape fixity ratio of 94.8 &#177; 2.15% and a shape recovery rate of 81.4 &#177; 3.84%. Owing to their well&#8208;preserved secondary structure and crosslinking network, keratin fibers exhibit outstanding water&#8208;stability and wet stretchability, with a maximum tensile strain of 362 &#177; 15.9%. In this system, we investigate the reconfiguration of the protein secondary structure between &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheet as the fundamental actuation mechanism in response to hydration. This responsiveness is studied under force loading and unloading along the fiber axis. Hydrogen bonds act as the &#8220;switches&#8221; clicked by water molecules to trigger the shape&#8208;memory effect, while disulfide bonds and cellulose nanocrystals play the role of &#8220;net&#8208;points&#8221; to maintain the permanent shape of the material. Water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers are manipulable and exhibit potential in the fabrication of textile actuators, which may be applied in smart apparel and programmable biomedical devices.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Hollow&#8208;structured Mesoporous Carbons by Enhanced Surface Interaction for High&#8208;performance Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Nanoporous carbons are very attractive for various applications including energy storage. Templating methods with assembled amphiphilic molecules or porous inorganic templates are typically used for the synthesis. Amongst the different members of this family, CMK&#8208;5&#8208;like structures that are constructed to consist of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm amorphous carbon nanotubes and ultrahigh specific surface area due to their thin pore walls, have the best properties in various respects. However, the fabrication of such hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons entails elaborately tailoring the surface properties of template pore walls and selecting specific carbon precursors. Thus, very limited cases are successful. Herein, we&#160;report a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method to create hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons and heteroatom&#8208;doped derivatives with numerous organic molecules (e.g., furfuryl alcohol, resol, 2&#8208;thiophene methanol, dopamine, tyrosine) and different structural templates. These carbon materials exhibit ultrahigh surface area (2400 m2 g&#8211;1), large pore volume (4.0 cm3 g&#8211;1), as well as satisfactory lithium&#8208;storage capacity (1460 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.1 A g&#8211;1), excellent rate capability (320 mAh g&#8211;1 at 5 A g&#8211;1), and very outstanding cycling performance (2000 cycles at 5 A g&#8211;1).

Amongst the different members of this family, CMK-5-like structures that are constructed to consist of sub-10&#160;nm amorphous carbon nanotubes and ultrahigh specific surface area due to their thin pore walls, have the best properties in various respects.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Loading Manganese&#8208;Based Electrodes for Aqueous Batteries via Polymorph Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical performance of MnO2 differs with its polymorph states. By tuning the temperature, the deposited phase can be manipulated from &#603;&#8208;MnO2 to &#947;&#8208;MnO2 with &#8776;200&#8208;fold enhancement in conductivity for both MnO2&#8211;H2 and MnO2&#8211;Zn aqueous batteries. Such polymorph tuning technologies have validated the application potential for ultrahigh normalized areal loading electrodes and good cyclability at high areal capacities.








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based aqueous batteries utilizing Mn2+/MnO2 redox reactions are promising choices for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high theoretical specific capacity, high power capability, low&#8208;cost, and intrinsic safety with water&#8208;based electrolytes. However, the application of such systems is hindered by the insulating nature of deposited MnO2, resulting in low normalized areal loading (0.005&#8211;0.05&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) during the charge/discharge cycle. In this work, the electrochemical performance of various MnO2 polymorphs in Mn2+/MnO2 redox reactions is investigated, and &#603;&#8208;MnO2 with low conductivity is determined to be the primary electrochemically deposited phase in normal acidic aqueous electrolyte. It is found that increasing the temperature can change the deposited phase from &#603;&#8208;MnO2 with low conductivity to &#947;&#8208;MnO2 with two order of magnitude increase in conductivity. It is demonstrated that the highly conductive &#947;&#8208;MnO2 can be effectively exploited for ultrahigh areal loading electrode, and a normalized areal loading of 33&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved. At a mild temperature of 50&#160;&#176;C, cells are cycled with an ultrahigh areal loading of 20&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 (1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than previous studies) for over 200 cycles with only 13% capacity loss.

&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical performance of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; differs with its polymorph states. By tuning the temperature, the deposited phase can be manipulated from &lt;i&gt;&#603;&lt;/i&gt;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with &#8776;200-fold enhancement in conductivity for both MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Zn aqueous batteries. Such polymorph tuning technologies have validated the application potential for ultrahigh normalized areal loading electrodes and good cyclability at high areal capacities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manganese-based aqueous batteries utilizing Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; redox reactions are promising choices for grid-scale energy storage due to their high theoretical specific capacity, high power capability, low-cost, and intrinsic safety with water-based electrolytes. However, the application of such systems is hindered by the insulating nature of deposited MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in low normalized areal loading (0.005&#8211;0.05&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) during the charge/discharge cycle. In this work, the electrochemical performance of various MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; polymorphs in Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; redox reactions is investigated, and &#603;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with low conductivity is determined to be the primary electrochemically deposited phase in normal acidic aqueous electrolyte. It is found that increasing the temperature can change the deposited phase from &#603;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with low conductivity to &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with two order of magnitude increase in conductivity. It is demonstrated that the highly conductive &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be effectively exploited for ultrahigh areal loading electrode, and a normalized areal loading of 33&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved. At a mild temperature of 50&#160;&#176;C, cells are cycled with an ultrahigh areal loading of 20&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than previous studies) for over 200 cycles with only 13% capacity loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Stalactite Nanopores for Biosensing and Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a nature&#8208;inspired method for stalactite nanopores growth using atomic layer deposition of hafnium dioxide at the orifice of templated silicon nitride apertures. These nanostructures feature reduced sensing regions of 2&#8208;dimensional material nanopores with the asymmetry of capillaries, offering ionic selectivity, stability, and scalability. This nanopore platform has the potential in nanofluidic research: biosensing, energy science, and filtration. 








Abstract
Nature provides a wide range of self&#8208;assembled structures from the nanoscale to the macroscale. Under the right thermodynamic conditions and with the appropriate material supply, structures like stalactites, icicles, and corals can grow. However, the natural growth process is time&#8208;consuming. This work demonstrates a fast, nature&#8208;inspired method for growing stalactite nanopores using heterogeneous atomic deposition of hafnium dioxide at the orifice of templated silicon nitride apertures. The stalactite nanostructures combine the benefits of reduced sensing region typically for 2&#8208;dimensional material nanopores with the asymmetric geometry of capillaries, resulting in ionic selectivity, stability, and scalability. The proposed growing method provides an adaptable nanopore platform for basic and applied nanofluidic research, including biosensing, energy science, and filtration technologies.

         <title>Greatly Enhanced Resonant Exciton&#8208;Trion Conversion in Electrically Modulated Atomically Thin WS2 at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excitonic resonance in atomically thin semiconductors has the potential to enable highly tunable and ultra&#8208;compact optical devices. However, insufficient light&#8208;matter interactions have hindered the observation of trionic phenomenon and the development of excitonic devices for dynamic applications. To overcome this limitation, an optical cavity is engaged, resulting in greatly enhanced exciton&#8208;trion conversion at room temperature and enabling both amplitude and phase tuning in monolayer tungsten disulfide.








Abstract
Excitonic resonance in atomically thin semiconductors offers a favorite platform to study 2D nanophotonics in both classical and quantum regimes and promises potentials for highly tunable and ultra&#8208;compact optical devices. The understanding of charge density dependent exciton&#8208;trion conversion is the key for revealing the underlaying physics of optical tunability. Nevertheless, the insufficient and inefficient light&#8208;matter interactions hinder the observation of trionic phenomenon and the development of excitonic devices for dynamic power&#8208;efficient electro&#8208;optical applications. Here, by engaging an optical cavity with atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), greatly enhanced exciton&#8208;trion conversion is demonstrated at room temperature (RT) and achieve electrical modulation of reflectivity of &#8776;40% at exciton and 7% at trion state, which correspondingly enables a broadband large phase tuning in monolayer tungsten disulfide. Besides the absorptive conversion, &#8776;100% photoluminescence conversion from excitons to trions is observed at RT, illustrating a clear physical mechanism of an efficient exciton&#8208;trion conversion for extraordinary optical performance. The results indicate that both excitons and trions can play significant roles in electrical modulation of the optical parameters of TMDCs at RT. The work shows the real possibility for realizing electrical tunable and multi&#8208;functional ultra&#8208;thin optical devices using 2D materials.

Efficient deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with EQEmax and CIEy coordinate of 15.3% and 0.073 with DIDOBNA&#8208;N and 16.2% and 0.049 with MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N illustrate the promise of the molecular design of these emitters.








Abstract
Two multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are presented and it is shown how further borylation of a deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter, DIDOBNA&#8208;N, both blueshifts and narrows the emission producing a new near&#8208;UV MR&#8208;TADF emitter, MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N, are shown. DIDOBNA&#8208;N emits bright blue light (&#934;PL = 444&#160;nm, FWHM = 64&#160;nm, &#934;PL = 81%, &#964;d = 23 ms, 1.5 wt% in TSPO1). The deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on this twisted MR&#8208;TADF compound shows a very high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 15.3% for a device with CIEy of 0.073. The fused planar MR&#8208;TADF emitter, MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N shows efficient and narrowband near&#8208;UV emission (&#955;PL = 402&#160;nm, FWHM = 19&#160;nm, &#934;PL = 74.7%, &#964;d = 133 ms, 1.5 wt% in TSPO1). The best OLED with MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N, doped in a co&#8208;host, shows the highest efficiency reported for a near&#8208;UV OLED at 16.2%. With a CIEy coordinate of 0.049, this device also shows the bluest EL reported for a MR&#8208;TADF OLED to date.

         <title>Materials for Cell Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;surface&#8208;associated materials (e.g., nanoparticles, microparticles, and polymeric coatings) can prevent cell damage or loss, control cell transport and biodistribution, mask cell&#8208;surface antigens, regulate cell phenotypes, and deliver therapeutic agents to target&#160;tissues.








Abstract
Cell therapies are emerging as a promising new therapeutic modality in medicine, generating effective treatments for previously incurable diseases. Clinical success of cell therapies has energized the field of cellular engineering, spurring further exploration of novel approaches to improve their therapeutic performance. Engineering of cell surfaces using natural and synthetic materials has emerged as a valuable tool in this endeavor. This review summarizes recent advances in the development of technologies for decorating cell surfaces with various materials including nanoparticles, microparticles, and polymeric coatings, focusing on the ways in which surface decorations enhance carrier cells and therapeutic effects. Key benefits of surface&#8208;modified cells include protecting the carrier cell, reducing particle clearance, enhancing cell trafficking, masking cell&#8208;surface antigens, modulating inflammatory phenotype of carrier cells, and delivering therapeutic agents to target tissues. While most of these technologies are still in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept stage, the promising therapeutic efficacy of these constructs from in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies has laid a strong foundation for eventual clinical translation. Cell surface engineering with materials can imbue a diverse range of advantages for cell therapy, creating opportunities for innovative functionalities, for improved therapeutic efficacy, and transforming the fundamental and translational landscape of cell therapies.

         <title>Multifunctional Filler&#8208;Free PEDOT:PSS Hydrogels with Ultrahigh Electrical Conductivity Induced by Lewis&#8208;Acid&#8208;Promoted Ion Exchange</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;halides&#8208;doped poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxy thiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hydrogels with an ultrahigh electrical conductivity up to 547 S&#160;cm&#8722;1 have been prepared that exhibited high performance in thermoelectrics, electromagnetic shielding, Joule heating, and sensing.








Abstract
Highly conductive hydrogels with biotissue&#8208;like mechanical properties are of great interest in the emerging field of hydrogel bioelectronics due to their good biocompatibility, deformability, and stability. Fully polymeric hydrogels may exhibit comparable Young's modulus to biotissues. However, most of these filler&#8208;free hydrogels have a low electrical conductivity of &lt;10 S&#160;cm&#8722;1, which limits their wide applications of them in digital circuits or bioelectronic devices. In this work, a series of metal&#8208;halides&#8208;doped poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hydrogels with an ultrahigh electrical conductivity up to 547 S&#160;cm&#8722;1 is reported, which is 1.5 times to 104 times higher than previously reported filler&#8208;free polymeric hydrogels. Theoretical calculation demonstrated that the ion exchange between PEDOT:PSS and the metal halides played an important role to promote phase separation in the hydrogels, which thus leads to ultrahigh electrical conductivity. The high electrical conductivity resulted in multifunctional hydrogels with high performance in thermoelectrics, electromagnetic shielding, Joule heating, and sensing. Such flexible and stretchable hydrogels with ultrahigh electrical conductivity and stability upon various deformations are promising for soft bioelectronics devices and wearable electronics.

         <title>Multifunctional Magnetic Oxide&#8208;MoS2 Heterostructures on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exotic functionalities of transition metal oxides are appealing to multifunctional devices if integrated with low&#8208;dimensional materials on Si&#8208;based platforms. In this study, heterostructures of MoS2 and magnetic Sr&#8208;doped LaMnO3 are achieved on Si using a freestanding form of Sr&#8208;doped LaMnO3. The multifunctionality of the heterostructures is demonstrated based on three applications, including field&#8208;effect transistors, photodiodes, and magnetoresponsive heterostructure devices.








Abstract
Correlated oxides and related heterostructures are intriguing for developing future multifunctional devices by exploiting their exotic properties, but their integration with other materials, especially on Si&#8208;based platforms, is challenging. Here, van der Waals heterostructures of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) , a correlated manganite perovskite, and MoS2 are demonstrated on Si substrates with multiple functions. To overcome the problems due to the incompatible growth process, technologies involving freestanding LSMO membranes and van der Waals force&#8208;mediated transfer are used to fabricate the LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures. The LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures exhibit a gate&#8208;tunable rectifying behavior, based on which metal&#8208;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (MESFETs) with on&#8208;off ratios of over 104 can be achieved. The LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures can function as photodiodes displaying considerable open&#8208;circuit voltages and photocurrents. In addition, the colossal magnetoresistance of LSMO endows the LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures with an electrically tunable magnetoresponse at room temperature. This work not only proves the applicability of the LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure devices on Si&#8208;based platform but also demonstrates a paradigm to create multifunctional heterostructures from materials with disparate properties.

         <title>Magnetization Control of Zero&#8208;Field Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which causes a superconducting state in one direction and a normal&#8208;conducting state in another, has significant potential for developing ultralow power consumption circuits and non&#8208;volatile memory. However, the practical control of the SDE necessities the precise tuning of current, temperature, magnetic field, or magnetism. Therefore, the mechanisms of the SDE must be understood to develop novel materials and devices capable of realizing the SDE under more controlled and robust conditions. This study demonstrates an intrinsic zero&#8208;field SDE with an efficiency of up to 40% in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices. The polarity and magnitude of the zero&#8208;field SDE are controllable by the direction of magnetization, indicating that the effective exchange field acts on Cooper pairs. Furthermore, the first&#8208;principles calculation indicates that the SDE can be enhanced by an asymmetric configuration of proximity induced magnetic moments in superconducting layers, which induces a magnetic toroidal moment. This study has important implications regarding the development of novel materials and devices that can effectively control the SDE. Moreover, the magnetization control of the SDE is expected to aid in the designing of superconducting quantum devices and establishing a material platform for topological superconductors.

         <title>Microporogen&#8208;Structured Collagen Matrices for Embedded Bioprinting of Tumor Models for Immuno&#8208;Oncology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microporous collagen matrix is developed for embedded printing of a 3D melanoma tumor model. This microporogen&#8208;structured matrix exhibits a fibrillar collagen type&#8208;I network akin to that observed in vivo. Printed tumor cells remain viable and proliferate, while antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells incorporated in the matrix migrate to the tumor site, where they induce cell death.








Abstract
Embedded bioprinting enables the rapid design and fabrication of complex tissues that recapitulate in vivo microenvironments. However, few biological matrices enable good print fidelity, while simultaneously facilitate cell viability, proliferation, and migration. Here, a new microporogen&#8208;structured (&#181;POROS) matrix for embedded bioprinting is introduced, in which matrix rheology, printing behavior, and porosity are tailored by adding sacrificial microparticles composed of a gelatin&#8211;chitosan complex to a prepolymer collagen solution. To demonstrate its utility, a 3D tumor model is created via embedded printing of a murine melanoma cell ink within the &#181;POROS collagen matrix at 4 &#176;C. The collagen matrix is subsequently crosslinked around the microparticles upon warming to 21&#160;&#176;C, followed by their melting and removal at 37&#160;&#176;C. This process results in a &#181;POROS matrix with a fibrillar collagen type&#8208;I network akin to that observed in vivo. Printed tumor cells remain viable and proliferate, while antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells incorporated in the matrix migrate to the tumor site, where they induce cell death. The integration of the &#181;POROS matrix with embedded bioprinting opens new avenues for creating complex tissue microenvironments in vitro that may find widespread use in drug discovery, disease modeling, and tissue engineering for therapeutic use.

         <title>PAF&#8208;6 Doped with Phosphoric Acid through Alkaline Nitrogen Atoms Boosting High&#8208;Temperature Proton&#8208;Exchange Membranes for High Performance of Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PAF&#8208;6&#160;with ordered porous structure and abundant alkaline sites&#160;are doped with phosphoric acid to obtain PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA. It is applied to the OPBI&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;exchange membrane toward superb mechanical properties and excellent proton conduction performance. The peak power density of the H2/O2 fuel cell at 200&#160;&#176;C reaches 437.7&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 with the catalyst Pt dosage only 0.3&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) can offer improved energy efficiency and tolerance to fuel/air impurities. The high expense of the high&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;exchange membranes (HT&#8208;PEMs) and their low durability at high temperature still impede their further practical applications. In this work, a phosphoric acid (PA)&#8208;doped porous aromatic framework&#160;(PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA) is incorporated into poly[2,2&#8242;&#8208;(p&#8208;oxydiphenylene)&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;benzimidazole] (OPBI) to fabricate novel PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA/OPBI composite HT&#8208;PEMs through solution&#8208;casting. The alkaline nitrogen structure in PAF&#8208;6 can be protonated with PA to provide proton hopping sites, and its porous structure can enhance the PA retention in the membranes, thus creating fast pathways for proton transfer. The hydrogen bond interaction between the rigid PAF&#8208;6 and OPBI can also enhance the mechanical properties and chemical stability of the composite membranes. Consequently, PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA/OPBI exhibits&#160;an optimal proton conductivity of 0.089 S cm&#8722;1 at 200&#160;&#176;C, and peak power density of 437.7&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 (Pt: 0.3 mg cm&#8722;2), which is significantly higher than that of the OPBI. &#160; The PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA/OPBI provides&#160;a novel strategy for the practical application of PBI&#8208;based HT&#8208;PEMs.

&lt;p&gt;PAF-6&#160;with ordered porous structure and abundant alkaline sites&#160;are doped with phosphoric acid to obtain PAF-6-PA. It is applied to the OPBI-based high-temperature proton-exchange membrane toward superb mechanical properties and excellent proton conduction performance. The peak power density of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fuel cell at 200&#160;&#176;C reaches 437.7&#160;mW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with the catalyst Pt dosage only 0.3&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-temperature proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs) can offer improved energy efficiency and tolerance to fuel/air impurities. The high expense of the high-temperature proton-exchange membranes (HT-PEMs) and their low durability at high temperature still impede their further practical applications. In this work, a phosphoric acid (PA)-doped porous aromatic framework&#160;(PAF-6-PA) &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; incorporated into poly[2,2&#8242;-(p-oxydiphenylene)-5,5&#8242;-benzimidazole] (OPBI) to fabricate novel PAF-6-PA/OPBI composite HT-PEMs through solution-casting. The alkaline nitrogen structure in PAF-6 can be protonated with PA to provide proton hopping sites, and its porous structure can enhance the PA retention in the membranes, thus creating fast pathways for proton transfer. The hydrogen bond interaction between the rigid PAF-6 and OPBI can also enhance the mechanical properties and chemical stability of the composite membranes. Consequently, PAF-6-PA/OPBI exhibits&#160;an optimal proton conductivity of 0.089 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 200&#160;&#176;C, and peak power density of 437.7&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (Pt: 0.3 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which is significantly higher than that of the OPBI. &#160; The PAF-6-PA/OPBI provides&#160;a novel strategy for the practical application of PBI-based HT-PEMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible and Stretchable Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Physiological Sensing Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are an emerging class of organic electronic building blocks exhibiting significant advantages for developing flexible/stretchable physiological sensors. This review discusses structure, operation, critical features, a wide spectrum of physiological sensing mechanisms and uses, as well as major challenges and opportunities for flexible/stretchable OECTs, particularly for biochemical and bioelectrical sensor applications.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable bioelectronics provides a biocompatible interface between electronics and biological systems and has received tremendous attention for in situ monitoring of various biological systems. Considerable progress in organic electronics has made organic semiconductors, as well as other organic electronic materials, ideal candidates for developing wearable, implantable, and biocompatible electronic circuits due to their potential mechanical compliance and biocompatibility. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as an emerging class of organic electronic building blocks, exhibit significant advantages in biological sensing due to the ionic nature at the basis of the switching behavior, low driving voltage (&lt;1 V), and high transconductance (in millisiemens range). During the past few years, significant progress in constructing flexible/stretchable OECTs (FSOECTs) for both biochemical and bioelectrical sensors has been reported. In this regard, to summarize major research accomplishments in this emerging field, this review first discusses structure and critical features of FSOECTs, including working principles, materials, and architectural engineering. Next, a wide spectrum of relevant physiological sensing applications, where FSOECTs are the key components, are summarized. Last, major challenges and opportunities for further advancing FSOECT physiological sensors are discussed.

         <title>Engineering Sub&#8208;Nanometer Hafnia&#8208;Based Ferroelectric to Break The Scaling Relation for High&#8208;Efficiency Piezocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Reversible control of ferroelectric polarization is essential to overcome the heterocatalytic kinetic limitation. This can be achieved by creating a surface with switchable electron density; however, owing to the rigidity of traditional ferroelectric oxides, achieving polarization reversal in piezocatalytic processes remains challenging. Herein, sub&#8208;nanometer sized Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) nanowires with a polymer&#8208;like flexibility have been synthesized. Oxygen K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and negative spherical aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscope (NCS&#8208;TEM) reveal an orthorhombic (Pca21) ferroelectric phase of the HZO sub&#8208;nanometer wires (SNWs). The ferroelectric polarization of flexible HZO SNWs can be easily switched by slight external vibration, resulting in a dynamic modulation of the binding energy of adsorbates and thus breaking the &#8220;scaling relationship&#8221; during piezocatalysis. Consequently, the as&#8208;synthesized ultrathin HZO nanowires display superb water&#8208;splitting activity, with a H2 production rate of 25687&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under 40&#160;kHz ultrasonic vibration, which is 235 and 41 times higher than those of non&#8208;ferroelectric hafnium oxides and rigid BaTiO3 nanoparticles, respectively. More strikingly, the hydrogen production rates can reach 5.2&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 by addition of stirring exclusively.

Abstract
The quantum age is just around the corner. As quantum systems become more stable, robust, and mainstream, tackling the challenge of high&#8208;throughput manufacturing will require further developments in materials synthesis, characterization, assembly, and diagnostics. As the building blocks of future technologies scale down to atomic and molecular scales, a paradigm shift in manufacturing will begin to take shape. Inspired by a quantum manufacturing world that elevates the Materials Genome Initiative to the next level, a &#8220;human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop&#8221; framework for high&#8208;throughput manufacturing, which addresses key opportunities and challenges to be overcome, is outlined.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quantum age is just around the corner. As quantum systems become more stable, robust, and mainstream, tackling the challenge of high-throughput manufacturing will require further developments in materials synthesis, characterization, assembly, and diagnostics. As the building blocks of future technologies scale down to atomic and molecular scales, a paradigm shift in manufacturing will begin to take shape. Inspired by a quantum manufacturing world that elevates the Materials Genome Initiative to the next level, a &#8220;human-in-the-loop&#8221; framework for high-throughput manufacturing, which addresses key opportunities and challenges to be overcome, is outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topology and Symmetry in Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological materials offer conceptual novelties and provide unique platforms for exploring fundamental science questions and transformational next&#8208;generation technologies. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work focused on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory paradigm. The image highlights how constant energy surfaces in topological materials differ fundamentally from those in normal materials.








Abstract
Interest in topological materials continues to grow unabated in view of their conceptual novelties as well as their potential as platforms for transformational new technologies. Electronic states in a topological material are robust against perturbations and support unconventional electromagnetic responses. The first&#8208;principles band&#8208;theory paradigm has been a key player in the field by providing successful prediction of many new classes of topological materials. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory framework. In this work, effective strategies for topological materials discovery and impactful directions for future topological materials research are also commented.

Quantum Applications
In article number 2201064, Ajit K. Roy and co&#8208;workers present a perspective of quantum technology state of the art wherein critical stumbling blocks for quantum technology development are identified. As represented in the cover, atomic defects are created in a transition metal chalcogenide (TMD) thin film with a specialized tip in an atomic force microscope. AFM tip tracing indicates atomic&#8208;scale localization of materials states at the defect location. These controlled and localized defect sites are the source of quantum signal generation under a biased field.

         <title>Through the Lens of a Momentum Microscope: Viewing Light&#8208;Induced Quantum Phenomena in 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, time&#8208;resolved momentum&#8208;microscopy is highlighted as a powerful new technique for characterizing photoexcited two&#8208;dimensional materials in momentum&#8208;space. The recent scientific progress that is&#160;made thanks to this technique is surveyed. The future directions in which it will be impactful are outlined: the dynamics of photoexcitations, and the control of the band&#8208;structure by Floquet band engineering.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) materials at their 2D limit are diverse, flexible, and unique laboratories to study fundamental quantum phenomena and their future applications. Their novel properties rely on their pronounced Coulomb interactions, variety of crystal symmetries and spin&#8208;physics, and the ease of incorporation of different vdW materials to form sophisticated heterostructures. In particular, the excited state properties of many 2D semiconductors and semi&#8208;metals are relevant for their technological applications, particularly those that can be induced by light. In this paper, the recent advances made in studying out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, light&#8208;induced, phenomena in these materials are reviewed using powerful, surface&#8208;sensitive, time&#8208;resolved photoemission&#8208;based techniques, with a particular emphasis on the emerging multi&#8208;dimensional photoemission spectroscopy technique of time&#8208;resolved momentum microscopy. The advances this technique has enabled in studying the nature and dynamics of occupied excited states in these materials are discussed. Then, the future research directions opened by these scientific and instrumental advancements are projected for studying the physics of 2D materials and the opportunities to engineer their band&#8208;structure and band&#8208;topology by laser fields.

The future directions in which it will be impactful are outlined: the dynamics of photoexcitations, and the control of the band-structure by Floquet band engineering.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals (vdW) materials at their 2D limit are diverse, flexible, and unique laboratories to study fundamental quantum phenomena and their future applications. Their novel properties rely on their pronounced Coulomb interactions, variety of crystal symmetries and spin-physics, and the ease of incorporation of different vdW materials to form sophisticated heterostructures. In particular, the excited state properties of many 2D semiconductors and semi-metals are relevant for their technological applications, particularly those that can be induced by light. In this paper, the recent advances made in studying out-of-equilibrium, light-induced, phenomena in these materials are reviewed using powerful, surface-sensitive, time-resolved photoemission-based techniques, with a particular emphasis on the emerging multi-dimensional photoemission spectroscopy technique of time-resolved momentum microscopy. The advances this technique has enabled in studying the nature and dynamics of occupied excited states in these materials are discussed. Then, the future research directions opened by these scientific and instrumental advancements are projected for studying the physics of 2D materials and the opportunities to engineer their band-structure and band-topology by laser fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetic Topological Insulator Heterostructures: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of topology and magnetic order can lead to new quantum states and exotic physical effects. An overview of proximity&#8208;coupled magnetic topological insulator heterostructures, involving modulation doping, magnetic insulators, antiferromagnets, and rare&#8208;earth dopants, is given. They form a platform for exploring emergent phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect, real&#8208;space topological spin textures, and interfacial exchange coupling.








Abstract
Topological insulators (TIs) provide intriguing prospects for the future of spintronics due to their large spin&#8211;orbit coupling and dissipationless, counter&#8208;propagating conduction channels in the surface state. The combination of topological properties and magnetic order can lead to new quantum states including the quantum anomalous Hall effect that was&#160;first experimentally realized in Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 films. Since magnetic doping can introduce detrimental effects, requiring very low operational temperatures, alternative approaches are explored. Proximity coupling to magnetically ordered systems is an obvious option, with the prospect to raise the temperature for observing the various quantum effects. Here, an overview of proximity coupling and interfacial effects in TI heterostructures is presented, which provides a versatile materials platform for tuning the magnetic and topological properties of these exciting materials. An introduction is first given to the heterostructure growth by molecular beam epitaxy and suitable structural, electronic, and magnetic characterization techniques. Going beyond transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped and undoped TI heterostructures, examples of heterostructures are discussed, including rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped TIs, magnetic insulators, and antiferromagnets, which lead to exotic phenomena such as skyrmions and exchange bias. Finally, an outlook on novel heterostructures such as intrinsic magnetic TIs and systems including 2D materials is&#160;given.

         <title>Quantum Sensing of Thermoelectric Power in Low&#8208;Dimensional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric conversion has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In this review, the thermoelectric microscopy&#8208;based quantum sensing of thermopower from classical, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, collective spin dynamics, and relativistic effect is summarized. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials provide insights for the future thermoelectric applications.








Abstract
Thermoelectric power, has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In addition to classical and macroscopic values, thermopower also varies locally over a wide range of length scales, and is fundamentally linked to electron wave functions and phonon propagation. Various experimental methods for the quantum sensing of localized thermopower have been suggested, particularly based on scanning probe microscopy. Here, critical advances in the quantum sensing of thermopower are introduced, from the atomic to the several&#8208;hundred&#8208;nanometer scales, including the unique role of low&#8208;dimensionality, defects, spins, and relativistic effects for optimized power generation. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials can provide insights useful for the design of advanced materials for future thermoelectric applications. Quantum sensing techniques for thermopower can pave the way to practical and novel energy devices for a sustainable society.

         <title>Understanding Heterogeneities in Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneities such as defects, impurities, edges, interfaces, and disorder often define and affect the coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topology of quantum states. Their roles in quantum materials are examined at the atomistic level by revealing the different degrees of freedom of heterogeneities, understanding their effects on the host material, and controlling heterogeneities to create new materials with tailored quantum functions.








Abstract
Quantum materials are usually heterogeneous, with structural defects, impurities, surfaces, edges, interfaces, and disorder. These heterogeneities are sometimes viewed as liabilities within conventional systems; however, their electronic and magnetic structures often define and affect the quantum phenomena such as coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topological effects in the host system. Therefore, a critical need is to understand the roles of heterogeneities in order to endow materials with new quantum functions for energy and quantum information science applications. In this article, several representative examples are reviewed on the recent progress in connecting the heterogeneities to the quantum behaviors of real materials. Specifically, three intertwined topic areas are assessed: i) Reveal the structural, electronic, magnetic, vibrational, and optical degrees of freedom of heterogeneities. ii) Understand the effect of heterogeneities on the behaviors of quantum states in host material systems. iii) Control heterogeneities for new quantum functions. This progress is achieved by establishing the atomistic&#8208;level structure&#8208;property relationships associated with heterogeneities in quantum materials. The understanding of the interactions between electronic, magnetic, photonic, and vibrational states of heterogeneities enables the design of new quantum materials, including topological matter and quantum light emitters based on heterogenous 2D materials.

         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, focusing on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are outlined.








Abstract
Recent discoveries of exotic physical phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity in magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene, dissipationless Dirac fermions in topological insulators, and quantum spin liquids, have triggered tremendous interest in quantum materials. The macroscopic revelation of quantum mechanical effects in quantum materials is associated with strong electron&#8211;electron correlations in the lattice, particularly where materials have reduced dimensionality. Owing to the strong correlations and confined geometry, altering atomic spacing and crystal symmetry via strain has emerged as an effective and versatile pathway for perturbing the subtle equilibrium of quantum states. This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, with particular focus on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are first discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are next outlined, with current challenges and future opportunities in quantum straintronics followed. Overall, strain engineering of quantum phenomena and functionalities is a rich field for fundamental research of many&#8208;body interactions and holds substantial promise for next&#8208;generation electronics capable of ultrafast, dissipationless, and secure information processing and communications.

         <title>Harnessing the Quantum Behavior of Spins on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating electron spin resonance capability in spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, quantum states of individual spins on surfaces can be initialized, controlled, and read out. Individual spins and artificial spin structures built atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom provide new platforms for sensing magnetic interactions, performing quantum operations, and simulating spin Hamiltonians at the atomic scale.








Abstract
The desire to control and measure individual quantum systems such as atoms and ions in a vacuum has led to significant scientific and engineering developments in the past decades that form the basis of today's quantum information science. Single atoms and molecules on surfaces, on the other hand, are heavily investigated by physicists, chemists, and material scientists in search of novel electronic and magnetic functionalities. These two paths crossed in 2015 when it was&#160;first clearly demonstrated that individual spins on a surface can be coherently controlled and read out in an all&#8208;electrical fashion. The enabling technique is a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance, which offers unprecedented coherent controllability at the Angstrom length scale.

     alt="Harnessing the Quantum Behavior of Spins on Surfaces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By incorporating electron spin resonance capability in spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, quantum states of individual spins on surfaces can be initialized, controlled, and read out. Individual spins and artificial spin structures built atom-by-atom provide new platforms for sensing magnetic interactions, performing quantum operations, and simulating spin Hamiltonians at the atomic scale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire to control and measure individual quantum systems such as atoms and ions in a vacuum has led to significant scientific and engineering developments in the past decades that form the basis of today's quantum information science. Single atoms and molecules on surfaces, on the other hand, are heavily investigated by physicists, chemists, and material scientists in search of novel electronic and magnetic functionalities. These two paths crossed in 2015 when it was&#160;first clearly demonstrated that individual spins on a surface can be coherently controlled and read out in an all-electrical fashion. The enabling technique is a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance, which offers unprecedented coherent controllability at the Angstrom length scale. This review aims to illustrate the essential ingredients that allow the quantum operations of single spins on surfaces. Three domains of applications of surface spins, namely quantum sensing, quantum control, and quantum simulation, are discussed with physical principles explained and examples presented. Enabled by the atomically-precise fabrication capability of STM, single spins on surfaces might one day lead to the realization of quantum nanodevices and artificial quantum materials at the atomic&#160;scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The basic concepts of quantum computing, communications, and sensing technologies are introduced. The current materials&#8208;related challenges in current quantum devices are identified and how nanoscale and low&#8208;dimensional materials may be used to overcome these challenges is considered. Theoretical and experimental studies on nanomaterials for quantum devices are reviewed.








Abstract
Quantum information science and engineering (QISE)&#8212;which entails the use of quantum mechanical states for information processing, communications, and sensing&#8212;and the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology have dominated condensed matter physics and materials science research in the 21st century. Solid&#8208;state devices for QISE have, to this point, predominantly been designed with bulk materials as their constituents. This review considers how nanomaterials (i.e., materials with intrinsic quantum confinement) may offer inherent advantages over conventional materials for QISE. The materials challenges for specific types of qubits, along with how emerging nanomaterials may overcome these challenges, are identified. Challenges for and progress toward nanomaterials&#8208;based quantum devices are condidered. The overall aim of the review is to help close the gap between the nanotechnology and quantum information communities and inspire research that will lead to next&#8208;generation quantum devices for scalable and practical quantum applications.

         <title>Benchmarking Noise and Dephasing in Emerging Electrical Materials for Quantum Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The available data on low&#8208;frequency fluctuations in electrical properties are reviewed to benchmark dephasing and noise in materials that are of direct interest to quantum technologies. The physical processes causing dephasing and noise are elaborated, the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is evaluated, and it is hoped that a clearer pathway to design, characterize and implement both material and devices for quantum&#160;applications is thus provided.








Abstract
As quantum technologies develop, a specific class of electrically conducting materials is rapidly gaining interest because they not only form the core quantum&#8208;enabled elements in superconducting qubits, semiconductor nanostructures, or sensing devices, but also the peripheral circuitry. The phase coherence of the electronic wave function in these emerging materials will be crucial when incorporated in the quantum architecture. The loss of phase memory, or dephasing, occurs when a quantum system interacts with the fluctuations in the local electromagnetic environment, which manifests in &#8220;noise&#8221; in the electrical conductivity. Hence, characterizing these materials and devices therefrom, for quantum applications, requires evaluation of both dephasing and noise, although there are very few materials where these properties are investigated simultaneously. Here, the available data on magnetotransport and low&#8208;frequency fluctuations in electrical conductivity are reviewed to benchmark the dephasing and noise. The focus is on new materials that are of direct interest to quantum technologies. The physical processes causing dephasing and noise in these systems are elaborated, the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from materials synthesis and devices realization are evaluated, and it is hoped that a clearer pathway to design and characterize both material and devices for quantum&#160;applications is thus provided.

2D layered materials, exhibiting exotic structural, electrical, and magnetic properties, provide a superior platform for implementing novel quantum devices&#8212;from tunneling diodes and transistors, to spin&#8208;FETs, valley&#8208;FETs, and qubits. The physics are highlighted and the opportunities and challenges of exploiting the unique quantum properties of 2D materials to enable revolutionary ultra&#8208;energy&#8208;efficient quantum devices are analyzed.








Abstract
As an approximation to the quantum state of solids, the band theory, developed nearly seven decades ago, fostered the advance of modern integrated solid&#8208;state electronics, one of the most successful technologies in the history of human civilization. Nonetheless, their rapidly growing energy consumption and accompanied environmental issues call for more energy&#8208;efficient electronics and optoelectronics, which necessitate the exploration of more advanced quantum mechanical effects, such as band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling, spin&#8211;orbit coupling, spin&#8211;valley locking, and quantum entanglement. The emerging 2D layered materials, featured by their exotic electrical, magnetic, optical, and structural properties, provide a revolutionary low&#8208;dimensional and manufacture&#8208;friendly platform (and many more opportunities) to implement these quantum&#8208;engineered devices, compared to the traditional electronic materials system. Here, the progress in quantum&#8208;engineered devices is reviewed and the opportunities/challenges of exploiting 2D materials are analyzed to highlight their unique quantum properties that enable novel energy&#8208;efficient devices, and useful insights to quantum device engineers and 2D&#8208;material scientists are provided.

         <title>Recent Development of Ultrafast Optical Characterizations for Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of ultrashort optical pulses has provided unprecedented opportunities to probe and manipulate physical properties of quantum materials. There have been rapid growing discoveries of photoinduced new phenomena and nonlinear properties. A review on recent progress of ultrafast optical characterization and manipulation of quantum states, specifically in systems with broken&#8208;symmetry states or phase transitions, and prospects are provided.








Abstract
The advent of intense ultrashort optical pulses spanning a frequency range from terahertz to the visible has opened a new era in the experimental investigation and manipulation of quantum materials. The generation of strong optical field in an ultrashort time scale enables the steering of quantum materials nonadiabatically, inducing novel phenomenon or creating new phases which may not have an equilibrium counterpart. Ultrafast time&#8208;resolved optical techniques have provided rich information and played an important role in characterization of the nonequilibrium and nonlinear properties of solid systems. Here, some of the recent progress of ultrafast optical techniques and their applications to the detection and manipulation of physical properties in selected quantum materials are reviewed. Specifically, the new development in the detection of the Higgs mode and photoinduced nonequilibrium response in the study of superconductors by time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy are discussed.

         <title>Nanoconfined Water&#8208;Ion Coordination Network for Flexible Energy Dissipation Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Water&#8208;ion interaction in a nanoconfined environment that deeply constrains spatial freedoms of local atomistic motion with unconventional coupling mechanisms beyond that in a free, bulk state is essential to spark designs of a broad spectrum of nanofluidic devices with unique properties and functionalities. Here, we&#160;report that the interaction between ions and water molecules in a hydrophobic nanopore forms a coordination network with an interaction density that is nearly four&#8208;fold as that of the bulk counterpart. Such strong interaction facilitates the connectivity of the water&#8208;ion network and is uncovered by corroborating the formation of ion clusters and the reduction of particle dynamics. We&#160;design a liquid&#8208;nanopore energy dissipation system and demonstrate in both molecular simulations and experiments that the formed coordination network controls the outflow of confined electrolytes along with a pressure reduction, capable of providing flexible protection to personnel and devices and instrumentations against external mechanical impacts and attacks.

         <title>Continuous Spectrum&#8208;Polarization Recombinant Optical Encryption with Dielectric Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Jones matrix, with eight degrees of freedom (DoFs), provides a general mathematical framework for the multifunctional design of metasurfaces. Theoretically, the maximum eight DoFs can be further extended in spectrum dimension to endow unique encryption capabilities. However, the topology and intrinsic spectral responses of metaatoms constraints the continuous engineering of polarization evolution over wavelength dimension. In this work, we report a forward evolution strategy to quickly establish the mapping relationships between the solutions of dispersion Jones matrix and the spectral responses of metaatoms. Based on the eigenvector transformation method, we successfully reconstruct the arbitrary conjugate polarization channels over the continuous spectrum dimension. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrated a silicon metadevice for optical information encryption transmission. Remarkably, the arbitrary combination forms of polarization and wavelength dimension increase the information capacity (210). And the measured polarization contrasts of the conjugate polarization conversion were &gt;94% in the entire wavelength range (3&#8764;4&#160;&#956;m). We believe that the proposed approach will benefit secure optical and quantum information technologies.

         <title>Specific Clearance of Lipopolysaccharide from Blood Based on Peptide Bottlebrush Polymer for Sepsis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEP&#8208;1 exhibiting high affinity and specificity toward Escherichia coli&#160;lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#160;is discovered. Not only could it distinguish LPS from plasma proteins, but it can even distinguish the targeted LPS from other types of LPSs with &#8776;1000 times higher affinity. A hemocompatible bottlebrush polymer bearing PEP&#8208;1 achieves specific clearance of LPS from circulating blood for sepsis therapy.








Abstract
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the primary bacterial toxin that is vital to the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis associated with extremely high morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, specific clearance of LPS from circulating blood is highly challenging because of the structural complexity and its variation between/within bacterial species. Herein, a robust strategy based on phage display screening and hemocompatible peptide bottlebrush polymer design for specific clearance of targeted LPS from circulating blood is proposed. Using LPS extracted from Escherichia coli as an example, a novel peptide (HWKAVNWLKPWT) with high affinity (KD &lt; 1.0 n&#1084;), specificity, and neutralization activity (95.9 &#177; 0.1%) against the targeted LPS is discovered via iterative affinity selection coupled with endotoxin detoxification&#160;screening. A hemocompatible bottlebrush polymer bearing the short peptide [poly(PEGMEA&#8208;co&#8208;PEP&#8208;1)] exhibits high LPS selectivity to reduce circulating LPS level from 2.63 &#177; 0.01 to 0.78 &#177; 0.05 EU mL&#8722;1 in sepsis rabbits via extracorporeal hemoperfusion (LPS clearance ratio &gt; 70%), reversing the LPS&#8208;induced leukocytopenia and multiple organ damages significantly. This work provides a universal paradigm for developing a highly selective hemoadsorbent library fully covering the LPS family, which is promising to create a new era of precision medicine in sepsis therapy.

         <title>Opportunities And Challenges in Applying Solid&#8208;State Nmr Spectroscopy in Organic Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent years it was shown that mechanochemical strategies can be beneficial in directed conversions of organic compounds. Finding new reactions proved difficult, and due to the lack of mechanistic understanding of mechanochemical reaction events, respective efforts have mostly remained empirical. Spectroscopic techniques are crucial in shedding light on these questions. In this overview, the opportunities and challenges of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in the field of organic mechanochemistry are discussed. After a brief discussion of the basics of high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state NMR under magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) conditions, seven opportunities for solid&#8208;state NMR in the field of organic mechanochemistry are presented, ranging from ex&#8208;situ approaches to structurally elucidate reaction products obtained by milling to the potential and limitations of in&#8208;situ solid&#8208;state NMR approaches. Particular strengths of solid&#8208;state NMR, for instance in differentiating polymorphs, in NMR&#8208;crystallographic structure&#8208;determination protocols, or in detecting weak noncovalent interactions in molecular&#8208;recognition events employing proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR experiments at fast MAS frequencies, are discussed.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis and Accurate Doping of Wafer&#8208;Scale Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconducting Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) possess atomically thin thickness, dangling&#8208;bond free surface, flexible band structure, and silicon&#8208;compatible feature, making them one of the most promising channels for constructing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art field&#8208;effect transistors in the post&#8208;Moore's era. However, the existing 2D semiconducting TMDCs fall short of meeting the industry criteria for practical applications in electronics due to their small domain size and the lack of effective approach to modulate intrinsic physical properties. Therefore, it is crucial to prepare and doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs single crystals with wafer size. In this review, we&#160;systematically summary the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progresses regarding the wafer&#8208;scale growth of 2D semiconducting TMDCs polycrystalline and single&#8208;crystal films. The domain orientation control of 2D TMDCs and the seamless stitching of unidirectionally aligned 2D islands by means of substrate design are proposed. In addition, the accurate and uniform doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs and the effect on electronic device performances are also discussed. Finally, the dominating challenges pertaining to enhance electronic device performances of TMDCs are emphasized, and the further development directions are put forward. This review provides a systematically and in&#8208;depth summary for high&#8208;performance device applications of 2D semiconducting TMDCs.

         <title>Giant Energy Density via Mechanically Tailored Relaxor Ferroelectric Behavior of Pzt Thick Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Relaxor ferroelectrics (RFEs) are being actively investigated for energy storage applications due to their large electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced polarization with slim hysteresis and fast energy charging&#8208;discharging capability. Here, w e report a novel nanograin engineering approach based upon high kinetic energy deposition for mechanically inducing the RFE behavior in a normal ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT), which results in simultaneous enhancement in the dielectric breakdown strength (EDBS) and polarization. Mechanically transformed relaxor thick films with 4&#160;&#956;m thickness exhibited an exceptional EDBS of 540 MV/m and reduced hysteresis with large unsaturated polarization (103.6 &#956;C/cm2), resulting in a record high energy storage density of 124.1 J/cm3 and a power density of 64.5 MW/cm3. This fundamental advancement is correlated with the generalized nanostructure design that comprises of nanocrystalline phases embedded within the amorphous matrix. Microstructure&#8208;tailored ferroelectric behavior overcomes the limitations imposed by traditional compositional design methods and provides a feasible pathway for realization of high&#8208;performance energy storage materials.

         <title>High Throughput Screening of Surface Engineered Cyanine Nanodots for Active Transport of Therapeutic Antibody into Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The successful delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules into solid tumor holds great challenge due to their high resistance to penetrate through the complex tumor microenvironments. Here, we harness active&#8208;transporting nanoparticles to efficiently deliver biomacromolecular drugs into solid tumor through cell transcytosis. We prepared a serial of molecular precise cyanine 5&#8208;cored polylysine G5 dendrimers (Cy5 nanodots) with different peripheral amino acids (G5&#8208;AA). We evaluated the capability of these positive charged nanodots to induce cell endocytosis, exocytosis and transcytosis via fluorescence&#8208;based high throughput screen. The optimized nanodots (G5&#8208;R) was conjugated with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 (a therapeutic monoclonal antibody binding to programmed&#8208;death ligand 1) (&#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R) to demonstrate the nanoparticle&#8208;mediated tumor active transport. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R could greatly enhance the tumor penetration capability through adsorption&#8208;mediated transcytosis (AMT). We tested the effectiveness of &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R in treating mice bearing partially resected CT26 tumor, mimicking the local immunotherapy of residual tumors post&#8208;surgery in the clinic. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R embedded in fibrin gel could efficiently mediate tumor cell transcytosis, and deliver &#945;PD&#8208;L1 throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing immune checkpoint blockade, reducing tumor recurrence, and significantly prolonging the survival time. The active transporting nanodots are promising platforms for efficient tumor delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successful delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules into solid tumor holds great challenge due to their high resistance to penetrate through the complex tumor microenvironments. Here, we harness active-transporting nanoparticles to efficiently deliver biomacromolecular drugs into solid tumor through cell transcytosis. We prepared a serial of molecular precise cyanine 5-cored polylysine G5 dendrimers (Cy5 nanodots) with different peripheral amino acids (G5-AA). We evaluated the capability of these positive charged nanodots to induce cell endocytosis, exocytosis and transcytosis via fluorescence-based high throughput screen. The optimized nanodots (G5-R) was conjugated with &#945;PD-L1 (a therapeutic monoclonal antibody binding to programmed-death ligand 1) (&#945;PD-L1-G5-R) to demonstrate the nanoparticle-mediated tumor active transport. The &#945;PD-L1-G5-R could greatly enhance the tumor penetration capability through adsorption-mediated transcytosis (AMT). We tested the effectiveness of &#945;PD-L1-G5-R in treating mice bearing partially resected CT26 tumor, mimicking the local immunotherapy of residual tumors post-surgery in the clinic. The &#945;PD-L1-G5-R embedded in fibrin gel could efficiently mediate tumor cell transcytosis, and deliver &#945;PD-L1 throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing immune checkpoint blockade, reducing tumor recurrence, and significantly prolonging the survival time.

         <title>Photothermal&#8208;Magnetic Synergistic Effects in An Electrocatalyst for Efficient Water Splitting Under Optical&#8208;Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits water splitting, and external fields can help improve it. However, the effect of a single external field on OER is limited and unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the mechanism by which external fields improve OER is unclear, particularly in the presence of multiple fields. Herein, we propose a strategy for enhancing the OER activity of a catalyst using the combined effect of an optical&#8208;magnetic field and study the mechanism of catalytic activity enhancement. Under the optical&#8208;magnetic field, Co3O4 reduces the resistance by increasing the catalyst temperature. Meanwhile, CoFe2O4 further reduces the resistance via the negative magnetoresistance effect, thus decreasing the resistance from 16 &#937; to 7.0 &#937;. Additionally, CoFe2O4 acts as a spin polarizer, and electron polarization results in a parallel arrangement of oxygen atoms, which increases the kinetics of the OER under the magnetic field. Benefiting from the optical and magnetic response design, Co3O4/CoFe2O4@Ni foam requires an overpotential of 172.4&#160;mV to reach a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 under an optical&#8208;magnetic field, which is significantly higher than those of recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes Over Pd/C3N4 Through Dual Regulation of Nitrogen Defects And Mott&#8211;Schottky Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of alkynes is an important reaction; however, the catalytic activity and selectivity in this reaction are generally conflicting. In this study, ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on a graphite&#8208;like C3N4 structure with nitrogen defects (Pd/DCN) were synthesized. The resulting Pd/DCN exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance in the transfer hydrogenation of alkynes with ammonia borane. The reaction rate and selectivity of Pd/DCN were superior to those of Pd/BCN (bulk C3N4 without nitrogen defects) under visible light irradiation. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations showed that the Mott&#8211;Schottky effect in Pd/DCN could change the electronic density of the Pd NPs, and thus enhanced the hydrogenation selectivity toward phenylacetylene. After 1&#160;h, the hydrogenation selectivity of Pd/DCN reached 95%, surpassing that of Pd/BCN (83%). Meanwhile, nitrogen defects in the supports improved the visible&#8208;light response and accelerated the transfer and separation of photogenerated charges to enhance the catalytic activity of Pd/DCN. Therefore, Pd/DCN exhibited higher efficiency under visible light, with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 2002 min&#8722;1. This TOF was five times that of Pd/DCN under dark conditions and 1.5 times that of Pd/BCN. This study provides new insights into the rational design of high&#8208;performance photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation catalysts.

         <title>Broadband Photodetectors and Imagers in Stretchable Electronics Packaging</title>

Abstract
The integration of flexible electronics with optics can help realize a powerful tool that facilitates the creation of a smart society wherein internal evaluations can be easily performed nondestructively from the surface of various objects that we use or encounter in our daily lives. Here, we review organic material&#8208;based stretchable optical sensors and imagers that possess both bending capability and rubber&#8208;like elasticity. We discuss the latest trends in nondestructive evaluation equipment that enable simple on&#8208;site evaluations of health conditions and abnormalities without subjecting the targeted living bodies and various objects to mechanical stress. Real&#8208;time performance under real&#8208;life conditions is becoming increasingly important for creating smart societies interwoven with optical technologies. In particular, the terahertz (THz)&#8208;wave region offers a substance&#8208; and state&#8208;specific fingerprint spectrum that enables instantaneous analyses. However, to make THz sensors accessible, the following issues must be addressed: broadband and high&#8208;sensitivity at room temperature, stretchability to follow the surface movements of targets, and digital transformation compatibility. We discuss in detail the materials, electronics packaging, and remote imaging systems used to overcome these issues. Ultimately, stretchable optical sensors and imagers with highly&#8208;sensitive and broadband THz sensors can facilitate the multifaceted on&#8208;site evaluation of solids, liquids, and gases.

         <title>Two&#8208;Tailed Dynamic Covalent Amphiphile Combats Bacterial Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of non&#8208;antibiotic two&#8208;tailed antimicrobial amphiphile (T2A2) via dynamic covalent bonding is reported. T2A2 prevents biofilm formation and eradicates the mature biofilms via multiple mechanisms, suggestions applications in addressing the ever&#8208;growing threat of drug resistance in bacteria.








Abstract
Drug combination provides an efficient pathway to combat drug resistance in bacteria and bacterial biofilms. However, the facile methodology to construct the drug combinations and their applications in nanocomposites is still lacking. Here the two&#8208;tailed antimicrobial amphiphiles (T2A2) composed of nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;donor (diethylenetriamine NONOate, DN) and various natural aldehydes are reported. T2A2 self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles due to their amphiphilic nature, with remarkably low critical aggregation concentration. The representative cinnamaldehyde (Cin)&#8208;derived T2A2 (Cin&#8208;T2A2) assemblies demonstrate excellent bactericidal efficacy, notably higher than free Cin and free DN. Cin&#8208;T2A2 assemblies kill multidrug&#8208;resistant staphylococci and eradicate their biofilms via multiple mechanisms, as proved by mechanism studies, molecular dynamics simulations, proteomics, and metabolomics. Furthermore, Cin&#8208;T2A2 assemblies rapidly eradicate bacteria and alleviate inflammation in the subsequent murine infection models. Together, the Cin&#8208;T2A2 assemblies may provide an efficient, non&#8208;antibiotic alternative in combating the ever&#8208;increasing threat of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and their biofilms.

A high&#8208;density neuromorphic computing memristor array based on 2D&#160;materials paves the way for next&#8208;generation information&#8208;processing components and in&#8208;memory computing systems. However, the traditional 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based memristor devices suffer from poor flexibility and opacity, which hinders the application of memristors in flexible electronics. Here, a flexible artificial synapse array based on TiOx/Ti3C2Tx film is fabricated by a convenient and energy&#8208;efficient solution&#8208;processing technique, which realizes high transmittance (&#8776;90%) and oxidation resistance (&gt;30 days). The TiOx/Ti3C2Tx memristor shows low device&#8208;to&#8208;device variability, long memory retention and endurance, a high ON/OFF ratio, and fundamental synaptic behavior. Furthermore, satisfactory flexibility (R = 1.0&#160;mm) and mechanical endurance (104 bending cycles) of the TiOx/Ti3C2Tx memristor are achieved, which is superior to other film memristors prepared by chemical vapor deposition. In addition, high&#8208;precision (&gt;96.44%) MNIST handwritten digits recognition classification simulation indicates that the TiOx/Ti3C2Tx artificial synapse array holds promise for future neuromorphic computing applications, and provides excellent high&#8208;density neuron circuits for new flexible intelligent electronic equipment.

Abstract
Neural stem cells, with capability of self&#8208;renewal, differentiation, and environment modulation, are considered promising for stroke, brain injury therapy and neuron regeneration. Activation of endogenous neural stem cells, is attracting increasing research enthusiasm, which avoids immune rejection and ethical issues of exogeneous cell transplantation. Yet how to induce directed growth and differentiation in situ remain a major challenge. In this study, w e propose a pure water driven Ni&#8208;Zn micromotor via a self&#8208;established electric&#8208;chemical field. The micromotors can be magnetically guided and precisely approach target neural stem cell. Through electric&#8208;chemical field, bioelectrical signal exchange and communication with endogenous neural stem cells w ere allowed, thus allowing for regulated proliferation and directed neuron differentiation in vivo. Therefore, Ni&#8208;Zn micromotor provides a platform for controlling cell fate via self&#8208;established electrochemical field and targeted activation of endogenous neural stem cells.

         <title>Carbon Aerogel Lightweight Al Battery for Fast Storage of Fluctuating Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Al batteries have great potential for renewable energy storage owing to their low cost, high capacity, and safety. High energy density and adaptability to fluctuating electricity are major challenges. Here, a lightweight Al battery for fast storage of fluctuating energy is constructed based on a novel hierarchical porous dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and an integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. A new induced mechanism by the O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF anode was confirmed for uniform Al deposition. The GCAF cathode possesses a higher mass utilization ratio due to the extremely high loading mass (9.5&#8211;10.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) of graphite materials compared to conventional coated cathodes. Meanwhile, the volume expansion of the GCAF cathode was almost negligible, resulting in better cycling stability. The lightweight CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery can adapt well to large and fluctuating current densities owing to its hierarchical porous structure. A large discharge capacity (115.6 mAh g&#8722;1) after 2000 cycles and a short charge time (7.0&#160;min) at a high current density were obtained simultaneously. The construction strategy of lightweight Al batteries based on carbon aerogel electrodes will promote the breakthrough of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Al batteries adapted to the fast storage of fluctuating renewable energy.

         <title>Bioinspired Bilevel Metamaterial for Multispectral Manipulation towards Visible, Multi&#8208;Wavelength Detection Lasers and Mid&#8208;Infrared Selective Radiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Manipulation of the electromagnetic signature in multiple wavebands is necessary and effective in civil and industrial applications. However, the integration of multispectral requirements, particularly for the bands with comparable wavelengths, challenges the design and fabrication of current compatible metamaterials. Here, a bioinspired bilevel metamaterial is proposed for multispectral manipulation involving visible, multi&#8208;wavelength detection lasers and mid&#8208;infrared, along with radiative cooling. The metamaterial, consisting of dual&#8208;deck Pt disks and SiO2 intermediate layer, is inspired by the broadband reflection splitting effect found in butterfly scales and achieves ultra&#8208;low specular reflectance (average 0.013) over the entire 0.8&#8208;1.6&#160;&#956;m with large scattering angles. Meanwhile, tunable visible reflection and selective dual absorption peaks in MIR can be simultaneously realized, providing structural color, effective radiative thermal dissipation at 5&#8211;8&#160;&#956;m and 10.6&#160;&#956;m laser absorption. The metamaterial is fabricated by a low&#8208;cost colloidal lithography method combined with two patterning processes. Multispectral manipulation performances are experimentally demonstrated and a significant apparent temperature drop (maximum 15.7&#160;&#176;C) compared to the reference is observed under thermal imager. This work achieves optical response in multiple wavebands and provides a valuable way to effectively design multifunctional metamaterials inspired by nature.

         <title>Manipulations of Spin Wave by Photoelectrons in Ferromagnetic/Non&#8208;Ferromagnetic Alloyed Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spin wave is considered an alternative carrier with great promise for information sensing. The feasible excitation and low&#8208;power manipulation of spin waves still remain a challenge. In this regard, natural light enables spin wave tunability is profoundly investigated in Co60Al40 alloyed film. A reversible manner with 2&#176; of the critical angle of the body spin wave is achieved successfully. Meanwhile, an eye&#8208;catching shift (817&#160;Oe) of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) field is obtained optically, leading to changes in magnetic anisotropy. Based on the modified Puszkarski's surface inhomogeneity model, the sunlight control of spin&#8208;wave resonance (SWR) can be comprehended by a photoelectron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced effective surface magnetic anisotropy change. Furthermore, the body spin wave is modulated stably with natural light illumination, confirming a non&#8208;volatile, reversible switching behavior. This work has both practical and theoretical importance for developing future sunlight&#8208;tunable magnonics/spintronics devices.

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Performance Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Activation of In&#8208;Layer Channels for Enhanced Ion Storage and Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries, leveraging non&#8208;metallic ammonium ions, have arisen as a promising electrochemical energy storage system; however, their advancement has been hindered by the scarcity of high&#8208;performance ammonium&#8208;ion storage materials. In this study, w e propose an electrochemical phase transformation approach for the in&#8208;situ synthesis of layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O (E&#8208;VOPO) with predominant growth on the (200) plane, corresponding to the tetragonal channels on (001) layers. O ur findings reveal that these tetragonal in&#8208;layer channels not only furnish NH4+ storage sites but also enhance transfer kinetics by providing rapid cross&#8208;layer migration pathways. This crucial aspect has been largely overlooked in previous studies. The E&#8208;VOPO electrode exhibits exceptional ammonium&#8208;ion storage performance, including significantly increased specific capacity, enhanced rate capability, and robust cycling stability. The resulting full cell can be stably operated for 12500 charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 for over 70 days. The proposed approach offers a new strategy for meticulously engineering electrode materials with facilitated ion storage and migration, thereby paving the way for developing more efficient and sustainable energy storage systems.

The E-VOPO electrode exhibits exceptional ammonium-ion storage performance, including significantly increased specific capacity, enhanced rate capability, and robust cycling stability. The resulting full cell can be stably operated for 12500 charge-discharge cycles at 2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for over 70 days. The proposed approach offers a new strategy for meticulously engineering electrode materials with facilitated ion storage and migration, thereby paving the way for developing more efficient and sustainable energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reconfiguring Hard Carbons with Emerging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights three critical structural features of hard carbons for practical use in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, namely crystallites, defects, and nanopores. The impact of these structural features upon sodium storage is systematically discussed and an ideal configuration, namely sieving carbons with tightened pore entrance and enlarged pore body, is finally proposed for superior sodium storage.








Abstract
Hard carbons, an important category of amorphous carbons, are non&#8208;graphitizable and are widely accepted as the most promising anode materials for emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs)&#65292; because of their changeable low&#8208;potential charge/discharge plateaus. However, their microstructures are not fixed and are difficult to accurately demonstrate as graphites do. The successful use of hard carbons in SIBs revives the interest to clearly picture their complicated microstructures that are in close relevance to sodium storage. In this review, the past definitions and structural models of hard carbons are revisited first, and a renewed understanding of their sodium storage is presented. Three critical structural features are highlighted for hard carbons, namely crystallites, defects, and nanopores, which are directly responsible for the presence of the low&#8208;potential plateaus and their reversible extension. The impact of these structural features upon the sodium storage is then deeply discussed and sieving carbons is finally proposed as an ideal configuration of carbon anode for superhigh sodium storage. This review is expected to offer a clear picture of hard carbons, and help realize a truly rational design of high&#8208;capacity carbon anodes, driving the industrialization of SIBs, and more promisingly open up a window for exploring their possible new uses.

         <title>Title A Flexible Tough Hydrovoltaic Coating for Wearable Sensing Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The lack of strong binding mechanism between nanomaterials severely restricts the advantages of evaporation&#8208;driven hyhrovoltaic effect in wearable sensing electronics. It's a challenging task to observably improve the mechanical toughness and flexibility of hyhrovoltaic devices to match the wearable demand without abandoning the nanostructures and surface function. Here, we developed a flexible tough PAN/Al2O3 hydrovoltaic coating with both good electricity generation (open circuit voltage&#8764;3.18&#160;V) and sensitive ion sensing (2285&#160;V M&#8722;1 for NaCl solutions in 10&#8722;4&#8208;10&#8722;3&#160;M) capabilities. The porous nanostructure composed of Al2O3 nanoparticles is firmly locked by the strong binding effect of PAN, giving a critical binding force 4 times than that of Al2O3 film to easily deal with 9.92 m s&#8722;1 strong waterflow impact. Finally, skin&#8208;tight and non&#8208;contact device structures were proposed to achieve wearable multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensing directly using sweat. The flexible tough PAN/Al2O3 hydrovoltaic coating breaks through the mechanical brittleness limitation and broadens the applications of evaporation&#8208;induced hydrovoltaic effect in self&#8208;powered wearable sensing electronics.

         <title>Phosphine Oxide&#8208;Balanced Intra&#8208; and Inter&#8208;Chain Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Polymers: Beyond 30% External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) is crucial for developing highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers. The balance of intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;chain TSCT can markedly improve the performance, but it is still a big challenge. In this contribution, an effective strategy for &#8220;intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;chain TSCT balance&#8221; is demonstrated by a series non&#8208;conjugated copolymers containing 9,9&#8208;dimethylacridine (DMAC) donor and triazine&#8208;phosphine oxide (PO) based acceptors. Steady&#8208;state and transient emission spectra indicate that compared to the corresponding blends, the copolymers can indeed achieve the balanced intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;chain TSCT through accurately optimizing inductive and steric effects of the acceptors. DPOT acceptor with the strongest electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and the second bigger steric hindrance endows its copolymers with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies beyond 95% and 32%, respectively. It demonstrates that compared to other congeners, the synergistic inductive and steric effects effectively enhance TSCT in DPOT based copolymers for radiation, and suppresses singlet and triplet quenching. The record&#8208;high efficiencies of its devices make this kind of copolymers hold the potential for low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;efficiency applications.

         <title>Soft Multimaterial Magnetic Fibers and Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preform&#8208;to&#8208;fiber thermal drawing of magnetically responsive soft composite materials enables the fabrication of magnetic fibers with extreme aspect ratios and intricate internal multimaterial structures, resulting in diverse functionalities. The soft magnetic fibers can optimally steer in many different directions, lift heavy loads, and also can be weaved into forming functional magnetic textiles for programmable shape&#8208;morphing. 








Abstract
Magnetically responsive soft materials are promising building blocks for the next generation of soft robotics, prosthesis, surgical tools, and smart textiles. To date, however, the fabrication of highly integrated magnetic fibers with extreme aspect ratios, that can be used as steerable catheters, endoscopes, or within functional textiles remains challenging. Here, multimaterial thermal drawing is proposed as a material and processing platform to realize 10s of meters long soft, ultrastretchable, yet highly resilient magnetic fibers. Fibers with a diameter as low as 300&#160;&#181;m and an aspect ratio of 105 are demonstrated, integrating nanocomposite domains with ferromagnetic microparticles embedded in a soft elastomeric matrix. With the proper choice of filler content that must strike the right balance between magnetization density and mechanical stiffness, fibers withstanding strains of &gt;1000% are shown, which can be magnetically actuated and lift up to 370 times their own weight. Magnetic fibers can also integrate other functionalities like microfluidic channels, and be weaved into conventional textiles. It is shown that the novel magnetic textiles can be washed and sustain extreme mechanical constraints, as well as be folded into arbitrary shapes when magnetically actuated, paving the way toward novel intriguing opportunities in medical textiles and soft magnetic systems.

         <title>Bright and Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are seen as potentially promising candidates for novel light&#8208;emission applications, owing to their unique characteristics. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress made in the development of 2D TMDC&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting devices and highlights the remaining challenges.








Abstract
2D monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) show great promise for the development of next&#8208;generation light&#8208;emitting devices owing to their unique electronic and optoelectronic properties. The dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface and direct&#8208;bandgap structure of monolayer TMDCs allow for near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies. The excellent mechanical and optical characteristics of 2D TMDCs offer great potential to fabricate TMDC&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) featuring good flexibility and transparency. Great progress has been made in the fabrication of bright and efficient LEDs with varying device structures. In this review, the aim is to provide a comprehensive summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress made in the construction of bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs. After a brief introduction to the research background, the preparation of 2D TMDCs used for LEDs is briefly discussed. The requirements and the corresponding challenges to achieve bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs are introduced. Thereafter, various strategies to enhance the brightness of monolayer 2D TMDCs are described. Following that, the carrier&#8208;injection schemes enabling bright and efficient TMDC&#8208;based LEDs along with the device performance are summarized. Finally, the challenges and future prospects regarding the accomplishment of TMDC&#8208;LEDs with ultimate brightness and efficiency are discussed.

         <title>Type I Photosensitization with Strong Hydroxyl Radical Generation in NIR Dye Boosted by Vigorous Intramolecular Motions for Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the relationship between type I photosensitization with strong hydroxyl radical (&#8729;OH) formation and intramolecular motions is established. The solid&#8208;state intramolecular motions are almost maximized by the double engineering which may lead to a strong &#8729;OH generation. Combined with the high photothermal conversion efficiency, the synergistic phototherapy toward in vivo tumor can be well performed.








Abstract
Development of type I photosensitizers (PSs) with strong hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) formation is particularly important in the anaerobic tumor treatment. On the other hand, it is challenging to obtain an efficient solid&#8208;state intramolecular motion to promote the development of molecular machine and molecular motor. However, the relationship between them is never revealed. In this work, a pyrazine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared type I PS with remarkable donor&#8211;acceptor effect is developed. Notably, the intramolecular motions are almost maximized by the combination of intramolecular and intermolecular engineering to simultaneously introduce the unlimited bond stretching vibration and boost the group rotation. The photothermal conversion caused by the intramolecular motions is realized with efficiency as high as 86.8%. The D&#8211;A conformation of PS can also induce a very small singlet&#8208;triplet splitting of 0.07&#160;eV, which is crucial to promote the intersystem crossing for the triplet sensitization. Interestingly, its photosensitization is closely related to the intramolecular motions, and a vigorous motion may give rise to a strong &#183;OH generation. In view of its excellent photosensitization and photothermal behavior, the biocompatible PS exhibits a superior imaging&#8208;guided cancer synergistic therapy. This work stimulates the development of advanced PS for the biomedical application and solid&#8208;state intramolecular motions.

         <title>Tenascin&#8208;C Activation of Lung Fibroblasts in a 3D Synthetic Lung Extracellular Matrix Mimic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;hydrogel that mimics the protein content and stiffness of healthy lung tissue is synthesized. Lung&#8208;mimicking material is applied&#160;to reveal the ability of tenascin&#8208;C to activate fibroblasts in lung&#8208;metastatic breast cancer. This novel hydrogel environment will be incredibly useful for research questions involving the lung extracellular matrix.








Abstract
The lung extracellular matrix (ECM) maintains the structural integrity of the tissue and regulates the phenotype and functions of resident fibroblasts. Lung&#8208;metastatic breast cancer alters these cell&#8208;ECM interactions, promoting fibroblast activation. There is a need for bio&#8208;instructive ECM models that match the ECM composition and biomechanics of the lung to study these cell&#8208;matrix interactions in vitro. Here, a synthetic, bioactive hydrogel is synthesized that mimics the native lung modulus and includes a representative distribution of the most abundant ECM peptide motifs responsible for integrin&#8208;binding and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;mediated degradation in the lung, which enables quiescent culture of human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). Stimulation with transforming growth factor &#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1), metastatic breast cancer conditioned media (CM), or tenascin&#8208;C&#8208;derived integrin&#8208;binding peptide activated hydrogel&#8208;encapsulated HLFs demonstrates multiple environmental methods to activate HLFs in a lung ECM&#8208;mimicking hydrogel. This lung hydrogel platform is a tunable, synthetic approach to studying the independent and combinatorial effects of ECM in regulating fibroblast quiescence and activation.

         <title>Completely Activated and Phase&#8208;Transformed Kfemnhcf for Zn/K Hybrid Batteries with 14500 Cycles by an OH&#8208;rich Hydrogel Electrolyte</title>

Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates have been recognized as superior cathode materials for zinc and zinc hybrid batteries, particularly the Prussian blue analogue (PBA). However, PBA development has been hindered by several limitations, including small capacities (&lt; 70 mAh g&#8722;1) and short lifespans (&lt;1000 cycles). These limitations generally arise due to incomplete activation of redox sites and structure collapse during intercalation/deintercalation of metal ions in PBAs. According to this study, the adoption of a hydroxyl&#8208;rich (OH&#8208;rich) hydrogel electrolyte with extended electrochemical stability windows (ESWs) can effectively activate the redox site of low&#8208;spin Fe of the KxFeyMn1&#8208;y[Fe(CN)6]w&#183;zH2O (KFeMnHCF) cathode while tuning its structure. Additionally, the strong adhesion of the hydrogel electrolyte inhibits KFeMnHCF particles from falling off the cathode and dissolving. The easy desolvation of metal ions in the developed OH&#8208;rich hydrogel electrolytes can lead to a fast and reversible intercalation/deintercalation of metal ions in the PBA cathode. As a result, the Zn||KFeMnHCF hybrid batteries achieve the unprecedented characteristics of 14500 cycles, a 1.7&#160;V discharge plateau, and a 100 mAh g&#8722;1 discharge capacity. The results of this study provide a new understanding of the development of zinc hybrid batteries with PBA cathode materials and present a promising new electrolyte material for this application.

         <title>Reversible Crosslinking of Commodity Polymers via Photo&#8208;Controlled Metal&#8208;Ligand Coordination for High&#8208;Performance And Recyclable Thermoset Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermoset plastics, highly desired for their stability, durability, and chemical resistance, are currently consumed over 60 million tons annually across the globe, but they are difficult to recycle due to their crosslinked structures. The development of recyclable thermoset plastics is an important but challenging task. Here, we prepare recyclable thermoset plastics by crosslinking a commodity polymer, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), with a small percentage of a Ru complex via nitrile&#8208;Ru coordination. PAN is obtained from industry and the Ru complex is synthesized in one step, which enables the production of recyclable thermoset plastics in an efficient way. Additionally, the thermoset plastics exhibit impressive mechanical performance, boasting a Young's modulus of 6.3&#160;GPa and a tensile strength of 109.8&#160;MPa. Moreover, they can be decrosslinked when exposed to both light and a solvent, and can then be re&#8208;crosslinked upon heating. This reversible crosslinking mechanism enables the recycling of thermosets from a mixture of plastic waste. We also demonstrate the preparation of recyclable thermosets from other commodity polymers such as SAN resins and polymer composites through reversible crosslinking. This study shows reversible crosslinking via metal&#8208;ligand coordination is a new strategy for designing recyclable thermosets using commodity polymers.

         <title>Water Induced Bandgap Engineering in Nanoribbons of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Different from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheets, the bandgap of hBN nanoribbons (BNNRs) can be changed by spatial/electrostatic confinement. It has been predicted that a transverse electric field can narrow the bandgap and even cause an insulator&#8208;metal transition in BNNRs. However, experimentally introducing an overhigh electric field across the BNNR remains challenging. Here, we&#160;theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that water adsorption greatly reduces bandgap of zigzag oriented BNNRs (zBNNRs). Ab initio calculations show that water adsorbed beside the BNNR induces a transverse equivalent electric field of over 2&#160;V/nm thereby reducing its bandgap. Field effect transistors were&#160;successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of zBNNRs with adsorbates of water could&#160;be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via electrical field modulation at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements were&#160;taken to determine the optical bandgap in zBNNR. Wider zBNNRs exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17&#160;eV. This study yields fundamental insights in new routes toward realizing electronic/optoelectronic devices and circuits based on hexagonal boron nitride.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence And Photoluminescence Heterojunction for Superior Multi&#8208;mode Sensing Platform of Friction, Force, Pressure And Temperature in Fibers And 3D&#8208;printed Polymers</title>

Abstract
Endowing a single material with various types of luminescence, i.e., exhibiting a simultaneous optical response to different stimuli, is vital in various fields. A photoluminescence (PL)&#8208; and mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based multifunctional sensing platform was&#160;built by combining heterojunctioned ZnS/CaZnOS:Mn2+ mechano&#8208;photonic materials using a 3D&#8208;printing technique and fiber spinning. ML&#8208;active particles were&#160;embedded in micron&#8208;sized cellulose fibers for flexible optical devices capable of emitting light driven by mechanical force. We&#160;also fabricated individual modified 3D&#8208;printed hard units that exhibit intense ML in response to mechanical deformation such as impact and friction. Importantly, they also allow low&#8208;pressure sensing up to &#8764;100&#160;bar, a range previously inaccessible by any other optical sensing technique. Moreover, the developed optical manometer based on the PL of the materials demonstrates a superior high&#8208;pressure sensitivity of &#8764;6.20&#160;nm/GPa. Using this sensing platform, four modes of temperature detection can be achieved: excitation&#8208; and emission&#8208;band spectral shifts, bandwidth broadening and lifetime shortening. Our&#160;work supports the possibility of&#160;mass production of ML&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.

         <title>Optimization of Charge Management And Energy Loss in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs) have received tremendous attention in recent decades because of their advantages over their polymer counterparts. These advantages include well&#8208;defined chemical structures, easy purification, and negligible batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation. Remarkable progress with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 17% has recently been achieved with improved charge management (FF &#215; JSC) and reduced energy loss (Eloss). Morphology control is the key factor in the progress of ASM&#8208;OSCs, which remains a significant challenge because of the similarities in the molecular structures of the donors and acceptors. In this review, we summarize the effective strategies for charge management and/or Eloss reduction from the perspective of effective morphology control. We aim to provide practical insights and guidance for material design and device optimization to promote further development of ASM&#8208;OSCs to a level where they can compete with or even surpass the efficiency of polymer solar cells.

         <title>Mechanochromism and Strain&#8208;Induced Crystallization in Thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;derived Stereoelastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Most elastomers undergo strain&#8208;induced crystallization (SIC) under tension; as individual chains are held rigidly in a fixed position by an applied strain, their alignment along the strain field results in a shift from strain&#8208;hardening (SH) to SIC. A similar degree of stretching is associated with the tension necessary to accelerate mechanically&#8208;coupled, covalent chemical responses of mechanophores in overstretched chains, raising the possibility of an interplay between the macroscopic response of SIC, and the molecular response of mechanophore activation. Here we report thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;derived stereoelastomers, doped covalently with a dipropiolate&#8208;derivatized spiropyran (SP) mechanophore (0.25&#8208;0.38 mol%). Material properties of SP&#8208;containing films are consistent with undoped controls, indicating that the SP behaves as a reporter of the mechanical state of the polymer film. Uniaxial tensile tests reveal correlations between mechanochromism and SIC, which are strain rate&#8208;dependent. Potential consequences of the correlations between mechanochromism and SIC include the possibility that mechanochromophores may provide a pathway to bridge these phenomena, since molecular&#8208;level mechanochemical activation results in a macroscopic color change in the bulk material. When mechanochromic films are stretched slowly to the point of mechanophore activation, the covalently tethered mechanophore remains trapped in a force&#8208;activated state, even after the applied stress is removed. Additionally, the kinetics of mechanophore reversion correlate with the applied strain rate, resulting in highly tunable decoloration rates. Because these polymers are not covalently cross&#8208;linked, they can be recycled by melt&#8208;pressing into new films, which increases their potential range of strain&#8208;sensing, morphology&#8208;sensing, and shape&#8208;memory applications.

         <title>Intense Hydrochromic Photon Upconversion from Lead&#8208;Free Zero&#8208;Dimensional Metal Halides For Water Detection and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hydrochromic materials that change their luminescence color upon exposure to moisture have attracted considerable attention owing to their applications in sensing and information encryption. However, the existing materials lack high hydrochromic response and color tunability. This study reports the development of a new and bright zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) Cs3GdCl6 metal halide as the host for hydrochromic photon upconversion in the form of polycrystals (PCs) and nanocrystals (NCs). Lanthanides co&#8208;doped cesium gadolinium chloride metal halides exhibit upconversion luminescence (UCL) in the visible&#8211;infrared region upon 980&#160;nm laser excitation. In particular, Yb3+ and Er3+ co&#8208;doped PCs exhibit hydrochrmic UCL color change from green to red. These hydrochromic properties are quantitatively confirmed through sensitive detection of water in the tetrahydrofuran solvent via UCL color changes. This water&#8208;sensing probe exhibits excellent repeatability and is particularly suitable for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term water monitoring. Furthermore, the hydrochromic UCL property is exploited for stimuli&#8208;responsive information encryption via cyphertexts. These findings will pave way for the development of new hydrochromic upconverting materials for emerging applications, such as noncontact sensors, anticounterfeit and information encryption.

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency of Low&#8208;Grade Heat Harvesting by Structural Vibration Entropy in Thermally Regenerative Electrochemical Cycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The majority of waste&#8208;heat energy exists in the form of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#176;C), which is immensely difficult to convert into usable energy using conventional energy&#8208;harvesting systems. Thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles (TREC), which integrate battery and thermal&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting functionalities, have been considered an attractive system for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. Herein, we investigate the role of structural vibration modes in enhancing the efficacy of TREC systems. We analyze how changes in bonding covalency, influenced by the amount of structural water molecules, impact the vibration modes. We discover that even small amounts of water molecules can induce the A1g stretching mode of cyanide ligands with strong structural vibration energy, which significantly contributes to a larger temperature coefficient (&#593;) in a TREC system. Leveraging these insights, we have designed and implemented a highly efficient TREC system using a sodium&#8208;ion&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte. Our study provides valuable insights into the potential of TREC systems, offering a deeper understanding of the intrinsic properties of Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) regulated by structural vibration modes. These insights open up new possibilities for enhancing the energy&#8208;harvesting capabilities of TREC systems.

         <title>Water Activation in Solar&#8208;Powered Vapor Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar&#8208;powered water evaporation (SWE), based on the liquid&#8208;gas phase conversion concept using solar energy, has been given close attention as a promising technology to address the global water shortage. At molecular level, water molecules escaping from liquid water should overcome the attraction of the molecules on the liquid surface layer to evaporate. For this reason, it is better to reduce the energy required for evaporation by breaking a smaller number of hydrogen bonds or forming weak hydrogen bonds to ensure efficient and convenient vapor production. Many novel evaporator materials and effective water activation strategies have been proposed to stimulate rapid steam production and surpass the theoretical thermal limit. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the phase/enthalpy change process of water evaporation is unclear. In this review, we provide a summary of theoretical analyses of vaporization enthalpy, general calculations, and characterization methods. We have also outlined various water activation mechanisms to reduce evaporation enthalpy in evaporators. Moreover, unsolved issues associated with water activation are critically discussed to provide a direction for future research. Meanwhile, significant pioneering developments made in SWE have been highlighted, hoping to provide a relatively entire chain for more scholars who are just stepping into this field.

For this reason, it is better to reduce the energy required for evaporation by breaking a smaller number of hydrogen bonds or forming weak hydrogen bonds to ensure efficient and convenient vapor production. Many novel evaporator materials and effective water activation strategies have been proposed to stimulate rapid steam production and surpass the theoretical thermal limit. However, an in-depth understanding of the phase/enthalpy change process of water evaporation is unclear. In this review, we provide a summary of theoretical analyses of vaporization enthalpy, general calculations, and characterization methods. We have also outlined various water activation mechanisms to reduce evaporation enthalpy in evaporators. Moreover, unsolved issues associated with water activation are critically discussed to provide a direction for future research. Meanwhile, significant pioneering developments made in SWE have been highlighted, hoping to provide a relatively entire chain for more scholars who are just stepping into this field.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Surface Engineering of Fluorinated Graphene Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Lithium/Sodium/Potassium Primary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fluorinated carbon (CFx) is considered as a promising cathode material for lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries with superior theoretical energy density. However, achieving high energy and power densities simultaneously remains a considerable challenge due to the strong covalency of the C&#8208;F bond in the highly fluorinated CFx. Herein, an efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets (DFG&#8208;N) to possess controllable conductive nanolayers and reasonably regulated C&#8208;F bonds. The DFG&#8208;N delivers an unprecedented dual performance for lithium primary batteries with a power density of 77456&#160;W kg&#8722;1 and an energy density of 1067&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an ultrafast rate of 50 C, which is the highest level reported to date. The DFG&#8208;N also achieved a record power density of 15256 and 17881&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 10 C for sodium and potassium primary batteries, respectively. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the excellent performance of DFG&#8208;N is attributed to surface engineering strategies that remarkably improve electronic and ionic conductivity without sacrificing the high fluorine content. This work provides a compelling strategy for developing advanced ultrafast primary batteries that combine ultrahigh energy density and power density.

         <title>Non&#8208;blinking Luminescence from Charged Single Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photoluminescence blinking behaviour from single quantum dots under steady illumination is an important but controversial topic. Its occurrence has impeded the use of single quantum dots in bio&#8208;imaging. Different mechanisms have been proposed to account for it, although controversial, the most important of which is the non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination mechanism whereby photo&#8208;charging of quantum dots can lead to the blinking phenomenon. Here, the singly charged trion, which maintains photon emission, including the radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination, leads to fluorescence non&#8208;blinking which was observed in photo&#8208;charged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs). This phenomenon can be explained in terms of different energy levels in the GQDs, caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups in the single GQDs. The suppressed blinking is due to the filling of trap sites owing to a Coulomb blockade. Our results provide a profound understanding of the special optical properties of GQDs, affording a reference for further in&#8208;depth research.

         <title>Thin Film Organic Heteroepitaxy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, while rules for commensurate epitaxy of covalent or ionic inorganic material systems are known to be dictated by lattice matching constraints, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems are still being written. Here, we&#160; find that lattice matching alone is insufficient to achieve heteroepitaxy in molecular systems, owing to weak intermolecular forces that describe molecular crystals. We&#160; find that, in addition, the lattice matched plane also must be the lowest energy surface of the adcrystal to achieve, for the first time, one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate molecular heteroepitaxy. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the lattice matched interface to be of higher electronic quality than a disordered interface of the same materials.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells by Tailoring of Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of perovskite solar cells is a significant challenge for commercialization due to the inherent instability of the perovskite material and the interface defects between different layers in the device. Tailoring the interfaces in perovskite solar cells can enhance the device's efficiency and stability. This review discusses the theory of interface improvement and various interface materials for efficient, stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The interface tailoring is crucial for the efficiency and stability of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs). The reported interface engineering primarily focuses on the energy level turning and trap state passivation to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In this review, molecule modifications are classified according to the basics of electron transfer mechanisms for the interface tailoring of materials. An in&#8208;depth analysis of energy level modification and trap passivation, as well as the universal Density Functional Theory (DFT) method employed in interface tailoring. In addition, strategies to address environmental protection and large&#8208;scale mini&#8208;modules fabrication by interface engineering are also discussed. This review can guide the researchers in understanding interface engineering to design interface materials for efficient, stable, and eco&#8208;friendly PSCs.

Here, The proposal of a comprehensive review on the recent advances of sonosensitive nanomaterials in advancing four US&#8208;related biological applications and disease theranostics is aimed. In addition to the mostly explored nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT), the summary and discussion of other sono&#8208;therapies and progresses/achievements are relatively lacking, including sonomechanical therapy (SMT), sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT), and sonothermal therapy (STT).

Furthermore, the representative paradigms for nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/enhanced US therapies are elaborated according to therapeutic principles and diversity. This review provides an updated and comprehensive review of the field of nanoultrasonic biomedicine, and comprehensively discusses the progress of versatile ultrasonic disease treatments. Finally, the deep discussion on the facing challenges and prospects is expected to promote the emergence and establishment of a new branch of US biomedicine through the rational combination of nanomedicine and US clinical biomedicine.

         <title>Efficient Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Mixed Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells via Natural Tin Oxide Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrow&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films doped with SnOx exhibit improved film morphology, crystallization, optical properties, and more interestingly, an upshifted Fermi level. Consequently, SnOx&#8208;doped devices have considerably reduced defects and improved transport of major carriers, resulting in a maximum efficiency of 22.16% for Sn&#8208;Pb single&#8208;junction cells and a remarkable efficiency of 26.01% for two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) mixed tin/lead&#8208;based (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention for use in tandem solar cells. However, they are still plagued by serious carrier recombination due to inferior film properties resulting from the alloying of Sn with Pb elements, which leads to p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping behaviors. This work reports an effective tin oxide (SnOx) doping strategy to produce high&#8208;quality Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films for utilization in efficient single&#8208;junction and tandem PSCs. SnOx can be naturally oxidized from tin diiodide raw powders and successfully incorporated into Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films. Consequently, Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films doped with SnOx exhibit dramatically improved morphology, crystallization, absorption, and more interestingly, upward&#8208;shifted Fermi levels. The resulting narrow&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with natural SnOx doping have considerably reduced carrier recombination, therefore delivering a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16% for single&#8208;junction cells and a remarkable PCE of 26.01% (with a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 25.33%) for two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells. This work introduces a facile doping strategy for the manufacture of efficient single&#8208;junction narrow&#8208;bandgap PSCs and their tandem solar cells.

&lt;p&gt;Narrow-bandgap Sn-Pb perovskite films doped with SnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit improved film morphology, crystallization, optical properties, and more interestingly, an upshifted Fermi level. Consequently, SnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-doped devices have considerably reduced defects and improved transport of major carriers, resulting in a maximum efficiency of 22.16% for Sn-Pb single-junction cells and a remarkable efficiency of 26.01% for two-terminal all-perovskite tandem cells.

         <title>3D Optical Coherence Thermometry Using Polymeric Nanogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Translation of nanothermometry to the clinic faces limitations like lack of 3D thermal images and the need for tools that are clinically unavailable. To overcome them, optical coherence thermometry (OCTh) is developed by combining thermoresponsive nanogels with conventional optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems employed daily at hospitals. OCTh makes possible 3D thermal imaging of tissues subjected to photothermal processes.








Abstract
In nanothermometry, the use of nanoparticles as thermal probes enables remote and minimally invasive sensing. In the biomedical context, nanothermometry has emerged as a powerful tool where traditional approaches, like infrared thermal sensing and contact thermometers, fall short. Despite the strides of this technology in preclinical settings, nanothermometry is not mature enough to be translated to the bedside. This is due to two major hurdles: the inability to perform 3D&#160;thermal imaging and the requirement for tools that are readily available in the clinics. This work simultaneously overcomes both limitations by proposing the technology of optical coherence thermometry (OCTh). This is achieved by combining thermoresponsive polymeric nanogels and optical coherence tomography (OCT)&#8212;a 3D imaging technology routinely used in clinical practice. The volume phase transition of the thermoresponsive nanogels causes marked changes in their refractive index, making them temperature&#8208;sensitive OCT contrast agents. The ability of OCTh to provide 3D thermal images is demonstrated in tissue phantoms subjected to photothermal processes, and its reliability is corroborated by comparing experimental results with numerical simulations. The results included in this work set credible foundations for the implementation of nanothermometry in the form of OCTh in clinical practice.

         <title>Highly Reliable Textile&#8208;Type Memristor by Designing Aligned Nanochannels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly reliable textile&#8208;type memristor is fabricated by designing Pt/CuZnS memristive fiber with aligned nanochannels, showing small set voltage variation (&lt;5.6%) under ultralow set voltage (&#8776;0.089&#160;V). The resultant textile&#8208;type memristor array with high device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity could seamlessly unify with sensing, power&#8208;supplying, and displaying textiles/fibers to form all&#8208;textile integrated electronic systems for new&#8208;generation human&#8211;machine interactions.








Abstract
Information&#8208;processing devices are the core components of modern electronics. Integrating them into textiles is the indispensable demand for electronic textiles to form close&#8208;loop functional systems. Memristors with crossbar configuration are regarded as promising building blocks to design woven information&#8208;processing devices that seamlessly unify with textiles. However, the memristors always suffer from severe temporal and spatial variations due to the random growth of conductive filaments during filamentary switching processes. Here, inspired by the ion nanochannels across synaptic membranes, a highly reliable textile&#8208;type memristor made of Pt/CuZnS memristive fiber with aligned nanochannels, showing small set voltage variation (&lt;5.6%) under ultralow set voltage (&#8776;0.089&#160;V), high on/off ratio (&#8776;106), and low power consumption (0.1&#160;nW), is reported. Experimental evidence indicate that nanochannels with abundant active S defects can anchor silver ions and confine their migrations to form orderly and efficient conductive filaments. Such memristive performances enable the resultant textile&#8208;type memristor array to have high device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity and process complex physiological data like brainwave signals with high recognition accuracy (95%). The textile&#8208;type memristor arrays are mechanically durable to withstand hundreds of bending and sliding deformations, and seamlessly unified with sensing, power&#8208;supplying, and displaying textiles/fibers to form all&#8208;textile integrated electronic systems for new generation human&#8208;machine interactions.

         <title>Rocket&#8208;Inspired Effervescent Motors for Oral Macromolecule Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure and function of rockets, a novel micromotor delivery system is presented with scaled&#8208;down rocket&#8208;like architecture and effervescent&#8208;tablets&#8208;derived fuel for efficient oral macromolecule delivery by penetrating the intestinal barrier. It is demonstrated that these motors can efficiently move and stab into the intestinal mucosa for insulin delivery, exhibiting efficacy in regulating blood glucose level in a&#160;diabetic rabbit model.








Abstract
Oral administration is among the most convenient ways with good patient compliance for drug delivery; while it remains a challenge to achieve desirable bioavailability of most macromolecules due to the complex gastrointestinal barriers. Here, inspired by the structure and function of rocket, a novel micromotor delivery system is presented with scaled&#8208;down rocket&#8208;like architecture and effervescent&#8208;tablets&#8208;derived fuel for efficient oral macromolecule delivery by penetrating intestinal barrier. These rocket&#8208;inspired effervescent motors (RIEMs) are composed of sharp needle tips for both loading cargoes and efficient penetrating, and tail wings for loading effervescent powders and avoiding perforation. When exposed to a water environment, the effervescent fuel generates intensive CO2 bubbles to propel the RIEMs to move at high speed. Thus, the RIEMs with their sharp tip can inject into the surrounding mucosa for effective drug release. Furthermore, benefiting from their tail&#8208;wing design, perforation can be effectively avoided during the injection process, ensuring the safety of the RIEMs in gastrointestinal active delivery. Based on these advantages, it is demonstrated that the RIEMs can efficiently move and stab into the intestinal mucosa for insulin delivery, exhibiting efficacy in regulating blood sugar glucose in a diabetic rabbit model. These features indicate that these RIEMs are versatile and valuable for clinical oral delivery of macromolecules.

         <title>Single&#8208;Gate In&#8208;Transistor Readout of Current Superposition and Collapse Utilizing Quantum Tunneling and Ferroelectric Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superposition and collapse of nanostructured in&#8208;transistor current networks are demonstrated to be read and decoded by quantum tunneling and ferroelectric switching in gate&#8208;all&#8208;around polysilicon nanosheet arrays and planar&#8208;gated nanofilms. The drain current output is therefore endowed with polymorphism due to the interplay of the polysilicon and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanostructures.








Abstract
In nanostructure assemblies, the superposition of current paths forms microscopic electric circuits, and different circuit networks produce varying results, particularly when utilized as transistor channels for computing applications. However, the intricate nature of assembly networks and the winding paths of commensurate currents hinder standard circuit modeling. Inspired by the quantum collapse of superposition states for information decoding in quantum circuits, the implementation of analogous current path collapse to facilitate the detection of microscopic circuits by modifying their network topology is explored. Here, the superposition and collapse of current paths in gate&#8208;all&#8208;around polysilicon nanosheet arrays are demonstrated to enrich the computational resources within transistors by engineering the channel length and quantity. Switching the ferroelectric polarization of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 gate dielectric, which drives these transistors out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, decodes the output polymorphism through circuit topological modifications. Furthermore, a protocol for the single&#8208;electron readout of ferroelectric polarization is presented with tailoring the channel coherence. The introduction of lateral path superposition results into intriguing metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transitions due to transient behavior of ferroelectric switching. This ability to adjust the current networks within transistors and their interaction with ferroelectric polarization in polycrystalline nanostructures lays the groundwork for generating diverse current characteristics as potential physical databases for optimization&#8208;based computing.

         <title>Charge Concentration Limits the Hydrogen Evolution Rate in Organic Nanoparticle Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity shows that the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by aqueous&#8208;soluble organic donor&#8211;acceptor nanoparticles is limited by charge concentration, and that nanoparticles have 3&#215; more long&#8208;lived accumulated charges relative to bulk samples of the same material composition.








Abstract
Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity is used to compare aqueous&#8208;soluble organic nanoparticle photocatalysts and bulk thin films composed of the same mixture of semiconducting polymer and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor molecule and the relationship between composition, interfacial surface area, charge&#8208;carrier dynamics, and photocatalytic activity is examined. The rate of hydrogen evolution reaction by nanoparticles composed of various donor:acceptor blend ratio compositions is quantitatively measured, and it is found that the most active blend ratio displays a hydrogen quantum yield of 0.83% per photon. Moreover, it is found that nanoparticle photocatalytic activity corresponds directly to charge generation, and that nanoparticles have 3&#215; more long&#8208;lived accumulated charges relative to bulk samples of the same material composition. These results suggest that, under the current reaction conditions, with &#8776;3&#215; solar flux, catalytic activity by the nanoparticles is limited by the concentration of electrons and holes in operando and not a finite number of active surface sites or the catalytic rate at the interface. This provides a clear design goal for the next generation of efficient photocatalytic nanoparticles.

         <title>Separating Crystal Growth from Nucleation Enables the In Situ Controllable Synthesis of Nanocrystals for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylic acid&#8208;containing ammonium ligands separate nucleation and crystal growth in in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed perovskite nanocrystals, enabling quantum&#8208;confined nanocrystals with narrow size distributions. Deprotonated phosphonates further enhance photoluminescence quantum yields to unity through defect passivation. These allow for perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with a maximum current efficiency of 109&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1 and a 45.6 h operating half&#8208;time with an initial brightness of 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) display bright luminescence for light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) applications; however, they require post&#8208;synthesis ligand exchange that may cause surface degradation and defect formation. In situ&#8208;formed PNCs achieve improved surface passivation using a straightforward synthetic approach, but their LED performance at the green wavelength is not yet comparable with that of colloidal PNC devices. Here, it is found that the limitations of in situ&#8208;formed PNCs stem from uncontrolled formation kinetics: conventional surface ligands confine perovskite nuclei but fail to delay crystal growth. A bifunctional carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;containing ammonium hydrobromide ligand that separates crystal growth from nucleation is introduced, leading to the formation of quantum&#8208;confined PNC solids exhibiting a narrow size distribution. Controlled crystallization is further coupled with defect passivation using deprotonated phosphinates, enabling improvements in photoluminescence quantum yield to near unity. Green LEDs are fabricated with a maximum current efficiency of 109&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1 and an average external quantum efficiency of 22.5% across 25 devices, exceeding the performance of their colloidal PNC&#8208;based counterparts. A 45.6 h operating half&#8208;time is further documented for an unencapsulated device in N2 with an initial brightness of 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Formation of Amorphous Iron&#8208;Calcium Phosphate with High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;bearing amorphous calcium phosphate (Fe&#8208;ACP) is prepared in the presence of ammonium iron citrate. The Fe&#8208;ACP particles can be highly stable in water and simulated body fluid. The particles show good biocompatibility and osteogenic properties. By applying the Fe&#8208;ACP particles as initial powders, calcium iron phosphate ceramics with superior mechanical strength and acid resistance are prepared.








Abstract
Amorphous iron&#8208;calcium phosphate (Fe&#8208;ACP) plays a vital role in the mechanical properties of teeth of some rodents, which are very hard, but its formation process and synthetic route remain unknown. Here, the synthesis and characterization of an iron&#8208;bearing amorphous calcium phosphate in the presence of ammonium iron citrate (AIC) are reported. The iron is distributed homogeneously on the nanometer scale in the resulting particles. The prepared Fe&#8208;ACP particles can be highly stable in aqueous media, including water, simulated body fluid, and acetate buffer solution (pH 4). In vitro study demonstrates that these particles have good biocompatibility and osteogenic properties. Subsequently, Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) is utilized to consolidate the initial Fe&#8208;ACP powders. The results show that the hardness of the ceramics increases with the increase of iron content, but an excess of iron leads to a rapid decline in hardness. Calcium iron phosphate ceramics with a hardness of 4&#160;GPa can be achieved, which is higher than that of human enamel. Furthermore, the ceramics composed of iron&#8208;calcium phosphates show enhanced acid resistance. This study provides a novel route to prepare Fe&#8208;ACP, and presents the potential role of Fe&#8208;ACP in biomineralization and as starting material to fabricate acid&#8208;resistant high&#8208;performance bioceramics.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning&#8208;Enabled Intelligent Design of Thermal Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep&#8208;learning&#8208;enabled intelligent design method of thermal metamaterials is proposed by using a deep generative model. To realize automatic, real&#8208;time, and customizable design of thermal metamaterials, this framework is constructed via a pre&#8208;trained deep learning model to achieve an end&#8208;to&#8208;end mapping relationship between thermal response and microstructure, which provides great flexibility in the on&#8208;demand inverse design of thermal metamaterials.








Abstract
Thermal metamaterials are mixture&#8208;based materials that are engineered to manipulate, control, and process the flow of heat, enabling numerous advanced thermal metadevices. Conventional thermal metamaterials are predominantly designed with tractable regular geometries owing to the delicate analytical solution and easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement effective structures. Nevertheless, it is challenging to achieve the design of thermal metamaterials with arbitrary geometry, letting alone intelligent (automatic, real&#8208;time, and customizable) design of thermal metamaterials. Here, an intelligent design framework of thermal metamaterials is presented via a pre&#8208;trained deep learning model, which gracefully achieves the desired functional structures of thermal metamaterials with exceptional speed and efficiency, regardless of arbitrary geometry. It possesses incomparable versatility and is of great flexibility to achieve the corresponding design of thermal metamaterials with different background materials, anisotropic geometries, and thermal functionalities. The transformation thermotics&#8208;induced, freeform, background&#8208;independent, and omnidirectional thermal cloaks, whose structural configurations are automatically designed in real&#8208;time according to shape and background, are numerically and experimentally demonstrated. This study sets up a novel paradigm for an automatic and real&#8208;time design of thermal metamaterials in a new design scenario. More generally, it may open a door to the realization of an intelligent design of metamaterials in also other physical domains.

         <title>Dendritic Solid Polymer Electrolytes: A New Paradigm for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the review, it is not only focused on reviewing dendritic polymer electrolytes (PEs) in basic concept, synthesis methodologies, balancing of properties, ion transport mechanism, etc. but also try to outline the possibility of dendritic PEs toward on&#8208;demand design. It is believed that including examples of designing advanced/safe dendritic PEs will show the readers a more comprehensive prospect of this burgeoning field.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ions battery is widely used and recognized, but its energy density based on organic electrolytes has approached the theoretical upper limit, while the use of organic electrolytes also brings some safety hazards (leakage and flammability). Polymer electrolytes (PEs) are expected to fundamentally solve the safety problem and improve energy density. Therefore, Li&#8208;ions battery based on solid PE has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, low ionic conductivity and poor mechanical properties, as well as a narrow electrochemical window limit its further development. Dendritic PEs with unique topology structure has low crystallinity, high segmental mobility, and reduced chain entanglement, providing a new avenue for designing high&#8208;performance PEs. In this review, the basic concept and synthetic chemistry of dendritic polymers are first introduced. Then, this story will turn to how to balance the mechanical properties, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical stability of dendritic PEs from synthetic chemistry. In addition, accomplishments on dendritic PEs based on different synthesis strategies and recent advances in battery applications are summarized and discussed. Subsequently, the ionic transport mechanism and interfacial interaction are deeply analyzed. In the end, the challenges and prospects are outlined to promote further development in this booming field.

&lt;p&gt;In the review, it is not only focused on reviewing dendritic polymer electrolytes (PEs) in basic concept, synthesis methodologies, balancing of properties, ion transport mechanism, etc. but also try to outline the possibility of dendritic PEs toward on-demand design. It is believed that including examples of designing advanced/safe dendritic PEs will show the readers a more comprehensive prospect of this burgeoning field.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li-ions battery is widely used and recognized, but its energy density based on organic electrolytes has approached the theoretical upper limit, while the use of organic electrolytes also brings some safety hazards (leakage and flammability). Polymer electrolytes (PEs) are expected to fundamentally solve the safety problem and improve energy density. Therefore, Li-ions battery based on solid PE has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, low ionic conductivity and poor mechanical properties, as well as a narrow electrochemical window limit its further development. Dendritic PEs with unique topology structure has low crystallinity, high segmental mobility, and reduced chain entanglement, providing a new avenue for designing high-performance PEs. In this review, the basic concept and synthetic chemistry of dendritic polymers are first introduced. Then, this story will turn to how to balance the mechanical properties, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical stability of dendritic PEs from synthetic chemistry. In addition, accomplishments on dendritic PEs based on different synthesis strategies and recent advances in battery applications are summarized and discussed. Subsequently, the ionic transport mechanism and interfacial interaction are deeply analyzed. In the end, the challenges and prospects are outlined to promote further development in this booming field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Augmenting Immunogenic Cell Death and Alleviating Myeloid&#8208;Derived Suppressor Cells by Sono&#8208;Activatable Semiconducting Polymer Nanopartners for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sono&#8208;activatable semiconducting polymer nanopartner is reported to overcome post&#8208;treatment hypoxia and target myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells for cancer immunotherapy. The release of drug partners in tumor microenvironment is precisely controlled by ultrasound activation, augmenting immunogenic cell death, and alleviating myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells simultaneously. This sono&#8208;activatable immunotherapeutic strategy greatly amplifies immunological effect for inhibiting bilateral tumor growths and preventing tumor metastases.








Abstract
Inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) by sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is promising for cancer immunotherapy, which however is inefficient due to oxygen depletion that compromises SDT effect and mediates recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The fabrication of sono&#8208;activatable semiconducting polymer nanopartners (SPNTi) to simultaneously augment ICD and alleviate MDSCs for immunotherapy is reported. A sonodynamic semiconducting polymer, hydrophobic hypoxia&#8208;responsive tirapazamine (TPZ)&#8208;conjugate, and MDSC&#8208;targeting drug (ibrutinib) are encapsulated inside such SPNTi with surface shell of a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;cleavable amphiphilic polymer. TPZ and ibrutinib serve as drug partners to enlarge immunotherapeutic effect. Upon sono&#8208;activation, SPNTi generate 1O2 to break 1O2&#8208;cleavable polymers for in situ liberations of TPZ&#8208;conjugate and ibrutinib in tumor sites, and oxygen is consumed to create severe hypoxic tumor microenvironment, in which, TPZ&#8208;conjugate is activated for augmenting ICD action, while ibrutinib alleviates MDSCs for promoting antitumor immunological effect. In a bilateral tumor mouse model, SPNTi&#8208;mediated sono&#8208;activatable immunotherapy results in growth restraints of primary and distant tumors and noteworthy precaution of tumor metastases. This study thus provides a sono&#8208;activatable immunotherapeutic strategy with high precision and safety for cancer via overcoming post&#8208;treatment hypoxia and targeting MDSCs.

A versatile molecule featured by aggregation&#8208;induced emission, namely DHTDP, synchronously enabling second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence and efficient photothermal conversion is developed elaborately. By camouflaging DHTDP nanoparticles with cancer cell membrane, the resultant biomimetic nanoparticles exhibit significantly facilitated delivery efficiency and homologous targeting capability, successfully achieving precise imaging and maximized therapeutic outcomes via trimodal imaging (NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8211;photoacoustic&#8211;photothermal imaging) guided photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Multimodal phototheranostics on the basis of a single molecule with one&#8208;for&#8208;all characteristics represents a convenient approach for effective cancer treatment. In this report, a versatile molecule featured by aggregation&#8208;induced emission, namely DHTDP, synchronously enabling second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence emission and efficient photothermal conversion is developed by elaborate structural modulation. By camouflaging DHTDP nanoparticles with cancer cell membrane, the resultant biomimetic nanoparticles exhibit significantly both facilitated delivery efficiency and homologous targeting capability, and afford precise imaging guidance and maximize therapeutic outcomes in form of NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (FLI)&#8211;photoacoustic imaging (PAI)&#8211;photothermal imaging (PTI) trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT). This study presents the first example of biomimetic multimodal phototheranostics loaded by homogeneity&#8208;targeting cell membrane, thus brings a new insight into the exploration of superior phototheranostics for practical cancer theranostics.

         <title>Phonon Polaritonics in Broad Terahertz Frequency Range with Quantum Paraelectric SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quantum paraelectric SrTiO3 offers low&#8208;loss, ultra&#8208;broadband, and temperature insensitive phonon&#8211;polaritons in the frequency range of 7&#8211;13&#160;THz within the &#8220;new terahertz gap&#8221;. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept phonon&#8211;polaritonic concentrators are experimentally realized to enhance electric field to the order of GV m&#8208;1 over a large volume resolvable by far&#8208;field optics for potential applications in non&#8208;equilibrium quantum materials and infrared molecular spectroscopy.








Abstract
Photonics in the frequency range of 5&#8211;15&#160;terahertz (THz) potentially open a new realm of quantum materials manipulation and biosensing. This range, sometimes called &#8220;the new terahertz gap&#8221;, is traditionally difficult to access due to prevalent phonon absorption bands in solids. Low&#8208;loss phonon&#8211;polariton materials may realize sub&#8208;wavelength, on&#8208;chip photonic devices, but typically operate in mid&#8208;infrared frequencies with narrow bandwidths and are difficult to manufacture on a large scale. Here, for the first time, quantum paraelectric SrTiO3 enables broadband surface phonon&#8211;polaritonic devices in 7&#8211;13&#160;THz. As a proof of concept, polarization&#8208;independent field concentrators are designed and fabricated to locally enhance intense, multicycle THz pulses by a factor of 6 and increase the spectral intensity by over 90 times. The time&#8208;resolved electric field inside the concentrators is experimentally measured by THz&#8208;field&#8208;induced second harmonic generation. Illuminated by a table&#8208;top light source, the average field reaches 0.5&#160;GV&#160;m&#8722;1 over a large volume resolvable by far&#8208;field optics. These&#160;results potentially enable scalable THz photonics with high breakdown fields made of various commercially available phonon&#8211;polariton crystals for studying driven phases in quantum materials and nonlinear molecular spectroscopy.

         <title>Solid&#8211;Liquid Crystal Biphasic Ferroelectrics with Tunable Biferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholestanyl 4&#8208;X&#8208;benzoate (X = Cl, Br, and&#160;I) shows ferroelectricity in solid and liquid&#8208;crystal phases, distinct from traditional ferroelectrics with either solid or liquid&#8208;crystal ferroelectric phases. Its solid&#8211;solid and solid&#8211;liquid crystal transition temperature (TS&#8211;S and TS&#8211;LC) and spontaneous polarization in solid and liquid&#8208;crystal phases can be regulated by halogen substitutions, which are unprecedented in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity has been separately found in numerous solid and liquid crystal materials since its first discovery in 1920. However, a single material with biferroelectricity existing in both solid and liquid crystal phases is very rare, and the regulation of biferroelectricity has never been studied. Here, solid&#8211;liquid crystal biphasic ferroelectrics, cholestanyl 4&#8208;X&#8208;benzoate (4X&#8208;CB, X = Cl, Br, and I), which exhibits biferroelectricity in both the solid and liquid crystal phases, is presented. It is noted that the ferroelectric liquid crystal phase of 4X&#8208;CB is a cholesteric one, distinct from the ordinary chiral smectic ferroelectric liquid crystal phase. Moreover, 4X&#8208;CB shows solid&#8211;solid and solid&#8211;liquid crystal phase transitions, of which the transition temperatures gradually increase from Cl to Br to I substitution. The spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 4X&#8208;CB in both solid and liquid crystal phases can also be regulated by different halogen substitutions, where the 4Br&#8208;CB has the optimal Ps because of the larger molecular dipole moment. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, 4X&#8208;CB is the first ferroelectric with tunable biferroelectricity, which offers a feasible case for the performance optimization of solid&#8211;liquid crystal biphasic ferroelectrics.

         <title>Intrinsic Descriptor Guided Noble Metal Cathode Design for Li&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsic descriptor &#966; is discovered to predict high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2 battery cathode materials, which is experimentally verified and effectively guides the design of Pd@graphene catalyst with an ultralow overpotential (0.41&#160;V) and superior cycling performance up to 1400&#160;h.








Abstract
To date, the effect of noble metal (NM) electronic structures on CO2 reaction activity remains unknown, and explicit screening criteria are still lacking for designing highly efficient catalysts in CO2&#8208;breathing batteries. Herein, by preferentially considering the decomposition of key intermediate Li2CO3, an intrinsic descriptor constituted of the dx2&#8722;y2${{\rm{d}}}_{{x}^2 - {y}^2}$ orbital states and the electronegativity for predicting high&#8208;performance cathode material are discovered. As a demonstration, a series of graphene&#8208;supported noble metals (NM@G) as cathodes are fabricated via a fast laser scribing technique. Consistent with the preliminary prediction, Pd@G exhibits an ultralow overpotential (0.41&#160;V), along with superior cycling performance up to 1400&#160;h. Moreover, the overall thermodynamic reaction pathways on NM@G confirm the reliability of the established intrinsic descriptor. This basic finding of the relationship between the electronic properties of noble metal cathodes and the performance of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries provides a novel avenue for designing remarkably efficient cathode materials for metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Isotope Exchange Raman Spectroscopy (IERS): A Novel Technique to Probe Physicochemical Processes In Situ</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in situ technique for the direct characterization of mass&#8208;transport properties is presented, which is based on the coupling of Raman spectroscopy to isothermal isotope exchanges. Its original concept and unique strengths are demonstrated by studying Gd&#8208;doped ceria thin films. It is a new, rapid, cheap, and non&#8208;destructive approach to make O&#8208;transport visible that can be readily expanded to many laboratories worldwide.








Abstract
A novel in situ methodology for the direct study of mass&#8208;transport properties in oxides with spatial and unprecedented time resolution, based on Raman spectroscopy coupled to isothermal isotope exchanges, is developed. Changes in the isotope concentration, resulting in a Raman frequency shift, can be followed in real time, which is not accessible by conventional methods, enabling complementary insights for the study of ion&#8208;transport properties of electrode and electrolyte materials for advanced solid&#8208;state electrochemical devices. The proof of concept and strengths of isotope exchange Raman spectroscopy (IERS) is demonstrated by studying the oxygen isotope back&#8208;exchange in gadolinium&#8208;doped ceria (CGO) thin films. Resulting oxygen self&#8208;diffusion and surface exchange coefficients are compared to conventional time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) characterization and literature values, showing good agreement, while at the same time providing additional insight, challenging established assumptions. IERS captivates through its rapidity, simple setup, non&#8208;destructive nature, cost effectiveness, and versatile fields of application and thus can readily be integrated as new standard tool for in situ and operando characterization in many laboratories worldwide. The applicability of this method is expected to consolidate the&#160;understanding of elementary physicochemical processes and impact various emerging fields including solid oxide cells, battery research, and&#160;beyond.

         <title>On the Mechanism of Solvents Catalyzed Structural Transformation in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of 2D&#8211;3D structural transformation in metal halide compounds, in presence of protic solvents is elucidated. Hydrogen bonds between&#160;the solvent and different anions dictate the catalytic function, and the barrier reduction to allow the structural transformation. Interesting grain centers and grain boundaries are transformed differently, allowing design of artificial heterostructures.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites show the capability of performing structural transformation, allowing the formation of functional heterostructures. Unfortunately, the elusive mechanism governing these transformations limits their technological application. Herein, the mechanism of 2D&#8211;3D structural transformation is unraveled as catalyzed by solvents. By combining a spatial&#8208;temporal cation interdiffusivity simulation with experimental findings, it is&#160;validated that, protic solvents foster the dissociation degree of formadinium iodide (FAI) via dynamic hydrogen bond, then the stronger hydrogen bond of phenylethylamine (PEA) cation with selected solvents compared to dissociated FA cation facilitates 2D&#8211;3D transformation from (PEA)2PbI4 to FAPbI3. It is&#160;discovered that, the energy barrier of PEA out&#8208;diffusion and the lateral transition barrier of inorganic slab are diminished. For 2D films the protic solvents catalyze grain centers (GCs) and grain boundaries (GBs) transforme into 3D phases and quasi&#8208;2D phases, respectively. While in the solvent&#8208;free case, GCs transform into 3D&#8211;2D heterostructures along the direction perpendicular to the substrate, and most GBs evolve into 3D phases. Finally, memristor devices fabricated using the transformed films uncover that, GBs composed of 3D phases are more prone to ion migration. This work elucidates the fundamental mechanism of structural transformation in metal halide perovskites, allowing their use to fabricate complex heterostructures.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution, Highly Transparent, and Efficient Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of electrostatic force&#8208;induced deposition (EF&#8208;ID) is proposed by introducing alternating polyethyleneimine and fluorosilane patterns to synergistically improve the quantum dot (QD) pattern pixel accuracy, boost device transmittance, and reduce the device leakage current, which enables high resolution ranging from 1104 to 3031 PPI and a high efficiency of 15.6%, as well as highly transparent quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) with a high transmittance of 90.7%, indicating an effective approach for high&#8208;resolution QLEDs with high efficiency and transparency.








Abstract
Aiming at next&#8208;generation displays, high&#8208;resolution quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) with high efficiency and transparency are highly desired. However, there is limited study involving the improvements of QLED pixel resolution, efficiency, and transparency simultaneously, which undoubtedly restricts the practical applications of QLED for next&#8208;generation displays. Here, the strategy of electrostatic force&#8208;induced deposition (EF&#8208;ID) is proposed by introducing alternating polyethyleneimine (PEI) and fluorosilane patterns to synergistically improve the pixel accuracy and transmittance of QD patterns. More importantly, the leakage current induced by the void spaces between pixels that is usually reported for high&#8208;resolution QLEDs is greatly suppressed by substrate&#8208;assisted insulating fluorosilane patterns. Finally, high&#8208;performance QLEDs with high resolution ranging from 1104 to 3031 pixels per inch (PPI) and a high efficiency of 15.6% are achieved, among the best performances of high resolution QLEDs. Notably, the high resolution QD pixels greatly enhance the transmittance of the QD patterns, thus prompting an impressive transmittance of 90.7% for the transparent QLEDs (2116 PPI), which represents the highest transmittance of transparent QLED devices. Consequently, this work contributes an effective and general approach for high&#8208;resolution QLEDs with high efficiency and transparency.

         <title>Modulating The D&#8208;Band Center Enables Ultrafine Pt3Fe Alloy Nanoparticles for Ph&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
By providing dual active sites to synergistically accelerate the H2O dissociation and H+ reduction, ordered intermetallic alloys usually show extraordinary performance for pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, activated N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres&#8208;supported intermetallic Pt3Fe alloys (Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A) as a highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal HER is reported. The Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A exhibits low overpotential (&#951;10) of 13, 29, and 48&#160;mV to deliver 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4, 1.0&#160;M KOH, and 1.0&#160;M phosphate buffered solution (PBS), respectively, as well as robust stability to maintain the overall catalytic performances. Theoretical studies reveal that the strong Pt 5d&#8722;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions negatively shift the d&#8208;band center of Pt 5d orbital, resulting in reduced H* adsorption energy of Pt sites and enhanced acidic HER activity. With Pt and Fe acting as co&#8208;adsorption sites for H* and *OH intermediates, respectively, a low energy barrier is required for Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A to dissociate the H2O to afford H* intermediates, which greatly promotes the H* intermediates adsorption and H2 formation in alkaline and neutral conditions. The synthetic strategy is further extended to the synthesis of Pt3Co and Pt3Ni alloys with excellent HER activity in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes, demonstrating the great potential of these Pt&#8208;based alloys for practical applications.

The Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe/NMCS-A exhibits low overpotential (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) of 13, 29, and 48&#160;mV to deliver 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 0.5&#160;M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.0&#160;M KOH, and 1.0&#160;M phosphate buffered solution (PBS), respectively, as well as robust stability to maintain the overall catalytic performances. Theoretical studies reveal that the strong Pt 5&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;Fe 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbital electronic interactions negatively shift the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center of Pt 5&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbital, resulting in reduced H* adsorption energy of Pt sites and enhanced acidic HER activity. With Pt and Fe acting as co-adsorption sites for H* and *OH intermediates, respectively, a low energy barrier is required for Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe/NMCS-A to dissociate the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to afford H* intermediates, which greatly promotes the H* intermediates adsorption and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation in alkaline and neutral conditions. The synthetic strategy is further extended to the synthesis of Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Co and Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni alloys with excellent HER activity in pH-universal electrolytes, demonstrating the great potential of these Pt-based alloys for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Soft robots are composed of compliant materials that facilitate high degrees of freedom, shape&#8208;change adaptability, and safer interaction with humans. An attractive choice of material for soft robotics is crosslinked networks of liquid crystal polymers (LCNs), as they are responsive to a wide variety of external stimuli and capable of undergoing fast, programmable, complex shape morphing, which allows for their use in a wide range soft robotic applications. However, unlike hydrogels, another popular material in soft robotics, LCNs have limited applicability in flooded or aquatic environments. This can be attributed not only to the poor efficiency of common LCN actuation methods underwater but also to the complicated relationship between LCNs and water. In this review, we elaborate on the relationship between water and LCNs and survey the existing body of literature where LCNs, both hygroscopic and non&#8208;hygroscopic, are utilized in aquatic soft robotic applications. We then discuss the challenges LCNs face in widespread adaptation to aquatic soft robotic applications and, finally, envisage possible paths forward for their successful use in aquatic environments.

         <title>Indirect Electrocatalysis S&#8208;N/S&#8208;S Bond Construction by Robust Polyoxometalate Based Foams</title>

Abstract
Indirect electrocatalytic conversion of cheap organic raw materials via the activation of S&#8208;H and N&#8208;H bonds into the value&#8208;added S&#8208;N/S&#8208;S bonds chemicals for industrial rubber production is a promising strategy to realize the atomic economic reaction, during which the kinetic inhibition that is associated with the electron transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface in traditional direct electrocatalysis can be eliminated to achieve higher performance. Here, for the first time, a series of di&#8208;copper substituted phosphotungstate based foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) have been fabricated with tunable loadings (17 to 44 wt%) that can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides. Specifically, the optimal PW10Cu2@CMC (44 wt%) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the construction of S&#8208;N/S&#8208;S bonds (yields up to 99%) coupling with the efficient production of H2 (&#8764;50&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Remarkably, it enables the scale&#8208;up production (&#8764;14.4&#160;g in a batch&#8208;experiment) and the obtained products can serve as rubber vulcanization accelerators with superior properties to traditional industrial rubber additives in real industrial processes. This powerful catalysis system that can simultaneously produce rubber vulcanization accelerator and H2 might inaugurate a new electrocatalytic avenue to explore polyoxometalate&#8208;based foam catalysts in electrocatalysis field.

         <title>A Computationally Assisted Approach for Designing Wearable Biosensors toward Non&#8208;Invasive Personalized Molecular Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated computational framework named QuantumDock is developed for universal molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) development toward a variety of wearable biosensing applications. QuantumDock employs molecular docking and density functional theory to probe the molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules, optimizing the selectivity of the MIP biosensor for the wearable analysis of a wide range of biomarkers. (e.g., phenylalanine).








Abstract
Wearable sweat sensors have the potential to revolutionize precision medicine as they can non&#8208;invasively collect molecular information closely associated with an individual's health status. However, the majority of clinically relevant biomarkers cannot be continuously detected in situ using existing wearable approaches. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are a promising candidate to address this challenge but haven't yet gained widespread use due to their complex design and optimization process yielding variable selectivity. Here, QuantumDock is introduced, an automated computational framework for universal MIP development toward wearable applications. QuantumDock utilizes density functional theory to probe molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules to optimize selectivity, a fundamentally limiting factor for MIP development toward wearable sensing. A molecular docking approach is employed to explore a wide range of known and unknown monomers, and to identify the optimal monomer/cross&#8208;linker choice for subsequent MIP fabrication. Using an essential amino acid phenylalanine as the exemplar, experimental validation of QuantumDock is performed successfully using solution&#8208;synthesized MIP nanoparticles coupled with ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy. Moreover, a QuantumDock&#8208;optimized graphene&#8208;based wearable device is designed that can perform autonomous sweat induction, sampling, and sensing. For the first time, wearable non&#8208;invasive phenylalanine monitoring is demonstrated in human subjects toward personalized healthcare applications.

         <title>Large Anomalous Nernst Effects at Room Temperature in Fe3Pt Thin films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the discovery of a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) of Syx &#8776; 2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in ferromagnetic Fe3Pt, which also shows a remarkable coercive field of about 1300&#160;Oe. The results highlight the important roles of both Berry curvature and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in achieving large ANE without an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Heat current in ferromagnets can generate a transverse electric voltage perpendicular to magnetization, known as anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). ANE originates intrinsically from the combination of large Berry curvature and density of states near the Fermi energy. It shows technical advantages over the conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect in converting waste heat to electricity due to its unique transverse geometry. However, materials showing giant ANE remain to be explored. Herein,&#160;&#160;a large ANE thermopower of Syx &#8776; 2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in ferromagnetic Fe3Pt epitaxial films is reported, which also show a giant transverse thermoelectric conductivity of &#945;yx &#8776; 4 A K&#8722;1&#160;m&#8722;1 and a remarkable coercive field of 1300&#160;Oe. The theoretical analysis reveals that the strong spin&#8208;orbit interaction in addition to the hybridization between Pt 5d and Fe 3d electrons leads to a series of distinct energy gaps and large Berry curvature in the Brillouin zone, which is the key for the large ANE. These results highlight the important roles of both Berry curvature and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in achieving large ANE at zero magnetic field, providing pathways to explore materials with giant transverse thermoelectric effect without an external magnetic field.

         <title>Ion Tunnel Matrix Initiated Oriented Attachment for Highly Utilized Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of &#8220;trapping&#8208;then&#8208;planting&#8221; oriented&#8208;attached deposition is demonstrated toward high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;metal anode battery. Stable zinc plating/stripping for 6600 cycles (1320 h) at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% with a rigorous 100% ZUR (zinc utilization ratio) protocol are realized. Moreover, an anode&#8208;limited pouch cell with a low N/P of 1.2 that displays an energy density of 214&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 is constructed; this greatly exceeds commercial aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Metallic zinc is an ideal anode for aqueous energy storage; however, Zn anodes suffer from nonhomogeneous deposition, low reversibility, and dendrite formation; these lead to an overprovision of zinc metal in full cells.

     alt="Ion Tunnel Matrix Initiated Oriented Attachment for Highly Utilized Zn Anodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy of &#8220;trapping-then-planting&#8221; oriented-attached deposition is demonstrated toward high-performance zinc-metal anode battery. Stable zinc plating/stripping for 6600 cycles (1320 h) at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% with a rigorous 100% ZUR (zinc utilization ratio) protocol are realized. Moreover, an anode-limited pouch cell with a low N/P of 1.2 that displays an energy density of 214&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is constructed; this greatly exceeds commercial aqueous batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metallic zinc is an ideal anode for aqueous energy storage; however, Zn anodes suffer from nonhomogeneous deposition, low reversibility, and dendrite formation; these lead to an overprovision of zinc metal in full cells. Herein, oriented-attachment-regulated Zn stacking initiated through a trapping-then-planting process with a high zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is reported. Due to the isometric topology features of cubic-type Prussian blue analog (PBA), the initial Zn plating occurs at specific sites with equal spacing of &#8776;5&#160;&#197; in the direction perpendicular to the substrate; the trace amount of zinc ions trapped in tunnel matrix provides nuclei for the oriented attachment of Zn (002) deposits. As a result, the PBA-decorated substrate delivers high reversibility of dendrite-free zinc plating/stripping for more than 6600 cycles (1320&#160;h) and achieves an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5% at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 100% ZUR. Moreover, the anode-limited full cell with a low negative&#8211;positive electrode ratio (N/P) of 1.2 can be operated stably for 360 cycles, displaying an energy density of 214&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;; this greatly exceeds commercial aqueous batteries. This work provides a proof of concept design of metal anodes with a high utilization ratio and a practical method for developing high-energy-density batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Ultrastable Ultrathin Black Phosphorus Nanodisks Hybridized with Fe3O4 Nanoclusters and Iron (V)&#8208;Oxo Complex for Efficient Potassium Storage</title>

Ultrathin black phosphorus nanodisks hybridized with Fe3O4 nanoclusters and iron (V)&#8208;oxo complex are rationally synthesized, and shown to exhibit ultrahigh stability in humid air, and competitive electrochemical potassium storage properties benefiting from unique structural and compositional merits.








Abstract
The practical&#160;application of metalloid black phosphorus (BP) based anodes for potassium ion batteries is mainly impeded by its instability in air and irreversible/sluggish potassium storage behaviors. Herein, a 2D composite is purposefully conceptualized, where ultrathin BP nanodisks with Fe3O4 nanoclusters are hybridized with Lewis acid iron (V)&#8208;oxo complex (FC) nanosheets (denoted as BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC). The introduced electron coordinate bridge between FC and BP, and hydrophobic surface of FC synergistically assure that BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC is ultrastable in humid air. With the purposeful structural and componential design, the resultant BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC anode is endowed with appealing electrochemical performance in terms of reversible capacity, rate behavior, and long&#8208;duration cycling stability in both half and full cells. Furthermore, the underlying formation and potassium&#8208;storage mechanisms of BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC are tentatively proposed. The in&#8208;depth insights here will provide a crucial understanding in rational exploration of advanced anodes for next&#8208;generation PIBs.

         <title>Synergistic Modification of 2D Perovskite with Alternating Cations in the Interlayer Space and Multisite Ligand toward High&#8208;Performance Inverted Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic modulation strategy of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite with alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) and multisite ligand 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (MTD) is proposed to fabricate high&#8208;quality methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite films. The significantly inhibited nonradiative recombination enables the realization of high&#8208;efficiency inverted devices with a fascinating power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.58%, which is one of the highest PCEs reported for inverted devices.








Abstract
The preparation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films is key to realize efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells. The trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination at grain boundary (GB) and surface poses a serious challenge for fabricating high&#8208;quality perovskite films. Here, a synergistic modulation strategy of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite with alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) and multisite ligand 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (MTD) for fabricating high&#8208;quality methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite films is reported. The formation of ACI 2D perovskite promotes the nucleation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites, suppresses the generation of yellow phase, and promotes the formation of black phase, leading to increased grain size and crystallinity. Due to the synergistic effect of ACI 2D perovskite and MTD, the defects at GBs and surface are healed simultaneously. The significantly inhibited nonradiative recombination enables realization of high&#8208;efficiency inverted devices with a fascinating power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.58%, which is one of the highest PCEs reported for inverted devices. The synergistically modified unsealed device demonstrates an excellent long&#8208;term ambient stability, retaining 90.5% of its initial PCE after 3000&#160;h under a relative humidity of 30&#8211;40%. This work provides deep insights into minimizing nonradiative recombination losses through the rational synergistic engineering of GB and surface toward efficient and stable inverted devices.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Mechanical Bilayer Metamaterial with Global Area&#8208;Preserving Density Tunability for Acoustic Wave Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented 2D metamaterial consists of two layers that are actuated separately by a remotely applied magnetic field. This novel bilayer design strategy enables the adjustment of the area density while simultaneously preserving the overall dimensions. These designs can be further exploited in acoustic applications, including highly tunable bandgaps and waveguides.








Abstract
2D metamaterials have immense potential in acoustics, optics, and electromagnetic applications due to their unique properties and ability to conform to curved substrates. Active metamaterials have attracted significant research attention because of their on&#8208;demand tunable properties and performances through shape reconfigurations. 2D active metamaterials often achieve active properties through internal structural deformations, which lead to changes in overall dimensions. This demands corresponding alterations of the conforming substrate, or the metamaterial fails to provide complete area coverage, which can be a significant limitation for their practical applications. To date, achieving area&#8208;preserving active 2D metamaterials with distinct shape reconfigurations remains a prominent challenge. In this paper, magneto&#8208;mechanical bilayer metamaterials are presented that demonstrate area density tunability with area&#8208;preserving capability. The bilayer metamaterials consist of two arrays of magnetic soft materials with distinct magnetization distributions. Under a magnetic field, each layer behaves differently, which allows the metamaterial to reconfigure its shape into multiple modes and to significantly tune its area density without changing its overall dimensions. The area&#8208;preserving multimodal shape reconfigurations are further exploited as active acoustic wave regulators to tune bandgaps and wave propagations. The bilayer approach thus provides a new concept for the design of area&#8208;preserving active metamaterials for broader applications.

         <title>Implantable, Biodegradable, and Wireless Triboelectric Devices for Cancer Therapy Through Disrupting Microtubule and Actins Dynamics</title>

Abstract
Electric field&#8208;based stimulation is emerging as a new cancer therapeutic modality through interfering with cell mitosis. To address its limitations of complicated wire connections, bulky devices, and coarse spatial resolution, we propose an improved and alternative method for wirelessly delivering electrical stimulation into tumor tissues through designing an implantable, biodegradable and wirelessly controlled therapeutic triboelectric nanogenerator (ET&#8208;TENG). With the excitation of ultrasound (US) to the ET&#8208;TENG, the implanted ET&#8208;TENG can generate an alternating current voltage and concurrently release the loaded anti&#8208;mitotic drugs into tumor tissues, which synergistically disrupts the assembly of microtubules and filament actins, induces cell cycle arrest, and finally enhances cell death. With the assistance of US, the device can be completely degraded after the therapy, getting free of a secondary surgical extraction. The device can not only work around those unresectable tumors, but also provides a new application of wireless electric field in cancer therapy.

Abstract
Organic memory have attracted tremendous attention for next&#8208;generation electronic elements for the molecules&#8217; strikingly ease of structural design. However, due to their hardly controllable and low ion transport, it is always essential and challenge to effectively control their random migration, pathway and duration. There are very few effective strategies, and specific platforms with a view to molecule with specific coordination groups&#8208;regulating ions have been rarely reported. In this work, as a generalized rational design strategy, w e introduced the well&#8208;known Tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) with multiple coordination groups and small plane structure into stable polymers framework to modulate the Ag migration and then achieved the high performance devices with ideal productivity, low operation voltage and power, stable switching cycles and state retention. Raman mapping demonstrated that the migrated Ag can specially coordinate with the embedded TCNQ molecules. Notably, w e can modulate the TCNQ molecule distribution inside the polymer framework and regulate the memristive behaviors through controlling the formed Ag conductive filaments (CFs) as demonstrated by the Raman mapping, in&#8208;situ C&#8208;AFM, XRD and depth&#8208;profiling XPS. Thus the controllable molecule&#8208;mediated Ag movements show its potential in rationally designing high performance devices and versatile functions and is enlightening in constructing memristors with molecule&#8208;mediated ion movements.

         <title>4D Visualization of a Nonthermal Coherent Magnon in the Laser Heated Lattice by an X&#8208;ray Free Electron Laser</title>

Abstract
Ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic phenomena is an exciting achievement of mankind, expanding one's horizon of knowledge towards the functional nonequilibrium states. The dynamics acting on an extremely short timescale pushes the detection limits that reveal fascinating light&#8208;matter interactions for nonthermal creation of effective magnetic fields. While some cases are benchmarked by emergent transient behaviors, otherwise identifying the nonthermal effects remains challenging. Here, we introduce femtosecond time&#8208;resolved resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment using an X&#8208;ray free electron laser to distinguish between the effective field and the photoinduced thermal effect. We observe that a multiferroic Y&#8208;type hexaferrite exhibits magnetic Bragg peak intensity oscillations manifesting entangled antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Fourier components of a coherent antiferromagnetic magnon. The magnon trajectory constructed in three&#8208;dimensional space and time domains is decisive to evince ultrafast field formation preceding the lattice thermalization. We directly unravel a remarkable impact of photoexcitation across the electronic band gap, amplifying the photomagnetic coupling that is one of the highest among antiferromagnetic dielectrics. Leveraging the above&#8208;band&#8208;gap photoexcitation, this energy&#8208;efficient optical process further suggests a novel photomagnetic control of ferroelectricity in multiferroics.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Modulation with Covalent Organic Framework Enables Efficient And Durable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dual&#8208;interface modulation including buried interface as well as the top surface has recently been proven to be crucial for obtaining high photovoltaic performance in lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, for the first time, we report the strategy of using functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely HS&#8208;COFs, for dual&#8208;interface modulation, and further understand its intrinsic mechanisms in optimizing the bottom and top surfaces. Specifically, the buried HS&#8208;COFs layer can enhance the resistance against ultraviolet radiation, and more importantly, release the tensile strain, which is beneficial for enhancing device stability and improving the order of perovskite crystal growth. Furthermore, the detailed characterization results reveal that the HS&#8208;COFs on the top surface can effectively passivate the surface defects and suppress non&#8208;radiation recombination, as well as optimize the crystallization and growth of the perovskite film. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the dual&#8208;interface modified device delivers a champion efficiency of 24.26% and 21.30% for 0.0725 cm2 and 1 cm2&#8208;sized devices, respectively. Moreover, it retains 88% and 84% of their initial efficiency after aging for 2000 hours under the ambient conditions (25&#176;C, relative humidity: 35&#8208;45%) and a nitrogen atmosphere with heating at 65&#176;C, respectively.

         <title>In Situ Activation of Snap&#8208;Through Instability in Multi&#8208;Response Metamaterials through Multistable Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contact&#8208;induced topological transformation is leveraged to introduce a highly versatile multistable metamaterial capable of switching its mechanical response post fabrication. The authors demonstrate how the in&#8208;situ activation and deactivation of snap&#8208;through instability enable to generate non&#8208;volatile mechanical logic operations and to reprogram energy dissipation.








Abstract
Snap&#8208;through instability has been widely leveraged in metamaterials to attain non&#8208;monotonic responses for a specific subset of applications where conventional monotonic materials fail to perform. In the remaining more plentiful set of ordinary applications, snap&#8208;through instability is harmful, and current snapping metamaterials become inadequate because their capacity to snap cannot be suppressed post&#8208;fabrication. Here, a class of topology&#8208;transformable metamaterials is introduced to enable in situ activation and deactivation of the snapping capacity, providing a remarkable level of versatility in switching between responses from monotonic to monostable and bistable snap&#8208;through. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments are combined to unveil the role played by contact in the topological transformation capable of increasing the geometry incompatibility and confinement stiffness of selected architectural members. The strategy here presented for post&#8208;fabrication reprogrammability of matter and on&#8208;the&#8208;fly response switching paves the way to multifunctionality for application in multiple sectors from mechanical logic gates, and adjustable energy dissipators, to in situ adaptable sport&#160;equipment.

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Inspired Sticky Artificial Spider Silk for Signal Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuron&#8208;inspired sticky artificial spider silk is prepared based on proton donor&#8208;acceptor (PrDA) hydrogel fibers, which exhibits excellent mechanical robustness and ionic conductivity. It provides a new design strategy for signal transmission and regulation applications in bioelectrodes and artificial synapse.








Abstract
Neurons exhibit excellent signal transmission capacity, which inspire artificial neuron materials for applications in the field of wearable electronics and soft robotics. In addition, the neuron fibers exhibit good mechanical robustness by sticking to the organs, which currently has rarely been studied. Here, a sticky artificial spider silk is developed by employing a proton donor&#8208;acceptor (PrDA) hydrogel fiber for application as artificial neuron fibers. Tuning the molecular electrostatic interactions by modulating the sequences of proton donors and acceptors, enables combination of excellent mechanical properties, stickiness, and ion conductivity. In addition, the PrDA hydrogel exhibits high spinning capacity for a wide range of donor&#8208;acceptor combinations. The PrDA artificial spider silk would shed light on the design of new generation of artificial neuron materials, bio&#8208;electrodes, and artificial synapses.

         <dc:description>
Numerous well&#8208;designed nanosystems have emerged that incorporate presupposed cascade amplification processes and can be activated by exogenous ultrasound stimulation or ultrasound&#8208;actuated specific substances to trigger chemotherapy, chemodynamic therapy, immunotherapy, ferroptosis, and other therapeutic modalities, with the aim of maximizing antitumor efficacy and minimizing detrimental effects.








Abstract
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered cascade amplification of nanotherapies has attracted considerable attention as an effective strategy for cancer treatment. With the remarkable advances in materials chemistry and nanotechnology, a large number of well&#8208;designed nanosystems have emerged that incorporate presupposed cascade amplification processes and can be activated to trigger therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and ferroptosis, under exogenous US stimulation or specific substances generated by US actuation, to maximize antitumor efficacy and minimize detrimental effects. Therefore, summarizing the corresponding nanotherapies and applications based on US&#8208;triggered cascade amplification is essential. This review comprehensively summarizes and highlights the recent advances in the design of intelligent modalities, consisting of unique components, distinctive properties, and specific cascade processes. These ingenious strategies confer unparalleled potential to nanotherapies based on ultrasound&#8208;triggered cascade amplification and provide superior controllability, thus overcoming the unmet requirements of precision medicine and personalized treatment. Finally, the challenges and prospects of this emerging strategy are discussed and it is expected to encourage more innovative ideas and promote their further development.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Programmed Rewritable Lattice&#8208;Mediated Multistate Memory for High&#8208;Density Data Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;time programmable non&#8208;volatile memory is realized by utilizing light programming on a ReS2 device. The device exhibits more than 128 extremely stable states with linearly increasing conductance and shows superior wavelength discrimination capability. This device represents a significant contribution to memory technology by offering the ability to store information in multistate memory and enabling filter&#8208;free color image recorder applications.








Abstract
Mainstream non&#8208;volatile memory (NVM) devices based on floating gate structures or phase&#8208;change/ferroelectric materials face inherent limitations that compromise their suitability for long&#8208;term data storage. To address this challenge, a novel memory device based on light&#8208;programmed lattice engineering of thin rhenium disulfide&#160;(ReS2 ) flakes is proposed. By inducing sulfur vacancies in the ReS2 channel through light illumination, the device's electrical conductivity is modified accordingly and multiple conductance states for data storage therefore are generated. The device exhibits more than 128 distinct states with linearly increasing conductance, corresponding to a sevenfold increase in storage density. Through further optimization to achieve atomic&#8208;level precision in defect creation, it is possible to achieve even higher storage densities. These states are extremely stable in vacuum or inert ambient showing long retention of &gt;10 years, while they can be erased upon exposure to the air. The ReS2 memory device can maintain its stability over multiple program&#8208;erase operation cycles and shows superior wavelength discrimination capability for incident light in the range of 405&#8211;785&#160;nm. This device represents a significant contribution to NVM technology by offering the ability to store information in multistate memory and enabling filter&#8208;free color image recorder applications.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Thermoelectric Microdevices for 4D Thermometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device is developed for direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale. The paradigm of a 3D&#8208;printed thermocouple micro&#8208;network provides new advantages to access microscopic thermodynamics without dimensional limit. In this study, microscale 4D temperature fields generated by Joule&#8208;heating or evaporative cooling are directly observed.








Abstract
Thermometry, the process of measuring temperature, is one of the most fundamental tasks not only for understanding the thermodynamics of basic physical, chemical, and biological processes but also for thermal management of microelectronics. However, it is a challenge to acquire microscale temperature fields in both space and time. Here, a 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device that enables direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale is reported. The device is composed of freestanding thermocouple probe networks, fabricated by bi&#8208;metal 3D printing with an outstanding spatial resolution of a few &#181;m. It shows that the developed 4D thermometry can explore dynamics of Joule heating or evaporative cooling on microscale subjects of interest such as a microelectrode or a water meniscus. The utilization of 3D printing further opens up the possibility to freely realize a wide range of on&#8208;chip, freestanding microsensors or microelectronic devices without the design restrictions by manufacturing processes.

         <title>Imitating Architectural Mortise&#8208;Tenon Structure for Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 material with implanted architectural mortise&#8208;tenon (MT) structures is developed. These MT structures not only improve the mechanochemical stability by suppressing the intrinsic anisotropic volume change but also provide an expressway for fast Li&#8208;ion transport. This layered LiNi0.8C0.1Mn0.1O2 exhibits a capacity retention of 82% over 1200 cycles (1C) and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 97.5%.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are the most promising cathodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries, but chemo&#8208;mechanical failures during cycling and large first&#8208;cycle capacity loss hinder their applications in high&#8208;energy batteries. Herein, by introducing spinel&#8208;like mortise&#8208;tenon structures into the layered phase of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811), the adverse volume variations in cathode materials can be significantly suppressed. Meanwhile, these mortise&#8208;tenon structures play the role of the expressway for fast lithium&#8208;ion transport, which is substantiated by experiments and calculations. Moreover, the particles with mortise&#8208;tenon structures usually terminate with the most stable (003) facet. The new cathode exhibits a discharge capacity of 215&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 97.5%, and capacity retention of 82.2% after 1200 cycles at 1&#160;C. This work offers a viable lattice engineering to address the stability and low initial Coulombic efficiency of the Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides, and facilitates the implementation of Li&#8208;ion batteries with high&#8208;energy density and long durability.

         <title>3d imprinting of Voxel&#8208;Level Structural Colors in Lithium Niobate Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advanced coloration method is of pivotal importance in science, technology, and engineering. However, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structural colors that are critical for emerging multi&#8208;dimensional information representation and recording are rarely achievable. Here, we&#160;report on a facile voxel&#8208;level programmable 3D structural coloration in the bulk lithium niobate (LiNbO3) crystal. This is achieved by engineering wavelength&#8208;selective interference between ordinary (O) and extraordinary (E) light in the crystal matrix. To induce effective phase contrast between O and E light for establishing the highly localized interference across the visible band, we&#160;revealed the presence of a pulse&#8208;internal&#8208;coupling effect in the single&#8208;pulse ultrafast laser&#8208;crystal interaction and thus developed an ultrafast laser&#8208;induced micro&#8208;amorphization (MA) strategy to manipulate local matrix structure. Consequently, micro&#8208;nano&#8208;scale colorful voxels can be fast inscribed into any spatial position of the crystal matrix in one step. We&#160;demonstrated that the colors can be flexibly manipulated and fast extracted in 3D space. Multi&#8208;dimensional MA&#8208;color data storage with large capacity, high writing and readout speed, long lifetime, and excellent stability under harsh conditions was&#160;achieved. The present principle enables multifunctional 3D structural coloration devices inside high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index transparent dielectrics and can serve as a general platform to innovate next&#8208;generation information optics.

         <title>Title Extreme Polarization Anisotropy in Resonant Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation from Aligned Carbon Nanotube Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess extremely anisotropic electronic, thermal, and optical properties owing to their one&#8208;dimensional character. While their linear optical properties have been extensively studied, nonlinear optical processes, such as harmonic generation for frequency conversion, remain largely unexplored in CNTs, particularly in macroscopic CNT assemblies. In this work, w e synthesized macroscopic films of aligned and type&#8208;separated (semiconducting and metallic) CNTs and studied polarization&#8208;dependent third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG) from the films with fundamental wavelengths ranging from 1.5 to 2.5&#160;&#956;m. Both films exhibited strongly wavelength&#8208;dependent, intense THG signals, enhanced through exciton resonances, and w e found third&#8208;order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of 2.50 &#215; 10&#8722;19 m2/V2 (semiconducting CNTs) and 1.23 &#215; 10&#8722;19 m2/V2 (metallic CNTs), respectively, for 1.8&#160;&#956;m excitation. Further, through systematic polarization&#8208;dependent THG measurements, w e determined the values of all elements of the susceptibility tensor, verifying the macroscopically one&#8208;dimensional nature of the films. Finally, w e performed polarized THG imaging to demonstrate the nonlinear anisotropy in the large&#8208;size CNT film with good alignment. These findings promise applications of aligned CNT films in mid&#8208;infrared frequency conversion, nonlinear optical switching, polarized pulsed lasers, polarized long&#8208;wave detection, and high&#8208;performance anisotropic nonlinear photonic devices.

         <title>Trivalent Europium Doped CsCl Quantum Dots for MA&#8208;free Perovskite Solar Cells with Inherent Bandgap through Lattice Strain Compensation</title>

Abstract
Cesium&#8208;formamidinium (Cs&#8208;FA) perovskites have garnered widespread interest owing to their excellent thermal&#8208; and photostability in achieving stable formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, Cs&#8208;FA perovskite typically suffers from Cs+ and FA+ mismatches, affecting the Cs&#8208;FA morphology and lattice distortion, resulting in an enlarged bandgap (Eg). To address these issues, we developed &#8220;upgraded&#8221; CsCl&#8212;Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots (QDs) for FAPbI3 PSCs to solve the key issues in Cs&#8208;FA PSCs and also exploit the advantage of Cs&#8208;FA PSCs on stability. The introduction of Eu3+ promoted the formation of high&#8208;quality Cs&#8208;FA films by adjusting the Pb&#8208;I cluster structure. CsCl:Eu3+ also offsets the local strain and lattice contraction induced by Cs+, which maintains the inherent Eg of FAPbI3 and decreases the trap density. Finally, we obtained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.13% with an excellent short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 26.10&#160;mA/cm2, which are among the highest in methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free PSCs. The unencapsulated devices showed excellent humidity and storage stability owing to the relieved lattice strain and ligand protection. We achieved an initial PCE of 92.2% within 500&#160;h under continuous light illumination of 1.5 G and bias voltage conditions, demonstrating excellent operational stability. This study provides a universal strategy to address the inherent issues of Cs&#8208;FA devices and maintain the stability of MA&#8208;free PSCs to satisfy future commercial criteria.

         <title>Achieving All Plateau and High Capacity Sodium Insertion in Topological Graphitized Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hard carbon anodes with all&#8208;plateau capacities below 0.1&#160;V are prerequisites to achieve high energy density sodium ion storages, which are holding promises for the future sustainable energy technologies. However, challenges in removing defects and improving the insertion of sodium ions heading off the development of hard carbon to achieve this goal. Herein, we reported a highly cross&#8208;linked topological graphitized carbon using biomass corn cobs through a two&#8208;step rapid thermal annealing strategy. The topological graphitized carbon constructed with long&#8208;range graphene nanoribbons and cavities/tunnels provides a multi&#8208;directional insertions of sodium ions whilst eliminating defects to absorb sodium ions at high voltage region. Evidences from advanced technique including in&#8208;situ XRD, in&#8208;situ Raman and in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ TEM indicate that the sodium ions appear Na cluster formation between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements. The reported topological insertion mechanism enables outstanding battery performance with a single full low&#8208;voltage plateau capacity of 290 mAh g&#8722;1, which is almost 97% of the total capacity.

         <title>Narrowband Organic Afterglow via Phosphorescence F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Achieving multicolor organic afterglow materials with narrowband emission and high color purity is important in various optoelectronic fields but remains a great challenge. Here, we&#160;present an efficient strategy to obtain narrowband organic afterglow materials via F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from long&#8208;lived phosphorescence donors to narrowband fluorescence acceptors in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix. The resulting materials exhibit narrowband emission with full width at half maximum (FWHM) as small as 23&#160;nm and the longest lifetime of 721.22&#160;ms. Meanwhile, by pairing the appropriate donors and acceptors, multicolor and high color purity afterglow ranging from green to red with the maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 67.1% are achieved. Moreover, given their long luminescence lifetime, high color purity, and flexibility, we&#160;demonstrate the potential applications in high&#8208;resolution afterglow displays and dynamic and quick information identification in low&#8208;light conditions. This work provides a facile approach for developing multicolor and narrowband afterglow materials as well as expands the features of organic afterglow.

         <title>Overcoming Charge Confinement in Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The small nanoparticle size and long&#8208;chain ligands in colloidal metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PeQDs) cause charge confinement, which impedes exciton dissociation and carrier extraction in PeQD solar cells, so they have low short&#8208;circuit current density Jsc, which impedes further increases in their power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, we develop a re&#8208;assembling process (RP) for perovskite nanocrystalline (PeNC) films made of PeQDs to increase Jsc in PeQD solar cells. RP of PeNC films increases their crystallite size and eliminates long&#8208;chain ligands, and thereby overcomes the charge confinement in PeNC films. These changes facilitate exciton dissociation and increase carrier extraction in PeQD solar cells. By use of this method, the gradient bandgap PeQD solar cells achieve a Jsc = 19.30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 without compromising the photo&#8208;voltage, and yielded high PCE = 16.46% with negligible hysteresis and good stability. This work provides a new strategy to process PeNC films and pave a way for high performance PeQD optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Protonated Organic Semiconductors: Origin of Water&#8208;Induced Charge Trap Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite dramatic improvements in the electronic characteristics of organic semiconductors, the low operational stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors hinders their direct use in practical applications. Although the literature contains numerous reports on the effects of water on the operational stability of organic field effect transistors, the underlying mechanisms of trap generation induced by water remain unclear. Here, we&#160;propose a protonation&#8208;induced trap generation of organic semiconductors as a possible origin of the operational instability in organic field&#8208;effect transistors. Spectroscopic and electronic investigation techniques combined with simulations revealed that the direct protonation of organic semiconductors by water during operation might&#160;be responsible for the trap generation induced by bias stress; this phenomenon is independent of the trap generation at an insulator surface. In addition, the same feature occurred in small&#8208;band&#8208;gap polymers with fused thiophene rings irrespective of their crystalline ordering, implying the generality of protonation induced trap generation in various polymer semiconductors with a small band&#8208;gap. Our&#160;finding of the trap generation process provides new perspectives for achieving greater operational stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

Abstract
Microneedles (MNs) have become versatile platforms for minimally invasive transdermal drug delivery devices. However, there are concerns about MN&#8208;induced skin infections with long&#8208;term transdermal administration. Using the Langmuir&#8722;Blodgett (LB) technique, we&#160;develop a simple method for depositing antibacterial nanoparticles of various shapes, sizes, and compositions onto MNs. This strategy has merits over conventional dip coating techniques, including controlled coating layers, uniform and high coverage, and a straightforward fabrication process. This provides MNs with a fast&#8208;acting and long&#8208;lasting antibacterial effect. Our&#160;study demonstrates that antibacterial MNs achieve superior bacterial elimination in vitro and in vivo without sacrificing payload capacity, drug release, or mechanical strength. We&#160;believe that such functional nanoparticle coating technique offers a platform for the expansion of MNs function, especially in long&#8208;term transdermal drug delivery fields.

         <title>Extracellular Vesicles&#8208;Derived Hybrid Nanoplatforms for Amplified CD47 Blockade&#8208;Based Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Immunomodulation of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) into tumor&#8208;inhibiting M1&#8208;like phenotype is a promising but challenging strategy. Cleverly, tumor cells overexpress CD47, a &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal that ligates with the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) on macrophages to escape phagocytosis. Thus, effective re&#8208;education of TAMs into &#8220;eat me&#8221; type and blocking the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling play pivotal roles in tumor immunotherapy. Herein, we report that hybrid nanovehicles (hEL&#8208;RS17) derived from extracellular vesicles of M1 macrophages and decorated with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, can actively target tumor cells and remodel TAM phenotypes. Consequently, more M1&#8208;like TAMs infiltrate into tumor tissue to phagocytize more tumor cells due to CD47 blockade. By further co&#8208;encapsulating chemotherapeutic agent shikonin, photosensitizer IR820 and immunomodulator polymetformin in hEL&#8208;RS17, an enhanced antitumor effect is obtained due to the combinational treatment modality and close synergy among each component. Upon laser irradiation, the designed SPI@hEL&#8208;RS17 nanoparticles exert potent antitumor efficacy against both 4T1 breast tumor and B16F10 melanoma models, which not only suppresses primary tumor growth, but also inhibits lung metastasis and prevents tumor recurrence, exhibiting great potential in boosting CD47 blockade&#8208;based antitumor immunotherapy.

Cleverly, tumor cells overexpress CD47, a &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal that ligates with the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) on macrophages to escape phagocytosis. Thus, effective re-education of TAMs into &#8220;eat me&#8221; type and blocking the CD47-SIRP&#945; signaling play pivotal roles in tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Regulating The Lithium Ions&#8217; Local Coordination Environment Through Designing Cof with Single Atomic Co Site to Achieve Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The detrimental lithium dendrites growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) inhibit the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, we explore atomically dispersed cobalt coordinate conjugated bipyridine&#8208;rich covalent organic framework (sp2c&#8208;COF) as an artificial SEI on the surface of Li metal anode to resolve these issues. The single Co atoms confined in the structure of COF enhance the number of active sites and promote electron transfer to COF. The Co&#8208;N coordination and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;group synergistic effects can maximum adsorb the electron from the donor (Co) and create an electron&#8208;rich environment, hence further regulating the Li+ local coordination environment and achieving uniform Li nucleation behavior. Furthermore, the in&#8208;situ technology and density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism of sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co inducing Li uniform deposition and promoting Li+ rapid migration. Based on these advantages, the sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co modified Li anode exhibits a low Li nucleation barrier of 8&#160;mV, and excellent cycling stability of 6000&#160;h.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Adaptable Polyimide Hybrid Dielectric Films with Superior Recyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polyimides (PIs) used in advanced electrical and electronic devices can be electrically/mechanically damaged, resulting in a significant waste of resources. Closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling may prolong the service life of synthetic polymers. However, the design of dynamic covalent bonds for preparing chemically recyclable crosslinked PIs remains a challenging task. Herein, new crosslinked PI films containing a PI oligomer, chain extender, and crosslinker are reported. They exhibit superior recyclability and excellent self&#8208;healable ability owing to the synergistic effect of the chain extender and crosslinker. The produced films can be completely depolymerized in an acidic solution at ambient temperature, leading to efficient monomer recovery. The recovered monomers may be used to remanufacture crosslinked PIs without deteriorating their original performance. In particular, the designed films can serve as corona&#8208;resistant films with a recovery rate of approximately 100%. Furthermore, carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRCs) with PI matrices are suitable for harsh environments and can be recycled multiple times at a non&#8208;destructive recycling rate up to 100%. The preparation of high&#8208;strength dynamic covalent adaptable PI hybrid films from simple PI oligomers, chain extenders, and crosslinkers may provide a solid basis for sustainable development in the electrical and electronic fields.

         <title>Application of Conductive MOF in Zinc&#8208;based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The use of conductive MOFs (c&#8208;MOFs) in zinc&#8208;based batteries has been a popular research direction. Zinc&#8208;based batteries are widely used with the advantages of high specific capacity and safety and stability, but they also face many problems. c&#8208;MOFs have excellent conductivity compared with other primitive MOFs, and therefore have better applications in zinc&#8208;based batteries. In this paper, we discuss the transfer mechanisms of the unique charges of c&#8208;MOFs: hop transport and band transport respectively, and further address the way of electron transport. Then, it is introduced that c&#8208;MOFs can be prepared in various ways, among which solvothermal, interfacial synthesis and post&#8208;processing methods are widely used. In addition, the applications of c&#8208;MOFs are discussed in terms of their role and performance in different types of zinc&#8208;based batteries. Finally, the current problems of c&#8208;MOFs and the prospects for their future development are presented.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant Atomic Layers of Amorphous Carbon Nitride Topologically Derived from MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Low&#8208;dielectric constant materials such as silicon dioxide serving as interconnect insulators in current integrated circuit face a great challenge due to their relatively high dielectric constant of &#8764; 4, twice that of the recommended value by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, causing severe parasitic capacitance and associated response delay. Here, novel atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) were prepared via a topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. Remarkably, the assembled a&#8208;CN film exhibits an ultralow dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kilohertz, much lower than the previously reported dielectric materials such as amorphous carbon (2.2) and fluorinated&#8208;doped SiO2 (3.6), ascribed to the low density of 0.55&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and high sp3 C level of 35.7%. Moreover, the a&#8208;CN film has a breakdown strength of 5.6 megavolts per centimeter, showing great potential in integrated circuit application.

Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the major advances of nanolights with extensive exploration of nano&#8208;luminescent materials like carbon dots (CDs). However, solvent&#8208;free processing of these materials remains a formidable challenge, impeding endeavors to develop advanced manufacturing techniques. Herein, in response to this challenge, liquid crystallization is demonstrated as a versatile and robust approach by deliberately anchoring flexible alkyl chains on the CDs surface. Alkyl chain grafting on the CDs surface is observed to substantially depress the common aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, and results in a shift of self&#8208;assembly structure from the crystalline phase to smectic liquid crystalline phase. The liquid crystalline phase transition temperature is ready to adjust by varying the alkyl chain length, endowing low temperature (&lt; 50&#160;&#176;C) melt&#8208;processing capabilities. Consequently, the first case of direct ink writing (DIW) with liquid crystal (LC) carbon dots is demonstrated, giving rise to highly emissive objects with blue, green and red color fluorescence, respectively. Another unexpected finding is that the DIW with LC inks dramatically outperforms the DIW with isotropic inks, further highlighting the significance of LC processing. The reported approach herein not only exhibits a fundamental advance by imparting LC functions to CDs, but also promises technological utility in DIW&#8208;based advanced manufacturing.
