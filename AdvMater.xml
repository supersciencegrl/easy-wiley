         <title>Thermally drawn highly conductive fibers with controlled elasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electronic fabrics necessitate both electrical conductivity and, like any textile, elastic recovery. Achieving both requirements on the scale of a single fiber remains an unmet need. Here, two approaches for achieving conductive fibers (107S/m) reaching 50% elongation while maintaining minimal change in resistance (&lt;0.5%) in embedded metallic electrodes are introduced. The first approach involves inducing a buckling instability in a metal microwire within a cavity of a thermally drawn elastomer fiber. The second approach relies on twisting an elastomer fiber to yield helical metal electrodes embedded in a stretchable yarn. The scalability of both approaches is illustrated in apparatuses for continuous buckling and twisting that yield tens of meters of elastic conducting fibers. Through experimental and analytical methods, we elucidate how geometric parameters, such as buckling pre&#8208;strain and helical angle, as well as materials choice, control not only the fiber's elasticity but also its Young's modulus. Links between mechanical and electrical properties are exposed. The resulting fibers are used to construct elastic fabrics that contain diodes, by weaving and knitting, thus demonstrating the scalable fabrication of conformable and stretchable antennas that support optical data transmission.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Tailored Surface Oxide on Cu&#8208;Ga Intermetallics Enhances CO2 Reduction Selectivity to Methanol at Ultra&#8208;Low Potential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In this work, electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has been performed on two intermetallic compounds formed by copper and gallium metals (CuGa2 and Cu9Ga4) for the first time. Among them, CuGa2 selectively converts CO2 to methanol with remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.26% at an extremely low potential of &#8208;0.3&#160;V versus RHE. The, high performance of CuGa2 compared to Cu9Ga4 has been driven by its unique two&#8208;dimensional structure that retains surface and sub&#8208;surface oxide species (Ga2O3) even in the reduction atmosphere. The Ga2O3, species have been mapped by XPS and XAFS techniques and electrochemical measurements. The eCO2RR activity and selectivity to methanol have been decreased at higher potential due to the lattice expansion caused by the reduction of the Ga2O3, which has been probed by in&#8208;situ XAFS, quasi in&#8208;situ powder XRD and ex&#8208;situ XPS measurements. The mechanism of the formation of methanol from CO2 at various potentials has been visualized by in&#8208;situ IR spectroscopy and source of carbon of methanol at the molecular level confirmed from the isotope labelling experiments in the presence of 13CO2. Finally, to minimize the mass transport limitations and improve the overall eCO2RR performance, PTFE&#8208;based gas diffusion electrode (GDE) has been employed in the flow cell configuration.

         <title>Synergy between Palladium Single Atoms and Nanoparticles via Hydrogen Spillover for Enhancing CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic Pd1 and PdNPs form a functional catalyst for enhancing photocatalytic CO2 methanation. Pd1 activate CO2, while PdNPs boost H2O dissociation. The H* produced by PdNPs migrates to Pd1 via hydrogen spillover to promote multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer processes. Moreover, the adjacent Pd1 and PdNPs stabilize intermediates, such as *CHO. Therefore, efficient photocatalytic CO2 to CH4 is highly favored.








Abstract
Selective photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbon&#8208;neutral fuels such as methane (CH4) is extremely desirable but remains a challenge since sluggish multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer and various C1 intermediates are involved. Herein, a synergistic function between single Pd atoms (Pd1) and Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) on graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) for photocatalytic CO2 methanation is presented. The catalyst achieves a high selectivity of 97.8% for CH4 production with a yield of 20.3&#160;&#181;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. Mechanistic studies revealed that Pd1 sites activated CO2, while PdNPs sites boosted water (H2O) dissociation for increased H* coverage. The H* produced by PdNPs migrate to the Pd1 sites to promote multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer via hydrogen spillover. Moreover, the adjacent Pd1 and PdNPs effectively stabilized intermediates such as *CHO, thereby favoring the pathway for CH4 production. This work provides a new perspective into the development of selective photocatalytic CO2 conversion through the artful design of synergistic catalytic sites.

         <title>Macroscale Conjugated Microporous Polymers: Controlling Versatile Functionalities Over Several Dimensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in macroscale conjugated microporous polymers for gas adsorption, energy, sensing, filtration/purification, and catalysis applications are reviewed, with particular focus on how the macroscopic architectures brings about more functionalities and opportunities.








Abstract
Since discovered in 2007, conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) have been developed for numerous applications including gas adsorption, sensing, organic and photoredox catalysis, energy storage, etc. While featuring abundant micropores, the structural rigidity derived from CMPs&#8217; stable &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton leads to insolubility and thus poor processability, which severely limits their applicability, e.g., in CMP&#8208;based devices. Hence, the development of CMPs whose structure can not only be controlled on the micro&#8208; but also on the macroscale have attracted tremendous interest. In conventional synthesis procedures, CMPs are obtained as powders, but in recent years various bottom&#8208;up synthesis strategies have been developed, which yield CMPs as thin films on substrates or as hybrid materials, allowing to span length scales from individual conjugated monomers to micro&#8208;/macrostructures. This review surveys recent advances on the construction of CMPs into macroscale structures, including membranes, films, aerogels, sponges, and other architectures. The focus is to describe the underlying fabrication techniques and the implications which follow from the macroscale morphologies, involving new chemistry and physics in such materials for applications like molecular separation/filtration/adsorption, energy storage and conversion, photothermal transformation, sensing, or catalysis.

         <title>Spatial Separation of Cocatalysts on Z&#8208;Scheme Organic/Inorganic Heterostructure Hollow Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and In&#8208;Depth Analysis of the Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction hollow sphere with spatially separated cocatalysts is proposed to overcome the fundamental limitation in photocatalytic water splitting. The Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction effectively stimulates interfacial charge transfer while retaining high redox power, whereas the spatially separated cocatalysts stimulate surface charge separation. Their synergistic effect results in an exceptional photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of 8.15 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A Z-scheme heterojunction hollow sphere with spatially separated cocatalysts is proposed to overcome the fundamental limitation in photocatalytic water splitting. The Z-scheme heterojunction effectively stimulates interfacial charge transfer while retaining high redox power, whereas the spatially separated cocatalysts stimulate surface charge separation. Their synergistic effect results in an exceptional photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution performance of 8.15 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>The Pivotal Role of s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;Block Metals in Water Electrolysis: Status Quo and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

This review pioneeringly presents the unique and essential role of some s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metal species enabling transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts to efficiently drive hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Transition metals, in particular noble metals, are the most common species in metal&#8208;mediated water electrolysis because they serve as highly active catalytic sites. In many cases, the presence of nontransition metals, that is, s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals with high natural abundance in the earth&#8208;crust in the catalytic material is indispensable to boost efficiency and durability in water electrolysis. This is why alkali metals, alkaline&#8208;earth metals, rare&#8208;earth metals, lean metals, and metalloids receive growing interest in this research area. In spite of the pivotal role of these nontransition metals in tuning efficiency of water electrolysis, there is far more room for developments toward a knowledge&#8208;based catalyst design. In this review, five classes of nontransition metals species which are successfully utilized in water electrolysis, with special emphasis on electronic structure&#8211;catalytic activity relationships and phase stability, are discussed. Moreover, specific fundamental aspects on electrocatalysts for water electrolysis as well as a perspective on this research field are also addressed in this account. It is anticipated that this review can trigger a broader interest in using s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals species toward the discovery of advanced polymetal&#8208;containing electrocatalysts for practical water splitting.

         <title>Reconfigurable Quasi&#8208;Nonvolatile Memory/Subthermionic FET Functions in Ferroelectric&#8211;2D Semiconductor vdW Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new principle for ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor (FeFET) functional reconfiguration by controlling the behaviors of interfacial oxygen vacancies in a prototype 2D van der Waals FeFET is proposed and proved. FeFET with large counterclockwise hysteresis and negative capacitance FET free of hysteresis are realized for memory (neural computing) and low&#8208;power computing, respectively. It paves a new path toward both in&#8208;memory computing and transistor&#8208;memory monolithic integration.








Abstract
The functional reconfiguration of transistors and memory in homogenous ferroelectric devices offers significant opportunities for implementing the concepts of in&#8208;memory computing and logic&#8208;memory monolithic integration. Thus far, reconfiguration is realized through programmable doping profiles in the semiconductor channel using multiple&#8208;gate operation. This complex device architecture limits further scaling to match the overall chip requirements. Here, reconfigurable memory/transistor functionalities in a ferroelectric&#8208;gated van der Waals transistor by controlling the behavior of ferroelectric oxygen vacancies at the interface are demonstrated. Short&#8208; and long&#8208;term memory functions are demonstrated by modulating the border oxygen vacancy distribution and the associated charge dynamics. The quasi&#8208;nonvolatile long&#8208;term memory exhibits data retention of over 105 s and endurance of up to 5 &#215; 105 cycles, verifying its applicability as a potential device platform for neuromorphic networks. More importantly, by modulating the ferroelectricity of the interfacial domains with the interactions of oxygen vacancies, a hysteresis&#8208;free logic transistor is realized with a subthermionic subthreshold swing down to 46&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, which resembles a negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistor. The new concept of achieving functional reconfiguration with prior device performance in a single&#8208;gate ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor is of great advantage in future integrated circuit applications.

         <title>Gradient Doping in Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskites by Barium Ions for Efficient Single&#8208;Junction and Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Barium ions are reported to effectively n&#8208;dope perovskites. Distribution of the barium ions and related n&#8208;doping effect is in a gradient across the perovskite film, resulting in a homojunction, which facilitates the separation and transport of the photogenerated carriers. Carrier diffusion length &gt;2&#160;&#181;m and boosted efficiencies of 21.2% for single&#8208;junction cell and 25.3% for all&#8208;perovskite tandem cell are achieved.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) tin (Sn)&#8211;lead (Pb) perovskites generally have a high density of unintentional p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping, which reduces the charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes, diffusion lengths, and device efficiencies. Here, a&#160;p&#8211;n&#160;homojunction across the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite is demonstrated, which results from a gradient doping by barium ions (Ba2+). It is reported that 0.1&#160;mol% Ba2+ can effectively compensate the p&#8208;doping of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites or even turns it to n&#8208;type without changing its bandgap. Ba2+ cations are found to stay at the interstitial sites and work as shallow electron donor. In addition, Ba2+ cations show a unique heterogeneous distribution in perovskite film. Most of the barium ions stay in the top 600&#160;nm region of the perovskite films and turn it into weakly n&#8208;type, while the bottom portion of the film remains as p&#8208;type. The gradient doping forms a homojunction from top to bottom of the perovskite films with a built&#8208;in field that facilitates extraction of photogenerated carriers, resulting in an increased carrier extraction length. This strategy enhances the efficiency of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite single&#8208;junction solar cells to over 21.0% and boosts the efficiencies of monolithic perovskite&#8211;perovskite tandem solar cells to 25.3% and 24.1%, for active areas of 5.9&#160;mm2&#160;and 0.94&#160;cm2, respectively.

         <title>Electrode Engineering in Halide Perovskite Electronics: Plenty of Room at the Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational selection of electrodes plays a critical role in perovskite&#8208;based electronics due to the high reactivity of halide perovskite materials. A comprehensive review of perovskite/electrode interfaces, as well as, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact engineering, which assists the development of perovskite&#8208;based devices with inhibited interfacial reactions, ohmic carrier transport, and non&#8208;hysteric electronic characteristics, is presented.








Abstract
Contact engineering is a prerequisite for achieving desirable functionality and performance of semiconductor electronics, which is particularly critical for organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskites due to their ionic nature and highly reactive interfaces. Although the interfaces between perovskites and charge&#8208;transporting layers have attracted lots of attention due to the photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting diode applications, achieving reliable perovskite/electrode contacts for electronic devices, such as transistors and memories, remains as a bottleneck. Herein, a critical review on the elusive nature of perovskite/electrode interfaces with a focus on the interfacial electrochemistry effects is presented. The basic guidelines of electrode selection are given for establishing non&#8208;polarized interfaces and optimal energy level alignment for perovskite materials.

&lt;p&gt;Rational selection of electrodes plays a critical role in perovskite-based electronics due to the high reactivity of halide perovskite materials. A comprehensive review of perovskite/electrode interfaces, as well as, state-of-the-art contact engineering, which assists the development of perovskite-based devices with inhibited interfacial reactions, ohmic carrier transport, and non-hysteric electronic characteristics, is presented.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact engineering is a prerequisite for achieving desirable functionality and performance of semiconductor electronics, which is particularly critical for organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskites due to their ionic nature and highly reactive interfaces. Although the interfaces between perovskites and charge-transporting layers have attracted lots of attention due to the photovoltaic and light-emitting diode applications, achieving reliable perovskite/electrode contacts for electronic devices, such as transistors and memories, remains as a bottleneck. Herein, a critical review on the elusive nature of perovskite/electrode interfaces with a focus on the interfacial electrochemistry effects is presented. The basic guidelines of electrode selection are given for establishing non-polarized interfaces and optimal energy level alignment for perovskite materials. Furthermore, state-of-the-art strategies on interface-related electrode engineering are reviewed and discussed, which aim at achieving ohmic transport and eliminating hysteresis in perovskite devices. The role and multiple functionalities of self-assembled monolayers that offer a unique approach toward improving perovskite/electrode contacts are also discussed. The insights on electrode engineering pave the way to advancing stable and reliable perovskite devices in diverse electronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Progress in Protective Membranes Fabricated via Electrospinning: Advanced Materials, Biomimetic Structures, and Functional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospinning has been used for several applications over the last 20 years. Multifunctional protective membranes in terms of novel material design, novel structure construction, and various applications via electrospinning are reviewed. Diverse protective membranes are investigated, existing problems are discussed, and solutions for future technology development are proposed. This is of significance for the sustainable development of intelligent protection systems.








Abstract
Electrospinning is a significant micro/nanofiber processing technology and has been rapidly developing in the past 2 decades. It has several applications, including advanced sensing, intelligent manufacturing, and high&#8208;efficiency catalysis. Here, multifunctional protective membranes fabricated via electrospinning in terms of novel material design, construction of novel structures, and various protection requirements in different environments are reviewed. To achieve excellent comprehensive properties, such as, high water vapor transmission, high hydrostatic pressure, optimal mechanical property, and air permeability, combinations of novel materials containing nondegradable/degradable materials and functional structures inspired by nature have been investigated for decades. Currently, research is mainly focused on conventional protective membranes with multifunctional properties, such as, anti&#8208;UV, antibacterial, and electromagnetic&#8208;shielding functions. However, important aspects, such as, the properties of electrospun monofilaments, development of &#8220;green electrospinning solutions&#8221; with high solid content, and approaches for enhancing adhesion between hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers are not considered. Based on this systematic review, the development of electrospinning for protective membranes is discussed, the existing gaps in research are discussed, and solutions for the development of technology are proposed. This review will assist in promoting the diversified development of protective membranes and is of great significance for fabricating advanced materials for intelligent protection.

         <title>Regulation of Surface Defect Chemistry towards Stable Ni&#8208;rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Surface reconstruction of Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides degrades the cycling stability and safety of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which challenges typical surface modification approaches to build a robust interface with electrochemical activity. Here, we propose a strategy by leveraging the low strain analogues of Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208; rich layered oxides to reconstruct a stable surface on the Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes. The new surface structure not only consists of a gradient chemical composition but also contains a defect&#8208;rich structure regarding the formation of oxygen vacancies and cationic ordering, which can simultaneously facilitate lithium diffusion and stabilize the crystal structure during the (de)lithiation. These features in the Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides lead to a dramatic improvement in electrochemical properties, especially the cyclability under high voltage cycling, exhibiting the 30% increase in capacity retention after 200 cycles at the current density of 1C (3.0&#8208;4.6&#160;V). Our findings offer a facile and effective way to regulate defect chemistry and surface structure in parallel on Ni&#8208;rich layered structure cathodes to achieve high&#8208;energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Surface reconstruction of Ni-rich layered oxides degrades the cycling stability and safety of high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries, which challenges typical surface modification approaches to build a robust interface with electrochemical activity. Here, we propose a strategy by leveraging the low strain analogues of Li- and Mn- rich layered oxides to reconstruct a stable surface on the Ni-rich layered cathodes. The new surface structure not only consists of a gradient chemical composition but also contains a defect-rich structure regarding the formation of oxygen vacancies and cationic ordering, which can simultaneously facilitate lithium diffusion and stabilize the crystal structure during the (de)lithiation.

         <title>Sensitive Activatable Nanoprobes for Real&#8208;time Ratiometric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Reactive Oxygen Species and Ameliorating Inflammation In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Imaging guided real&#8208;time monitoring of the treatment process of inflammatory diseases is important for the timely adjustment of the treatment planning to lower unnecessary side effects and improve treatment outcomes. However, it is difficult to reflect the dynamic changes of inflammation in vivo with enough tissue penetration depth. Here, we developed a novel nanotheranostic agent (denominated TMSN@PM) with platelet membrane&#8208;coated, tempol&#8208;grafted, manganese&#8208;doped, mesoporous silica nanoparticles. The platelet membrane endowed the TMSN@PM with the ability to target inflammation sites, which were verified by fluorescence imaging with Cy5&#8208;labeled TMSN@PM. Under the inflammatory environment (mild acidity and excess reactive oxygen species, ROS), TMSN@PM can scavenge the excess ROS, thereby alleviating inflammation, degrade and release manganese ions for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The relaxation changes (&#916;R1) were almost linearly correlated with the concentration of H2O2, which could reflect the degree of inflammation. This method offers a non&#8208;invasive imaging&#8208;based strategy for early prediction of the therapeutic outcomes in inflammatory therapy, which may contribute to precision medicine in terms of prognostic stratification and therapeutic planning in future.

         <title>More Than Carbazole Derivatives Activate Room Temperature Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence of Benzoindole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The mechanism of carbazole(Cz)&#8208;based phosphors is still unclear since its isomer (1H&#8208;benzo[f]indole, Bd) was discovered in 2020. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of four Cz/Bd derivatives, named as 2CzBr, CzBdBr, 2BdBr and 3Bd, and give the general mechanism of Bd derivatives for their ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP). Bd and its derivatives gave double groups of intrinsic phosphorescence, including the short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence with a short lifetime and the ultralong phosphorescence at long wavelengths, assigned to their neutral molecules and radical cations, respectively. Interestingly, the doped PMMA films of CzBdBr and 2BdBr showed photo&#8208;activated ultralong phosphorescence at room temperature (RT). The activation of RT ultralong phosphorescence of Bd derivatives involved three factors: (1) well dispersion in the matrix with limited amount, (2) generation of their radical cations and (3) the matrix&#8208;mediated stabilization of radical cations. In addition, the function of Cz derivatives to activate the intrinsic ultralong phosphorescence of Bd derivatives could be replaced by photo&#8208;activation or by using other matrixes. Moreover, the photo&#8208;activated ultralong phosphorescence was closely related to the molecular structures of Bd derivatives and the stability of their radical cations. For some Cz systems obtained from commercially available Cz, their ultralong phosphorescence might originate from synergistic effect of two or even more kinds of Bd derivatives. Significantly, the application of the doped PMMA films was practiced and gave an exciting result that the high&#8208;resolution QR code could be reversibly printed and erased on the doped film. Our research has expanded the understanding in the field of ultralong organic phosphorescence and it may pave a new way for its development.

         <title>Confined growth of silver&#8208;copper Janus nanostructures with {100} facets for highly selective tandem electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds significant potential to promote carbon neutral. However, the selectivity toward multi&#8208;carbon products in CO2RR is still too low to meet practical applications. Here we report the delicate synthesis of three kinds of Ag&#8208;Cu Janus nanostructures with {100} facets (JNS&#8208;100) for highly selective tandem electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products. By controlling the surfactant and reduction kinetics of Cu precursor, we realize the confined growth of Cu with {100} facets on one of the six equal faces of Ag nanocubes. Compared with Cu nanocubes, Ag65&#8208;Cu35 JNS&#8208;100 demonstrate much superior selectivity for both ethylene and multi&#8208;carbon products in CO2RR at less negative potentials. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the compensating electronic structure and carbon monoxide spillover in Ag65&#8208;Cu35 JNS&#8208;100 contribute to the enhanced CO2RR performance. This study provides an effective strategy to design advanced tandem catalysts toward the extensive application of CO2RR.

Compared with Cu nanocubes, Ag&lt;sub&gt;65&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt; JNS-100 demonstrate much superior selectivity for both ethylene and multi-carbon products in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR at less negative potentials. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the compensating electronic structure and carbon monoxide spillover in Ag&lt;sub&gt;65&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt; JNS-100 contribute to the enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance. This study provides an effective strategy to design advanced tandem catalysts toward the extensive application of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multifunctional PA/FL Dual&#8208;mode Imaging Gold&#8208;based Theranostic Nanoformulation without External Laser Limitations</title>

Abstract
Theranostics is a new type of biomedical technology that organically combines the diagnosis and therapy of diseases. Among molecular imaging techniques, the integration of photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence (FL) imaging modes with high sensitivity and imaging depth provides precise diagnostic outcomes. Gold nanorods (Au NRs) are well&#8208;known contrast agents for PA imaging and photothermal therapy. However, its high toxicity, poor biocompatibility, rapid clearance, and the need for an external laser source limits its application. Therefore, modification of Au NRs with carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials (CBNs) is done to obtain a multifunctional dual&#8208;mode gold&#8208;based nanoformulation (mdGC), which preforms dual&#8208;mode imaging of PA and FL. The results show that mdGC promotes tumor cell apoptosis and exhibits good antitumor performance through the mitochondria&#8208;mediated apoptotic pathway by increasing the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, and regulating the expression of apoptosis&#8208;related genes. The targeting rate of mdGC to tumor tissue is up to 20.71&#177;1.94%&#160;ID g&#8211;1; the tumor growth inhibition rate is as high as 80.44% without external laser sources. In general, mdGC is a potential multifunctional diagnostic and therapy integrated nanoformulation.

         <title>Heterointerface Created on Au&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Loaded Unilamellar Hydroxide Electrocatalysts as a Highly Active Site for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The material design for interface active sites to allow a novel oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism is proposed. The Au&#8208;cluster&#8208;loaded unilamellar layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide nanosheet electrocatalysts create interfacial active sites that exhibit interfacial direct O&#63743;O coupling and excellent OER performance.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical element for all sorts of reactions that use water as a hydrogen source, such as hydrogen evolution and electrochemical CO2 reduction, and novel design principles that provide highly active sites on OER electrocatalysts push the limits of their practical applications. Herein, Au&#8208;cluster loading on unilamellar exfoliated layered double hydroxide (ULDH) electrocatalysts for the OER is demonstrated to fabricate a heterointerface between Au clusters and ULDHs as an active site, which is accompanied by the oxidation state modulation of the active site and interfacial direct O&#63743;O coupling (&#8220;interfacial DOOC&#8221;). The Au&#8208;cluster&#8208;loaded ULDHs exhibit excellent activities for the OER with an overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements reveal that charge transfer from the Au clusters to ULDHs modifies the oxidation states of trivalent metal ions, which can be active sites on the ULDHs. The present study, supported by highly sensitive spectroscopy combining reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy and modulation&#8208;excitation spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, indicates that active sites at the interface between the Au clusters and ULDHs promote a novel OER mechanism through interfacial DOOC, thereby achieving outstanding catalytic performance.

         <title>Magnetoelectric effect in hydrogen harvesting: magnetic field as a trigger of catalytic reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic fields have been regarded as an additional stimulus for electro&#8208; and photocatalytic reactions, but not as a direct trigger for catalytic processes. Multiferroic/magnetoelectric materials, whose electrical polarization and surface charges can be magnetically altered, are especially suitable for triggering and control of catalytic reactions solely with magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate that magnetic fields can be employed as an independent input energy source for hydrogen harvesting by means of the magnetoelectric effect. Composite multiferroic CoFe2O4&#8208;BiFeO3 core&#8208;shell nanoparticles act as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that is triggered when an alternating magnetic field is applied to an aqueous dispersion of the magnetoelectric nanocatalysts. Based on density functional calculations, we propose that the hydrogen evolution is driven by changes in the ferroelectric polarization direction of BiFeO3 caused by the magnetoelectric coupling. We believe our findings will open new avenues towards magnetically induced renewable energy harvesting.

         <title>Distinct Crystal&#8208;Facet&#8208;Dependent Behaviors for Single&#8208;Atom Palladium&#8208;On&#8208;Ceria Catalysts: Enhanced Stabilization and Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct behaviors of single Pd atoms dispersed on different crystal facets of CeO2 is investigated. In situ characterizations reveal that the oxygen defects on the different facets of CeO2 can affect the formation and stability of single atoms. Pd atoms dispersed on CeO2(100) exhibit higher sinter&#8208;resistant performance than those on CeO2(111), and a different selectivity in the N&#8208;alkylation reaction.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance, fully atomically dispersed single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation industrial catalysts. However, it remains a great challenge to avoid the aggregation of isolated atoms into nanoparticles during the preparation and application of SACs. Here, the evolution of Pd species is investigated on different crystal facets of CeO2, and vastly different behaviors on the single&#8208;atomic dispersion of surface Pd atoms are surprisingly discovered. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ near&#8208;ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;XPS (NAP&#8208;XPS), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that, in a reducing atmosphere, more oxygen vacancies are generated on the (100) facet of CeO2, and Pd atoms can be trapped and thus feature atomic dispersion; by contrast, on the CeO2 (111) facet, Pd atoms will readily aggregate into clusters (Pdn). Furthermore, Pd1/CeO2(100) gives a high selectivity of 90.3% for the catalytic N&#8208;alkylation reaction, which is 2.8 times higher than that for Pdn/CeO2(111). This direct evidence demonstrates the crucial role of crystal&#8208;facet effects in the preparation of metal&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide SACs. This work thus opens an avenue for the rational design and targeted synthesis of ultrastable and sinter&#8208;resistant SACs.

The authors propose an ionic hydrogel with outstanding self&#8208;healing ability, ultra&#8208;stretchability, and conductivity in cryogenic environments. The artificial nerve fiber (SSANF) is fabricated based on the ionic hydrogel through bionic structural design. The SSANF enables stable information and energy transmission when connected to the biomimetic intelligent robot, even under big deformation and &#8722;78.5&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Self&#8208;healing materials behave with irreplaceable advantages in biomimetic intelligent robots (BIR) for avoiding or reducing safety hazards and economic losses from accidental damage during service. However, the self&#8208;healing ability is unreservedly lost and even becomes rigid and fragile in the cryogenic environment where BIR are precisely needed. Here, the authors report a versatile ionic hydrogel with fast self&#8208;healing ability, ultra&#8208;stretchability, and stable conductivity, even at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C. The hydrogel is systematically optimized to improve a hydrogen&#8208;bonded network nanostructure, coordinated achieving a quick self&#8208;healing ability within 10&#160;min, large deformation tolerance of over 7000%, superior conductivity of 11.76 S cm&#8722;1 and anti&#8208;freezing ability, which is difficult to obtain simultaneously. Such a hydrogel provides new opportunities for artificial electronic devices in harsh environments. As a prospective application, they fabricate an artificial nerve fiber by mimicking the structure and functions of the myelinated axon, exhibiting the property of fast and potential&#8208;gated signal transmission. This artificial nerve fiber is integrated into a robot for demonstrating a real&#8208;time high fidelity and high throughput information interaction under big deformation and cryogenic temperature. The hydrogel and bionic device will bring pioneering functions for robots and open a broad application scenario in extreme conditions.

         <title>Anionic Lipid Nanoparticles Preferentially Deliver mRNA to the Hepatic Reticuloendothelial System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) capable of delivering therapeutic RNA to specific cells in the body are required if the immense potential of these plug&#8208;and&#8208;play technologies is to be realized. Using embryonic zebrafish as a predictive in vivo model and with a thorough understanding of the nano&#8211;biointeractions involved, LNPs capable of preferential messenger RNA delivery to hepatic reticuloendothelial system cells are rationally designed.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP&#8208;based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP&#8208;based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP&#8211;mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES&#8208;targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver&#8208;specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano&#8211;biointeractions involved.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Observation of Near&#8208;Intrinsic Exciton Linewidth in Monolayer WS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 7.18 meV near&#8208;intrinsic exciton linewidth in monolayer WS2 is achieved at room temperature by coupling it with a moderate&#8208;refractive&#8208;index hydrogenated silicon nanosphere in water. The dielectric nanosphere is designed to boost the dynamic competition between WS2 exciton and trion decay channels and rebuild the excitonic relaxation processes with suppressed exciton nonradiative recombination. A tunable exciton linewidth is also demonstrated.








Abstract
The homogeneous exciton linewidth, which captures the coherent quantum dynamics of an excitonic state, is a vital parameter in exploring light&#8211;matter interactions in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). An efficient control of the exciton linewidth is of great significance, and in particular of its intrinsic linewidth, which determines the minimum timescale for the coherent manipulation of excitons. However, such a control is rarely achieved in TMDs at room temperature (RT). While the intrinsic A exciton linewidth is down to 7 meV in monolayer WS2, the reported RT linewidth is typically a few tens of meV due to inevitable homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening effects. Here, it is shown that a 7.18 meV near&#8208;intrinsic linewidth can be observed at RT when monolayer WS2 is coupled with a moderate&#8208;refractive&#8208;index hydrogenated silicon nanosphere in water. By boosting the dynamic competition between exciton and trion decay channels in WS2 through the nanosphere&#8208;supported Mie resonances, the coherent linewidth can be tuned from 35 down to 7.18 meV. Such modulation of exciton linewidth and its associated mechanism are robust even in presence of defects, easing the sample quality requirement and providing new opportunities for TMD&#8208;based nanophotonics and optoelectronics.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
The indispensable requirement for sustainable development of human society has forced almost all countries to seek highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective ways to harvest and convert solar energy. Though continuous progress has advanced, it remains a daunting challenge to achieve full&#8208;spectrum solar absorption and maximize the conversion efficiency of sunlight. Recently, thermoplasmonics has emerged as a promising solution, which involves several beneficial effects including enhanced light absorption and scattering, generation and relaxation of hot carriers, as well as localized/collective heating, offering tremendous opportunities for optimized energy conversion. Besides, all these functionalities can be tailored via elaborated designs of materials and nanostructures. In this review, first the fundamental physics governing thermoplasmonics is presented and then the strategies for both material selection and nanostructured designs toward more efficient energy conversion are summarized. Based on this, recent progress in thermoplasmonic applications including solar evaporation, photothermal chemistry, and thermophotovoltaic is reviewed. Finally, the corresponding challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Antibacterial Strategies Enabled by Gene&#8208;Transfection and Immunomodulatory Nanoparticles in 3D&#8208;printed Scaffolds for Synergistic Exogenous and Endogenous Treatment of Infections</title>

As research on refractory Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;related implant infection intensifies, certain challenges remain, including low antibiotic concentrations within infected areas, immune escape achieved by intracellular bacteria, myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) inducing regional immunosuppression, and recurrence of residual pathogenic bacteria after drug suspension. Herein, we propose a novel antimicrobial system to simultaneously address these issues. Specifically, we have designed an oxygen species&#8208;responsive 3D printed scaffold with shell&#8208;core nanoparticles, which are loaded with an antimicrobial peptide plasmid (LL37 plasmid) and have LL37 grafted on their surface (LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37). The surface&#8208;grafted LL37 directly kills S. aureus and, following entry into cells, the nanoparticles kill intracellular bacteria. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo, following translation of the LL37 plasmid, cells function as factories of the antimicrobial peptide, thereby generating a continuous, prolonged, antibacterial effect at the site of infection. This system significantly reduces the abnormal increase in MDSCs within the infected microenvironment, thus, relieving the immunosuppressive state and restoring a protective antimicrobial immune response. Hence, this proposed antimicrobial system provides an antimicrobial immune response. Hence, this proposed antimicrobial system provides a novel strategy for S. aureus&#8208;related infections by offering a combined active antimicrobial and immunotherapeutic strategy, thereby significantly reducing the recurrence rate following recovery from implant&#8208;associated infections.

         <title>A biomaterial&#8208;based hedging immune strategy for scarless tendon healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Scarring rather than regeneration, is an inevitable outcome of unbalanced amplifications of inflammation&#8208;destructive signals and atresia of the regenerative niche. However, identifying and effectively hedging against the risk of scarring and realizing the conversion of regenerative cues remain difficult. In this paper, we report a hedging immune strategy based microfibrous membrane (Him&#8208;MFM) by tethering distearoyl phosphoethanolamine layer&#8208;supported copoly(lactic/glycolic acid) electrospun fibers with identified CD11b+/CD68+ scarring subpopulation membranes in the immune landscape after tendon injury to counterweigh tissue damage. Him&#8208;MFM, carrying relevant risk receptors was shown to shift high type I biased polarization, alleviate apoptosis and metabolic stress, and mitigate inflammatory tenocyte response. Remarkably, the hedging immune strategy reversed the damaged tendon sheath barrier to the innate IL&#8208;33 secretory phenotype by 4.36 times and initiated the mucous&#8208;IL&#8208;33&#8208;Th2 axis, directly supplying a transient but obligate regenerative niche for sheath stem cell proliferation. In murine flexor tendon injury, the wrapping of Him&#8208;MFM alleviated pathological responses, protected tenocytes in situ, and restored hierarchically arranged collagen fibers covered with basement membrane, structurally and functionally comparable to mature tendons, demonstrating that hedging immunity is a promising strategy to yield regenerative responses not scarring.

         <title>A Van der Waals Interface Hosting Two Groups of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple groups of magnetic skyrmions add an additional degree of freedom for skyrmion&#8208;based ultrahigh&#8208;density memory devices. Vertical imprinting of magnetic skyrmions in 2D layered magnetic heterostructures are reported. Two sets of topological Hall effects are observed at low temperatures and these two groups of skyrmions are directly imaged using magnetic force microscopy.








Abstract
Multiple magnetic skyrmion phases add an additional degree of freedom for skyrmion&#8208;based ultrahigh&#8208;density spin memory devices. Extending the field to 2D van der Waals magnets is a rewarding challenge, where the realizable degree of freedoms (e.g., thickness, twist angle, and electrical gating) and high skyrmion density result in intriguing new properties and enhanced functionality. In this work, a van der Waals interface, formed by two 2D ferromagnets Cr2Ge2Te6 and Fe3GeTe2 with a Curie temperature of &#8776;65 and &#8776;205 K, respectively, hosting two groups of magnetic skyrmions, is reported. Two sets of topological Hall effect signals are observed below 6s0 K when Cr2Ge2Te6 is magnetically ordered. These two groups of skyrmions are directly imaged using magnetic force microscopy, and supported by micromagnetic simulations. Interestingly, the magnetic skyrmions persist in the heterostructure with zero applied magnetic field. The results are promising for the realization of skyrmionic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures hosting multiple skyrmion&#160;phases.

         <title>Soft Actuators Made of Discrete Grains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;change actuators have been shown to achieve useful volumetric expansions. Simultaneously, granular systems are able to flow, jam, and exhibit unique bulk properties. In this work, granular actuators are introduced, where each grain is a phase&#8208;change actuator. Grains can be used independently for micro&#8208;actuation, in agglomerates for macro&#8208;actuation, can flow for freeform actuator printability, and exhibit compatibility with various granular assembly designs.








Abstract
Recent work has demonstrated the potential of actuators consisting of bulk elastomers with phase&#8208;changing inclusions for generating high forces and large volumetric expansions. Simultaneously, granular assemblies have been shown to enable tunable properties via different packings, dynamic moduli via jamming, and compatibility with various printing methods via suspension in carrier fluids. Herein, granular actuators are introduced, which represent a new class of soft actuators made of discrete grains. The soft grains consist of a hyperelastic shell and multiple solvent cores. Upon heating, the encapsulated solvent cores undergo liquid&#8208;to&#8208;gas phase change, inducing rapid and strong volumetric expansion of the hyperelastic shell up to 700%. The grains can be used independently for micro&#8208;actuation, or in granular agglomerates for meso&#8208; and macroscale actuation, demonstrating the scalability of the granular actuators. Furthermore, the active grains can be suspended in a carrier resin or solvent to enable printable soft actuators via established granular material processing techniques. By combining the advantages of phase&#8208;change soft actuation and granularity, this work presents the opportunity to realize soft actuators with tunable bulk properties, compatibility with self&#8208;assembly techniques, and on&#8208;demand reconfigurability.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;1D Electronic Transport in a 2D Magnetic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CrSBr is a 2D semiconductor of interest for its magnetic properties. Temperature&#8208; and gate&#8208;dependent transport exhibit an extreme anisotropy (ca. 102 to 105)&#8212;stronger than in any other 2D semiconductor&#8212;and the photocurrent shows clear signatures of 1D behavior. This work shows that CrSBr is a quasi&#8208;1D electronic system, a unique characteristic in the panorama of known 2D semiconductors.








Abstract
Electronic transport through exfoliated multilayers of CrSBr, a 2D semiconductor of interest because of its magnetic properties, is investigated. An extremely pronounced anisotropy manifesting itself in qualitative and quantitative differences of all quantities measured along the in&#8208;plane a and b crystallographic directions is found. In particular, a qualitatively different dependence of the conductivities &#963;a and &#963;b on temperature and gate voltage, accompanied by orders of magnitude differences in their values (&#963;b/&#963;a&#160;&#8776; 3 &#215; 102&#160;to 105 at low temperature and negative gate voltage) are observed, together with a different behavior of the longitudinal magnetoresistance in the two directions and the complete absence of the Hall effect in transverse resistance measurements. These observations appear not to be compatible with a description in terms of conventional band transport of a 2D doped semiconductor. The observed phenomenology&#8212;and unambiguous signatures of a 1D van Hove singularity detected in energy&#8208;resolved photocurrent measurements&#8212;indicate that electronic transport through CrSBr multilayers is better interpreted by considering the system as formed by weakly and incoherently coupled 1D wires, than by conventional 2D band transport. It is concluded that CrSBr is the first 2D semiconductor to show distinctly quasi&#8208;1D electronic transport properties.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production by Seawater Electrolysis Coupling Sulfion Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seawater electrolysis coupling sulfion degradation enables energy&#8208;saving and chlorine&#8208;free hydrogen production at low electricity expense while rapidly degrading sulfion pollutants to value&#8208;added sulfur for better sustainability.








Abstract
Electrolysis of costless and infinite seawater is a promising way toward grid&#8208;scale hydrogen production without causing freshwater stress. Practical potential of this technology, however, is hindered by low energy efficiency and anode corrosion by the detrimental chlorine chemistry in seawater in addition to unaffordable electricity expense. Herein, energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production is reported by chlorine&#8208;free seawater splitting coupling sulfion oxidation. It yields hydrogen at a low cell voltage of 0.97&#160;V, cutting the electricity consumption to 2.32&#160;kWh per m3 H2 at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Compared to alkaline water electrolysis, the energy expense is primarily saved by 60% with 50% lower energy equivalent input. Benefiting from the ultralow cell voltage, the hazardous chlorine chemistry is fully avoided without anode corrosion regardless of Cl&#8722; crossover. Meanwhile, it also allows fast degradation of S2&#8722; pollutant from the water body to value&#8208;added sulfur with 80% efficiency, for further reducing hydrogen cost and protection of the ecosystem. Connecting such a hybrid seawater electrolyzer to a commercial solar cell can harvest the hydrogen from seawater with better sustainability. This work may offer new opportunities for low&#8208;cost hydrogen production from the unlimited ocean resources with environmental protection.

         <title>The Development of Chiral Nanoparticles to Target NK Cells and CD8+ T Cells for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral nanoparticles (NPs) are developed as tumor immunoadjuvants for the treatment and prevention of cancer by stimulating both the innate and acquired immune responses. It is revealed that chiral NPs stimulate the expression of cytokines to induce cytotoxic activity in natural killer (NK) cells, while the CD8+ T cells are activated to eliminate tumor cells via antigen cross presentation.








Abstract
The chirality of nanomaterials (nanoparticles, NPs) can influence their interaction with cells and biological systems. However, how chirality can exert impact on the immune response has yet to be investigated. Here, the immunological effect of chiral nanomaterials is investigated as a therapeutic and preventive option against tumors. Compared with achiral nanoparticles, chiral NPs with a g&#8208;factor of 0.44 are shown to enhance both innate and acquired immunity against tumor growth. It is also found that chiral NPs enhance the activation of CD8+ T and natural killer cells (CD69+ NK cells) by stimulating dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, L&#8208;type NPs induce a 1.65&#8208;fold higher proportion of CD8+ T and CD69+ NK cells than D&#8208;type NPs. Next, the therapeutic and preventative effects of chiral NPs against tumors in a EG7.OVA tumor model are investigated. It is found that L&#8208;type NPs have a significant greater ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and prolong the survival time of model mice than D&#8208;type NPs. Mice treated with L&#8208;type NPs induce the activation of 84.98&#160;&#177; 6.63% CD8+ T cells and 33.62&#160;&#177; 3.41% of NK cells in tumor tissues; these are 1.62&#8208;fold and 1.39&#8208;fold higher than that seen in the mice treated with D&#8208;type NPs. Mechanistic studies reveal that chiral NPs exert mechanical force on bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and stimulate the expression of cytokines to induce cytotoxic activity in NK cells. Synergistically, the CD8+ T cells are stimulated to eliminate tumor cells via antigen cross presentation. The force of interaction between L&#8208;type NPs and cells is higher than that for D&#8208;NPs, thus further promoting the activation of NK cells and CD8+ T cells and their infiltration into tumor tissue. These findings open up a new avenue for chiral nanomaterials to act as immunoadjuvants for the prevention and treatment of cancer.

         <title>A Transformable Amphiphilic and Block Polymer&#8722;Dendron Conjugate for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Retention with Cellular Homeostasis Perturbation via Membrane Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme&#8208;triggered stealthy&#8208;to&#8208;sticky transformation of a polymer&#8722;dendron conjugate can both meliorate its tumor tissue distribution and perturb cancer cellular homeostasis via the membrane flow process. This work presents a versatile approach to augmenting the tumor therapeutic efficacy of a nanomedicine via manipulation of its interactions with tumor membrane systems.








Abstract
Efficient penetration and retention of therapeutic agents in tumor tissues can be realized through rational design of drug delivery systems. Herein, a polymer&#8722;dendron conjugate, POEGMA&#8208;b&#8208;p(GFLG&#8208;Dendron&#8208;Ppa) (GFLG&#8208;DP), is presented, which allows a cathepsin&#8208;B&#8208;triggered stealthy&#8208;to&#8208;sticky structural transformation. The compositions and ratios are optimized through dissipative particle dynamics simulations. GFLG&#8208;DP displays tumor&#8208;specific transformation and the consequently released dendron&#8208;Ppa is found to effectively accumulate on the tumor cell membrane. The interaction between the dendron&#8208;Ppa and the tumor cell membrane results in intracellular and intercellular transport via membrane flow, thus achieving efficient deep penetration and prolonged retention of therapeutic agents in the solid tumor tissues. Meanwhile, the interaction of dendron&#8208;Ppa with the endoplasmic reticulum disrupts cell homeostasis, making tumor cells more vulnerable and susceptible to photodynamic therapy. This platform represents a versatile approach to augmenting the tumor therapeutic efficacy of a nanomedicine via manipulation of its interactions with tumor membrane systems.

         <title>An Engineered Protein&#8722;Au Bioplaster for Efficient Skin Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of engineered protein&#8722;Au bioplaster with outstanding photothermal effect is developed. In this system, the adhesion performance can be enhanced significantly as prolonging irradiation time to achieve stable adhesion on skin surface. This further promotes the heat penetration into the skin tumor site for non&#8208;invasive thermal eradication of melanoma.








Abstract
Melanoma is the most lethal malignancy in skin cancer and may occur at any site and express melanocytes. Due to malignant melanoma's invasion and migration nature, conventional therapies make it challenging to remove the whole tumor tissue while undertaking the high risks of tumor recurrence. Regarding the emerging targeted therapies and immunotherapy, drug resistance and low immunotherapeutic activity remain significant challenges. It is thus becoming urgently important to develop alternative strategies for melanoma therapy. Herein, a novel bifunctional protein&#8208;based photothermal bioplaster (PPTB) is developed for non&#8208;invasive tumor therapy and skin tissue regeneration. The complexation of adhesive protein and gold nanorods (GNRs) endow the obtained PPTB with good biocompatibility, controllable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated adhesion performance, and high photothermal performance. Therefore, the PPTB bioagent facilitates skin adhesion and effectively transfers heat from skin to tumor. This behavior endows PPTB capability to eradicate skin tumors conveniently. Thus, the assembly strategy enables this hybrid bioplaster to hold great potential for skin&#8208;related tumor treatment.

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;Double&#8208;Layer Solid Electrolyte with Adjustable Interphases Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;double&#8208;layer solid electrolyte is designed by using different kinds of plasticizers coupled with a polymer. Through the in situ polymerization of propylene carbonate on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, to form a protective layer, the oxidation and cycling stability of the cathode are improved. The low&#8208;voltage stability and fast ion transmission is improved by the affinity of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and poly(vinylidene fluoride).








Abstract
Increasing the energy density and long&#8208;term cycling stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries necessitates the stability of electrolytes under high/low voltage application and stable electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact.

&lt;p&gt;A quasi-double-layer solid electrolyte is designed by using different kinds of plasticizers coupled with a polymer. Through the in situ polymerization of propylene carbonate on LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to form a protective layer, the oxidation and cycling stability of the cathode are improved. The low-voltage stability and fast ion transmission is improved by the affinity of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and poly(vinylidene fluoride).

&lt;p&gt;Increasing the energy density and long-term cycling stability of lithium-ion batteries necessitates the stability of electrolytes under high/low voltage application and stable electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact. However, neither a single polymer nor liquid electrolyte can realize this due to their limited internal energy gap, which cannot avoid lithium-metal deposition and electrolyte oxidation simultaneously. Herein, a novel type of quasi-double-layer composite polymer electrolytes (QDL-CPEs) is proposed by using plasticizers with high oxidation stability (propylene carbonate) and high reduction stability (diethylene glycol dimethyl ether) in a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based electrolyte composites. In-situ-polymerized propylene carbonate can function as a cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) film, which can enhance the antioxidant ability. The nucleophilic substitution reaction between diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and PVDF increases the reduction stability of the electrolyte on the anodic side, without the formation of lithium dendrites.

         <title>Unraveling Heat Transport and Dissipation in Suspended MoSe2 from Bulk to Monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study using Raman thermometry and ab initio simulations to unravel the heat transport properties of suspended MoSe2 crystals with systematic thickness variation down to the monolayer. Monolayer films have almost the same in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity as bulk material thanks to an additional heat&#8208;carrying low&#8208;frequency mode. Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane heat dissipation to air is extremely efficient for the thinnest flakes.








Abstract
Understanding heat flow in layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals is crucial for applications exploiting these materials. Despite significant efforts, several basic thermal transport properties of TMDs are currently not well understood, in particular how transport is affected by material thickness and the material's environment. This combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study establishes a unifying physical picture of the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of the representative TMD MoSe2. Thermal conductivity measurements using Raman thermometry on a large set of clean, crystalline, suspended crystals with systematically varied thickness are combined with ab initio simulations with phonons at finite temperature. The results show that phonon dispersions and lifetimes change strongly with thickness, yet the thinnest TMD films exhibit an in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity that is only marginally smaller than that of bulk crystals. This is the result of compensating phonon contributions, in particular heat&#8208;carrying modes around &#8776;0.1&#160;THz in (sub)nanometer thin films, with a surprisingly long mean free path of several micrometers. This behavior arises directly from the layered nature of the material. Furthermore, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane heat dissipation to air molecules is remarkably efficient, in particular for the thinnest crystals, increasing the apparent thermal conductivity of monolayer MoSe2 by an order of magnitude. These results are crucial for the design of (flexible) TMD&#8208;based (opto&#8208;)electronic&#160;applications.

         <title>Multiferroic&#8208;Enabled Magnetic&#8208;Excitons in 2D Quantum&#8208;Entangled Van der Waals Antiferromagnet NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum&#8208;entangled magnetic excitons develop in a triangular multiferroic NiI2 when it goes through a second phase transition at low temperatures. In this graph of optical absorption data, the bright regions indicate where two exciton&#8208;related peaks appear below the second magnetic phase transition as indicated by the dashed line. The many&#8208;body calculations show that this exciton arises from a transition between two quantum&#8208;entangled states of Zhang&#8211;Rice triplet and Zhang&#8211;Rice singlet states.








Abstract
Matter&#8211;light interaction is at the center of diverse research fields from quantum optics to condensed matter physics, opening new fields like laser physics. A magnetic exciton is one such rare example found in magnetic insulators. However, it is relatively rare to observe that external variables control matter&#8208;light interaction. Here, it is reported that the broken inversion symmetry of multiferroicity can act as an external knob enabling magnetic excitons in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiI2. It is further discovered that this magnetic exciton arises from a transition between Zhang&#8211;Rice&#8208;triplet and Zhang&#8211;Rice&#8208;singlet fundamentally quantum&#8208;entangled states. This quantum entanglement produces an ultrasharp optical exciton peak at 1.384&#160;eV with a 5 meV linewidth. The work demonstrates that NiI2 is 2D magnetically ordered with an intrinsically quantum&#8208;entangled ground state.

         <title>Highly Transparent and Self&#8208;Healable Solar Thermal Anti&#8208;/Deicing Surfaces: When Ultrathin MXene Multilayers Marry a Solid Slippery Self&#8208;Cleaning Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar anti&#8208;/deicing surfaces, exhibiting high transparency (coated glass, transmittance &gt;77%&#160;at 550&#160;nm) and photothermal healability, are fabricated on various substrates, by applying a solid omniphobic slippery coating onto layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer&#8208;assembled MXene multilayers. The surface temperature rises by 31 &#176;C under 1.0 sun illumination for anti&#8208;/deicing applications, and the surface possesses self&#8208;cleaning capability to spontaneously shed waterborne and organic liquids.








Abstract
Solar anti&#8208;/deicing can solve icing problems by converting sunlight into heat. One of the biggest problems, which has long been plaguing the design of solar anti&#8208;/deicing surfaces, is that photothermal materials are always lightproof and appear black, because of the mutual exclusiveness between generating heat and retaining transparency. Herein, a highly transparent and scalable solar anti&#8208;/deicing surface is reported, which enables the coated glass to exhibit high transparency (&gt;77% transmittance at 550&#160;nm) and meanwhile causes a &gt;30 &#176;C&#160;surface temperature increase relative to the ambient environment under 1.0 sun illumination. Such a transparent anti&#8208;/deicing surface can be fabricated onto a large class of substrates (e.g., glass, ceramics, metals, plastics), by applying a solid omniphobic slippery coating onto layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer&#8208;assembled ultrathin MXene multilayers. Hence, the surface possesses a self&#8208;cleaning ability to shed waterborne and oil&#8208;based liquids thanks to residue&#8208;free slipping motion. Passive anti&#8208;icing and active deicing capabilities are, respectively, obtained on the solar thermal surface, which effectively prevents water from freezing and simultaneously melts pre&#8208;formed ice and thick frost. The self&#8208;cleaning effect enables residue&#8208;free removal of unfrozen water and interfacially melted ice/frost to boost the anti&#8208;/deicing efficiency. Importantly, the surface is capable of self&#8208;healing under illumination to repair physical damage and chemical degradation.

         <title>2D FeP Nanoframe Superlattices via Space&#8208;Confined Topochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D superlattices comprising monolayer FeP nanoframes are designed and synthesized through a space&#8208;confined topochemical transformation approach, using carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices as a precursor. The resulting 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices possess a number of unique features unavailable in conventional nanocrystal superlattices, which make them particularly promising as highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled nanocrystal superlattices represent an emergent class of designer materials with potentially programmable functionalities. The ability to construct hierarchically structured nanocrystal superlattices with tailored geometry and porosity is critical for extending their applications.

&lt;p&gt;Self-assembled nanocrystal superlattices represent an emergent class of designer materials with potentially programmable functionalities. The ability to construct hierarchically structured nanocrystal superlattices with tailored geometry and porosity is critical for extending their applications.

         <title>Escalating Ferromagnetic Order via Se&#8208;Vacancies Near Vanadium in WSe2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhancement of ferromagnetism is demonstrated via Se&#8208;vacancy engineering in V&#8208;doped WSe2 diluted magnetic semiconductors and the underlying mechanism is elucidated. After generation of abundant Se&#8208;vacancies via heat&#8208;treatment, butterfly&#8208;shaped hysteresis in the magnetoresistance curves and distinct magnetic domains are clearly observed. With state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art atomic elemental mapping and comprehensive theoretical explanation, the origin of the enhanced ferromagnetism is revealed.








Abstract
Magnetic order has been proposed to arise from a variety of defects, including vacancies, antisites, and grain boundaries, which are relevant in numerous electronics and spintronics applications. Nevertheless, its magnetism remains controversial due to the lack of structural analysis. The escalation of ferromagnetism in vanadium&#8208;doped WSe2 monolayer is herein demonstrated by tailoring complex configurations of Se vacancies (SeVac) via post heat&#8208;treatment. Structural analysis of atomic defects is systematically performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), enabled by the monolayer nature. Temperature&#8208;dependent magnetoresistance hysteresis ensures enhanced magnetic order after high&#8208;temperature heat&#8208;treatment, consistent with magnetic domain analysis from magnetic force microscopy (MFM). The vanadium&#8211;Se vacancy pairing is a key to promoting ferromagnetism via spin&#8208;flip by electron transfer, predicted from density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations. The approach toward nanodefect engineering paves a way to overcome weak magnetic order in diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) for renovating semiconductor spintronics.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Treatment for Highest&#8208;Efficiency Ambient Printed Stable All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ionic liquid, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate (EMIMHSO4), is employed for managing defects in printed cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) films. The EMIMHSO4 can succesfully regulate perovskite thin&#8208;film growth and strongly coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+, which enable the achievement of the highest&#8208;efficiencies ambient printed CsPbI3 solar cells, both under 1 sun illumination (20.01%, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and indoor light illumination (37.24%, 1000 lux, 365 &#181;W cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) perovskite is well known for its unparalleled stability at high temperatures up to 500 &#176;C and under oxidative chemical stresses. However, upscaling solar cells via ambient printing suffers from imperfect crystal quality and defects caused by uncontrollable crystallization. Here, the incorporation of a low concentration of novel ionic liquid is reported as being promising for managing defects in CsPbI3 films, interfacial energy alignment, and device stability of solar cells fabricated via ambient blade&#8208;coating. Both theoretical simulations and experimental measurements reveal that the ionic liquid successfully regulates the perovskite thin&#8208;film growth to decrease perovskite grain boundaries, strongly coordinates with the undercoordinated Pb2+ to passivate iodide vacancy defects, aligns the interface to decrease the energy barrier at the electron&#8208;transporting layer, and relaxes the lattice strain to promote phase stability. Consequently, ambient printed CsPbI3 solar cells with power conversion efficiency as high as 20.01% under 1 sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and 37.24% under indoor light illumination (1000 lux, 365 &#181;W cm&#8722;2) are achieved; both are the highest for printed all&#8208;inorganic cells for corresponding applications. Furthermore, the bare cells show an impressive long&#8208;term ambient stability with only &#8776;5% PCE degradation after 1000 h aging under ambient conditions.

         <title>A New Durable Surface Nanoparticles&#8208;Modified Perovskite Cathode for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells from Selective Cation Exsolution under Oxidizing Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major perovskite phase, m&#8208;BCFZYN&#8208;095, in BCFZYN&#8208;095 has high proton conductivity, and NiO nanoparticles on the surface effectively improve the oxygen surface exchange rate, thereby simultaneously increasing proton and oxygen ion conductivities of the BCFZYN&#8208;095 composite. Consequently, favorable peak power densities of a protonic ceramic fuel cell with the BCFZYN&#8208;095 composite cathode in H2 are obtained.








Abstract
A high&#8208;performance cathode of a protonic ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) should possess excellent oxygen reduction reactivity, high proton/oxygen&#8208;ion/electron conductivity, and sufficient operational stability, thus requiring a delicate tuning of both the bulk and surface properties of the electrode material. Although surface modification of perovskites with nanoparticles from reducing&#8208;atmosphere exsolution has been demonstrated effective at improving the electrochemical anodic oxidation, such nanoparticles would easily re&#8208;incorporate into the perovskite lattice causing a big challenge for their application as a cathode. Here, a durable perovskite&#8208;based nanocomposite cathode for PCFCs is reported, which is facilely prepared via the exsolution of nanoparticles in an oxidizing atmosphere. Through composition and cation nonstoichiometry manipulation, a precursor with the nominal composition of Ba0.95(Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1)0.95Ni0.05O3&#8722;&#948; (BCFZYN&#8208;095) is designed, synthesized, and investigated, which, upon calcination, gives rise to the formation of a perovskite&#8208;based nanocomposite comprising a major perovskite phase and a minor NiO phase enriched on the perovskite surface. The major perovskite phase enabled by the proper cation nonstoichiometry manipulation promotes bulk proton conduction while the NiO nanoparticles facilitate the oxygen surface exchange process, leading to a superior cathodic performance with a maximum peak power density of 1040&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and excellent operational stability of 400 h at 550&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Dopant Selection for Metal Oxide&#8208;Based Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting: The Case Study of Fe2O3 and CuO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning is applied to guide rational dopant selection in metal oxide photoelectrodes with improved photoelectrochemical water splitting performance. The chemical state is found to be the most significant factor for dopant selection, while dopants with stronger metal&#8211;oxygen bond and larger ionic radius are preferred for charge separation and transfer.








Abstract
Doping is an effective strategy for tuning metal oxide&#8208;based semiconductors for solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Despite decades of extensive research effort, the dopant selection is still largely dependent on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach.

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is applied to guide rational dopant selection in metal oxide photoelectrodes with improved photoelectrochemical water splitting performance. The chemical state is found to be the most significant factor for dopant selection, while dopants with stronger metal&#8211;oxygen bond and larger ionic radius are preferred for charge separation and transfer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doping is an effective strategy for tuning metal oxide-based semiconductors for solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Despite decades of extensive research effort, the dopant selection is still largely dependent on a trial-and-error approach. Machine learning (ML) is promising in providing predictable insights on the dopant selection for high-performing PEC systems because it can uncover correlations from the seemingly ambiguous linkages between vast features of dopants and the PEC performance of doped photoelectrodes. Herein, the authors successfully build ML model to predict the doping effect of 17 metal dopants into hematite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), a prototype photoelectrode material. Their findings disclose the critical parameters from the 10 intrinsic features of each dopant. The model is further experimentally validated by the coherent prediction on Y and La dopants&#8217; behaviors. Further interpretation of the ML model suggests that the chemical state is the most significant selection criteria, meanwhile, dopants with higher metal&#8211;oxygen bond formation enthalpy and larger ionic radius are favored in improving the charge separation and transfer (CST) in the Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoanodes. The generic feature of this ML guided selection criteria has been further extended to CuO-based photoelectrodes showing improved CST by alkaline metal ions doping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High Conductivity 1D &#960;&#8211;d Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Efficient Polysulfide Trapping&#8208;Diffusion&#8208;Catalysis in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Rationally designed multifunctional polysulfide mediators based on a novel 1D &#960;&#8211;d conjugated Ni&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D) are demonstrated as excellent cathode materials in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, realizing the adsorption&#8208;catalysis&#8208;conversion of polysulfides, and thus batteries with exceptional lifespan are delivered.








Abstract
The shuttling behavior and sluggish conversion kinetics of the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS) represent the main obstructions to the practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, a 1D &#960;&#8211;d conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D, is presented as an efficient sulfur host to overcome these limitations. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D is characterized by a remarkable binding strength for trapping soluble LiPS species. Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D also acts as an effective catalyst for S reduction during the discharge process and Li2S oxidation during the charging process. In addition, the delocalization of electrons in the &#960;&#8211;d system of Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D provides a superior electrical conductivity to improve electron transfer. Thus, cathodes based on Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D enable LSBs with excellent performance, for example, impressive cycling stability with over 82% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 3 C, superior rate performance of 575 mAh g&#8722;1 at 8 C, and a high areal capacity of 6.63 mAh cm&#8722;2 under raised sulfur loading of 6.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. The strategies and advantages here demonstrated can be extended to a broader range of &#960;&#8211;d conjugated MOFs materials, which the authors believe have a high potential as sulfur hosts in LSBs.

         <title>Fabrication of Stretchable Superamphiphobic Surfaces with Deformation&#8208;Induced Rearrangeable Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable and durable superamphiphobic surface is fabricated by a simple and low&#8208;cost spray&#8208;coating method. Low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids can easily slide off the surface, even when the tensile strain of the surface is &#8805;225%.








Abstract
Stretchable superamphiphobic surfaces with a high deformation resistance are in demand to achieve liquid&#8208;repellent performance in flexible electronics, artificial skin, and textile dressings. However, it is challenging to make mechanically robust superamphiphobic coatings, which maintain their superliquid repellency in a highly stretched state. Here, a stretchable superamphiphobic surface is reported, on which the microstructures can rearrange during stretching to maintain a stable superamphiphobicity even under a high tensile strain. The surface is prepared by spray&#8208;coating silicone nanofilaments onto a prestretched substrate (e.g., cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;polyisoprene) with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) layer as a binder. After subsequent fluorination, this surface keeps its superamphiphobicity to both water and n&#8208;hexadecane up to the tensile strain of at least 225%. The binding PDMS layer and rearrangeable structures maximize the deformation resistance of the surface during the stretching process. The superamphiphobicity and morphology of the surface are maintained even after 1000 stretch&#8211;release cycles. Taking advantage of the mentioned benefits, a liquid manipulation system is designed, which has the potential for fabricating reusable and low&#8208;cost platforms for biochemical detection and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.

         <title>Active and Passive Tuning of Ultranarrow Resonances in Polaritonic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;field nanoscopy monitors active and passive tuning of ultranarrow resonances in phononic nanoantennas over a wide spectral range (&#8722;35 cm&#8722;1, being the resonance linewidth &#8776;9 cm&#8722;1). Passive tunability can be realized by tailoring the dielectric environment of nanoantennas made of boron nitride, while reversible in situ tuning of narrow resonances is realized by placing nanoantennas on top of a graphene layer.








Abstract
Optical nanoantennas are of great importance for photonic devices and spectroscopy due to their capability of squeezing light at the nanoscale and enhancing light&#8211;matter interactions. Among them, nanoantennas made of polar crystals supporting phonon polaritons (phononic nanoantennas) exhibit the highest quality factors. This is due to the low optical losses inherent in these materials, which, however, hinder the spectral tuning of the nanoantennas due to their dielectric nature. Here, active and passive tuning of ultranarrow resonances in phononic nanoantennas is realized over a wide spectral range (&#8776;35 cm&#8722;1, being the resonance linewidth &#8776;9 cm&#8722;1), monitored by near&#8208;field nanoscopy. To do that, the local environment of a single nanoantenna made of hexagonal boron nitride is modified by placing it on different polar substrates, such as quartz and 4H&#8208;silicon carbide, or covering it with layers of a high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index van der Waals crystal (WSe2). Importantly, active tuning of the nanoantenna polaritonic resonances is demonstrated by placing it on top of a gated graphene monolayer in which the Fermi energy is varied. This work presents the realization of tunable polaritonic nanoantennas with ultranarrow resonances, which can find applications in active nanooptics and (bio)sensing.

         <title>A Wearable Microneedle&#8208;Based Extended Gate Transistor for Real&#8208;Time Detection of Sodium in Interstitial Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable microneedle&#8208;based extended gate field effect transistor for minimally invasive detection of sodium in the interstitial fluids and for real&#8208;time health monitoring is reported. The device exhibits excellent biocompatibility, and on&#8208;body mechanical stability and enables transfer of data via Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things platforms.








Abstract
Sodium is a prominent prognostic biomarker for assessing health status, such as dysnatremia. As of now, detection and monitoring of sodium levels in the human body is carried out by means of laborious and bulky laboratory equipmentand/or by offline analysis of various body fluids. Herein, an innovative stretchable, skin&#8208;conformal and fast&#8208;response microneedle extended&#8208;gate FET biosensor is reported for real&#8208;time detection of sodium in interstitial fluids for minimally invasive health monitoring along with high sensitivity, low limit of detection, excellent biocompatibility, and on&#8208;body mechanical stability. The integration of the reported device with a wireless&#8208;data transmitter and the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things cloud for real&#8208;time monitoring and long&#8208;term analysis is reported and discussed. This platform would eventually help bringing unlimited possibilities for effecient medical care and accurate clinical decision&#8208;making.

&lt;p&gt;A stretchable microneedle-based extended gate field effect transistor for minimally invasive detection of sodium in the interstitial fluids and for real-time health monitoring is reported. The device exhibits excellent biocompatibility, and on-body mechanical stability and enables transfer of data via Internet-of-Things platforms.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium is a prominent prognostic biomarker for assessing health status, such as dysnatremia. As of now, detection and monitoring of sodium levels in the human body is carried out by means of laborious and bulky laboratory equipmentand/or by offline analysis of various body fluids. Herein, an innovative stretchable, skin-conformal and fast-response microneedle extended-gate FET biosensor is reported for real-time detection of sodium in interstitial fluids for minimally invasive health monitoring along with high sensitivity, low limit of detection, excellent biocompatibility, and on-body mechanical stability. The integration of the reported device with a wireless-data transmitter and the Internet-of-Things cloud for real-time monitoring and long-term analysis is reported and discussed. This platform would eventually help bringing unlimited possibilities for effecient medical care and accurate clinical decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution via Strong Built&#8208;In Electric Field Induced by High Crystallinity of Perylene Imide Supramolecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline perylene imide supramolecular photocatalyst (PDI&#8208;NH) is successfully constructed via &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding. The PDI&#8208;NH performs a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), exceeding most of photocatalysts. The high crystallinity of PDI&#8208;NH ensures the built&#8208;in electric field, acting as a kinetic force to promote the charge separation.








Abstract
A highly crystalline perylene imide supramolecular photocatalyst (PDI&#8208;NH) is synthesized via imidazole solvent method. The catalyst shows a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) with apparent quantum yield of 10.4% at 400&#160;nm, which is 1353 times higher than the low crystalline PDI&#8208;NH. The highly crystalline structure comes from the ordered self&#8208;assembly process in molten imidazole solvent via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding. Further, the excellent performance ascribes to the robust built&#8208;in electric field induced by its high crystallinity, which greatly accelerates the charge separation and transfer. What is more, the PDI&#8208;NH is quite stable and can be reused over 50 h without performance attenuation. Briefly, the crystalline PDI&#8208;NH with strong built&#8208;in electric field throws light on photocatalytic oxygen evolution, showing a new perspective for the design of organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass Anode with an Exceptional Cycling&#8208;Induced Capacity Enhancement for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZIF glass (melt&#8208;quench Co ZIF&#8208;62 glass), for the first time, is evaluated as anode for high performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This ZIF glass anode exhibits an unusual capacity enhancement during charge&#8208;discharge cycling. This exceptional phenomenon is related to the unique structure of ZIF glass, e.g., short&#8208;range disorder.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise as high&#8208;energy anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their tunable chemistry, pore structure and abundant reaction sites. However, the pore structure of crystalline MOFs tends to collapse during lithium&#8208;ion insertion and extraction, and hence, their electrochemical performances are rather limited. As a critical breakthrough, a MOF glass anode for LIBs has been developed in the present work. In detail, it is fabricated by melt&#8208;quenching Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 (Co(Im)1.75(bIm)0.25) to glass, and then by combining glass with carbon black and binder. The derived anode exhibits high lithium storage capacity (306 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at of 2 A g&#8722;1), outstanding cycling stability, and superior rate performance compared with the crystalline Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 and the amorphous one prepared by high&#8208;energy ball&#8208;milling. Importantly, it is found that the Li&#8208;ion storage capacity of the MOF glass anode continuously rises with charge&#8211;discharge cycling and even tripled after 1000 cycles. Combined spectroscopic and structural analyses, along with density functional theory calculations, reveal the origin of the cycling&#8208;induced enhancement of the performances of the MOF glass anode, that is, the increased distortion and local breakage of the Co&#63743;N coordination bonds making the Li&#8208;ion intercalation sites more accessible.

         <title>A Minimalist Binary Vaccine Carrier for Personalized Postoperative Cancer Vaccine Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of minimalist vaccine carriers based on azole molecules&#8208;modified branched polyethylenimine is reported, which orchestrates the innate stimulating activity and antigen cross&#8208;presentation processes in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and achieves impressive personalized vaccine therapy results with the thus prepared binary vaccine.








Abstract
In recent years, significant evolutions have been made in applying nanotechnologies for prophylactic and therapeutic cancer vaccine design. However, the clinical translation of nanovaccines is still limited owing to their complicated compositions and difficulties in the spatiotemporal coordination of antigen&#8208;presenting cell activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation. Herein, a minimalist binary nanovaccine (BiVax) is designed that integrates innate stimulating activity into the carrier to elicit robust antitumor immunity. The authors started by making a series of azole molecules end&#8208;capped polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;M), and were&#160;surprised to find that over 60% of the PEI&#8208;M polymers have innate stimulating activity via activation of the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. PEI&#8208;4BImi, a PEI&#8208;M obtained from a series of polymers, elicits robust antitumor immune responses when used as a subcutaneously injected nanovaccine by simply mixing with ovalbumin antigens, and this BiVax system performs much better than the traditional ternary vaccine system, as well as, commercialized aluminum&#8208;containing adjuvants. This system also enables the fast preparation of personalized BiVax by compositing PEI&#8208;4BImi with autologous tumor cell membrane protein antigens, and a 60% postoperative cure rate is observed when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

         <title>Fully Synthetic 3D Fibrous Scaffolds for Stromal Tissues&#8212;Replacement of Animal&#8208;Derived Scaffold Materials Demonstrated by Multilayered Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of electrospun fibers and extensive amounts of porogens maximize the porosity of sub&#8208;micrometer fibrous scaffolds. The ensemble of loose fiber networks and appropriately sized pores enable the infiltration with stromal cells and the transformation to biological tissues. Thereby, the limitations of animal&#8208;derived scaffolds like decellularized tissues and hydrogels for tissue engineering applications or advanced therapy medicinal products are overcome.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) of soft tissues in vivo has remarkable biological and structural properties. Thereby, the ECM provides mechanical stability while it still can be rearranged via cellular remodeling during tissue maturation or healing processes. However, modern synthetic alternatives fail to provide these key features among basic properties. Synthetic matrices are usually completely degraded or are inert regarding cellular remodeling. Based on a refined electrospinning process, a method is developed to generate synthetic scaffolds with highly porous fibrous structures and enhanced fiber&#8208;to&#8208;fiber distances. Since this approach allows for cell migration, matrix remodeling, and ECM synthesis, the scaffold provides an ideal platform for the generation of soft tissue equivalents. Using this matrix, an electrospun&#8208;based multilayered skin equivalent composed of a stratified epidermis, a dermal compartment, and a subcutis is able to be generated without the use of animal matrix components. The extension of classical dense electrospun scaffolds with high porosities and motile fibers generates a fully synthetic and defined alternative to collagen&#8208;gel&#8208;based tissue models and is a promising system for the construction of tissue equivalents as in vitro models or in vivo implants.

A nontoxic, visible&#8208;blind quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based downconverting thin&#8208;film technology that offers a ninefold enhancement in the UV sensitivity of a silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor sensor without deteriorating its performance in the visible and near&#8208;infrared is reported. Additionally, a tandem stack of such QDs is reported, which enables UV&#8208;band discrimination in a cost effective and facile manner.








Abstract
Selective spectral detection of ultraviolet (UV) radiation is highly important across numerous fields from health and safety to industrial and environmental monitoring applications. Herein, a nontoxic, visible&#8208;blind, quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based sensing scheme that expands the spectral coverage of silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) sensors into the UV, enabling efficient UV detection without affecting the sensor performance in the visible and UV&#8208;band discrimination, is reported. This scheme uses zinc magnesium oxide (ZnMgO) QDs with compositionally tunable absorption across UV and high photoluminescence quantum yield in the visible. The efficient luminescence and large Stokes shift of these QDs are exploited herein to act as an efficient downconverting material that enhances the UV sensitivity of Si&#8208;photodetectors (Si&#8208;PDs). A Si&#8208;PD integrated with the QDs results in a ninefold improvement in photoresponsivity from 0.83 to 7.5&#160;mA W&#8722;1 at 260&#160;nm. Leveraging the tunability of these QDs, a simple UV&#8208;band identification scheme is further reported, which uses two distinct&#8208;bandgap ZnMgO QDs stacked in a tandem architecture whose spectral emission color depends on the UV&#8208;band excitation light. The downconverting stack enables facile discrimination of UV light using a standard CMOS image sensor (camera) or by the naked eye and avoids the use of complex optics.

         <title>Synergistic Disruption of Metabolic Homeostasis through Hyperbranched Poly(ethylene glycol) Conjugates as Nanotherapeutics to Constrain Cancer Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanotherapeutic is presented for combination therapy through controllable co&#8208;delivery of doxorubicin and pyropheophorbide&#8208;a using nanoparticles (HP&#8208;PD NPs) co&#8208;assembled from two hyperbranched polymer&#8208;based conjugates (HP&#8208;P and HP&#8208;D). The demonstrated tumor suppression effect can result from the reduced protein translation due to disruption of metabolic homeostasis as evidenced by metabolic variations.








Abstract
Combination therapy is a promising approach for effective treatment of tumors through synergistically regulating pathways. However, the synergistic effect is limited, likely by uncontrolled co&#8208;delivery of different therapeutic payloads in a single nanoparticle. Herein, a combination nanotherapeutic is developed by using two amphiphilic conjugates, hyperbranched poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (Ppa) (HP&#8208;P) and hyperbranched poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;doxorubicin (DOX) (HP&#8208;D) to construct co&#8208;assembly nanoparticles (HP&#8208;PD NPs) for controllably co&#8208;loading and co&#8208;delivering Ppa and DOX. In vitro and in vivo antitumor studies confirm the synergistic effect of photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy from HP&#8208;PD NPs. Metabolic variations reveal that tumor suppression is associated with disruption of metabolic homeostasis, leading to reduced protein translation. This study uncovers the manipulation of metabolic changes in tumor cells through disruption of cellular homeostasis using HP&#8208;PD NPs and provides a new insight into the rational design of synergistic nanotherapeutics for combination therapy.

         <title>Treatment of Ruptured and Nonruptured Aneurysms Using a Semisolid Iodinated Embolic Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel semisolid gel embolization agent is presented to achieve instant occlusion of saccular aneurysms. This approach is&#160;developed, optimized, and tested in vitro, in 3D models, in vivo in rat and in porcine arterial aneurysms. Most importantly, in ruptured porcine aneurysms causing catastrophic bleeding, the gel embolic material is able to achieve instant hemostasis in survival experiments.








Abstract
Saccular aneurysms (SAs) are focal outpouchings from the lateral wall of an artery. Depending on their morphology and location, minimally invasive treatment options include coil embolization, flow diverter stents, stent&#8208;assisted coiling, and liquid embolics. Many drawbacks are associated with these treatment options including recanalization, delayed healing, rebleeding, malpositioning of the embolic or stent, stent stenosis, and even rupture of the SA. To overcome these drawbacks, a nanoclay&#8208;based shear&#8208;thinning hydrogel (STH) is&#160;developed for the endovascular treatment of SAs. Extensive in vitro testing is&#160;performed to optimize STH performance, visualization, injectability, and endothelialization in cell culture. Femoral artery saccular aneurysm models in rats and in pigs are&#160;created to test stability, efficacy, immune response, endothelialization, and biocompatibility of STH in both ruptured and unruptured SA. Fluoroscopy and computed tomography imaging consistently confirmed SA occlusion without recanalization, migration, or nontarget embolization; STH is&#160;also shown to outperform coil embolization of porcine aneurysms. In pigs with catastrophic bleeding due to SA rupture, STH is&#160;able to achieve instant hemostasis rescuing the pigs in long&#8208;term survival experiments. STH is a promising semisolid iodinated embolic agent that can change the standard of medical practice and potentially save lives.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Efficient Sequential Drug Delivery of Biomimetic Nanosystem for Multimodal Chemo&#8208;, Antiangiogenic, and Anti&#8208;MDSC Therapy in Melanoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biomimetic DS@HLipo targets the tumor site, where near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;induced membrane permeation triggers the &#8220;ultrafast&#8221; and &#8220;thorough&#8221; release of sunitinib for both antiangiogenic therapy and anti&#8208;MDSC immunotherapy. The liberated doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded small&#8208;sized polymeric nanoparticles (DOX&#8208;NP) from the liposomes can then be more easily ingested by tumor cells for improved immunogenic chemotherapy.








Abstract
In view of the multiple pathological hallmarks of tumors, nanosystems for the sequential delivery of various drugs whose targets are separately located inside and outside tumor cells are desired for improved cancer therapy. However, current sequential delivery is mainly achieved through enzyme&#8208; or acid&#8208;dependent degradation of the nanocarrier, which would be influenced by the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, and unloading efficiency of the drug acting on the target outside tumor cells is usually unsatisfactory. Here, a light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy based on a liposomal formulation of doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded small&#8208;sized polymeric nanoparticles (DOX&#8208;NP) and free sunitinib in the aqueous cavity, is developed. The liposomal membrane is doped with photosensitizer porphyrin&#8211;phospholipid (PoP) and hybridized with red blood cell membrane to confer biomimetic features. Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;induced membrane permeabilization triggers the &#8220;ultrafast&#8221; and &#8220;thorough&#8221; release of sunitinib (100% release in 5&#160;min) for antiangiogenic therapy and also myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cell (MDSC) inhibition to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor environment. Subsequently, the small&#8208;sized DOX&#8208;NP liberated from the liposomes is more easily uptaken by tumor cells for improved immunogenic chemotherapy. RNA sequencing and immune&#8208;related assay indicates therapeutic immune enhancement. This light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy demonstrates the potency in cancer multimodal therapy against multiple targets in different spatial positions in tumor microenvironment.

Simultaneously blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor and integrin pathways with recombinant protein&#8208;drug conjugates treatment improves the tumor accumulation and cellular internalization of drug through regulating the F&#8208;actin content in cancer cells and extracellular matrix in the tumor environments as well as the physical environment of tumors, leading to an improved tumor therapy compared to free drug.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in fundamental cellular processes and pathological progression of many diseases. While most research and current knowledge focuses on the processes of biological and mechanical changes in ECM signaling residing cancer cells to respond, little is known of the converse&#8211;of how cancer cells initiate the changes of ECM properties. Here, it is reported that blocking the cancer cell signaling leads to disruption of tumor ECM. Using recombinant proteins (RPs) and recombinant protein&#8208;drug conjugates (RPDCs) that simultaneously target both epidermal growth factor receptor and integrin, it is demonstrated that multireceptor&#8208;mediated active modulation of tumor ECM can inhibit and even reverse tumor remodeling of the physiological and structural microenvironment. These results not only provide insights into the regulatory roles of cancer cells in developing a protumoral microenvironment, but also introduce a new therapeutic platform or strategy to treat cancers.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Nanophotonic Structures for High&#8208;Performance SEIRA Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of high&#8208;performance nanophotonic surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) sensor employing liquid gallium as the ground plane of nanopatch antennas is demonstrated. Superior performance for sensing thin analyte films such as monolayer 1&#8208;octadecanethiol is achieved. The developed cost&#8208;effective procedure for realizing such liquid&#8208;gallium&#8208;based nanophotonic SEIRA sensors is suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy can provide label&#8208;free, nondestructive detection and identification of analytes with high sensitivity and specificity, and therefore has been widely used for various sensing applications. SEIRA sensors usually employ resonant nanophotonic structures, which can substantially enhance the electric field and hence light&#8211;matter interactions by orders of magnitude in certain nanoscale hot spots of the devices. However, as ever, smaller hot spots are employed to further enhance the field, the delivery of analytes into such hot spots becomes increasingly challenging. Here, high&#8208;performance nanophotonic SEIRA sensors based on nanopatch antennas with a liquid gallium ground plane are demonstrated, which not only lead to ultrahigh field confinement and enhancement, but also allow for convenient and efficient delivery of analytes into nanometric hot spots by employing a simple procedure suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. The sensors exhibit superior sensitivity in the midinfrared spectral region. Around 10% molecular vibrational signals (i.e., the modulation of a sensor's reflection spectrum owing to the molecular vibrational modes of the analytes) near 2900&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;are achieved from sensing monolayer 1&#8208;octadecanethiol. This cost&#8208;effective and reliable method for realizing liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanophotonic structures provides a new strategy for developing high&#8208;performance sensors and other photonics applications in the infrared region.

         <title>PEG&#8208;Like Brush Polymer Conjugate of RNA Aptamer That Shows Reversible Anticoagulant Activity and Minimal Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a path is offered to rescuing RNA therapeutics from the deleterious immune side effects of PEG that induces life&#8208;threatening hypersensitivity reactions upon reactivity toward PEG antibodies using a next&#8208;generation PEG&#8208;like stealth polymer conjugate technology. These results breathe new life into an established and valuable drug delivery technology facing an impasse.








Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics are an emerging class of drugs. RNA aptamers are of significant therapeutic and clinical interest because their activity can be easily reversed in vivo&#8212;a useful feature that is difficult to achieve using other therapeutic modalities. Despite their therapeutic promise, RNA aptamers are limited by their poor blood circulation. The attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to RNA aptamers addresses this limitation. However, an RNA aptamer&#8208;PEG conjugate that is a reversible anticoagulant fails in a clinical trial due to the reactivity of the conjugate with pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies and has cast a pall over PEGylation of aptamers and other biologics, despite its long history of utility in drug delivery. Here, PEG antibody&#8208;reactivity of this RNA aptamer is eliminated by conjugating it to a next&#8208;generation PEG&#8208;like brush polymer&#8212;poly[(oligoethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate)] (POEGMA). The conjugate retained the drug's therapeutic action and the ability to be easily reversed. Importantly, this conjugate does not bind pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies that are prevalent in humans and does not induce a humoral immune response against the polymer itself in mice. These findings suggest a path to rescuing the PEGylation of RNA therapeutics and vaccines from the deleterious side&#8208;effects of PEG.

         <title>A Universal Ternary&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Ink Strategy toward Efficient Inkjet&#8208;Printed Perovskite Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
An environmentally&#8208;friendly ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink system with excellent printability and film&#8208;forming ability is tailor&#8208;made for efficient inkjet&#8208;printed perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). A record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% is achieved in inkjet&#8208;printed green perovskite QLEDs for the first time.








Abstract
Toward next&#8208;generation electroluminescent quantum dot (QD) displays, inkjet printing technique has been convinced as one of the most promising low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale manufacturing of patterned quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). The development of high&#8208;quality and stable QD inks is a key step to push this technology toward practical applications. Herein, a universal ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink strategy is proposed for the cesium lead halides (CsPbX3) perovskite QDs and their corresponding inkjet&#8208;printed QLEDs. With this tailor&#8208;made ternary halogen&#8208;free solvent (naphthene, n&#8208;tridecane, and n&#8208;nonane) recipe, a highly dispersive and stable CsPbX3 QD ink is obtained, which exhibits much better printability and film&#8208;forming ability than that of the binary solvent (naphthene and n&#8208;tridecane) system, leading to a much better qualitied perovskite QD thin film. Consequently, a record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% and maximum luminance of 43&#160;883.39&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 is achieved in inkjet&#8208;printed green perovskite QLEDs, which is much higher than that of the binary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system&#8208;based devices (EQE = 2.26%). Moreover, the ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system exhibits a universal applicability in the inkjet&#8208;printed red and blue perovskite QLEDs as well as cadmium (Cd)&#8208;based QLEDs. This work demonstrates a new strategy for tailor&#8208;making a general ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;QD&#8208;ink system for efficient inkjet&#8208;printed QLEDs as well as the other solution&#8208;processed electronic devices in the future.

         <title>Nonvolatile Ferroelectric&#8208;Domain&#8208;Wall Memory Embedded in a Complex Topological Domain Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prototype memory based on conductive ferroelectric domain&#8208;walls confined in a topological quadrant domain is demonstrated, which exhibits a resistive&#8208;switching characteristic with a large on/off ratio &gt;104&#160;and high readout current, as well as an excellent endurance over 108&#160;cycles and a long retention over 12&#160;days.








Abstract
The discovery and precise manipulation of atomic&#8208;size conductive ferroelectric domain walls offers new opportunities for a wide range of prospective electronic devices, and the emerging field of walltronics. Herein, a highly stable and fatigue&#8208;resistant nonvolatile memory device is demonstrated, which is based on deterministic creation and erasure of conductive domain walls that are geometrically confined in a topological domain structure. By introducing a pair of delicately designed coaxial electrodes onto the epitaxial BiFeO3&#160;film, a center&#8208;type quadrant topological domain with conductive charged domain walls can be easily created. More importantly, reversible switching of the quadrant domain between the convergent state with highly conductive confined walls and the divergent state with insulating confined walls can be realized, resulting in an apparent resistance change with a large on/off ratio of &gt;104&#160;and a technically preferred readout current (up to 40&#160;nA). Owing to restrictions from the clamped quadrant ferroelastic domain, the device exhibits excellent restoration repeatability over 108&#160;cycles and a long retention of over 12&#160;days (&gt;106&#160;s). These results provide a new pathway toward high&#8208;performance ferroelectric&#8208;domain&#8208;wall memory, which may spur extensive interest in exploring the immense potential in the emerging field of walltronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery and precise manipulation of atomic-size conductive ferroelectric domain walls offers new opportunities for a wide range of prospective electronic devices, and the emerging field of walltronics. Herein, a highly stable and fatigue-resistant nonvolatile memory device is demonstrated, which is based on deterministic creation and erasure of conductive domain walls that are geometrically confined in a topological domain structure. By introducing a pair of delicately designed coaxial electrodes onto the epitaxial BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;film, a center-type quadrant topological domain with conductive charged domain walls can be easily created. More importantly, reversible switching of the quadrant domain between the convergent state with highly conductive confined walls and the divergent state with insulating confined walls can be realized, resulting in an apparent resistance change with a large on/off ratio of &amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;and a technically preferred readout current (up to 40&#160;nA). Owing to restrictions from the clamped quadrant ferroelastic domain, the device exhibits excellent restoration repeatability over 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cycles and a long retention of over 12&#160;days (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s). These results provide a new pathway toward high-performance ferroelectric-domain-wall memory, which may spur extensive interest in exploring the immense potential in the emerging field of walltronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance In&#8208;Memory Photodetector Realized by Charge Storage in a van der Waals MISFET</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;memory photodetector is successfully designed based on a WSe2/h&#8208;BN/SiO2 van der Waals heterostructure, which demonstrates not only an ultrahigh photoresponsivity (337.8 A W&#8722;1) but also an extremely long&#8208;term retention (&gt;10 years). Moreover, the working mechanism with charge&#8208;storage effect of the h&#8208;BN/SiO2 structure is proved through a novel in situ optoelectronic electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy analysis.








Abstract
The emerging data&#8208;intensive applications in optoelectronics are driving innovation toward the fused integration of sensing, memory, and computing to break through the restrictions of the von Neumann architecture. However, the present photodetectors with only optoelectronic conversion functions cannot satisfy the growing demands of the multifunctions required in single devices. Here, a novel route for the integration of non&#8208;volatile memory into a photodetector is proposed, with a WSe2/h&#8208;BN van der Waals heterostructure on a Si/SiO2 substrate to realize in&#8208;memory photodetection. This photodetector exhibits an ultrahigh readout photocurrent of 3.4 &#181;A and photoresponsivity of 337.8 A W&#8722;1 in the solar&#8208;blind wavelength region, together with an extended retention time of more than 10 years. Furthermore, the charge&#8208;storage&#8208;based non&#8208;volatile mechanism of h&#8208;BN/SiO2 is successfully proven through a novel analysis of in situ optoelectronic electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy. These results represent a leap forward to future applications and insightful mechanisms of in&#8208;memory photodetection.

         <title>Oxide/ZIF&#8208;8 Hybrid Nanofiber Yarns: Heightened Surface Activity for Exceptional Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional chemiresistive gas sensor composed of nanofiber yarn sputter&#8208;deposited with indium tin oxide (ITO) as a sensing layer is designed, and then coated with zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) for nanofiltration of gas analytes. Through comprehensive sensing experiments and molecular modeling, it is demonstrated that yarn@ITO@ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits highly sensitive and selective sensing properties toward NO at room temperature with accelerated responding speeds.








Abstract
Though highly promising as powerful gas sensors, oxide semiconductor chemiresistors have low surface reactivity, which limits their selectivity, sensitivity, and reaction kinetics, particularly at room temperature (RT) operation. It is proposed that a hybrid design involving the nanostructuring of oxides and passivation with selective gas filtration layers can potentially overcome the issues with surface activity. Herein, unique bi&#8208;stacked heterogeneous layers are introduced; that is, nanostructured oxides covered by conformal nanoporous gas filters, on ultrahigh&#8208;density nanofiber (NF) yarns via sputter deposition with indium tin oxide (ITO) and subsequent self&#8208;assembly of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) nanocrystals. The NF yarn composed of ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;coated ITO films can offer heightened surface activity at RT because of high porosity, large surface area, and effective screening of interfering gases. As a case study, the hybrid sensor demonstrated remarkable sensing performances characterized by high NO selectivity, fast response/recovery kinetics (&gt;60&#8208;fold improvement), and large responses (12.8&#8208;fold improvement @ 1&#160;ppm) in comparison with pristine yarn@ITO, especially under highly humid conditions. Molecular modeling reveals an increased penetration ratio of NO over O2 to the ITO surface, indicating that NO oxidation is reliably prevented and that the secondary adsorption sites provided by the ZIF&#8208;8 facilitate the adsorption/desorption of NO, both to and from ITO.

         <title>A Stiffness&#8208;Switchable, Biomimetic Smart Material Enabled by Supramolecular Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stiffness&#8208;changing biomimetic smart material is developed through a unique water&#8211;ethanol solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;induced supramolecular reconfiguration strategy. The dynamic switchable supramolecular network imparts the material with an interesting self&#8208;regulation behavior in mechanical properties between soft and hard states, self&#8208;healing capability, and excellent formability, which holds great application potential in smart buildings, personal protection devices, soft robots, intelligent devices, and beyond.








Abstract
In nature, stiffness&#8208;changing behavior is essential for living organisms, which, however, is challenging to achieve in synthetic materials. Here, a stiffness&#8208;changing smart material, through developing interchangeable supramolecular configurations inspired from the dermis of the sea cucumber, which shows extreme, switchable mechanical properties, is reported. In the hydrated state, the material, possessing a stretched, double&#8208;stranded supramolecular network, showcases a soft&#8208;gel behavior with a low stiffness and high pliability. Upon the stimulation of ethanol to transform into the coiled supramolecular configuration, it self&#8208;adjusts to a hard state with nearly 500&#8208;times enhanced stiffness from 0.51&#160;to 243.6&#160;MPa, outstanding load&#8208;bearing capability (over 35&#160;000&#160;times its own weight), and excellent puncture/impact resistance with a specific impact strength of &#8776;116&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2 (g&#160;cm&#8722;3)&#8722;1 (higher than some metals and alloys such as aluminum, and even comparable to the commercially available protective materials such as D3O and Kevlar). Moreover, this material demonstrates reconfiguration&#8208;dependent self&#8208;healing behavior and designable formability, holding great promise in advanced engineering fields that require both high&#8208;strength durability and good formability. This work may open up a new perspective for the development of self&#8208;regulating materials from supramolecular&#8208;scale configuration regulation.

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Coordinated High&#8208;Performance Moisture Power in Natural Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient sunlight&#8208;coordinated &#8220;moist&#8208;electric generator&#8221; offers a record&#8208;high short&#8208;circuit current density, harvesting multiple sources of moisture and light synchronously, which is available for scalable integration toward portable and wearable power&#8208;supply systems under different real natural conditions, working for lighting and electrically driven objects.








Abstract
It is a challenge to spontaneously harvest multiple clean sources from the environment for upgraded energy&#8208;converting systems. The ubiquitous moisture and sunlight in nature are attractive for sustainable power generation especially. A high&#8208;performance light&#8208;coordinated &#8220;moist&#8208;electric generator&#8221; (LMEG) based on the rational combination of a polyelectrolyte and a phytochrome is herein developed. By spontaneous adsorption of gaseous water molecules and simultaneous exposure to sunlight, a piece of 1 cm2 composite film offers an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.92&#160;V and a considerable short&#8208;circuit current density of up to 1.55&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This record&#8208;high current density is about two orders of magnitude improvement over that of most conventional moisture&#8208;enabled systems, which is caused by moisture&#8208;induced charge separation accompanied with photoexcited carrier migration, as confirmed by a dynamic Monte Carlo device simulation. Flexible devices with customizable size are available for large&#8208;scale integration to effectively work under a wide range of relative humidity (about 20&#8211;100%), temperature (10&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C), and light intensity (30&#8211;200&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). The wearable and portable LMEGs provide ample power supply in natural conditions for indoor and outdoor electricity&#8208;consuming systems. This work opens a novel avenue to develop sustainable power generation through collecting multiple types of natural energy by a single hybrid harvester.

Flexible devices with customizable size are available for large-scale integration to effectively work under a wide range of relative humidity (about 20&#8211;100%), temperature (10&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C), and light intensity (30&#8211;200&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The wearable and portable LMEGs provide ample power supply in natural conditions for indoor and outdoor electricity-consuming systems. This work opens a novel avenue to develop sustainable power generation through collecting multiple types of natural energy by a single hybrid harvester.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Growth of Amorphous Discharge Products toward an Ultrawide Band Light&#8208;Assisted Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated fast kinetics for an ultrawide band photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 system is developed. The bifunctional Ag/Bi2MoO6 cathode is favorable to promoting the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction kinetics due to the discharge products is amorphous Li2O2. The reaction mechanism is revealed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. 








Abstract
Photoassisted electrochemical reaction is regarded as an effective approach to reduce the overpotential of lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries. However, the achievement of both broadband absorption and long term battery cycling stability are still a formidable challenge. Herein, an oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated fast kinetics for a photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 system is developed with a silver/bismuth molybdate (Ag/Bi2MoO6) hybrid cathode. The cathode can offer both double advantages for light absorption covering UV to visible region and excellent electrochemical activity for O2. Upon discharging, the photoexcited electrons from Ag nanoplate based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are injected into the oxygen vacancy in Bi2MoO6. The fast oxygen reaction kinetics generate the amorphous Li2O2, and the discharge plateau is improved to 3.05&#160;V. Upon charging, the photoexcited holes are capable to decompose amorphous Li2O2 promptly, yielding a very low charge plateau of 3.25&#160;V. A first cycle round&#8208;trip efficiency is 93.8% and retention of 70% over 500 h, which is the longest cycle life ever reported in photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 batteries. This work offers a general and reliable strategy for boosting the electrochemical kinetics by tailoring the crystalline of Li2O2 with wide&#8208;band light.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Programmable Microgel Lasers for Information Encoding and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural responsivity of active biomaterials, laser information encoding is demonstrated by exploiting enzyme&#8208;bioactive hydrogel materials confined in a microcavity. Tunable lasing wavelengths are achieved by manipulating the biological activity and nanostructures in hydrogel droplets. This study represents the first development of a biologically controlled laser for optical information applications.








Abstract
Microscale laser emissions have emerged as a promising approach for information encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting for their feature&#8208;rich spectra and high sensitivity to the surrounding environment. Compared with artificial materials, natural responsive biomaterials enable a higher level of complexity and versatile ways for tailoring optical responses. However, precise control of lasing wavelengths and spatial locations with biomolecules remains a huge challenge. Here, a biologically programmable laser, in which the lasing can be manipulated by biomolecular activities at the nanoscale, is developed. Tunable lasing wavelengths are achieved by exploiting the swelling properties of enzyme&#8208;responsive hydrogel droplets in a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot microcavity. Both experimental and theoretical means demonstrate that inner 3D network structures and external curvature of the hydrogel droplets lead to different lasing thresholds and resonance wavelengths. Finally, inkjet&#8208;printed multiwavelength laser encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting are showcased under different scalabilities and environments. Hyperspectral laser images are utilized as an advanced feature for a higher level of security. The biologically encoded laser will provide a new insight into the development of biosynthetic and bioprogrammable laser devices, offering new opportunities for secure communication and smart sensing.

         <title>Synthetic Matrix Scaffolds Engineer the In Vivo Tumor Immune Microenvironment for Immunotherapy Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor growth dynamics and reproducibility of preclinical breast cancer models are improved utilizing a system leveraging synthetic material scaffolds. These scaffolds induce reliable tumor formation and programmable immune infiltration based on composition, enabling enhanced consistency and relevance to human disease. Various immunotherapeutic strategies are tested, revealing differential efficacy based on immune milieu, demonstrating the promise to improve clinical immunotherapy applications.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most powerful anti&#8208;cancer therapies but is stymied by the limits of existing preclinical models with respect to disease latency and reproducibility. Additionally, the influence of differing immune microenvironments within tumors observed clinically and associated with immunotherapeutic resistance cannot be tuned to facilitate drug testing workflows without changing model system or laborious genetic approaches. To address this testing platform gap in the immune oncology drug development pipeline, the authors deploy engineered biomaterials as scaffolds to increase tumor formation rate, decrease disease latency, and diminish variability of immune infiltrates into tumors formed from murine mammary carcinoma cell lines implanted into syngeneic mice. By altering synthetic gel formulations that reshape infiltrating immune cells within the tumor, responsiveness of the same tumor model to varying classes of cancer immunotherapies, including in situ vaccination with a molecular adjuvant and immune checkpoint blockade, diverge. These results demonstrate the significant role the local immune microenvironment plays in immunotherapeutic response. These engineered tumor immune microenvironments therefore improve upon the limitations of current breast tumor models used for immune oncology drug screening to enable immunotherapeutic testing relevant to the variability in tumor immune microenvironments underlying immunotherapeutic resistance seen in human patients.

         <title>Engineering Radiosensitizer&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks Potentiate STING Pathway Activation for Advanced Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiotherapy suffers from high&#8208;dose radiation&#8208;induced systemic toxicity and radioresistance caused by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To overcome these limitations, a novel lanthanide&#8208;doped radiosensitizer&#8208;based metal&#8208;phenolic network is engineered to achieve a synergy of radiosensitization and stimulator of interferon genes pathway activation. This tactic promotes dendritic cell maturation and evokes potent systemic antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy, a mainstay of first&#8208;line cancer treatment, suffers from its high&#8208;dose radiation&#8208;induced systemic toxicity and radioresistance caused by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The synergy between radiosensitization and immunomodulation may overcome these obstacles for advanced radiotherapy. Here, the authors propose a radiosensitization cooperated with stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway activation strategy by fabricating a novel lanthanide&#8208;doped radiosensitizer&#8208;based metal&#8208;phenolic network, NaGdF4:Nd@NaLuF4@PEG&#8208;polyphenol/Mn (DSPM). The amphiphilic PEG&#8208;polyphenol successfully coordinates with NaGdF4:Nd@NaLuF4 (radiosensitizer) and Mn2+ via robust metal&#8208;phenolic coordination. After cell internalization, the pH&#8208;responsive disassembly of DSPM triggers the release of their payloads, wherein radiosensitizer sensitizes cancer cells to X&#8208;ray and Mn2+ promote STING pathway activation. This radiosensitizer&#8208;based DSPM remarkably benefits dendritic cell maturation, anticancer therapeutics in primary tumors, accompanied by robust systemic immune therapeutic performance against metastatic tumors. Therefore, a powerful radiosensitization with STING pathway activation mediated immunostimulation strategy is highlighted here to optimize cancer radiotherapy.

         <title>Assembly of Bioactive Nanoparticles via Metal&#8211;Phenolic Complexation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and tunable strategy is developed to assemble a range of biomacromolecules into bioactive metal&#8211;phenolic nanoparticles (b&#8208;MPN NPs), while retaining the intrinsic activity of the biomacromolecules. The bioactivity of the b&#8208;MPN NPs enables their use in various applications, including cell apoptosis, RNA degradation, cascade reactions, and gene silencing.








Abstract
The integration of bioactive materials (e.g., proteins and genes) into nanoparticles holds promise in fields ranging from catalysis to biomedicine. However, it is challenging to develop a simple and broadly applicable nanoparticle platform that can readily incorporate distinct biomacromolecules without affecting their intrinsic activity. Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic assembly approach is presented whereby diverse functional nanoparticles can be readily assembled in water by combining various synthetic and natural building blocks, including poly(ethylene glycol), phenolic ligands, metal ions, and bioactive macromolecules. The assembly process is primarily mediated by metal&#8211;phenolic complexes through coordination and hydrophobic interactions, which yields uniform and spherical nanoparticles (mostly &lt;200&#160;nm),&#160;while preserving the function of the incorporated biomacromolecules (siRNA and five different proteins used). The functionality of the assembled nanoparticles is demonstrated through cancer cell apoptosis, RNA degradation, catalysis, and gene downregulation studies. Furthermore, the resulting nanoparticles can be used as building blocks for the secondary engineering of superstructures via templating and cross&#8208;linking with metal ions. The bioactivity and versatility of the platform can potentially be used for the streamlined and rational design of future bioactive materials.

         <title>Novel Oligomer Enables Green Solvent Processed 17.5% Ternary Organic Solar Cells: Synergistic Energy Loss Reduction and Morphology Fine&#8208;Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low energy loss ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PM6:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl achieve significantly improved power conversion efficiencies of 17.54% and 17.32% by introducing novel oligomers with higher HOMO level as third&#8208;components, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs by green solvent. The significance of high electroluminescence quantum efficiency is highlighted and new understanding of energy loss mechanisms is provided toward high&#8208;performance, ecofriendly OSCs.








Abstract
The large non&#8208;radiative recombination is the main factor that limits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two novel structurally similar oligomers (named 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT) with D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D and A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration are synthesized for high&#8208;performance ternary OSCs with low energy loss. As third components, these PM6 analogue oligomers effectively suppress the non&#8208;radiative recombination in OSCs. Although the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT are higher than that of PM6, the oligomers enabled ultra&#8208;high electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of 0.05% and improved VOC, indicating suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination overweighs the common belief of deeper HOMO requirement in third component selection. Moreover, the different compatibility of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT with PM6 and BTP&#8208;BO4Cl fine&#8208;tunes the active layer morphology with synergistic effects. The ternary devices based on PM6:5BDTBDD:BTPBO4Cl and PM6:5BDDBDT:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl achieve a significantly improved PCEs of 17.54% and 17.32%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art OSCs processed by green solvent of o&#8208;xylene. The strategy using novel oligomer as third component also has very wide composition tolerance in ternary OSCs. This is the first work that demonstrates novel structurally compatible D&#8208;A type oligomers are effective third components, and provides new understanding of synergetic energy loss mechanisms towards high performance OSCs.

Porous Fibrous Scaffolds
The dimensions of electrospun fibers are predestined for synthetic replacement of extracellular matrix structures. In article number 2106780, Tobias Weigel and co&#8208;workers generate highly porous electrospun scaffolds, featuring an ensemble of loose fibers and pores of appropriate size to enable applications in engineering animal&#8208;free 3D biomedical tissues. The mechanical properties and structural composition describe a tradeoff between current synthetic porous scaffolds and animal&#8208;derived hydrogels, which are deployed as electrospun&#8208;based multilayered skin equivalents.

Thin Films
When thinning down silicon films toward nanometer thickness, their thermal conductivity decreases dramatically. In article number 2108352, Klaas&#8208;Jan Tielrooij and co&#8208;workers report a combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study that shows that this is not the case for the layered semiconductor MoSe2. For the thinnest MoSe2 films, the decreasing thermal conductivity is compensated by low&#8208;energy, long&#8208;mean&#8208;free&#8208;path heat&#8208;carrying modes. These thin films furthermore exhibit efficient heat dissipation to air molecules.

In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202108352"&gt;2108352&lt;/a&gt;, Klaas-Jan Tielrooij and co-workers report a combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study that shows that this is not the case for the layered semiconductor MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For the thinnest MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; films, the decreasing thermal conductivity is compensated by low-energy, long-mean-free-path heat-carrying modes. These thin films furthermore exhibit efficient heat dissipation to air molecules.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Materials: The Turning Point of Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advancement of organic photovoltaics has been significantly aided by the emergence of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) materials, and they are also able to satisfy the varied criteria for various types of organic photovoltaic device architectures. Furthermore, the absorption window is the most fundamental criterion for developing novel NIR organic photoelectric materials.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing organic semiconductors have opened up many exciting opportunities for organic photovoltaic (OPV) research. For example, new chemistries and synthetical methodologies have been developed; especially, the breakthrough Y&#8208;series acceptors, originally invented by our&#160;group, specifically Y1, Y3, and Y6, have contributed immensely to boosting single&#8208;junction solar cell efficiency to around 19%; novel device architectures such as tandem and transparent organic photovoltaics have been realized. The concept of NIR donors/acceptors thus becomes a turning point in the OPV field. Here, the development of NIR&#8208;absorbing materials for OPVs is reviewed. According to the low&#8208;energy absorption window, here, NIR photovoltaic materials (p&#8208;type (polymers) and n&#8208;type (fullerene and nonfullerene)) are classified into four categories: 700&#8211;800 nm, 800&#8211;900 nm, 900&#8211;1000 nm, and greater than 1000&#160;nm. Each subsection covers the design, synthesis, and utilization of various types of donor (D) and acceptor (A) units. The structure&#8211;property relationship between various kinds of D, A units and absorption window are constructed to satisfy requirements for different applications. Subsequently, a variety of applications realized by NIR materials, including transparent OPVs, tandem OPVs, photodetectors, are presented. Finally, challenges and future development of novel NIR materials for the next&#8208;generation organic photovoltaics and beyond are discussed.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Free Click Chemistry: Applications in Drug Delivery, Cell Tracking, and Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;free click chemistry is applicable outside of the laboratory, as it can be used controllably on cell surfaces, in the cytosol, and in living bodies. It is consequently of interest to biomedical researchers, and various new materials have been proposed. They can be categorized as nanoparticles for drug delivery, imaging agents for cell tracking, and hydrogels for tissue engineering.








Abstract
Traditionally, organic chemical reactions require organic solvents, toxic catalysts, heat, or high pressure. However, copper&#8208;free click chemistry has been shown to have favorable reaction rates and orthogonality in water, buffer solutions, and physiological conditions without toxic catalysts. Strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition and inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions are representative of copper&#8208;free click chemistry. Artificial chemical reactions via click chemistry can also be used outside of the laboratory in a controllable manner on live cell surfaces, in the cytosol, and in living bodies. Consequently, copper&#8208;free click chemistry has many features that are of interest in biomedical research, and various new materials and strategies for its use have been proposed. Herein, recent remarkable trials that have used copper&#8208;free click chemistry are described, focusing on their applications in molecular imaging and therapy. The research is categorized as nanoparticles for drug delivery, imaging agents for cell tracking, and hydrogels for tissue engineering, which are rapidly advancing fields based on click chemistry. The content is based primarily on the experience with click chemistry&#8208;based biomaterials over the last 10 years.

         <title>Colloidal Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Nanoplatelets: Thickness&#8208;Controlled Synthesis, Properties, and Application in Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the research progress and challenges associated with thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis, stability, surface passivation, doping, optical (linear and nonlinear) properties of both organic and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid lead and lead&#8208;free halide perovskite nanoplatelets along with recent progress on their application to light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Colloidal metal&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (MHP NCs) are gaining significant attention for a wide range of optoelectronics applications owing to their exciting properties, such as defect tolerance, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and tunable emission across the entire visible wavelength range. Although the optical properties of MHP NCs are easily tunable through their halide composition, they suffer from light&#8208;induced halide phase segregation that limits their use in devices. However, MHPs can be synthesized in the form of colloidal nanoplatelets (NPls) with monolayer (ML)&#8208;level thickness control, exhibiting strong quantum confinement effects, and thus enabling tunable emission across the entire visible wavelength range by controlling the thickness of bromide or iodide&#8208;based lead&#8208;halide perovskite NPls. In addition, the NPls exhibit narrow emission peaks, have high exciton binding energies, and a higher fraction of radiative recombination compared to their bulk counterparts, making them ideal candidates for applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). This review discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in colloidal MHP NPls: synthetic routes, thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis of both organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid and all&#8208;inorganic MHP NPls, their linear and nonlinear optical properties (including charge&#8208;carrier dynamics), and their performance in LEDs. Furthermore, the challenges associated with their thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis, environmental and thermal stability, and their application in making efficient LEDs are discussed.

         <title>Biomimetic Immunosuppressive Exosomes that Inhibit Cytokine Storms Contribute to the Alleviation of Sepsis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sepsis is a disease characterized by multiple organ failure caused by immune hyperactivation and cytokine storms. Studies have shown that the incidence of sepsis in melanoma patients is substantially lower compared to the general population. We also observe that experimental tumor&#8208;bearing animals have high survival rates after sepsis induction, suggesting that tumors may suppress sepsis&#8208;associated immune overactivation, thereby alleviating sepsis. Based on the above&#8208;described findings, we assess whether tumor cells play an antisepsis role in mice through the secretion of exosomes. Analysis of exosome activity reveals that the induced exosomes (iExo) secreted by tumor cells following lipopolysaccharide treatment improve sepsis to a greater extent than normal secretory exosomes (nExo). Further analysis reveals that iExos exert their protective effects mainly through seven key miRNAs. In vitro bionic simulation of exosomes is carried out using exosome mimics generated by loading the aforementioned microRNAs into hyaluronic acid&#8208;polyethylenimine nanoparticles. Exosome mimics at specific miRNA ratios alleviate sepsis in mice and cynomolgus monkeys, indicating that biomimetic simulation of tumor&#8208;suppressive exosomes may represent a promising therapeutic method for the treatment of sepsis and cytokine storm&#8208;related conditions.

         <title>A Gradient pH&#8208;Sensitive Polymer&#8208;Based Antiviral Strategy via Viroporin&#8208;Induced Membrane Acidification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is challenging to develop potent and broad&#8208;spectrum antivirals. Gradient pH&#8208;sensitive polymeric nanoprobes are designed for accurate measurement of the cellular membrane acidification induced by virus infection. In response to acidified membranes, one of the polymers selectively targets to virus&#8208;infected cells and viruses, eventually lysing viral envelopes and exerting powerful activities against a variety of viruses.








Abstract
Lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;targeting strategies hold great promise to develop broad&#8208;spectrum antivirals. However, it remains a big challenge to identify novel membrane&#8208;based targets of viruses and virus&#8208;infected cells for development of precision targeted approaches. Here, it is discovered that viroporins, viral&#8208;encoded ion channels, which have been reported to mediate release of hydrogen ions, trigger membrane acidification of virus&#8208;infected cells. Through development of a fine&#8208;scale library of gradient pH&#8208;sensitive (GPS) polymeric nanoprobes, the cellular membrane pH transitions are measured from pH 6.8&#8211;7.1 (uninfection) to pH 6.5&#8211;6.8 (virus&#8208;infection). In response to the subtle pH alterations, the GPS polymer with sharp response at pH 6.8 (GPS6.8) selectively binds to virus&#8208;infected cell membranes or the viral envelope, and even completely disrupts the viral envelope. Accordingly, GPS6.8 treatment exerts suppressive effects on a wide variety of viruses including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 through triggering viral&#8208;envelope lysis rather than affecting immune pathway or viability of host cells. Murine viral&#8208;infection models exhibit that supplementation of GPS6.8 decreases viral titers and ameliorates inflammatory damage. Thus, the gradient pH&#8208;sensitive nanotechnology offers a promising strategy for accurate detection of biological pH environments and robust interference with viruses.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Functionality&#8208;Multiplexing Capability in Metasurface Design Based on Statistical Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning models are embedded in both gradient&#8208;based and nongradient optimization loops to automatically design multifunctional metasurfaces and push the design capacity even when the ideal optical response is not achievable by certain meta&#8208;atoms. Metasurface focusing lenses and holograms are experimentally demonstrated, with up to eight controllable responses subjected to different combinations of incident frequencies and polarizations.








Abstract
As 2D metamaterials, metasurfaces provide an unprecedented means to manipulate light with the ability to multiplex different functionalities in a single planar device. Currently, most pursuits of multifunctional metasurfaces resort to empirically accommodating more functionalities at the cost of increasing structural complexity, with little effort to investigate the intrinsic restrictions of given meta&#8208;atoms and thus the ultimate limits in the design. In this work, it is proposed to embed machine&#8208;learning models in both gradient&#8208;based and nongradient optimization loops for the automatic implementation of multifunctional metasurfaces. Fundamentally different from the traditional two&#8208;step approach that separates phase retrieval and meta&#8208;atom structural design, the proposed end&#8208;to&#8208;end framework facilitates full exploitation of the prescribed design space and pushes the multifunctional design capacity to its physical limit. With a single&#8208;layer structure that can be readily fabricated, metasurface focusing lenses and holograms are experimentally demonstrated in the near&#8208;infrared region. They show up to eight controllable responses subjected to different combinations of working frequencies and linear polarization states, which are unachievable by the conventional physics&#8208;guided approaches. These results manifest the superior capability of the data&#8208;driven scheme for photonic design, and will accelerate the development of complex devices and systems for optical display, communication, and computing.

         <title>Electrochemically Exfoliated Chlorine&#8208;doped Graphene for Flexible All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors with High Volumetric Energy Density</title>

Abstract
Graphene&#8208;constructed micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) have received considerable attention more recently, as part of the prospective wearable and portable electronics owing to their distinctive merits of well&#8208;tunable power output, robust mechanical flexibility, long cyclability, and wide operating temperature range. In the current work, we focus on the fabrication of high&#8208;quality and solution&#8208;processible chlorine&#8208;doped ultrathin graphene (Cl&#8208;G) nanosheets through a handy yet eco&#8208;friendly electrochemical exfoliation process. The Cl&#8208;G is characteristic of the large lateral size of around 10&#160;&#956;m, abundant nanopores with sizes of as small as 2&#160;nm, as well as numerous steps from the rugged surface. Arising from the rich chemical functionalities and structure defects, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state MSC built by using Cl&#8208;G via a facile mask&#8208;assisted method delivers a large reversible capacity and ultra&#8208;steady charge/discharge performance, with the capacitance being maintained at 98.1% even after 250&#8239;000 cycles. The Cl&#8208;G&#8208;MSC with EMIMBF4/PVDF&#8208;HFP as the electrolyte displays a large volumetric capacitance up to 160 F cm&#8211;3 at the scan rate of 5&#160;mV s&#8211;1 and high volumetric energy density of 97.9&#160;mW h cm&#8211;3 at the power density of 3.4 W cm&#8211;3. The device can also output a high voltage up to 3.5&#160;V and robust capability with 94.8% of capacitance retention upon 10&#8239;000 cycles. The scalable integration of MSCs based on Cl&#8208;G highlights their application potentials in microscale energy storage devices, given the facile and green fabrication process.

&lt;p&gt;Graphene-constructed micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) have received considerable attention more recently, as part of the prospective wearable and portable electronics owing to their distinctive merits of well-tunable power output, robust mechanical flexibility, long cyclability, and wide operating temperature range. In the current work, we focus on the fabrication of high-quality and solution-processible chlorine-doped ultrathin graphene (Cl-G) nanosheets through a handy yet eco-friendly electrochemical exfoliation process. The Cl-G is characteristic of the large lateral size of around 10&#160;&#956;m, abundant nanopores with sizes of as small as 2&#160;nm, as well as numerous steps from the rugged surface. Arising from the rich chemical functionalities and structure defects, the all-solid-state MSC built by using Cl-G via a facile mask-assisted method delivers a large reversible capacity and ultra-steady charge/discharge performance, with the capacitance being maintained at 98.1% even after 250&#8239;000 cycles.

         <title>Bioinspired Colloidal Photonic Composites: Fabrications and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organisms in nature have evolved unique structural colors and stimuli&#8208;responsive functions for camouflage, warning, and communication over millions of years, which are essential to their survival in harsh conditions. Inspired by these characteristics, colloidal photonic composites (CPCs) composed of colloidal photonic crystals embedded in the polymeric matrix have been artificially prepared and show great promise in applications. This review focuses on the summary of building blocks, i.e., colloidal particles and polymeric matrices, and constructive strategies from the perspective of designing CPCs with robust performance and specific functionality. Furthermore, we also discuss their state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications, including colorful coatings, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence, especially in the field of visualized sensing. Finally, current challenges and potential for future developments in this field are discussed. The purpose of this review is not only to clarify the design principle for artificial CPCs but also to serve as a roadmap for the exploration of next&#8208;generation photonic materials.

         <title>Surface Modification of Two&#8208;Dimensional Photocatalysts for Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials show many particular properties, such as high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, high anisotropic degree, and adjustable chemical functionality. These unique properties in 2D materials have sparked immense interest due to their applications in photocatalytic systems, resulting in significantly enhanced light capture, charge transfer kinetics, and surface reaction. This review first introduces the research progress in 2D photocatalysts based on varied compositions and functions followed by specific surface modification strategies. Fundamental principles focusing on light&#8208;harvesting, charge separation and molecular adsorption/activation in a 2D materials&#8208;based photocatalytic system have been systemically explored. The examples described here detail the use of 2D materials in various photocatalytic energy conversion systems, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, H2O2 production, and organic synthesis. Finally, by elaborating the challenges and possible solutions for developing these 2D materials, we expect to provide some inspiration for the future research of 2D materials used on efficient photocatalytic energy conversions.

         <title>Engineering high strength and super toughness of unfolded structural proteins and their extraordinary anti&#8208;adhesion performance for abdominal hernia repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The utility of unfolded structural proteins with diverse sequences offers multiple potentials to create functional biomaterials. However, it is challenging to overcome their structural defects for the development of biological fibers with a combination of high strength and high toughness. Herein, robust fibers from a recombinant unfolded protein consisting of resilin and supercharged polypeptide were fabricated via wet&#8208;spinning approaches. Particularly, the highly ordered structures induced by supramolecular complexation significantly improved the fiber's mechanical performance. In contrast to chemical fibers with high strength and low toughness (or vice versa), the present fibers demonstrated exceptional high strength and super toughness, showing a breaking strength of &#8764;550&#160;MPa and a toughness of &#8764;250&#160;MJ m&#8211;3, respectively, surpassing many polymer and artificial protein fibers. Remarkably, the outstanding biocompatibility and superior mechanical properties allow the constructed fiber patches for efficient abdominal hernia repair in rat models. In stark contrast to clinical patches, there is no any observed tissue adhesion by this treatment. Therefore, our work provides a new type of engineered protein materials for surgical applications.

         <title>Large Transverse and Longitudinal Magneto&#8208;Thermoelectric Effect in Polycrystalline Nodal&#8208;Line Semimetal Mg3Bi2</title>

Abstract
Topological semimetals provide new opportunities for exploring novel thermoelectric phenomena, owing to their exotic and nontrivial electronic structure topology around the Fermi surface. Herein, we report on the discovery of large transverse and longitudinal magneto&#8208;thermoelectric (MTE) effects in Mg3Bi2, which is predicted to be a type&#8208;II nodal&#8208;line semimetal in the absence of spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). The maximum transverse power factor is 2182 &#956;Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;2 at 13.5 K and 6 Tesla. The longitudinal power factor reaches up to 3043 &#956;Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;2, which is 20 times higher than that in a zero&#8208;strength magnetic field and is also comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MTE materials. By compensating the Mg loss in Mg&#8208;rich conditions for tuning the carrier concentration close to intrinsic state, the sample fabricated in this study exhibits a large linear non&#8208;saturating magnetoresistance of 940% under a field of 14 Tesla. Using density functional calculations, we attribute the underlying mechanism to the parent linear&#8208;dispersed nodal&#8208;line electronic structure without SOC and the anisotropic Fermi surface shape with SOC, highlighting the essential role of high carrier mobility and open electron orbits in the moment space. Our work offers a new avenue toward highly efficient MTE materials through defect engineering in polycrystalline topological semimetals.

         <title>Mesoporous single&#8208;crystal lithium titanate enabling fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries</title>

Abstract
There remain significant challenges in developing fast&#8208;charging materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to sluggish ion diffusion kinetics and unfavorable electrolyte mass transportation in battery electrodes. In this work, we report a mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline lithium titanate (MSC&#8208;LTO) microrod that can realize exceptional fast charge/discharge performance and excellent long&#8208;term stability in LIBs. The MSC&#8208;LTO microrods are featured with a single&#8208;crystalline structure and interconnected pores inside the entire single&#8208;crystalline body. These features not only shorten the lithium&#8208;ion diffusion distance but also allow for the penetration of electrolytes into the single&#8208;crystalline interior during battery cycling. Hence, the MSC&#8208;LTO microrods exhibit unprecedentedly high rate capability, achieving a specific discharge capacity of &#8764;174 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, which is very close to its theoretical capacity, and &#8764;169 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 C. More importantly, the porous single&#8208;crystalline microrods greatly mitigate the structure degradation during a long&#8208;term cycling test, offering &#8764;92% of the initial capacity after 10,000 cycles at 20 C. This work presents a novel strategy to engineer porous single&#8208;crystalline materials and paves a new venue for developing fast&#8208;charging materials for LIBs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the employment of graphene in microwave circuits is presented. The review starts with methods of the growth and transfer of graphene followed by different graphene&#8208;based devices. Thenceforth, exploiting these devices in different circuits is discussed. Finally, a perspective on the potential of graphene for enabling applications beyond the capabilities of classic semiconductors concludes this review.








Abstract
Over the past two decades, research on 2D materials has received much interest. Graphene is the most promising candidate regarding high&#8208;frequency applications thus far due to is high carrier mobility. Here, the research about the employment of graphene in micro&#8208; and millimeter&#8208;wave circuits is reviewed. The review starts with the different methodologies to grow and transfer graphene, before discussing the way graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors (GFETs) and diodes are built. A review on different approaches for realizing these devices is provided before discussing the employment of both GFETs and graphene diodes in different micro&#8208; and millimeter&#8208;wave circuits, showing the possibilities but also the limitations of this 2D material for high&#8208;frequency applications.

         <title>Nanoscale Faceting and Ligand Shell Structure Dominate the Self&#8208;Assembly of Non&#8208;Polar Nanoparticles into Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanoscale structures at liquid&#8208;solid interfaces occurs in a broad range of industrial processes and is found in various phenomena in nature. Conventional theory assumes spherical particles and homogeneous surfaces, but that model is oversimplified, and nanoscale in&#8208;situ observations are needed for a more complete understanding. We used liquid phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;STEM) to examine the interactions that direct the self&#8208;assembly of superlattices formed by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in non&#8208;polar liquids. Varying the molecular coating of the substrate modulated short&#8208;ranged attraction and led to switching between a range of different geometric structures including hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp), simple hexagonal (sh), dodecahedral quasi&#8208;crystal (dqc), and body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) lattices, as well as random distributions. Langevin dynamics simulations explain the experimental results in terms of the interplay between nanoparticle faceting, ligand shell structure, and substrate&#8208;NP&#8208;interactions.

         <title>Recent Structural Engineering of Polymer Semiconductors Incorporating Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Highly planar, extended &#960;&#8208;electron organic conjugated polymers have been increasingly attractive for achieving high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors. In addition to the conventional strategy to construct rigid backbone by covalent bonds, hydrogen bond has been employed extensively to increase the planarity and rigidity of polymer via intramolecular noncovalent interactions. This review provides a general summary of high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers incorporating hydrogen bonds in field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) over recent years. The structural engineering of the hydrogen bond&#8208;containing building blocks and the discussion of theoretical simulation, microstructural characterization, and device performance are covered. Additionally, the effects of the introduction of hydrogen bond on self&#8208;healing, stretchability, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties are also discussed. The review aims to help and inspire design of new high&#8208;mobility conjugated polymers with superiority of mechanical flexibility by incorporation of hydrogen bond for the application in flexible electronics.

         <title>Mobile Phone Flashlight Excited Red Afterglow Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence materials with ultralong lifetime possess the remarkable advantage in bioimaging for elimination of background noise by characteristic time scale. However, most of RTP luminogens need to be excited by the harmful UV lamp, and exhibit green or yellow emission with shallow tissue penetration, constraining the in vivo bioimaging for further application in clinical diagnosis and pathological study. In this text, the much safer excitation process by sunlight and mobile phone flashlight is realized by organic luminogens with various electronic pull&#8208;push systems. Moreover, the bright red RTP emission with lifetime up to 344&#160;ms is achieved by optimizing molecular geometry and electronic property. Especially, the mobile phone flashlight excited red afterglow imaging of lymph nodes in living mice has been realized for the first time, affording a safe and conventional approach to achieve the afterglow imaging of living mice with deep issue penetration and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios.

Abstract
Herein, we introduce the supramolecular plastic&#8208;like hydrogel (SPH) as a platform to fabricate sustainable plastics with ultrahigh stiffness and strength as well as water&#8208;assisted arbitrarily shapeable capability. The transparent plastics are constructed from SPHs of cellulose ether/polycarboxylic acid complexes and demonstrate mechanical robustness with Young's modulus up to 3.4&#160;GPa and tensile strength up to 124.0&#160;MPa, superior or comparable to most common plastics. Meanwhile, the shape of the plastics can be reversibly engineered by air drying of the SPHs with diverse 2D/3D shapes and structures, which are generated conveniently via origami, kirigami, embossing, etc., in virtue of plastic deformation and shape memory effect of SPHs. On the basis of multi&#8208;dimensional infrared&#8208;spectral analysis, it is revealed that the dense acid&#8208;acid and acid&#8208;ether H&#8208;bonding network in the plastic is responsible for the mechanical robustness while the evolution of water&#8208;polymer H&#8208;bonds into polymer&#8208;polymer H&#8208;bonds during air drying contributes to the shape fixing. This work provides a novel method of manufacturing sustainable plastics with simultaneous strong mechanical performance and convenient processibility from hydrogels with plastic&#8208;like mechanical behavior.

         <title>Implanting Electrons Donor to Enlarge d&#8208;p Hybridization of High&#8208;entropy (Oxy)hydroxide: A Novel Design to Boost Oxygen Evolution</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;entroy (HE) electrocatalysts are becoming the research hotspot due to their interesting &#8220;Cocktail Effect&#8221; and great potential for tailored catalytic properties. However, it is still a great challenge to illustrate their inherent catalytic mechanism for &#8220;Cocktail Effect&#8221;, and there is also a paucity of quantitative descriptors to characterize the specific catalytic activity and give logical design stratiges for HE systems. Herein we first report unexpected activation of all metal sites in HE Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe&#8208;Ag&#8208;Mo (oxy)hydroxides for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and find that metal&#8208;oxygen d&#8208;p hybridization as an effective descriptor can indicate the intrinsic activity of each metal site. According to the quantitative hybridizaiton, introducing electrons donor (e.g., Ag) is raised and verified to reinforce the electrocatalytic activity of HE system. Consequently, we construct Ag&#8208;decorated Co&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8208;Ag&#8208;Mo (oxy)hydroxide (Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH) electrocatalysts by an electrochemical reconstruction method and their OER performances are thoroughly characterized. The Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH is verified with a low overpotential (270&#160;mV at 100&#160;mA/cm2) and a small Tafel slope (35.3&#160;mV/dec) as well as good electrochemical stability. The favorable activity of electrons donor and underlying synergistic &#8220;Cocktail Effect&#8221; are demonstrated and disclosed. Our work opens up a new strategy to guide the design/fabricaiton of advanced HE electrocatalysts.

         <title>Chemical Passivation Stabilizes Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) are an attractive option for grid scale energy storage, which vital to the integration of renewable energy resources with the electric energy infrastructure. The cycling stability of aqueous ZIBs is determined by the electrochemical reversibility of Zn anode, which is often deteriorated by its corrosion and dendritic Zn deposition. Here, we demonstrate a simple and rapid surface passivation strategy that can drastically improve the cycling stability of Zn anodes. For example, a dip in KMnO4 solution readily forms a continuous, conformal and robust protective layer on the native Zn surface, leading to more uniform plating/stripping process, increased corrosion resistance and tolerance to manufacturing and processing defects on Zn metal electrodes. The Zn electrode cycling stabilities at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 are extended by about 40 times. In full battery tests in the configuration of Zn||&#946;&#8208;MnO2, the full cell with passivated Zn anode exhibited a capacity retention of 68.7% after 300 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g&#8722;1, while the cell with untreated Zn anode could only retain 7.4% of capacity under the same conditions.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Defective and Porous Ir Metallene with Polyallylamine for Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The design of defects and porous structures into metallene with functional surfaces is highly desired to improve its permeability, surface area and active sites, but remains a great challenge. In this work, polyallylamine encapsulated Ir metallene with defects and porous structure (Ir@PAH metallene) is easily fabricated by a one&#8208;step wet chemical reduction method. The Ir@PAH metallene exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with an overpotential of only 14&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, a low Tafel slope of 31.2&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, and almost no activity decay after stability test. The abundant defects and pores as well as several&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer nanosheet structures of Ir@PAH metallene provide a large specific surface area, high conductivity and efficient mass transport/diffusion. In addition, surface&#8208;functionalized PAH molecules can modulate the electronic structure through strong Ir&#8208;N interaction and act as proton carriers to capture hydrogen ions, which is very beneficial for HER in acidic media. This work provides a useful strategy for the synthesis of the defective and porous metallene with functionalized surfaces for various catalytic applications.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Fe Catalysts for Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions: Roles of Different N Species</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recognizing and controlling the structure&#8208;activity relationships of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is vital for manipulating their catalytic properties for various practical applications. Herein, we report Fe SACs supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (SA&#8208;Fe/CN), which show high catalytic reactivity (97% degradation of bisphenol A in only 5&#160;min), high stability (80% of reactivity maintained after five runs), and wide pH suitability (working pH range 3&#8211;11) toward Fenton&#8208;like reactions. We further explored the roles of different N species in these reactions, both experimentally and theoretically. We discovered that graphitic N is an adsorptive site for the target molecule, pyrrolic N coordinates with Fe(III) and plays a dominant role in the reaction, and pyridinic N, coordinated with Fe(II), is only a minor contributor to the reactivity of SA&#8208;Fe/CN. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that a lower d&#8208;band center location of pyrrolic&#8208;type Fe sites leads to the easy generation of Fe&#8208;oxo intermediates, and thus, excellent catalytic properties.

         <title>Protein&#8208;encoding Free&#8208;standing RNA Hydrogel for Sub&#8208;compartmentalized Translation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
RNA can self&#8208;fold into complex structures that can serve as major biological regulators in protein synthesis and in catalysis. Due to the abundance of structural primitives and functional diversity, RNA has been utilized for designing Nature&#8208;defined goals despite its intrinsic chemical instability and lack of technologies. Here, a robust, free&#8208;standing RNA hydrogel was developed through a sequential process involving both ligation and rolling circle transcription to form RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes, capable of both catalytic activity and enhancing expression of several proteins in sub&#8208;compartmentalized, phase&#8208;separated translation environments. Our observations suggest that this hydrogel will expand RNA research and impact practical RNA principles and applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA can self-fold into complex structures that can serve as major biological regulators in protein synthesis and in catalysis. Due to the abundance of structural primitives and functional diversity, RNA has been utilized for designing Nature-defined goals despite its intrinsic chemical instability and lack of technologies. Here, a robust, free-standing RNA hydrogel was developed through a sequential process involving both ligation and rolling circle transcription to form RNA G-quadruplexes, capable of both catalytic activity and enhancing expression of several proteins in sub-compartmentalized, phase-separated translation environments. Our observations suggest that this hydrogel will expand RNA research and impact practical RNA principles and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;co&#8208;electrolysis for co&#8208;production of phosphate and hydrogen in neutral phosphate buffer electrolyte</title>

Abstract
The spontaneous reaction between Zn and H2O is of critical importance and could plausibly be used to produce H2 gas, especially under neutral conditions. However, this reaction has long been overlooked owing to its sluggish kinetics and Zn consumption. Herein, we report a unique self&#8208;co&#8208;electrolysis system (SCES), using a Zn anode, a CoP&#8208;based catalytic cathode, and a neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as the electrolyte. In this SCES, Zn is not only a sacrificial anode but also an important precursor of high value&#8208;added NaZnPO4. Additionally, the composition and phase structure of NaZnPO4 can be well regulated. In this study, a high&#8208;performance N,Cu&#8208;CoP/carbon cloth (CC) catalyst was synthesized to catalyze the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at an especially low overpotential of 64.7&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. H2 gas (13.7&#160;mL cm&#8211;2 h&#8211;1) and NaZnPO4 (3.73&#160;mg cm&#8211;2 h&#8211;1) were obtained at the cathode and anode, respectively, in the N,Cu&#8208;CoP/CC || Zn SCES spontaneously. Moreover, the SCES had a favorable open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.79&#160;V and a maximum power density of 1.83&#160;mW cm&#8211;2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the electronic structure and HER catalytic mechanism of the N and Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;doped CoP catalysts.

         <title>Construction of mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting scaffolds in Zn powder: A scalable route to dendrite&#8208;free and flexible Zn anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are considered ideal candidates for Zn&#8208;based batteries because they enable a positive synergistic integration of safety and energy density. However, Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes still experience easy corrosion, uncontrolled dendrite growth, and poor mechanical strength, which restrict their further application. Herein, a mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor scaffold was introduced into Zn&#8208;P to successfully fabricate anti&#8208;corrosive, flexible, and dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes using a scalable tape&#8208;casting strategy. The as&#8208;established scaffold is characterized by robust flexibility, facile scale&#8208;up synthesis methodology, and exceptional anti&#8208;corrosive characteristics, and it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux during Zn plating/stripping, thus allowing stable Zn cycling. Benefiting from these comprehensive attributes, the as&#8208;prepared Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anode provides superior electrochemical performance, including long&#8208;life cycling stability and high rate capability in practical coin and flexible pouch cells; thus, it holds great potential for developing advanced Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The findings of this study provide insights for a promising scalable pathway to fabricate highly efficient and reliable Zn&#8208;based anodes and will aid in the realization of advanced flexible energy&#8208;storage devices.

Abstract
Advances in wearable epidermal sensors have revolutionized the way that physiological signals are captured and measured for health monitoring. One major challenge is to convert physiological signals to easily readable signals in a convenient way. One possibility for wearable epidermal sensors is based on visible readouts. There are a range of materials whose optical properties can be tuned by parameters such as temperature, pH, light, and electric fields. Herein, this review covers and highlights a set of materials with tunable optical properties and their integration into wearable epidermal sensors for health monitoring. Specifically, the recent progress, fabrication, and applications of these materials for wearable epidermal sensors are summarized and discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the next generation wearable devices are proposed.

         <title>Constructing Structurally Ordered High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles on Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Mesoporous Carbon Nanosheets for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally ordered high&#8208;entropy alloy (OHEA) nanoparticles (NPs) are constructed on a 2D nitrogen&#8208;rich mesoporous carbon sandwich framework (OHEA&#8208;mNC) through ligand&#8208;assisted interfacial assembly with NH3 annealing. The atom&#8208;resolved chemical identification confirms the ordered structure of HEA NPs with an L12 phase. The OHEA&#8208;mNC catalyst affords a greatly enhanced oxygen reduction performance compared with disordered HEA and Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
Recent efforts have observed nanoscaled chemical short&#8208;range order in bulk high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Simultaneously inspired with the nanostructuring technology, HEA nanoparticles (NPs) with complete chemical order may be achieved. Herein, structurally ordered HEA (OHEA) NPs are constructed on a novel 2D nitrogen&#8208;rich mesoporous carbon sandwich framework (OHEA&#8208;mNC) by combining a ligand&#8208;assisted interfacial assembly with NH3 annealing. Characterization results show that the resultant materials possess an ultrathin 2D nanosheet structure with large mesopores (&#8776;10&#160;nm), where structurally ordered HEA NPs with an L12 phase are homogeneously dispersed. The atom&#8208;resolved chemical analyses explicitly determine the location of each atomic site. When being evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction, the OHEA&#8208;mNC NPs afford a greatly enhanced catalytic performance, including a large half&#8208;wave potential (0.90&#160;eV) and a high durability (0.01&#160;V decay after 10 000 cycles) compared with the disordered HEA and commercial Pt/C catalysts. The excellent performance is attributed to the enhanced mass transfer rate, improved electron conductivity, and the presence of the stable chemically ordered HEA phase, as revealed by both the experimental results and theoretical calculation. This study suggests a highly feasible process to achieve structurally ordered HEA NPs with advanced mesoporous function in the electrochemical field.

         <title>Large magnetic gap in a designer ferromagnet&#8208;topological insulator&#8208;ferromagnet heterostructure</title>

Abstract
Combining magnetism and nontrivial band topology gives rise to quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators and exotic quantum phases such as the QAH effect where current flows without dissipation along quantized edge states. Inducing magnetic order in topological insulators via proximity to a magnetic material offers a promising pathway towards achieving QAH effect at high temperature for lossless transport applications. One promising architecture involves a sandwich structure comprising two single&#8208;septuple layers of MnBi2Te4 (a 2D ferromagnetic insulator) with ultra&#8208;thin Bi2Te3 in the middle, and is predicted to yield a robust QAH insulator phase with a large bandgap greater than 50 meV. Here we demonstrate the growth of a 1SL MnBi2Te4 / 4QL Bi2Te3 /1SL MnBi2Te4 heterostructure via molecular beam epitaxy and probe the electronic structure using angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. We observe strong hexagonally warped massive Dirac Fermions and a bandgap of 75 &#177; 15meV. The magnetic origin of the gap is confirmed by the observation of the exchange&#8208;Rashba effect, as well as the vanishing bandgap above the Curie temperature, in agreement with density functional theory calculations. These findings provide insights into magnetic proximity effects in topological insulators and reveal a promising platform for realizing the QAH effect at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Upcycling Silicon Photovoltaic Waste into Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two decades after the rapid expansion of photovoltaics, the number of solar panels reaching the end&#8208;of&#8208;life is increasing. While precious metals such as silver and copper are usually recycled, silicon, which makes up the bulk of a solar cell, goes to landfills. This is due to the defect&#8208; and impurity&#8208;sensitive nature in most silicon&#8208;based technologies, rendering it uneconomical to purify waste silicon. Thermoelectrics is a rare class of material in which defects and impurities can be engineered to enhance its performance. This is thanks to its majority carrier nature, making it defect&#8208; and impurity&#8208;tolerant. Here, we enables the upcycling of silicon from photovoltaic waste into thermoelectrics. This is done by doping 1% Ge and 4% P, which results in figure of merit (zT) of 0.45 at 873 K, the highest amongst silicon&#8208;based thermoelectrics. Our work represents an important piece of puzzle in realizing circular economy for photovoltaics and electronic waste.

         <title>Reducing Contact Resistance and Boosting Device Performance of Monolayer MoS2 by In&#8208;Situ Fe Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors are emerging as plausible candidates for the next&#8208;generation &#8220;More&#8208;than&#8208;Moore&#8221; nanoelectronics to tackle the scaling challenge of transistors. Wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WS2, have recently been successfully synthesized, nevertheless, the absence of effective doping technology fundamentally results in energy barriers and high contact resistances at metal&#8208;semiconductor interfaces, and thus restrict their practical applications. Herein, we develop a controllable doping strategy in the centimeter&#8208;sized monolayer MoS2 films to address this critical issue and boost the device performance. The ultralow contact resistance and perfect Ohmic contact with metal electrodes are uncovered in monolayer Fe&#8208;doped MoS2, which deliver excellent device performance featured with ultrahigh electron mobility and outstanding on/off current ratio. The impurity scattering is suppressed significantly thanks to the ultralow electron effective mass and appropriate doping site. Particularly, unidirectionally aligned monolayer Fe&#8208;doped MoS2 domains are prepared on a 2&#8208;inch commercial c&#8208;plane sapphire, suggesting the feasibility of synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale 2D single crystal semiconductors with outstanding device performance. This work presents the potential of high&#8208;performance monolayer transistor and enables the further device downscaling and Moore's law extending.

         <title>Advances in SnO2 for Efficient and Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on the regular n&#8208;i&#8208;p device architecture have reached above 25% certified efficiency with continuously reported improvements in recent years. A key common factor for these recent breakthroughs is the development of SnO2 as an effective electron transport layer in these devices. In this review, we discuss the key advances in SnO2 development, including various deposition approaches and surface treatment strategies, to enhance the bulk and interface properties of SnO2 for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs. We also discuss the general materials chemistry associated with SnO2 along with the corresponding materials challenges and improvement strategies, focusing on defects, intrinsic properties, and impact on device characteristics. Finally, we highlight some SnO2 implementations related to scalable processes and flexible devices, and we also provide our perspective on the future development of efficient and stable large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules.

         <title>Open&#8208;Shell Nanosensitizers for Glutathione Responsive Cancer Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;based nanosensitizer (Cu(II)NS) is synthesized for sonodynamic therapy. Cu(II)NS has an unpaired electron (open shell) with a doublet ground state and little sonosensitivity. Overexpressed glutathione in tumors can reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), leading to a singlet ground state and recuperative sonosensitivity. Through regulating the valence states of Cu, tumor therapy with enhanced therapeutic index is achieved.








Abstract
Deleterious effects to normal tissues and short biological half&#8208;life of sonosensitizers limit the applications of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Herein, a new sonosensitizer (Cu(II)NS) is synthesized that consists of porphyrins, chelated Cu2+, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to overcome the challenges of SDT. As Cu2+ contains 27&#160;electrons, Cu(II)NS has an unpaired electron (open shell), resulting in a doublet ground state and little sonosensitivity. Overexpressed glutathione in the tumor can reduce Cu2+ to generate Cu(I)NS, leading to a singlet ground state and recuperative sonosensitivity. Additionally, PEG endows Cu(II)NS with increased blood biological half&#8208;life and enhanced tumor accumulation, further increasing the effect of SDT. Through regulating the valence state of Cu, cancer SDT with enhanced therapeutic index is achieved.

         <title>Bioinspired Electron Polarization of Nanozymes with a Human Self&#8208;Generated Electric Field for Cancer Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A human self&#8208;generated electric&#8208;field&#8208;promoted system for improving cancer catalytic therapy is designed. The human self&#8208;generated electric field increases the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the covalent organic framework nanozyme by about fourfold to produce hydroxyl radicals for efficient cancer therapy.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production efficiencies of the nanocatalysts are highly desired for cancer therapy, but currently the ROS generation efficiency is still far from defecting the tumors. Therefore, improving their ROS generation ability is highly desirable for cancer therapy. Herein, inspired by the electrostatic preorganization effect during the catalysis of natural protein enzymes, a human self&#8208;driven catalysis&#8208;promoting system, TENG&#8208;CatSystem is developed, to improve catalytic cancer therapy. The TENG&#8208;CatSystem is mainly composed of three elements: a human self&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as the electric field stimulator to provide electric pulses with high biosafety, a nanozyme comprising a 1D ferriporphyrin covalent organic framework coated on a carbon nanotube (COF&#8208;CNT) to generate ROS, and a COF&#8208;CNT&#8208;embedded conductive hydrogel that can be injected into the tumor tissues to increase local accumulation of COF&#8208;CNT and decrease the electrical impedances of tissues. Under the human self&#8208;generated electric field provided by the wearable TENG, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the COF&#8208;CNT is fourfold higher than that without an electric field. Highly malignant 4T1 breast carcinoma in mice is significantly suppressed using the TENG&#8208;CatSystem. The human self&#8208;driven TENG&#8208;CatSystem not only demonstrates high catalytic ROS generation efficiency for improved cancer therapy, but also offers a new therapeutic mode for self&#8208;driven at&#8208;home therapy.

         <title>Micrometer&#8208;Sized SiMgyOx with Stable Internal Structure Evolution for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ element doping approach developed in this research provides not only a promising material (SiMgyOx) as high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion battery anodes with superior properties and low industrialization cost for commercial applications, but also insights on the reasonable structural design of micrometer&#8208;sized alloying anode materials for restraining internal cracks and improving electrochemical performance.








Abstract
In recent years, micrometer&#8208;sized Si&#8208;based anode materials have attracted intensive attention in the pursuit of energy&#8208;storage systems with high energy and low cost. However, the significant volume variation during repeated electrochemical (de)alloying processes will seriously damage the bulk structure of SiOx microparticles, resulting in rapid performance fade. This work proposes to address the challenge by preparing in situ magnesium&#8208;doped SiOx (SiMgyOx) microparticles with stable structural evolution against Li uptake/release. The homogeneous distribution of magnesium silicate in SiMgyOx contributes to building a bonding network inside the particle so that it raises the modulus of lithiated state and restrains the internal cracks due to electrochemical agglomeration of nano&#8208;Si. The prepared micrometer&#8208;sized SiMgyOx anode shows high reversible capacities, stable cycling performance, and low electrode expansion at high areal mass loading. A 21700 cylindrical&#8208;type cell based on the SiMgyOx&#8208;graphite anode and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathode demonstrates a 1000&#8208;cycle operation life using industry&#8208;recognized electrochemical test procedures, which meets the practical storage requirements for consumer electronics and electric vehicles. This work provides insights on the reasonable structural design of micrometer&#8208;sized alloying anode materials toward realization of high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Highly Conducting and Stretchable Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel for Soft Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue&#8208;like soft bioelectronics requires electrodes with muscle&#8208;like mechanical properties together with high electrical conductivity. However, existing hydrogels cannot well balance the two sides. In this work, an in situ aggregation and densification method is used to make hydrogels with both high electrical conductivity and high stretchability, and the hydrogel is verified to be effective for subcutaneous electromyographic signal recording and nerve stimulation.








Abstract
Conducting polymer hydrogels are promising materials in soft bioelectronics because of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties and the capability of electrical interaction with tissues. However, it is challenging to balance electrical conductivity and mechanical stretchability: pure conducting polymer hydrogels are highly conductive, but they are brittle; while incorporating the conducting network with a soft network to form a double network can improve the stretchability, its electrical conductivity significantly decreases. Here, the problem is addressed by concentrating a poorly crosslinked precursor hydrogel with a high content ratio of the conducting polymer to achieve a densified double&#8208;network hydrogel (5.5&#160;wt% conducting polymer), exhibiting both high electrical conductivity (&#8776;10 S cm&#8211;1) and a large fracture strain (&#8776;150%), in addition to high biocompatibility, tissue&#8208;like softness, low swelling ratio, and desired electrochemical properties for bioelectronics. A surface grafting method is further used to form an adhesive layer on the conducting hydrogel, enabling robust and rapid bonding on the tissues. Furthermore, the proposed hydrogel is applied to show high&#8208;quality physiological signal recording and reliable, low&#8208;voltage electrical stimulation based on an in vivo rat model. This method provides an ideal strategy for rapid and reliable tissue&#8208;device integration with high&#8208;quality electrical communications.

         <title>Intelligent Gold Nanoparticles with Oncogenic MicroRNA&#8208;Dependent Activities to Manipulate Tumorigenic Environments for Synergistic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional spherical nucleic acids are developed to utilize and manipulate the tumorigenic genetic environment, and are able to perform tumor&#8208;specific chain activities including oncogenic miRNAs (miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;155) inhibition, miR&#8208;21&#8208;dependent photothermal therapy, and miR&#8208;155&#8208;triggered chemotherapy for effective, accurate, and sustained tumor treatment.








Abstract
Tumorigenic environments, especially aberrantly overexpressed oncogenic microRNAs, play a critical role in various activities of tumor progression. However, developing strategies to effectively utilize and manipulate these oncogenic microRNAs for tumor therapy is still a challenge. To address this challenge, spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) consisting of gold nanoparticles in the core and antisense oligonucleotides as the shell are fabricated. Hybridized to the oligonucleotide shell is a DNA sequence to which doxorubicin is conjugated (DNA&#8208;DOX). The oligonucleotides shell is designed to capture overexpressed miR&#8208;21/miR&#8208;155 and inhibit the expression of these oncogenic miRNAs in tumor cells after tumor accumulation to manipulate genetic environment for accurate gene therapy. This process further induces the aggregation of these SNAs, which not only generates photothermal agents to achieve on&#8208;demand photothermal therapy in situ, but also enlarges the size of SNAs to enhance the retention time in the tumor for sustained therapy. The capture of the relevant miRNAs simultaneously triggers the intracellular release of the DNA&#8208;DOX from the SNAs to deliver tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy. Both in vivo and in vitro results indicate that this combination strategy has excellent tumor inhibition properties with high survival rate of tumor&#8208;bearing mice, and can thus be a promising candidate for effective tumor treatment.

         <title>Magnetic Soft Millirobots 3D Printed by Circulating Vat Photopolymerization to Manipulate Droplets Containing Hazardous Agents for In Vitro Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circulating vat photopolymerization (CVP) platform is developed to print magnetic soft millirobots (MSMRs) with high magnetic loading and high uniformity. CVP is able to 3D print MSMRs with true initial 3D geometry and the capability of reversible 3D&#8208;to&#8208;3D transformation for locomotion and object manipulation. The CVP&#8208;printed MSMRs are used for automated in vitro diagnostics of carbapenemase&#8208;producing Enterobacteriaceae.








Abstract
3D printing via vat photopolymerization (VP) is a highly promising approach for fabricating magnetic soft millirobots (MSMRs) with accurate miniature 3D structures; however, magnetic filler materials added to resin either strongly interfere with the photon energy source or sediment too fast, resulting in the nonuniformity of the filler distribution or failed prints, which limits the application of VP. To this end, a circulating vat photopolymerization (CVP) platform that can print MSMRs with high uniformity, high particle loading, and strong magnetic response is presented. After extensive characterization of materials and 3D printed parts, it is found that SrFe12O19 is an ideal magnetic filler for CVP and can be printed with 30% particle loading and high uniformity. By using CVP, various tethered and untethered MSMRs are 3D printed monolithically and demonstrate the capability of reversible 3D&#8208;to&#8208;3D transformation and liquid droplet manipulation in 3D, an important task for in vitro diagnostics that are not shown with conventional MSMRs. A fully automated liquid droplet handling platform that manipulates droplets with MSMR is presented for detecting carbapenem antibiotic resistance in hazardous biosamples as a proof of concept, and the results agree with the benchmark.

         <title>All&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals Barrier&#8208;Free Contacts for High&#8208;Mobility Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals (vdW) barrier&#8208;free metal&#8211;semiconductor contact is realized by using vdW semimetals to replace conventional metals, which can avoid the pinning effect of the Fermi levels and surface dangling bonds of conventional metal electrodes. Such a strategy can effectively reduce the contact resistance and enable record&#8208;setting performance metrics of 2D semiconductor transistors.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D semiconductor devices are considered to have beyond&#8208;silicon potential but are severely troubled by the high Schottky barriers of the metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts, especially for p&#8208;type semiconductors. Due to the severe Fermi&#8208;level pinning effect and the lack of conventional semimetals with high work functions, their Schottky hole barriers are hardly removed. Here, an all&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals barrier&#8208;free hole contact between p&#8208;type tellurene semiconductor and layered 1T&#8242;&#8208;WS2 semimetal is reported, which achieves a zero Schottky barrier height of 3 &#177; 9&#160;meV and a high field&#8208;effect mobility of &#8776;1304 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. The formation of such contacts can be attributed to the higher work function of &#8776;4.95&#160;eV of the 1T&#8242;&#8208;WS2 semimetal, which is in sharp contrast with low work function (4.1&#8211;4.7&#160;eV) of conventional semimetals. The study defines an available strategy for eliminating the Schottky barrier of metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts, facilitating 2D&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based electronics and optoelectronics to extend Moore's law.

&lt;p&gt;An all-van-der-Waals (vdW) barrier-free metal&#8211;semiconductor contact is realized by using vdW semimetals to replace conventional metals, which can avoid the pinning effect of the Fermi levels and surface dangling bonds of conventional metal electrodes. Such a strategy can effectively reduce the contact resistance and enable record-setting performance metrics of 2D semiconductor transistors.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin 2D semiconductor devices are considered to have beyond-silicon potential but are severely troubled by the high Schottky barriers of the metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts, especially for p-type semiconductors. Due to the severe Fermi-level pinning effect and the lack of conventional semimetals with high work functions, their Schottky hole barriers are hardly removed. Here, an all-van-der-Waals barrier-free hole contact between p-type tellurene semiconductor and layered 1T&#8242;-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; semimetal is reported, which achieves a zero Schottky barrier height of 3 &#177; 9&#160;meV and a high field-effect mobility of &#8776;1304 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>In Situ Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Organoids and Extracellular Matrix Interactions via Phototransfer by Allyl Sulfide Exchange&#8208;Expansion Microscopy (PhASE&#8208;ExM)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for expansion microscopy is devised and applied to visualize organoids cultured in Matrigel and synthetic hydrogels. Several existing limitations associated with imaging of organoids are overcome, enabling super&#8208;resolution image acquisition, eliminating signal attenuation for whole organoid imaging, and facilitating capture and quantification of cell&#8211;matrix interactions of organoids.








Abstract
3D organoid models have recently seen a boom in popularity, as they can better recapitulate the complexity of multicellular organs compared to other in vitro culture systems. However, organoids are difficult to image because of the limited penetration depth of high&#8208;resolution microscopes and depth&#8208;dependent light attenuation, which can limit the understanding of signal transduction pathways and characterization of intimate cell&#8208;extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. To overcome these challenges, phototransfer by allyl sulfide exchange&#8208;expansion microscopy (PhASE&#8208;ExM) is developed, enabling optical clearance and super&#8208;resolution imaging of organoids and their ECM in 3D. PhASE&#8208;ExM uses hydrogels prepared via photoinitiated polymerization, which is advantageous as it decouples monomer diffusion into thick organoid cultures from the hydrogel fabrication. Apart from compatibility with organoids cultured in Matrigel, PhASE&#8208;ExM enables 3.25&#215; expansion and super&#8208;resolution imaging of organoids cultured in synthetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels crosslinked via allyl&#8208;sulfide groups (PEG&#8208;AlS) through simultaneous photopolymerization and radical&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;transfer reactions that complete in &lt;70 s. Further, PEG&#8208;AlS hydrogels can be in situ softened to promote organoid crypt formation, providing a super&#8208;resolution imaging platform both for pre&#8208; and post&#8208;differentiated organoids. Overall, PhASE&#8208;ExM is a useful tool to decipher organoid behavior by enabling sub&#8208;micrometer scale, 3D visualization of proteins and signal transduction pathways.

         <title>Recent Advances in Delivery Systems for Genetic and Other Novel Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New vaccines such as genetic and subunit vaccines create the potential for improving the protective for improving challenged diseases. Owing to their nature, vaccine&#8208;delivery systems are important for their development. Recent advances are assessed and their features are discussed based on their research emphasis on functional design or administration route optimization, providing an overview of this field.








Abstract
Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost&#8208;effective prophylactic measures against diseases, especially infectious diseases including smallpox and polio. However, the development of effective prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines for other diseases such as cancer remains challenging. This is often due to the imprecise control of vaccine activity in vivo which leads to insufficient/inappropriate immune responses or short immune memory. The development of new vaccine types in recent decades has created the potential for improving the protective potency against these diseases. Genetic and subunit vaccines are two major categories of these emerging vaccines. Owing to their nature, they rely heavily on delivery systems with various functions, such as effective cargo protection, immunogenicity enhancement, targeted delivery, sustained release of antigens, selective activation of humoral and/or cellular immune responses against specific antigens, and reduced adverse effects. Therefore, vaccine delivery systems may significantly affect the final outcome of genetic and other novel vaccines and are vital for their development. This review introduces these studies based on their research emphasis on functional design or administration route optimization, presents recent progress, and discusses features of new vaccine delivery systems, providing an overview of this field.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Reconfiguration&#8208;Induced NiS/NiFe2O4 Composite for Performance&#8208;Enhanced Zinc&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase&#8208;reconfiguration process is fulfilled by a facile vacancy fabrication and a rapid aggregation of NiS on NiFe2O4. At the dense interface of the substrate and the in situ reconfigurable phase, the activated Ni atom shared by two phases in the interface can adsorb OH more easily and therefore affords a Zn&#8722;air battery (ZAB) with outstanding performance.








Abstract
Constructing composite structures is an essential approach for obtaining multiple functionalities in a single entity. Available synthesis methods of the composites need to be urgently exploited; especially in situ construction. Here, a NiS/NiFe2O4 composite through a local metal&#8722;S coordination at the interface is reported, which is derived from phase reconstruction in the highly defective matrix. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure confirms that long&#8208;range order is broken via the local metal&#8722;S coordination and, by using electron energy loss spectroscopy, the introduction of NiS/NiFe2O4 interfaces during the irradiation of plasma energy is identified. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that in situ phase reconfiguration is crucial for synergistically reducing energetic barriers and accelerating reaction kinetics toward catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result; it leads to an overpotential of 230&#160;mV @10 mA cm&#8722;2 for the OER and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81 V&#160;for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); as well as an excellent zinc&#8722;air battery (ZAB) performance with a power density of 148.5 mW cm&#8722;2. This work provides a new compositing strategy in terms of fast phase reconstruction of bifunctional catalysts.

         <title>Thermalization of Fluorescent Protein Exciton&#8211;Polaritons at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong exciton&#8211;photon coupling is demonstrated using a red fluorescent protein &#8220;mScarlet&#8221; integrated with a microcavity. The strongly coupled exciton&#8211;polariton system demonstrates nonlinear response along with thermalization and cooling at room temperature. The effective temperature, Teff&#160;&#8776; 350 K close to the lattice temperature indicates strongly thermalized exciton&#8211;polaritons.








Abstract
Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have recently emerged as a serious contender for realizing ultralow threshold room temperature exciton&#8211;polariton condensation and lasing. This contribution investigates the thermalization of FP microcavity exciton&#8211;polaritons upon optical pumping under ambient conditions. Polariton cooling is realized using a new FP molecule, called mScarlet, coupled strongly to the optical modes in a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. Interestingly, at the threshold excitation energy (fluence) of &#8776;9 nJ per pulse (15.6 mJ cm&#8722;2), an effective temperature is observed, Teff&#160;&#8776; 350 &#177; 35 K close to the lattice temperature indicative of strongly thermalized exciton&#8211;polaritons at equilibrium. This efficient thermalization results from the interplay of radiative pumping facilitated by the energetics of the lower polariton branch and the cavity Q&#8208;factor. Direct evidence for dramatic switching from an equilibrium state into a metastable state is observed for the organic cavity polariton device at room temperature via deviation from the Maxwell&#8211;Boltzmann statistics at k&#8214;&#160;= 0 above the threshold. Thermalized polariton gases in organic systems at equilibrium hold substantial promise for designing room temperature polaritonic circuits, switches, and lattices for analog simulation.

Direct evidence for dramatic switching from an equilibrium state into a metastable state is observed for the organic cavity polariton device at room temperature via deviation from the Maxwell&#8211;Boltzmann statistics at &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Volumetric Bioprinting of Organoids and Optically Tuned Hydrogels to Build Liver&#8208;Like Metabolic Biofactories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven volumetric bioprinting enables the layerless fabrication of constructs embedding human liver organoids. Bioresins with tunable refractive index allow printing of centimeter&#8208;scale tissue analogs at high cell density in below 20 s. Organoids mature into hepatocytic structures with native&#8208;like polarization. Bioprinted mathematically defined architectures modulate liver functions such as ammonia detoxification in a geometry&#8208;dependent manner, opening new possibilities for liver biofabrication.








Abstract
Organ&#8208; and tissue&#8208;level biological functions are intimately linked to microscale cell&#8211;cell interactions and to the overarching tissue architecture. Together, biofabrication and organoid technologies offer the unique potential to engineer multi&#8208;scale living constructs, with cellular microenvironments formed by stem cell self&#8208;assembled structures embedded in customizable bioprinted geometries. This study introduces the volumetric bioprinting of complex organoid&#8208;laden constructs, which capture key functions of the human liver. Volumetric bioprinting via optical tomography shapes organoid&#8208;laden gelatin hydrogels into complex centimeter&#8208;scale 3D structures in under 20 s. Optically tuned bioresins enable refractive index matching of specific intracellular structures, countering the disruptive impact of cell&#8208;mediated light scattering on printing resolution. This layerless, nozzle&#8208;free technique poses no harmful mechanical stresses on organoids, resulting in superior viability and morphology preservation post&#8208;printing. Bioprinted organoids undergo hepatocytic differentiation showing albumin synthesis, liver&#8208;specific enzyme activity, and remarkably acquired native&#8208;like polarization. Organoids embedded within low stiffness gelatins (&lt;2&#160;kPa) are bioprinted into mathematically defined lattices with varying degrees of pore network tortuosity, and cultured under perfusion. These structures act as metabolic biofactories in which liver&#8208;specific ammonia detoxification can be enhanced by the architectural profile of the constructs. This technology opens up new possibilities for regenerative medicine and personalized drug testing.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Fibers Embedded with Zincophilic Cu Nanoboxes for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The practical application of Zn metal anodes (ZMAs) is mainly impeded by the limited lifespan and low Coulombic efficiency (CE) resulting from the Zn dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) multi&#8208;functional host consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon fibers embedded with Cu nanoboxes (denoted as Cu NBs@NCFs) is rationally designed and developed for stable ZMAs. The 3D macroporous configuration and hollow structure can lower the local current density and alleviate the large volume change during the repeated cycling processes. Furthermore, zincophilic Cu and in&#8208;situ formed Cu&#8208;Zn alloy can act as homogeneous nucleation sites to minimize the Zn nucleation overpotential, further guiding uniform and dense Zn deposition. As a result, this Cu NBs@NCFs host exhibits high CE of Zn plating/stripping for 1000 cycles. The Cu NBs@NCFs&#8208;Zn electrode shows low voltage hysteresis and prolonged cycling life (450 h) with dendrite&#8208;free behaviors. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a Zn ion full cell is fabricated based on this Cu NBs@NCFs&#8208;Zn anode, which demonstrates decent rate capability and improved cycling performance.

         <title>Rational Synthesis of Solid&#8208;State Ultraviolet B Emitting Carbon Dots via Acetic Acid&#8208;Promoted Fractions of sp3 Bonding Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have received tremendous attention for their excellent photoluminescence (PL) properties. However, it remains a great challenge to obtain CDs with ultraviolet (UV, 200&#8211;400&#160;nm) emission in solid state, which requires strict control of the CDs structure and overcoming the aggregation caused quenching (ACQ). Herein, a new sp3 compartmentalization strategy is developed to meet these requirements, by employing acetic acid to promote fractions of sp3 bonding during the synthesis of CDs. It markedly decreases the size of sp2 conjugating units in the CDs, and shifts PL emission to the ultraviolet B (UVB) region (&#955;max = 308&#160;nm). Moreover, sp2 domains are well spatially compartmentalized by sp3 domains and the ACQ effect is minimized, enabling the high quantum yield in solid state (20.2%, &#955;ex = 265&#160;nm) with narrow bandwidth of 24&#160;nm and environmental robustness. The solid&#8208;state UVB emissive CDs is highly desired for application in photonic devices. Hence, a demo of UVB light&#8208;emitting diodes is fabricated for plant lighting, leading to a 29% increase of ascorbic acid content in the basil. Overall, we provide a rational and efficient way to construct solid UVB&#8208;CDs phosphors for wide applications.

         <title>Direct Ink Writing: A 3D Printing Technology for Diverse Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) has gained significant attention due to its ability to drive technological development as a sustainable, flexible, and customizable manufacturing scheme. Among the various AM techniques, direct ink writing (DIW) has emerged as the most versatile three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing technique for the broadest range of materials. DIW allows printing of practically any material, as long as the precursor ink can be engineered to demonstrate appropriate rheological behavior. This technique acts as a unique pathway to introduce design freedom, multifunctionality, and stability simultaneously into its printed structures. Here, we present a comprehensive review of DIW of complex 3D structures from various materials, including polymers, ceramics, glass, cement, graphene, metals, and their combinations through multimaterial printing. The review begins with an overview of the fundamentals of ink rheology, followed by an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various methods to tailor the ink for DIW of different classes of materials. Then, the diverse applications of DIW ranging from electronics to food to biomedical industries have been discussed. Finally, we highlight the current challenges and limitations of this technique, followed by its prospects as a guideline towards possible futuristic innovations.

         <title>Supported Lipid Bilayers Coupled to Organic Neuromorphic Devices Modulate Short&#8208;Term Plasticity in Biomimetic Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomembrane&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is fabricated and the short&#8208;term depression of the device is investigated. After morphological and electrical characterization of the lipid bilayer, its ionic barrier behavior is exploited to enhance the neuromorphic operation of the OECT. Such devices pave the way to synapse&#8208;resembling platforms to investigate neurodegenerative processes involving synaptic plasticity loss.








Abstract
Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental process for neuronal communication and is involved in neurodegeneration. This process has been recently exploited to inspire the design of next&#8208;generation bioelectronic platforms. Neuromorphic devices have emerged as ideal candidates in mimicking brain functionalities, thanks to their ionic&#8208;to&#8208;electronic signal transduction, biocompatibility, and their ability to display short&#8208; and long&#8208;term memory as biological synapses. However, these devices still fail in bridging the gap between electronics and biological systems due to the lack of biomimetic features. Here, a biomembrane&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is implemented and the supported&#8208;lipid&#8208;bilayer&#8208;mediated short&#8208;term depression of the device is investigated. After morphological and electrical characterization of the lipid bilayer, its ionic barrier behavior is exploited to enhance the neuromorphic operation of the OECT. Such biomimetic neuromorphic devices pave the way toward the implementation of synapses&#8208;resembling in vitro platforms to investigate and characterize neurodegenerative processes involving synaptic plasticity loss.

Here, a biomembrane-based organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is implemented and the supported-lipid-bilayer-mediated short-term depression of the device is investigated. After morphological and electrical characterization of the lipid bilayer, its ionic barrier behavior is exploited to enhance the neuromorphic operation of the OECT. Such biomimetic neuromorphic devices pave the way toward the implementation of synapses-resembling in vitro platforms to investigate and characterize neurodegenerative processes involving synaptic plasticity loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Flexible Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodine Microbattery with Unprecedented Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine microbattery with &gt;1500&#160;mWh cm&#8722;3 volumetric energy density and &gt;2000 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2 areal energy density is developed by a simple and effective strategy where an iodine cathode is generated in situ during charging. This work affords an innovative strategy to construct an ideal micro&#8208;power&#8208;source for future miniaturized and integrated electronics.








Abstract
Currently, reported aqueous microbatteries (MBs) only show unsatisfactory electrochemical performance (&#8804;120 mWh cm&#8722;3 volumetric energy density and &lt;1000&#160;&#956;Wh cm&#8722;2 areal energy density) and it remains challenging to develop durable aqueous MBs that can simultaneously offer both high volumetric and areal energy density. Herein, an in situ electrodeposition strategy is adopted to construct a flexible aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine MB (ZIDMB). Notably, the fabrication process well avoids the use of common additives (such as binders, conductive agents, and toxic solvent) and also bypasses subsequent time&#8208;consuming procedures such as grinding, coating, drying, etc., thus greatly simplifying the manufacture of the ZIDMB. Meanwhile, owing to the suppression of the shuttle effect of triiodide ions and the high ionic conductivity of the polyelectrolyte, the ZIDMB can simultaneously deliver record&#8208;high volumetric and areal energy densities of 1647.3 mWh cm&#8722;3 and 2339.1 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2, thus achieving values at least 13.5&#8208; and 2.3&#8208;fold better than those of best available aqueous MBs, respectively. This work affords an innovative strategy to construct an ideal micro&#8208;power&#8208;source for future miniaturized and integrated electronics.

         <title>Physically Detachable and Operationally Stable Cs2SnI6 Photodetector Arrays Integrated with &#956;&#8208;LEDs for Broadband Flexible Optical System</title>

Abstract
With the surge in perovskite research, practical features for future applications are like to be secured, but the reliability of the materials and the use of hazardous Pb are longstanding problems. Here, an air&#8208;stable Cs2SnI6 (CSI) is prepared via diluted hydriodic acid solvent&#8208;based precursor optimization during scalable hydrothermal growth. Materials characterization is performed using various elemental peak analyses and crystallographic identification. The resulting CSI exhibits long&#8208;term operating stability over 6 months, (i) at elevated temperatures, (ii) in ambient air, and (iii) under light illumination from UV to near&#8208;infrared. More importantly, to demonstrate an intriguing class of application up to system level, physically detachable CSI photodetector arrays (PD&#8208;arrays), integrated with micro&#8208;light emitting diodes (&#956;&#8208;LEDs) arrays, are successfully implemented. In addition, 3&#160;&#215; 3 flexible CSI PDs are fully operational, even in the air, and their spatial uniformity in pixels is quantitatively evaluated. The charge transport mechanisms of the CSI PDs under light and elevated temperature are assessed via temperature&#8208;dependent characterization from 148 K to 373 K, implying the involvement of 3D variable&#8208;range hopping. Multi&#8208;cycle evaluation of the CSI PD&#8208;arrays confirms their operational stability in AC and DC mode, demonstrating this platform's potential benefit for wireless optical interconnection in advanced Si technology.

         <title>Triboresistive Touch Sensing: grid&#8208;free Touch Point Recognition Based on Monolayered Ionic Power Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent growing pursuit of skin&#8208;mountable devices has been impeded by complicated structures of most sensing systems, containing electrode grids, stacked multi&#8208;layers, and even external power sources. Here, we introduce a type of touch sensing, termed triboresistive touch sensing, for gridless touch recognition based on monolayered ionic power generators. A homogeneous monolayer, i.e., ionic PDMS, generates electricity based on the electric field generated by touch. Voltages generated at each corner of ionic PDMS relied on resistance between touch points and each corner, ensuring recognition of the touch positions without need for electrode grid layers and external power sources. With notable advantages of high transparency (96.5%), stretchability (539.1%), and resilience (99.0%) of the ionic PDMS, epidermal triboresistive sensing was demonstrated to express touch position and readily play a musical instrument. Gridless system of triboresistive sensing allowed to rearrange touch sections according to a given situation without any physical modification, and thus easily completed consecutive missions of controlling position, orientation, and gripping functions of a robot.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Airflow Sensors Based on Suspended Carbon Nanotube Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;performance airflow sensors are in great demand in numerous fields but still face many challenges such as slow response speed, low sensitivity, large detection threshold, narrow sensing range, etc. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit many advantages in fabricating airflow sensors due to their nanoscale diameters, excellent mechanical and electrical properties, etc. However, the intrinsic extraordinary properties of CNTs were not fully exhibited in previously reported CNTs&#8208;based airflow sensors due to the mixed structures of macroscale CNT assemblies. Herein, we present suspended CNT networks (SCNTNs) as high&#8208;performance airflow sensors, which were self&#8208;assembled by ultralong CNTs and short CNTs in a one&#8208;step floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) process. The SCNTNs&#8208;based airflow sensors achieved a record&#8208;breaking short response time of 0.021 s, a high sensitivity of 0.0124 s m&#8722;1, a small detection threshold of 0.11 m s&#8722;1, and a wide detection range of 0.11&#8764;5.51 m s&#8722;1, superior to most of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art airflow sensors. To reveal the sensing mechanism, an acoustic response testing system and a mathematical model were developed. It was found that the airflow&#8208;caused intertube stress change resulted in the resistance variation of SCNTNs.

         <title>Aggregation Control, Surface Passivation, and Optimization of Device Structure Toward Near&#8208;Infrared Perovskite Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with an EQE up to 15.4%</title>

Abstract
In recent years, the performance of perovskite quantum dots (QDs) and QD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) has improved greatly, with the electroluminescence (EL) efficiency of green and red emission exceeding 20%. However, the development of perovskite near&#8208;infrared (NIR) QLEDs has reached stagnation, where the reported maximum EL efficiency is still below 6%, limiting their further applications. In this work, new NIR emissive FAPbI3 QDs were developed by post&#8208;treating long alkyl&#8208;encapsulated QDs with 2&#8208;phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI). The incorporation of PEAI reduces the QD surface defects for giving high photoluminescence quantum yield up to 61.6%. The n&#8208;octane solution of PEAI&#8208;passivated FAPbI3 QDs was spin&#8208;coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS&#8208;treated ITO electrode modified with a thermally cross&#8208;linked hole&#8208;transporting layer to give a full&#8208;coverage, smooth, and dense QD film. Incorporating with an effective electron&#8208;transporting material CN&#8208;T2T with deep LUMO and good electron mobility, the optimal device with EL &#955;max at 772&#160;nm achieved an external quantum efficiency up to 15.4% at a current density of 0.54&#160;mA/cm2 (2.6&#160;V), which is the highest efficiency ever reported for perovskite&#8208;based NIR QLEDs. This study provides a facile strategy to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite QD films suitable for highly efficient NIR QLEDs applications.

&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; at 772&#160;nm achieved an external quantum efficiency up to 15.4% at a current density of 0.54&#160;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (2.6&#160;V), which is the highest efficiency ever reported for perovskite-based NIR QLEDs. This study provides a facile strategy to prepare high-quality perovskite QD films suitable for highly efficient NIR QLEDs applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Blocking Cancer&#8208;Nerve Crosstalk for Treatment of Metastatic Bone Cancer Pain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The tumor microenvironment is a complex milieu where neurons constitute an important non&#8208;neoplastic cell type. From &#8220;Cancer Neuroscience&#8221;, the crosstalk between tumors and neurons favors the rapid growth of both, making the cancer&#8208;nerve interaction a reciprocally beneficial process. Thus, the cancer&#8208;nerve crosstalk may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention against cancer and cancer&#8208;related symptoms. We proposed a nerve&#8208;cancer crosstalk blocking strategy for metastatic bone cancer pain treatment, achieved by Mg/Al&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanoshells (Mg/Al&#8208;LDH) with AZ&#8208;23 loaded inside and alendronate (ALD) decorated outside. The pain&#8208;causing H+ was rapidly eliminated by LDH, with neurogenesis inhibited by the antagonist AZ&#8208;23. As positive feedback, the decreased pain reversed the nerve&#8208;to&#8208;cancer Ca2+ crosstalk&#8208;related cell cycle, dramatically inhibiting tumor growth. All experiments confirmed the improved pain threshold and enhanced tumor inhibition. The study may inspire multidisciplinary researchers to focus on the cancer&#8208;nerve crosstalk for treating cancer and accompanied neuropathic diseases.

Abstract
Semiconductor&#8208;liquid junction (SCLJ), the dominant place in photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysis, determines the interfacial activity and stability of photoelectrodes that directly affects the viability of PEC hydrogen generation. Though efforts dedicated in past decades, a challenge remains on creating a synchronously active and stable SCLJ, owing to the technical hurdles on simultaneously overlaying the two advantages. Present work demonstrates that, creating a SCLJ with unique configuration of dual interfacial layers, could yield BiVO4 photoanodes with synchronously boosted photoelectrochemical activity and operational stability with values located at the top in records of such photoelectrodes. The bespoke dual interfacial layers, accessed via grafting laser generated carbon dots with phenolic hydroxyl groups (LGCDs&#8208;PHGs), were experimentally verified effective, not only in generating the uniform layer of LGCDs with covalent anchoring for inhibited photo&#8208;corrosion, but activating respectively the charge separation and transfer in each layer for boosted charge carrier kinetics, resulted in the FeNiOOH&#8208;LGCDs&#8208;PHGs&#8208;MBVO photoanodes with a dual configuration with the photocurrent density of 6.08&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (averagely 6.01&#160;&#177; 0.07&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) @ 1.23 VRHE, and operational stability up to 120 hours (averagely 108&#160;&#177; 12.6 hours) @ 1.23 VRHE. Further work exploring LGCDs&#8208;PHGs from catecholic molecules warrants the proposed strategy a universal alternative of addressing interfacial charge carrier kinetics and operational stability of semiconductor photoelectrodes.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Change&#8208;Enabled, Rapid, High&#8208;Resolution Direct Ink Writing of Soft Silicone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel direct ink writing (DIW) method for 3D printing high&#8208;resolution soft silicones, enabled by the fast control of phase&#8208;change ink's flow behavior is presented. Printed filaments with a diameter of 50 &#181;m set a new benchmark in DIW of soft silicone. This technology exhibits excellent performances in the fabrication of flexible sensors, superhydrophobic surfaces, and shape&#8208;memory bionic devices.








Abstract
Soft silicone is an ideal flexible material for application, e.g., in soft robotics, flexible electronics, bionics, or implantable biomedical devices. However, gravity&#8208;driven sagging, filament stretching, and deformation can cause inevitable defects during rapid manufacturing, making it hard to obtain complex, high&#8208;resolution 3D silicone structures with direct ink writing (DIW) technology. Here, rapid DIW of soft silicone enabled by a phase&#8208;change&#8208;induced, reversible change of the ink's hierarchical microstructure is presented. During printing, the silicone&#8208;based ink, containing silica nanoparticles and wax microparticles, is extruded from a heated nozzle into a cold environment under controlled stress. The wax phase change (solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid) during printing rapidly destroys and rebuilds the particle networks, realizing fast control of the ink flow behavior and printability. This high&#8208;operating&#8208;temperature DIW method is fast (maximum speed &#8776;3100&#160;mm min&#8722;1) and extends the DIW scale range of soft silicone. The extruded filaments have small diameters (50&#160;&#177; 5&#160;&#181;m), and allow for large spans (&#8776;13&#8208;fold filament diameter) and high aspect ratios (&#8776;1), setting a new benchmark in the DIW of soft silicone. Printed silicone structures exhibit excellent performance as flexible sensors, superhydrophobic surfaces, and shape&#8208;memory bionic devices, illustrating the potential of the new 3D printing strategy.

         <title>Peritoneum&#8208;Inspired Janus Porous Hydrogel with Anti&#8208;Deformation, Anti&#8208;Adhesion, and Pro&#8208;Healing Characteristics for Abdominal Wall Defect Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peritoneum&#8208;inspired Janus porous poly(vinyl alchohol) (PVA) hydrogel patch with unique asymmetric cell&#8208;adhesion behaviors and excellent anti&#8208;swelling characteristics demonstrates anti&#8208;adhesion, pro&#8208;healing, and anti&#8208;deformation properties simultaneously, leading to superior repair effect of abdominal wall defects.








Abstract
Implantable meshes used in tension&#8208;free repair operations facilitate treatment of internal soft&#8208;tissue defects. However, clinical meshes fail to achieve anti&#8208;deformation, anti&#8208;adhesion, and pro&#8208;healing properties simultaneously, leading to undesirable surgery outcomes. Herein, inspired by the peritoneum, a novel biocompatible Janus porous poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel (JPVA hydrogel) is developed to achieve efficient repair of internal soft&#8208;tissue defects by a facile yet efficient strategy based on top&#8208;down solvent exchange. The densely porous and smooth bottom&#8208;surface of JPVA hydrogel minimizes adhesion of fibroblasts and does not trigger any visceral adhesion, and its loose extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;like porous and rough top&#8208;surface can significantly improve fibroblast adhesion and tissue growth, leading to superior abdominal wall defect treatment to commercially available PP and PCO meshes. With unique anti&#8208;swelling property (maximum swelling ratio: 6.4%), JPVA hydrogel has long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;deformation performance and maintains high mechanical strength after immersion in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline (PBS) for 14 days, enabling tolerance to the maximum abdominal pressure in an internal wet environment. By integrating visceral anti&#8208;adhesion and defect pro&#8208;healing with anti&#8208;deformation, the JPVA hydrogel patch shows great prospects for efficient internal soft&#8208;tissue defect repair.

Solution&#8208;processed, large&#8208;area, and flexible electronics largely relies on the excellent electronic properties of sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon molecules, either in the form of &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules and polymers or graphene and carbon nanotubes. Carbon with sp&#8208;hybridization, the foundation of the elusive allotrope carbyne, offers vast opportunities for functionalized molecules in the form of linear carbon atomic wires (CAWs), with intriguing and even superior predicted electronic properties. While CAWs represent a vibrant field of research, to date, they have only been applied sparingly to molecular devices. The recent observation of the field&#8208;effect in microcrystalline cumulenes suggests their potential applications in solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film transistors but concerns surrounding the stability and electronic performance have precluded developments in this direction. In the present study, ideal field&#8208;effect characteristics are demonstrated for solution&#8208;processed thin films of tetraphenyl[3]cumulene, the shortest semiconducting CAW. Films are deposited through a scalable, large&#8208;area, meniscus&#8208;coating technique, providing transistors with hole mobilities in excess of 0.1&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, as well as promising operational stability under dark conditions. These results offer a solid foundation for the exploitation of a vast class of molecular semiconductors for organic electronics based on sp&#8208;hybridized carbon systems and create a previously unexplored paradigm.

         <title>Nontrivial Doping Evolution of Electronic Properties in Ising&#8208;Superconducting Alloys</title>

Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides offer unprecedented versatility to engineer 2D materials with tailored properties to explore novel structural and electronic phase transitions. In this work, we present the atomic&#8208;scale evolution of the electronic ground state of a monolayer of Nb1&#8208;&#948;Mo&#948;Se2 across the entire alloy composition range (0 &lt; &#948; &lt;&#160;1) using low&#8208;temperature (300 mK) scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). In particular, we investigate the atomic and electronic structure of this 2D alloy throughout the metal to semiconductor transition (monolayer NbSe2 to MoSe2). Our measurements let us extract the effective doping of Mo atoms, the bandgap evolution and the band shifts, which are monotonic with &#948;. Furthermore, we demonstrate that collective electronic phases (charge density wave and superconductivity) are remarkably robust against disorder. We further show that the superconducting TC changes non&#8208;monotonically with doping. This contrasting behavior in the normal and superconducting state is explained using first&#8208;principles calculations. We show that Mo doping decreases the density of states at the Fermi level and the magnitude of pair&#8208;breaking spin fluctuations as a function of Mo content. Our results paint a detailed picture of the electronic structure evolution in 2D TMD alloys, which is of utmost relevance for future 2D materials design.

         <title>Engineered Living Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Living biological systems, ranging from single cells to whole organisms, can sense, process information, and actuate in response to changing environmental conditions. Inspired by living biological systems, engineered living cells and non&#8208;living matrices are brought together, which gives rise to the technology of engineered living materials. By designing the functionalities of living cells and the structures of non&#8208;living matrices, engineered living materials can be created to detect variability in the surrounding environment and to adjust their functions accordingly, thereby enabling applications in health monitoring, disease treatment, and environmental remediation. Hydrogels, a class of soft, wet, and biocompatible materials, have been widely used as matrices for engineered living cells, leading to the nascent field of engineered living hydrogels. Here, we discuss the interactions between hydrogel matrices and engineered living cells, focusing on how hydrogels influence cell behaviours and how cells affect hydrogel properties. We also discuss the interactions between engineered living hydrogels and their environments, and how these interactions enable versatile applications. Finally, we highlight current challenges facing the field of engineered living hydrogels for their applications in clinical and environmental settings.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Engineered Conjugated Polymer Nanoplatform for Activatable Companion Diagnostics and Multi&#8208;Stage Augmented Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Companion diagnostics (CDx) provides critical information for precision medicine. However, current CDx is mostly limited to in vitro tests which cannot accurately evaluate the disease progression and treatment response in real time. To overcome this challenge, we herein report a glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;engineered conjugated polymer (polyaniline, PANI) nanoplatform (denoted as PANITG) for activatable imaging&#8208;based CDx and multi&#8208;stage augmented photothermal/starvation synergistic therapy. PANITG comprises a pH&#8208;activatable conjugated polymer as a photothermal convertor and photoacoustic (PA) emitter, a GOx as a cancer starvation inducer as well as a H2O2 and acid producer, and a H2O2&#8208;cleavable linker as a &#8220;switch&#8221; for GOx activity. The in vivo PA imaging and photothermal therapy ability are activated by acidic tumor microenvironment and self&#8208;augmented by the reaction between GOx and glucose. Meanwhile, the photothermal effect would enhance the GOx activity in turn. Such multi&#8208;stage augmentation of the therapeutic effects would facilitate effective cancer management. In addition, the in vivo PA imaging with PANITG reveals the tumor pH level which is correlated to the efficiency of the photothermal therapy and to the catalytic activity of GOx at each stage, enabling real&#8208;time activatable CDx.

         <title>Passive ultra&#8208;conductive thermal metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultra&#8208;conductive heat transport showcases significant potentials in popular thermal managements with convection, phase change, and heat source. However, it is captivated impossible for passive thermal manipulation, usually bounded by intrinsic thermal conductivities of natural materials, to outperform these active recipes in need of extra energy payload. Here, we report a robust recipe to create passive ultra&#8208;conductive thermal metamaterials consisting of nothing but bulk natural materials. Thanks to the local thermal resistance regulation by vertical thermal transport channel, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept thermal metamaterials experimentally demonstrate extreme effective conductivity (1915 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1) solely with naturally occurring materials. The purely conductive modulation without any external energy is comparable to active counterparts, and further reveals its robustness and unexpected convenience. Our findings construct a high&#8208;efficient paradigm of passive thermal management with ultra&#8208;conductive heat transport, and further hint potentials in other Laplace fields, e.g., DC and magnetostatics.

         <title>12.42% Monolithic 25.42 cm2 Flexible Organic Solar Cells Enabled by an Amorphous ITO Modified Metal Grid Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Printed metal nano&#8208;grid electrode exhibits superior characteristics for use in flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the high surface roughness and inhomogeneity between grid and blank region is adverse for performance improvement. In this work, a thin amorphous ITO film (&#945;&#8208;ITO) was introduced to fill the blank and to improve the charge transporting. The introduction of &#945;&#8208;ITO significantly improves the comprehensive properties of metal grid electrode, which exhibited excellent bending resistance and long&#8208;term stability under double 85 condition (under 85&#160;&#176;C and 85% relative humidity) for 200 h. Both experimental and simulation results revealed &#945;&#8208;ITO with a sheet resistance of 20000 &#937;/&#9633; was sufficient to improve the charge transporting within the adjacent grids, leading to a remarkable efficiency of 16.54% for 1 cm2 flexible devices. With area increased to 4.00, 9.00 and 25.42 cm2, the devices still displayed a performance of 16.22%, 14.69% and 12.42%, respectively, showing less efficiency loss during upscaling. And the 25.42 cm2 monolithic flexible device exhibited a certificated efficiency of 12.03%. Moreover, the device showed significantly improved air stability relative to conventional high&#8208;conductive PEDOT:PSS modified device. All these make the &#945;&#8208;ITO modified Ag/Cu electrode promise to achieve high&#8208; efficient and long&#8208;term stable large&#8208;area flexible OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;Printed metal nano-grid electrode exhibits superior characteristics for use in flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the high surface roughness and inhomogeneity between grid and blank region is adverse for performance improvement. In this work, a thin amorphous ITO film (&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-ITO) was introduced to fill the blank and to improve the charge transporting. The introduction of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-ITO significantly improves the comprehensive properties of metal grid electrode, which exhibited excellent bending resistance and long-term stability under double 85 condition (under 85&#160;&#176;C and 85% relative humidity) for 200 h. Both experimental and simulation results revealed &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-ITO with a sheet resistance of 20000 &#937;/&#9633; was sufficient to improve the charge transporting within the adjacent grids, leading to a remarkable efficiency of 16.54% for 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; flexible devices. With area increased to 4.00, 9.00 and 25.42 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the devices still displayed a performance of 16.22%, 14.69% and 12.42%, respectively, showing less efficiency loss during upscaling. And the 25.42 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; monolithic flexible device exhibited a certificated efficiency of 12.03%. Moreover, the device showed significantly improved air stability relative to conventional high-conductive PEDOT:PSS modified device. All these make the &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-ITO modified Ag/Cu electrode promise to achieve high- efficient and long-term stable large-area flexible OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fully Solution&#8208;Printed Photosynaptic Transistor Array with Ultralow Energy Consumption for Artificial Vision Neural Network</title>

Abstract
Photosynaptic organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) represent a viable pathway to develop bionic optoelectronics. However, the high operating voltage and current of traditional photosynaptic OFETs lead to huge energy consumption greater than that of the real biological synapses, hindering their further development in new&#8208;generation visual prosthetics and artificial perception systems. Here, we report a fully solution&#8208;printed photosynaptic OFET (FSP&#8208;OFET) with substantial energy consumption reduction by introducing a source Schottky barrier to regulate charge carrier injection, which operates with a fundamentally different mechanism from traditional devices. The FSP&#8208;OFET not only significantly lowers the working voltage and current but also provides extraordinary neuromorphic light perception capabilities. Consequently, the FSP&#8208;OFET successfully emulates visual nervous responses to external light stimuli with ultralow energy consumption of 0.07&#8208;34 fJ per spike in short&#8208;term plasticity and 0.41&#8208;19.87 fJ per spike in long&#8208;term plasticity, both approaching the energy efficiency of biological synapses (1&#8208;100 fJ). Moreover, an artificial optic&#8208;neural network made from an 8 &#215; 8 FSP&#8208;OFET array on a flexible substrate shows excellent image recognition and reinforcement abilities at a low energy cost. The designed FSP&#8208;OFET offers an opportunity to realize photonic neuromorphic functionality with extremely low energy consumption dissipation.

         <title>Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Intramolecular Motion&#8208;Induced Photothermy for Tumor Phototheranostics and Tooth Root Canal Therapy</title>

Abstract
Much effort has been devoted to develop agents with superior photoacoustic/photothermal properties for improved disease diagnosis and treatment. Herein, a new fused two isoindigo (DIID)&#8208;based semiconducting conjugated polymer (named PBDT&#8208;DIID) was rationally designed and synthesized with a strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption band ranging from 700&#8211;1000&#160;nm. Water&#8208;dispersing nanoparticles (NPs) of PBDT&#8208;DIID were prepared with good biocompatibility and a rather high photothermal conversion efficiency (70.6%), as the active excited&#8208;state intramolecular twist around the central double bonds in DIID permitted most of the absorbed excitation energy flow to heat deactivation pathway through internal conversion. The photoacoustic signal could be further magnified by incorporation of polylactide (PLA) in the NP core to confine the generated heat of PBDT&#8208;DIID within NPs. The resultant doped NPs showed excellent performance in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in an orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model. It was also found that the photothermal effect of the PBDT&#8208;DIID NPs was safe and quite efficacious to highly improve the root canal treatment outcome by heating the 1% NaClO solution inside the root canal upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation in a human extracted tooth root canal infection model.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Metaphosphate&#8208;Like Terminals Enable High&#8208;Capacity MXene Anodes for Ultrafast Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active metaphosphate&#8208;like terminals for Nb4C3 MXene, which double the specific capacity of Nb4C3 MXene for ultrafast Na+ storage, are constructed. This study unveils that the molecular&#8208;level design of MXene terminals provides opportunities to alleviate the energy&#8722;power trade&#8208;off often faced by energy&#8208;storage devices.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, so&#8208;called MXenes, are noted as ideal fast&#8208;charging cation&#8208;intercalation electrode materials, which nevertheless suffer from limited specific capacities. Herein, it is reported that constructing redox&#8208;active phosphorus&#8722;oxygen terminals can be an attractive strategy for Nb4C3 MXenes to remarkably boost their specific capacities for ultrafast Na+ storage. As revealed, redox&#8208;active terminals with a stoichiometric formula of PO2&#8208; display a metaphosphate&#8208;like configuration with each P atom sustaining three P&#63743;O bonds and one P&#63742;O dangling bond. Compared with conventional O&#8208;terminals, metaphosphate&#8208;like terminals empower Nb4C3 (denoted PO2&#8208;Nb4C3) with considerably enriched carrier density (fourfold), improved conductivity (12.3&#8208;fold at 300 K), additional redox&#8208;active sites, boosted Nb redox depth, nondeclined Na+&#8208;diffusion capability, and buffered internal stress during Na+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. Consequently, compared with O&#8208;terminated Nb4C3, PO2&#8208;Nb4C3 exhibits a doubled Na+&#8208;storage capacity (221.0 mAh g&#8208;1), well&#8208;retained fast&#8208;charging capability (4.9&#160;min at 80% capacity retention), significantly promoted cycle life (nondegraded capacity over 2000 cycles), and justified feasibility for assembling energy&#8722;power&#8208;balanced Na&#8208;ion capacitors. This study unveils that the molecular&#8208;level design of MXene terminals provides opportunities for developing simultaneously high&#8208;capacity and fast&#8208;charging electrodes, alleviating the energy&#8722;power tradeoff typical for energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Ultrafast Sub&#8208;100 fs All&#8208;Optical Modulation and Efficient Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Weyl Semimetal Niobium Phosphide Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weyl semimetals are topological materials with promising electronic and optical properties. This work thoroughly characterizes the nonlinear optical properties of the Weyl semimetal niobium phosphide by using third&#8208;harmonic generation and nondegenerate pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy. A measured third&#8208;harmonic generation efficiency of 10&#8722;4% and an ultrafast change in reflectivity of close to 1% paves the way for the coming Weyl&#8208;semimetal&#8208;based nanophotonics.








Abstract
Since their experimental discovery in 2015, Weyl semimetals have generated a large amount of attention due their intriguing physical properties that arise from their linear electron dispersion relation and topological surface states. In particular, in the field of nonlinear (NL) optics and light harvesting, Weyl semimetals have shown outstanding performances and achieved record NL conversion coefficients. In this context, the first steps toward Weyl semimetal nanophotonics are performed here by thoroughly characterizing the linear and NL optical behavior of epitaxially grown niobium phosphide (NbP) thin films, covering the visible to the near&#8208;infrared regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. Despite the measured high linear absorption, third&#8208;harmonic generation studies demonstrate high conversion efficiencies up to 10&#8722;4% that can be attributed to the topological electron states at the surface of the material. Furthermore, nondegenerate pump&#8211;probe measurements with sub&#8208;10 fs pulses reveal a maximum modulation depth of &#8776;1%, completely decaying within 100 fs and therefore suggesting the possibility of developing all&#8208;optical switching devices based on NbP. Altogether, this work reveals the promising NL optical properties of Weyl semimetal thin films, which outperform bulk crystals of the same material, laying the grounds for nanoscale applications, enabled by top&#8208;down nanostructuring, such as light&#8208;harvesting, on&#8208;chip frequency conversion, and all&#8208;optical processing.

         <title>Circular Polarized Light Emission in Chiral Inorganic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) of chiral nanomaterials has cross&#8208;disciplinary importance for fundamental sciences and technologies. Two size&#8208; and organization&#8208;dependent contributions to CPLE are analyzed: circularly polarized luminescenceand circularly polarized scattering. Synergistic integration of luminescence and scattering outputs allows for high spectral purity and strong polarization rotation, which is demonstrated for inorganic nanomaterials with multiscale chirality.








Abstract
Chiral inorganic nanostructures strongly interact with photons changing their polarization state. The resulting circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) has cross&#8208;disciplinary importance for a variety of chemical/biological processes and is essential for development of chiral photonics. However, the polarization effects are often complex and their interpretation is dependent on the several structural parameters of the chiral nanostructure. CPLE in nanostructured media has multiple origins and several optical effects are typically convoluted into a single output. Analyzing CPLE data obtained for nanoclusters, nanoparticles, nanoassemblies, and nanocomposites from metals, chalcogenides, perovskite, and other nanostructures, it is shown here that there are several distinct groups of nanomaterials for which CPLE is dominated either by circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) or circularly polarized scattering (CPS); there are also many nanomaterials for which they are comparable. The following points are also demonstrated: 1) CPL and CPS contributions involve light&#8722;matter interactions at different structural levels; 2) contribution from CPS is especially strong for nanostructured microparticles, nanoassemblies, and composites; and 3) engineering of materials with strongly polarized light emission requires synergistic implementation of CPL and CPS effects. These findings are expected to guide development of CPLE materials in a variety of technological fields, including 3D displays, information storage, biosensors, optical spintronics, and biological probes.

         <title>Stepwise Energy Transfer: Near&#8208;Infrared Persistent Luminescence from Doped Polymeric Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process with an intermediate dye is presented, which provides a universal strategy for tuning the luminescence peak by a large margin. Therefore, bright NIR luminescence with a lifetime up to 0.2 s at 810 nm is achieved based on a new triphenylene&#8208;dye&#8208;doped polymer (TP@PVA) with a blue phosphorescence of 3.29 s.








Abstract
Organic near infrared (NIR) persistent&#8208;luminescence systems with bright and long&#8208;lived emission are highly valuable for applications in communication, imaging, and sensors. However, realizing these materials (especially lifetime over 0.1 s) is a challenge, mainly because of non&#8208;radiative quenching of their long&#8208;lived excitons. Herein, a universal strategy of stepwise F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) for a bright NIR system with remarkable persistent luminescence (up to 0.2 s at 810&#160;nm) is presented, based on a new triphenylene&#8208;dye&#8208;doped polymer (triphenylene&#8208;2&#8208;ylboronic acid@poly(vinyl alcohol) (TP@PVA)) with a persistent blue phosphorescence of 3.29 s. This persistent NIR luminescence is demonstrated for application not only in NIR anti&#8208;counterfeiting but also NIR bioimaging with penetrating a piece of skin as thick as 2.0&#160;mm. By co&#8208;doping a red dye (such as Nile red) and an NIR dye Cyanine 7 (Cy7) into this doped PVA film, the shortage of spectral overlap between TP emission and Cy7 absorbance is successfully solved, through a stepwise FRET process involving triplet to singlet (TS)&#8208;FRET from TP to the intermediate red dye and then singlet to singlet (SS)&#8208;FRET to Cy7. It is noted that the efficiency of the upper TS&#8208;FRET is enhanced significantly by the lower SS&#8208;FRET, leading to high efficiencies for the continuous FRETs.

Abstract
Although Li&#8208;S batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems, their practical applications are limited by the growth of Li dendrites and lithium polysulfide shuttling. These problems can be mitigated through the use of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which exhibit the advantages of maximal atom utilization efficiency (&#8764;100%) and unique catalytic properties, thus effectively enhancing the performance of electrode materials in energy storage devices. This review systematically summarizes the recent progress in SACs intended for use in Li metal anodes, S cathodes, and separators, briefly introducing the operating principles of Li&#8208;S batteries, the action mechanisms of the corresponding SACs, and the fundamentals of SACs activity, and then comprehensively describes the main strategies for SACs synthesis. Subsequently, the applications of SACs and the principles of SACs operation in reinforced Li&#8208;S batteries as well as other metal&#8208;S batteries are individually illustrated, and the major challenges of SACs usage in Li&#8208;S batteries as well as future development directions are presented.

         <title>Stabilization of Metastable Halide Perovskite Lattices in the 2D Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size effects of metastability in halide perovskites, especially the phase stabilization in the 2D limit due to the dominance of surface effects, are critically reviewed. This stabilization allows the incorporation of various A&#8208;cations that deemed oversized for 3D perovskites into the 2D perovskite lattices, which provide new insights on how the A&#8208;cations influence the structural, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric properties.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites constitute a new class of semiconductors that are structurally tailorable, exhibiting rich structural polymorphs. In this perspective, the polymorphism in lead halide perovskites is described&#8212;a material system currently used for high&#8208;performance photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Strategies for stabilizing the metastable perovskite polymorphs based on crystal size reduction and surface functionalization are critically reviewed. Focus is on an unprecedented stabilization of metastable perovskite lattices in the 2D limit (e.g., with a thickness down to a few unit cells) due to the dominance of surface effects. This stabilization allows the incorporation of various A&#8208;cations that deemed oversized for 3D perovskites into the 2D perovskite lattices, which bring new insights on the relationships between the crystal structures and optoelectronic properties and lead to emergent ferroelectricity in halide perovskites. A comprehensive understanding is provided on how the A&#8208;cations influence the structural, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric properties, with an emphasis on the second order Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion caused by the oversized A&#8208;cations. Finally, future perspectives on new structure exploration and studies of fundamental photophysical properties using stabilized perovskite lattices are provided.

         <title>Generation and Control of Terahertz Spin Currents in Topology&#8208;Induced 2D Ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2|Bi2Te3 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature 2D ferromagnetism is successfully realized in topological&#8208;insulator&#8208;induced van der Waals Fe3GeTe2, which is evidenced by ultrafast THz emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, the direction of the external magnetic field is rotated and the sample's front surface is reversed to probe the THz radiation symmetry. The results reveal that the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion effect is the dominant THz radiation mechanism.








Abstract
Future information technologies for low&#8208;dissipation quantum computation, high&#8208;speed storage, and on&#8208;chip communication applications require the development of atomically thin, ultracompact, and ultrafast spintronic devices in which information is encoded, stored, and processed using electron spin. Exploring low&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials, designing novel heterostructures, and generating and controlling ultrafast electron spin in 2D magnetism at room temperature, preferably in the unprecedented terahertz (THz) regime, is in high demand. Using THz emission spectroscopy driven by femtosecond laser pulses, optical THz spin&#8208;current bursts at room temperature in the 2D van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) integrated with Bi2Te3 as a topological insulator are successfully realized. The symmetry of the THz radiation is effectively controlled by the optical pumping incidence and external magnetic field directions, indicating that the THz generation mechanism is the inverse Edelstein effect contributed spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. Thickness&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, and structure&#8208;dependent nontrivial THz transients reveal that topology&#8208;enhanced interlayer exchange coupling increases the FGT Curie temperature to room temperature, which provides an effective approach for engineering THz spin&#8208;current pulses. These results contribute to the goal of all&#8208;optical generation, manipulation, and detection of ultrafast THz spin currents in room&#8208;temperature 2D magnetism, accelerating the development of atomically thin high&#8208;speed spintronic devices.

Using THz emission spectroscopy driven by femtosecond laser pulses, optical THz spin-current bursts at room temperature in the 2D van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (FGT) integrated with Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a topological insulator are successfully realized. The symmetry of the THz radiation is effectively controlled by the optical pumping incidence and external magnetic field directions, indicating that the THz generation mechanism is the inverse Edelstein effect contributed spin-to-charge conversion. Thickness-, temperature-, and structure-dependent nontrivial THz transients reveal that topology-enhanced interlayer exchange coupling increases the FGT Curie temperature to room temperature, which provides an effective approach for engineering THz spin-current pulses. These results contribute to the goal of all-optical generation, manipulation, and detection of ultrafast THz spin currents in room-temperature 2D magnetism, accelerating the development of atomically thin high-speed spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photopatternable Porous Separators for Micro&#8208;Electrochemical Energy Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photopatterning of a unique porous separator is demonstrated by modifying the chemistry of SU&#8208;8, an epoxy&#8208;derived photoresist, through the addition of an imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid, which serves as a templating agent. The photopatternable SU&#8208;8&#160;separator exhibits good electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical properties, and is integrated and electrochemically validated with nonplanar high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio 3D Li&#8208;ion microbatteries.








Abstract
The miniaturization of electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems, one of the key challenges facing the rapid expansion of the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, has been limited by poor performance of the various energy&#8208;storage components at the micrometer scale. Here, the development of a unique photopatternable porous separator that overcomes the electrolyte difficulties involving resistive losses at small dimensions is reported. The separator is based on modifying the chemistry of SU&#8208;8, an epoxy&#8208;derived photoresist, through the addition of a miscible ionic liquid. The ionic liquid serves as a templating agent, which is selectively removed by solution methods, leaving the SU&#8208;8&#160;scaffold whose interconnected porosity provides ion transport from the confined liquid electrolyte. The photopatternable separator exhibits good electrochemical, chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability during the operation of electrochemical devices in both 2D and 3D formats. For the latter, the separator demonstrates the ability to form conformal coatings over 3D structures. The development of the photopatternable separator overcomes the electrolyte issues, which have limited progress in the field of micro&#8208;EES.

         <title>Rapid Identification of DNA Fragments through Direct Sequencing with Electro&#8208;Optical Zero&#8208;Mode Waveguides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for flash sequencing of DNA molecules using single&#8208;molecule real&#8208;time sequencing is proposed. Electro&#8208;optical zero&#8208;mode waveguides are presented, which use voltage to efficiently load ultralow inputs (picogram&#8208;to&#8208;nanogram levels) of various&#8208;sized DNA fragments, followed by their optically guided sequencing in just a few minutes.








Abstract
In contrast to sequence&#8208;specific techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, DNA sequencing does not require prior knowledge of the sample for surveying DNA. However, current sequencing technologies demand high inputs for a suitable library preparation, which typically necessitates DNA amplification, even for single&#8208;molecule sequencing methods. Here, electro&#8208;optical zero&#8208;mode waveguides (eZMWs) are presented, which can load DNA into the confinement of zero&#8208;mode waveguides with high efficiency and negligible DNA fragment length bias. Using eZMWs, highly efficient voltage&#8208;induced loading of DNA fragments of various sizes from ultralow inputs (nanogram&#8208;to&#8208;picogram levels) is observed. Rapid DNA fragment identification is demonstrated by burst sequencing of short and long DNA molecules (260 and 20&#160;000&#160;bp) loaded from an equimolar picomolar&#8208;level concentration mixture in just a few minutes. The device allows further studies in which low&#8208;input DNA capture is essential, for example, in epigenetics, where native DNA is required for obtaining modified base information.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Insensitive Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaics by Bulk Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bulk&#8208;heterojunction strategy is developed to reduce the temperature sensitivity of inorganic perovskite solar cells to operation temperature, which may shed light on extending the application of perovskite solar cells for specific scenarios such as polar regions, near space, and exoplanet exploration.








Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) emerge as an ideal candidate for applications beyond terrestrial implementation due to their robustness. However, underlying mechanisms regarding their photovoltaic process at different temperatures remain unclear. Based on a stable absorber of CsPbI2.85(BrCl)0.15, considerable variation of corresponding device performance is revealed over temperature and further demonstrates a simple approach to an effective reduction of such variation. Interestingly, this absorber is found to be excitonic with poor carrier transport even at an ambient temperature of 285 K and below. With a novel device configuration of a PTB7&#8208;th/perovskite bulk heterojunction, exciton dissociation and carrier extraction is facilitated. The resultant solar cell attains a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.2% with the fill factor of &#8776;84%, which represents the highest&#8208;efficiency &#947;&#8208;phase IPSCs reported to date. Importantly, this device is less sensitive to operation temperature, wherein the PCE variation over the temperature range from 210 to 360 K is 60% suppressed compared with the reference. The approach is effectively extended to other IPSCs with different photoactive phases, which may shed light on realizing highly efficient IPSCs for specific scenarios such as polar regions, near&#8208;space, and exoplanet exploration.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Memristors Based on Ultrathin 2D Copper Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of ultrathin 2D copper chalcogenides with intrinsic memristive properties is synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy. The fabricated memristors exhibit relatively small switching voltage, fast switching speed, high switching uniformity, and wide operating temperature range, as well as stable retention and switching characteristics, indicating their tangible applications in future electronics.








Abstract
Copper chalcogenides represent a class of materials with unique crystal structures, high electrical conductivity, and earth abundance, and are recognized as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation green electronics. However, their 2D structures and the corresponding electronic properties have rarely been touched. Herein, a series of ultrathin copper chalcogenide nanosheets with thicknesses down to two unit cells are successfully synthesized, including layered Cu2Te, as well as nonlayered CuSe and Cu9S5, via van der Waals epitaxy, and their nonvolatile memristive behavior is investigated for the first time. Benefiting from the highly active Cu ions with low migration barriers, the memristors based on ultrathin 2D copper chalcogenide crystals exhibit relatively small switching voltage (&#8776;0.4&#160;V), fast switching speed, high switching uniformity, and wide operating temperature range (from 80 to 420 K), as well as stable retention and good cyclic endurance. These results demonstrate their tangible applications in future low&#8208;power, cryogenic, and high temperature harsh electronics.

         <title>Intracellular Self&#8208;Immolative Polyprodrug with Near&#8208;Infrared Light Guided Accumulation and in Vivo Visualization of Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>

An intracellular self&#8208;immolative polyprodrug (PMTO) is developed, wherein the drug accumulation in tumor is significantly enhanced under laser&#8208;triggered mild hyperthermia, and the drug release behavior is real&#8208;time monitored by ratiometric photoacoustic signals. PMTO holds great potential for enhanced targeted chemotherapy efficacy as well as the visualization of drug release in vivo, guiding the clinical medication in cancer treatment.








Abstract
The selective accumulation and real&#8208;time monitoring of drug release at tumor site are the key bottlenecks to the clinical translation of polyprodrug. Herein, an intracellular self&#8208;immolative polyprodrug (PMTO) is exploited, which not only shows the enhanced cellular internalization and selective accumulation in tumor site under the mild hyperthermia triggered by laser irradiation, but also possesses the self&#8208;monitoring drug release ability in vivo. The polyprodrug amphiphiles are synthesized by sequential esterification reaction, and hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) serves as blocking agent. On account of the mild hyperthermia produced by PMTO under the laser irradiation at tumor site, the cell membranous permeability increases, resulting in the enhanced cellular internalization and drug accumulation in tumor. After internalized by cells, the self&#8208;immolative PMTO nanoparticles can release free mitoxantrone (MTO) in intracellular reductive environment, and ratiometric photoacoustic imaging based on distinct signals between MTO and PMTO is presented to trace the drug release in vivo. Finally, this self&#8208;monitoring polyprodrug presents significant tumor suppression efficacy, which exhibits great potential for guiding the clinical medication in cancer treatment.

         <title>Enabling Anionic Redox Stability of P2&#8208;Na5/6Li1/4Mn3/4O2 by Mg Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substitution strategy of partial occupation of the Na&#8208;site by Mg ions in Na0.773Li0.25Mn0.75O2 not only reduces the chemical potential energy of oxygen but also reduces the undercoordinated oxygen, the nonbonded, and electron&#8208;deficient O2p states, thus enhancing the stability of oxygen anodic redox upon long&#8208;term cycling.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;based anionic redox reactions have recently emerged as a lever to increase the capacity of Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes in addition to the charge compensation based on cationic redox reactions for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, the irreversibility of anionic redox often aggravates irreversible structure change and poor cycling performance. Here, a stable anionic redox is achieved through substituting Na ions by Mg ions in P2&#8208;type Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mg substitution effectively decreases the oxygen chemical potential, causing an improvement in lattice oxygen stability. Moreover, at a highly desodiated state, Mg ions that remain in the lattice and interact with O 2p orbitals can decrease the undercoordinated oxygen and the nonbonded, electron&#8208;deficient O 2p states, facilitating the reversibility of oxygen redox. When cycled in the voltage range of 2.6&#8211;4.5&#160;V where only anionic redox occurs for charge compensation, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 presents a much better reversibility, giving a 4 times better cycle stability than that of Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Experimentally, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 exhibits a &#8776;1.1% volume expansion during sodium insertion/extraction, suggestive of a &#8220;zero&#8208;strain&#8221; cathode. Overall, the work opens a new avenue for enhancing anionic reversibility of oxygen&#8208;related Mn&#8208;rich cathodes.

         <title>Replicating the Cynandra opis Butterfly's Structural Color for Bioinspired Bigrating Color Filters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking inspiration from the unique structures found in the wings of the butterfly Cynandra opis, two&#8208;photon photolithography is used to fabricate bigrating nanostructures, whose optical properties may be controlled by variation of the height and period of the grating features. It is demonstrated that by tuning the grating period a structural color palette array can be printed and used as an artificial structural color device optimized for technological applications.








Abstract
Multilayer grating structures, such as those found on the wings of the butterfly Cynandra opis, are able to interact with light to generate structural coloration. When illuminated and viewed at defined angles, such structural color is characterized by exceptional purity and brightness. To provide further insight into the mechanism of structural coloration, two&#8208;photon laser lithography is used to fabricate bioinspired bigrating nanostructures, whose optical properties may be controlled by variation of the height and period of the grating features. Through the use of both spectral measurements and finite&#8208;element method simulations, herein specific feature dimensions are identified that due to the combined effects of multilayer interference and diffraction generate excellent spectral characteristics and high color purity over the entire visible range. Additionally, it is demonstrated that variation of feature period and/or height plays a central role in controlling both hue and purity. Importantly, such tuneable bigrating structures are of significant utility in color filtering applications.

By taking advantage of the synergetic effect of diradical feature and strong intermolecular interactions, a stable croconium derivative, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T, with high&#8208;spin state and ultra&#8208;broadband absorption covering 300 to 2000&#160;nm in the aggregated state is obtained. CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T demonstrates highly efficient photothermal conversion promoted by multiple nonradiative decay pathways, being a potential candidate for solar thermoelectric generation.








Abstract
Organic materials with radical characteristics are gaining increasing attention, due to their potential implications in highly efficient utilization of solar energy. Manipulating intermolecular interactions is crucial for tuning radical properties, as well as regulating their absorption bands, and thus improving the photothermal conversion efficiency. Herein, a diradical&#8208;featured organic small&#8208;molecule croconium derivative, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T, is reported for highly efficient utilization of solar energy. Upon aggregation, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T exists in dimer form, stabilized by the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and exhibits a rarely reported high&#8208;spin state. Benefiting from the synergic effects of radical characteristics and strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T powder absorbs broadly from 300 to 2000&#160;nm. In&#8208;depth investigations with transient absorption analysis reveal that the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions can promote nonradiative relaxation by accelerating internal conversion and facilitating intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) between dimeric molecules to open up faster internal conversion pathways. Remarkably, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T powder demonstrates a high photothermal efficiency of 79.5% under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. By employing CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T as a solar harvester, a CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T&#8208;loaded flexible self&#8208;healing poly(dimethylsiloxane) (H&#8208;PDMS) film, named as H&#8208;PDMS/CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T self&#8208;healing film, is fabricated and employed for solar&#8211;thermal applications. These findings provide a feasible guideline for developing highly efficient diradical&#8208;featured organic photothermal materials.

         <title>Endogenous Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Coupled Electrospun Short Fiber via Collecting Wound Exudation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D bionic short&#8208;fiber scaffold with excellent reversible hydroscopicity and biostable conductivity is fabricated to achieve precise tissue remodeling by collecting a large amount of secretions in the early stages of wound healing and transmitting bioelectrical signals to proactively match the cascade reaction of tissue repair.








Abstract
Endogenous electric fields (EF) are the basis of bioelectric signal conduction and the priority signal for damaged tissue regeneration. Tissue exudation directly affects the characteristics of endogenous EF. However, current biomaterials lead to passive repair of defect tissue due to limited management of early wound exudates and inability to actively respond to coupled endogenous EF. Herein, the 3D bionic short&#8208;fiber scaffold with the functions of early biofluid collection, response to coupled endogenous EF, is constructed by guiding the short fibers into a 3D network structure and subsequent multifunctional modification. The scaffold exhibits rapid reversible water absorption, reaching maximum after only 30 s. The stable and uniform distribution of polydopamine&#8208;reduced graphene oxide endows the scaffold with stable electrical and mechanical performances even after long&#8208;term immersion. Due to its unique &#8208; bionic structure and tissue affinity, the scaffold further acts as an &#8220;electronic skin,&#8221; which transmits endogenous bioelectricity via absorbing wound exudates, promoting the treatment of diabetic wounds. Furthermore, under the endogenous EF, the cascade release of vascular endothelial growth factor accelerates the healing process. Thus, the versatile scaffold is expected to be an ideal candidate for repairing different defect tissues, especially electrosensitive tissues.

&lt;p&gt;The 3D bionic short-fiber scaffold with excellent reversible hydroscopicity and biostable conductivity is fabricated to achieve precise tissue remodeling by collecting a large amount of secretions in the early stages of wound healing and transmitting bioelectrical signals to proactively match the cascade reaction of tissue repair.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endogenous electric fields (EF) are the basis of bioelectric signal conduction and the priority signal for damaged tissue regeneration. Tissue exudation directly affects the characteristics of endogenous EF. However, current biomaterials lead to passive repair of defect tissue due to limited management of early wound exudates and inability to actively respond to coupled endogenous EF. Herein, the 3D bionic short-fiber scaffold with the functions of early biofluid collection, response to coupled endogenous EF, is constructed by guiding the short fibers into a 3D network structure and subsequent multifunctional modification. The scaffold exhibits rapid reversible water absorption, reaching maximum after only 30 s. The stable and uniform distribution of polydopamine-reduced graphene oxide endows the scaffold with stable electrical and mechanical performances even after long-term immersion. Due to its unique - bionic structure and tissue affinity, the scaffold further acts as an &#8220;electronic skin,&#8221; which transmits endogenous bioelectricity via absorbing wound exudates, promoting the treatment of diabetic wounds. Furthermore, under the endogenous EF, the cascade release of vascular endothelial growth factor accelerates the healing process. Thus, the versatile scaffold is expected to be an ideal candidate for repairing different defect tissues, especially electrosensitive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Ultimate Narrowband and Ultrapure Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Polycyclo&#8208;Heteraborin Multi&#8208;Resonance Delayed&#8208;Fluorescence Emitters</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency ultrapure blue delayed&#8208;fluorescence materials are produced by the strategic doping of multiple boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms into the fused polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin &#960;&#8208;system. These new fluorophores allow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes to demonstrate ideal narrowband and ultrapure blue electroluminescence, meeting the requirements for modern ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays.








Abstract
To achieve an ultimate wide color gamut for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays, there is great demand for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) enabling monochromatic, ultrapure blue electroluminescence (EL). Herein, high&#8208;efficiency and ultrapure blue OLEDs based on polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials, BOBO&#8208;Z, BOBS&#8208;Z, and BSBS&#8208;Z, are reported. The key to the design of the present luminophores is the exquisite combination and interplay of multiple boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur heteroatoms embedded in a fused polycyclic &#960;&#8208;system. Comprehensive photophysical and computational investigations of this family of MR&#8208;TADF materials reveal that the systematic implementation of chalcogen (oxygen and sulfur) atoms can finely modulate the emission color while maintaining a narrow bandwidth, as well as the spin&#8208;flipping rates between the excited singlet and triplet states. Consequently, OLEDs based on BOBO&#8208;Z, BOBS&#8208;Z, and BSBS&#8208;Z demonstrate narrowband and ultrapure blue EL emission, with peaks at 445&#8211;463&#160;nm and full width at half maxima of 18&#8211;23&#160;nm, leading to Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage&#8208;y coordinates in the range of 0.04&#8211;0.08. Particularly, for OLEDs incorporating sulfur&#8208;doped BOBS&#8208;Z and BSBS&#8208;Z, notably high maximum external EL quantum efficiencies of 26.9% and 26.8%, respectively, and small efficiency roll&#8208;offs are achieved concurrently.

         <title>Supramolecular Reinforcement of Polymer&#8211;Nanoparticle Hydrogels for Modular Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin&#8208;based supramolecular binding enhances the viscoelastic properties of polymer&#8211;nanoparticle hydrogels and provides modular exchange of building blocks. This paradigm expands the interactions available for the formation of this class of injectable nanocomposite hydrogels, enabling unique applications in 3D printing, magnetic materials, and conductive hydrogels.








Abstract
Moldable hydrogels are increasingly used as injectable or extrudable materials in biomedical and industrial applications owing to their ability to flow under applied stress (shear&#8208;thin) and reform a stable network (self&#8208;heal). Nanoscale components can be added to dynamic polymer networks to modify their mechanical properties and broaden the scope of applications. Viscoelastic polymer&#8211;nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels comprise a versatile and tunable class of dynamic nanocomposite materials that form via reversible interactions between polymer chains and nanoparticles. However, PNP hydrogel formation is restricted to specific interactions between select polymers and nanoparticles, resulting in a limited range of mechanical properties and constraining their utility. Here, a facile strategy to reinforce PNP hydrogels through the simple addition of &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) to the formulation is introduced. The formation of polypseudorotoxanes between &#945;CD and the hydrogel components resulted in a drastic enhancement of the mechanical properties. Furthermore, supramolecular reinforcement of CD&#8211;PNP hydrogels enabled decoupling of the mechanical properties and material functionality. This allows for modular exchange of structural components from a library of functional polymers and nanoparticles. &#945;CD supramolecular binding motifs are leveraged to form CD&#8211;PNP hydrogels with biopolymers for high&#8208;fidelity 3D (bio)printing and drug delivery as well as with inorganic NPs to engineer magnetic or conductive&#160;materials.

         <title>Designing Angstrom&#8208;Scale Asymmetric MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Cavities for High Monovalent Ion Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of ion&#8208;selective membrane that possesses an asymmetrical bi&#8208;layer of functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF) with heterostructured connections between the two MOFs is introduced. The membrane consists of natural asymmetrical nanochannels that exhibit both extraordinary high ionic current rectification and high monovalent ion selectivity.








Abstract
Biological ion channels feature angstrom&#8208;scale asymmetrical cavity structures, which are the key to achieving highly efficient separation and sensing of alkali metal ions from aqueous resources. The clean energy future and lithium&#8208;based energy storage systems heavily rely on highly efficient ionic separations. However, artificial recreation of such a sophisticated biostructure has been technically challenging. Here, a highly tunable design concept is introduced to fabricate monovalent ion&#8208;selective membranes with asymmetric sub&#8208;nanometer pores in which energy barriers are implanted. The energy barriers act against ionic movements, which hold the target ion while facilitating the transport of competing ions. The membrane consists of bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF), possessing a 6 to 3.4&#8208;angstrom passable cavity structure. The ionic current measurements exhibit an unprecedented ionic current rectification ratio of above 100 with exceptionally high selectivity ratios of 84 and 80 for K+/Li+ and Na+/ Li+, respectively (1.14 Li+ mol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1). Furthermore, using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, it is shown that the combined effect of spatial hindrance and nucleophilic entrapment to induce energy surge baffles is responsible for the membrane's ultrahigh selectivity and ion rectification. This work demonstrates a striking advance in developing monovalent ion&#8208;selective channels and has implications in sensing, energy storage, and separation technologies.

         <title>Miniaturized Multispectral Detector Derived from Gradient Response Units on Single MAPbX3 Microwire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optic&#8208;component&#8208;free miniaturized multispectral detector with response&#8208;modulated photodetector units on gradient bandgap MAPbX3 microwire is fabricated to detect and discriminate incident light from 450 to 790&#160;nm, with 25&#160;nm resolution. This work will push multispectral detectors to universal application and provide guidance for forthcoming research in novel functional perovskite devices.








Abstract
Miniaturized multispectral detectors are urgently desired given the unprecedented prosperity of smart optoelectronic chips for integrated functions including communication, imaging, scientific analysis, etc. However, multispectral detectors require complicated prism optics or interference/interferometric filters for spectral recognition, which hampers the miniaturization and their subsequent integration in photonic integrated circuits. In this work, inspired by the advance of computational imaging, optical&#8208;component&#8208;free miniaturized multispectral detector on 4&#160;mm gradient bandgap MAPbX3 microwire with a diameter of 30&#160;&#181;m, is reported. With accurate composition engineering, halide ions in MAPbX3 microwire vary from Cl to I giving in the gradual variation of optical bandgap from 2.96 to 1.68&#160;eV along axis. The sensing units on MAPbX3 microwire offer the response edge ranging from 450 to 790&#160;nm with the responsivity over 20&#160;mA W&#8722;1, &#8722;3dB&#160;width over 450&#160;Hz, LDR of &#8776;60&#160;dB, and a noise current less than &#8776;1.4 &#215; 10&#8722;12 A Hz&#8722;0.5. As a result, the derived miniaturized detector achieves the function of multispectral sensing and discrimination with spectral resolution of &#8776;25&#160;nm and mismatch of &#8776;10&#160;nm. Finally, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept colorful imaging is successfully conducted with the miniaturized multispectral detector to further confirm its application in spectral recognition.

&lt;p&gt;An optic-component-free miniaturized multispectral detector with response-modulated photodetector units on gradient bandgap MAPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; microwire is fabricated to detect and discriminate incident light from 450 to 790&#160;nm, with 25&#160;nm resolution. This work will push multispectral detectors to universal application and provide guidance for forthcoming research in novel functional perovskite devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miniaturized multispectral detectors are urgently desired given the unprecedented prosperity of smart optoelectronic chips for integrated functions including communication, imaging, scientific analysis, etc. However, multispectral detectors require complicated prism optics or interference/interferometric filters for spectral recognition, which hampers the miniaturization and their subsequent integration in photonic integrated circuits. In this work, inspired by the advance of computational imaging, optical-component-free miniaturized multispectral detector on 4&#160;mm gradient bandgap MAPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; microwire with a diameter of 30&#160;&#181;m, is reported. With accurate composition engineering, halide ions in MAPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; microwire vary from Cl to I giving in the gradual variation of optical bandgap from 2.96 to 1.68&#160;eV along axis. The sensing units on MAPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; microwire offer the response edge ranging from 450 to 790&#160;nm with the responsivity over 20&#160;mA W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &#8722;3dB&#160;width over 450&#160;Hz, LDR of &#8776;60&#160;dB, and a noise current less than &#8776;1.4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;12&lt;/sup&gt; A Hz&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;0.5&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, the derived miniaturized detector achieves the function of multispectral sensing and discrimination with spectral resolution of &#8776;25&#160;nm and mismatch of &#8776;10&#160;nm. Finally, the proof-of-concept colorful imaging is successfully conducted with the miniaturized multispectral detector to further confirm its application in spectral recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;, Dual&#8208;, Triple, and Quadruple&#8208;Wavelength Surface&#8208;Emitting Lasing in Blue&#8208;Phase Liquid Crystal</title>

A strategy of how to controllably construct a multiwavelength laser, from single&#8208;, dual&#8208;, triple&#8208; to quadruple&#8208;wavelength, in a simple configuration, i.e., a free&#8208;standing blue&#8208;phase liquid crystals film, is presented. The corresponding principle is also investigated.








Abstract
Soft organic lasers with multiwavelength output and high spectral purity are of crucial importance for versatile photonic devices, owing to their monochromaticity, coherence, and high intensity.&#160;However, there remain challenges for the achievement of&#160;surface&#8208;emitting multiwavelength lasing in soft photonic crystals, and the relative mechanisms need to be investigated. Herein, single&#8208;, dual&#8208;, triple&#8208;, and quadruple&#8208;wavelength lasers are successfully achieved in dye&#8208;doped blue&#8208;phase liquid crystal (BPLC) film. The number and wavelength of the lasing peaks can be manipulated by tuning the center of the bandgap, the order parameter of the laser dye, the quality of the resonance cavity, and even the pump energy. For single&#8208;wavelength lasing, &#160;a lasing peak with&#160;an ultranarrow linewidth of 0.04&#160;nm (Q&#8208;factor of 13&#160;454) is achieved. Multiwavelength lasing is attained based on the following aspects: i) the narrow bandgaps of the BPLCs with&#160;full width at half maximum of 14&#8211;20&#160;nm; ii) a laser dye with high gain over a wide wavelength band, having a low&#8208;order parameter in the liquid crystal matrix; iii) appropriate relative positions between the reflection and fluorescence peaks; and iv) the highly ordered crystal lattice of BPLC film. The proposed single&#8208;to&#8208;quadruple&#8208;wavelength surface&#8208;emitting lasers can be employed as coherent light sources for next&#8208;generation optical devices.

         <title>Multifunctional Biomimetic Nanovaccines Based on Photothermal and Weak&#8208;Immunostimulatory Nanoparticulate Cores for the Immunotherapy of Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal porous silicon@Au nanocomposites are used as particular cores to be coated by cancer cell membranes to construct biomimetic nanovaccine with good biosafety. The developed nanovaccine shows a good prophylactic and synergistic photothermal&#8211;immunotherapeutic efficacy on the occurrence, growth, and metastasis of solid tumors, via the recruitment and activation of immune&#8208;related cells to elicit antitumor immunity.








Abstract
An alternative strategy of choosing photothermal and weak&#8208;immunostimulatory porous silicon@Au nanocomposites as particulate cores to prepare a biomimetic nanovaccine is reported to improve its biosafety and immunotherapeutic efficacy for solid tumors. A quantitative analysis method is used to calculate the loading amount of cancer cell membranes onto porous silicon@Au nanocomposites. Assisted with foreign&#8208;body responses, these exogenous nanoparticulate cores with weak immunostimulatory effect can still efficiently deliver cancer cell membranes into dendritic cells to activate them and the downstream antitumor immunity, resulting in no occurrence of solid tumors and the survival of all immunized mice during 55 day observation. In addition, this nanovaccine, as a photothermal therapeutic agent, synergized with additional immunotherapies can significantly inhibit the growth and metastasis of established solid tumors, via the initiation of the antitumor immune responses in the body and the reversion of their immunosuppressive microenvironments. Considering the versatile surface engineering of porous silicon nanoparticles, the strategy developed here is beneficial to construct multifunctional nanovaccines with better biosafety and more diagnosis or therapeutic modalities against the occurrence, recurrence, or metastasis of solid tumors in future clinical practice.

         <title>A Universal Cosolvent Evaporation Strategy Enables Direct Printing of Perovskite Single Crystals for Optoelectronic Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite single crystals (SCs) are grown on&#8208;demand at room temperature and integrated directly onto optoelectronic devices via printing and coating using a scalable cosolvent evaporation (CSE) strategy. The CSE strategy controls supersaturation and suppresses competing nucleation during drying to yield high&#8208;quality SCs of 2D, 3D, lead&#8208;free, and mixed&#8208;ion perovskites with minimal residue.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskite (MHP) single crystals (SCs) are in high demand for a growing number of printed electronic applications due to their superior optoelectronic properties compared to polycrystalline thin films. There is an urgent need to make SC fabrication facile, scalable, and compatible with the printed electronic manufacturing infrastructure. Here, a universal cosolvent evaporation (CSE) strategy is presented by which perovskite SCs and arrays are produced directly on substrates via printing and coating methods within minutes at room temperature from drying droplets. The CSE strategy successfully guides the supersaturation via controlled drying of droplets to suppress all crystallization pathways but one, and is shown to produce SCs of a wide variety of 3D, 2D, and mixed&#8208;cation/halide perovskites with consistency. This approach works with commonly used precursors and solvents, making it universal. Importantly, the SC consumes the precursor in the droplet, which enables the large&#8208;scale fabrication of SC arrays with minimal residue. Direct on&#8208;chip fabrication of 3D and 2D perovskite photodetector devices with outstanding performance is demonstrated. The approach shows that any MHP SC can now be manufactured on substrates using precision printing and scalable, high&#8208;throughput coating methods.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Twist Fibers toward Rotating Microengines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Untethered twist fibers with reversible responsiveness have shown great potential as rotating microengine, of which high torque and high rotational deformation are desirable. Herein, liquid crystal elastomer twist fiber (LCETF) with fixed twisting orientation is developed, demonstrating outstanding rotational performance due to its significant intrinsic deformation. The obtained LCETF can function as a rotating microengine in an electricity generator.








Abstract
Untethered twist fibers do not require end&#8208;anchoring structures to hold their twist orientation and offer simple designs and convenient operation. The reversible responsiveness of these fibers allows them to generate torque and rotational deformation continuously upon the application of external stimuli. The fibers therefore have potential in rotating microengines. In practical applications, high torque and rotational deformation are desirable to meet work capacity requirements. However, the simultaneous endowment of reversible responsiveness and high rotational performance to untethered twist fibers remains a challenge. In this study, a liquid crystal elastomer twist fiber (LCETF) is designed and developed with a fixed twisting alignment of mesogens to provide untethered and reversible responsiveness. Outstanding rotational performance can be achieved when the mesogenic orientation is disrupted through heat triggering. Owing to the significant intrinsic contractile ratio of the LCE material, the rotational deformation of the LCETF can reach 243.6&#176; mm&#8722;1. More importantly, the specific torque can reach 10.1 N m kg&#8722;1, which exceeds previously reported values. In addition, the LCETF can be exploited in a rotating microengine to convert heat into electricity with an induction voltage as high as 9.4&#160;V. This work broadens the applications of LCEs for energy harvesters, micromachines, and soft robots.

         <title>Highly Bright AIE Nanoparticles by Regulating the Substituent of Rhodanine for Precise Early Detection of Atherosclerosis and Drug Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly bright and atherosclerosis (AS)&#8208;targeting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoprobe is designed and synthesized by delicate molecular surgery strategy of AIE luminogen and surface functionalization with anti&#8208;CD47 antibody, which can serve as an effective near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe for early detection of atherosclerotic plaque, studying the progression of AS, and screening of anti&#8208;AS drugs in a precise, sensitive, and rapid manner.








Abstract
Fluorescent probes capable of precise detection of atherosclerosis (AS) at an early stage and fast assessment of anti&#8208;AS drugs in animal level are particularly valuable. Herein, a highly bright aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoprobe is introduced by regulating the substituent of rhodanine for early detection of atherosclerotic plaque and screening of anti&#8208;AS drugs in a precise, sensitive, and rapid manner. With dicyanomethylene&#8208;substituted rhodanine as the electron&#8208;withdrawing unit, the AIE luminogen named TPE&#8208;T&#8208;RCN shows the highest molar extinction coefficient, the largest photoluminescence quantum yield, and the most redshifted absorption/emission spectra simultaneously as compared to the control compounds. The nanoprobes are obtained with an amphiphilic copolymer as the matrix encapsulating TPE&#8208;T&#8208;RCN molecules, which are further surface functionalized with anti&#8208;CD47 antibody for specifically binding to CD47 overexpressed in AS plaques. Such nanoprobes allow efficient recognition of AS plaques at different stages in apolipoprotein E&#8208;deficient (apoE&#8722;/&#8722;) mice, especially for the recognition of early&#8208;stage AS plaques prior to micro&#8208;computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These features impel to apply the nanoprobes in monitoring the therapeutic effects of anti&#8208;AS drugs, providing a powerful tool for anti&#8208;AS drug screening. Their potential use in targeted imaging of human carotid plaque is further demonstrated.

         <title>A Flexible and Degradable Hybrid Mineral as a Plastic Substitute</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biomineralization, a flexible and degradable hybrid mineral (HM), which is dominated by minerals, is constructed by the inorganic ionic polymerization of calcium phosphate ionic oligomers under biomimetic control from organic templates (polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate). The HM shows potential to serve as a plastic substitute owing to its superior mechanical properties and environmental friendliness.








Abstract
The development of environmentally friendly plastics is critical to ensure sustainable development. In contrast to polymer plastics derived from petrochemicals, inorganic minerals, which are the most abundant matter in Earth's crust, are environmentally friendly. However, the brittleness of these minerals limits their applications as plastics. Here, because of the advantages of both biomineralization and inorganic ionic polymerization, the calcium phosphate (CaP, a typical geological and biological mineral) oligomers are used for biomimetic mineralization under the regulation of polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate, resulting in flexible CaP nanofibers with periodic structural defects. The assembly of CaP nanofibers produces a hierarchically structured bulk hybrid mineral (HM), which overcomes the intrinsic brittleness of minerals and exhibits plasticity characteristics. HM exhibits better hardness and thermostability than classical polymer plastics due to its dominant mineral composition. Notably, HM is environmentally friendly and degradable in nature, as it can potentially participate in geological cycles, indicating that this material is an optimal plastic substitute. The construction of periodic structural defects within flexible minerals expands the current understanding of materials science.

         <title>A Novel Technique for Controlling Anisotropic Ion Diffusion: Bulk Single&#8208;Crystalline Metallic Silicon Clathrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic ion&#8208;diffusion process is developed. This technique can homogeneously extract Na+ from a type&#8208;II Si clathrate regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity by skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force. The synthesis concept behind the technique is expected to expose new exploration areas for thermodynamically metastable materials.








Abstract
Na&#8208;free Si clathrates consisting only of Si cages are an allotrope of diamond&#8208;structured Si. This material is promising for various device applications, such as next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. The probable technique for synthesizing Na&#8208;free Si clathrates is to extract Na+ from the Si cages of Na24Si136. Vacuum annealing is presently a well&#8208;known conventional and effective approach for extracting Na. However, this study demonstrates that Na+ cannot be extracted from the surface of a single&#8208;crystalline type&#8208;II metallic Si clathrate (Na24Si136) in areas deeper than 150&#160;&#181;m. Therefore, a novel method is developed to control anisotropic ion diffusion: this is effective for various compounds with a large difference in the bonding strength between their constituent elements, such as Na24Si136 composed of covalent Si cages and weakly trapped Na+. By skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force, Na+ is homogeneously extracted regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity. Additionally, the proposed point defect model is evaluated via density functional theory, and the migration of Na+ between the Si cages is explained. It is expected that the developed experimental and computational techniques would significantly advance material design for synthesizing thermodynamically metastable materials.

         <title>Interface Engineering Between Multi&#8208;Elemental Alloy Nanoparticles and a Carbon Support Toward Stable Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial engineering approach is used to improve the stability (e.g., nanoparticle agglomeration) of multi&#8208;elemental alloy (MEA) nanoparticles on a carbon substrate. MEA&#8211;oxide&#8211;carbon catalysts with a hierarchical structure are synthesized via a high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method. The catalysts show excellent thermal and electrochemical stability, holding great potential for a range of catalytic reactions.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;elemental alloy (MEA) nanoparticles have recently received notable attention owing to their high activity and superior phase stability. Previous syntheses of MEA nanoparticles mainly used carbon as the support, owing to its high surface area, good electrical conductivity, and tunable defective sites. However, the interfacial stability issue, such as nanoparticle agglomeration, remains outstanding due to poor interfacial binding between MEA and carbon. Such a problem often causes performance decay when MEA nanoparticles are used as catalysts, hindering their practical applications. Herein, an interface engineering strategy is developed to synthesize MEA&#8211;oxide&#8211;carbon hierarchical catalysts, where the oxide on carbon helps disperse and stabilize the MEA nanoparticles toward superior thermal and electrochemical stability. Using several MEA compositions (PdRuRh, PtPdIrRuRh, and PdRuRhFeCoNi) and oxides (TiO2 and Cr2O3) as model systems, it is shown that adding the oxide renders superior interfacial stability and therefore excellent catalytic performance. Excellent thermal stability is demonstrated under transmission electron microscopy with in situ heating up to 1023 K, as well as via long&#8208;term cycling (&gt;370 hours) of a Li&#8211;O2 battery as a harsh electrochemical condition to challenge the catalyst stability. This work offers a new route toward constructing efficient and stable catalysts for various applications.

This leads to selective activation of tumor&#8208;reactive T cells, effective inhibition of tumor growth and prevention of immune&#8208;related adverse events, improving the current immune checkpoint blockade therapies.








Abstract
Despite the clinically proven efficacies of immune checkpoint blockades, including anti&#8208;cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4&#160;antibody (&#945;CTLA&#8208;4), the low response rate and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) in cancer patients represent major drawbacks of the therapy. These drawbacks of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;therapy are mainly due to the suboptimal activation of tumor&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and the systemic nonspecific activation of T cells. To overcome such drawbacks, &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;is delivered by dendritic cell&#8208;derived nanovesicles presenting tumor antigens (DCNV&#8208;TAs) that exclusively interact with tumor&#8208;specific T cells, leading to selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific CTLs. Compared to conventional &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;therapy, treatment with &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#8208;conjugated DCNV&#8208;TAs significantly inhibits tumor growth and reduces irAEs in syngeneic tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study demonstrates that the spatiotemporal presentation of both &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;and tumor antigens enables selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific T cells and potentiates the antitumor efficacy of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;without inducing systemic irAEs.

&lt;p&gt;Anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 antibody (&#945;CTLA-4)-conjugated and tumor antigen (TA)-loaded nanovesicles derived from dendritic cells can facilitate spatiotemporal delivery of TA and &#945;CTLA-4 to tumor-specific T cells. This leads to selective activation of tumor-reactive T cells, effective inhibition of tumor growth and prevention of immune-related adverse events, improving the current immune checkpoint blockade therapies.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomachinery for Enhancement of Bone Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA&#8211;amorphous calcium phosphate nanomachine that induces extrafibrillar and intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen fibrils and regenerates new bone in a dynamic and programmable manner is developed. This multifunctional nanomachinery is comparable to the function of osteoblasts. The RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines that simulate physiological processes brings new opportunities and challenges to bone tissue engineering.








Abstract
The visionary idea that RNA adopts nonbiological roles in today's nanomaterial world has been nothing short of phenomenal. These RNA molecules have ample chemical functionality and self&#8208;assemble to form distinct nanostructures in response to external stimuli. They may be combined with inorganic materials to produce nanomachines that carry cargo to a target site in a controlled manner and respond dynamically to environmental changes. Comparable to biological cells, programmed RNA nanomachines have the potential to replicate bone healing in vitro. Here, an RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachine is developed, which accomplishes intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar mineralization of collagen scaffolds to mimic bone formation in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulation indicates that noncovalent hydrogen bonding provides the energy source that initiates self&#8208;assembly of these nanomachines. Incorporation of the RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines into collagen scaffolds in vivo creates an osteoinductive microenvironment within a bone defect that is conducive to rapid biomineralization and osteogenesis. Addition of RNA&#8208;degrading enzymes into RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines further creates a stop signal that inhibits unwarranted bone formation in tissues. The potential of RNA in building functional nanostructures has been underestimated in the past. The concept of RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines participating in physiological processes may transform the nanoscopic world of life science.

         <title>Inverse Design of Ferroelectric&#8208;Order in Perovskite Crystal for Self&#8208;Powered Ultraviolet Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered KTa1&#8722;xNbxO3&#160;photodetector is fabricated based on &#8220;inverse&#8208;design&#8221; of the ferroelectric order.








Abstract
It has always been a hot topic to design an orderly mesoscopic structure in functional materials to tailor the macroscopic properties or realize new functions. The existence of domains in ferroelectric materials has been proven to affect the macroscopic properties, being actively studied in nonlinear optical conversion and piezoelectric effects. However, the high&#8208;efficiency photoelectric conversion capability of ferroelectric crystals has not yet been explored. Here, the authors study the orderly arrangement of ferroelectric order in KTa1&#8722;xNbxO3 (KTN) perovskite crystals, and design the &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; domains by tuning the Curie temperature Tc, thereby generating abundant charged domain walls and robust conductive channels for electrons and holes. An ultrahigh ultraviolet photoresponsivity is achieved in the KTN crystal under zero bias voltage, being about four orders magnitude higher than that of the well&#8208;known ferroelectric materials. The substantial improvement can be attributed to the judiciously designed ferroelectric order, as demonstrated by the conductive atomic force microscopy. In addition, KTN detector exhibits high stability and reliability after high&#8208;temperature and fatigue treatment. KTN crystal features giant photoresponsivity, high electric&#8211;optical coefficient, and large &#967;(2) nonlinearity concurrently, indicating its great potential for application of all&#8208;optical devices on photonic chips.

         <title>Record&#8208;High Superconductivity in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Emerged in Compressed 2H&#8208;TaS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;Tc superconducting state emerges in 2H&#8208;TaS2 under high pressure. The Tc enhances rapidly and reaches a maximum of &#8776;16.4 K at &#8776;157.4&#160;GPa, which sets a new record for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). It is the first time this remarkable superconducting state has been found in TMDs. The result brings a new broad perspective on layered materials.








Abstract
Pressure has always been an effective method for uncovering novel phenomena and properties in condensed matter physics. Here, an electrical transport study is carried on 2H&#8208;TaS2 up to &#8776;208&#160;GPa, and an unexpected superconducting state (SC&#8208;II) emerging around 86.1&#160;GPa with an initial critical temperature (Tc) of 9.6 K is found. As pressure increases, the Tc enhances rapidly and reaches a maximum of 16.4 K at 157.4&#160;GPa, which sets a new record for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The original superconducting state (SC&#8208;I) is found to be re&#8208;enhanced above 100&#160;GPa after the recession around 10&#160;GPa, and coexists with SC&#8208;II to the highest pressure applied in this work. In situ high&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction and Hall effect measurements reveal that the occurrence of SC&#8208;II is accompanied by a structural modification and a concurrent enhancement of hole carrier density. The new high&#8208;Tc superconducting state in 2H&#8208;TaS2 can be attributed to the change of the electronic states near the Fermi surface, owing to pressure&#8208;induced interlayer modulation. It is the first time finding this remarkable superconducting state in TMDs, which not only brings a new broad of perspective on layered materials but also expands the field of pressure&#8208;modified superconductivity.

         <title>A Programmable Dual&#8208;Regime Spray for Large&#8208;Scale and Custom&#8208;Designed Electronic Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable dual&#8208;regime spray that enables direct writing of custom electronic textiles (e&#8208;textiles) into stretch fabrics or garments over meter scale is introduced. The e&#8208;textiles tightly fit various body sizes and shapes of large animals to support reliable monitoring of health data under ambulatory conditions in a wirelessly controlled fashion.








Abstract
Increasing demand for wearable healthcare synergistically advances the field of electronic textiles, or e&#8208;textiles, allowing for ambulatory monitoring of vital health signals.

&lt;p&gt;A programmable dual-regime spray that enables direct writing of custom electronic textiles (e-textiles) into stretch fabrics or garments over meter scale is introduced. The e-textiles tightly fit various body sizes and shapes of large animals to support reliable monitoring of health data under ambulatory conditions in a wirelessly controlled fashion.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing demand for wearable healthcare synergistically advances the field of electronic textiles, or e-textiles, allowing for ambulatory monitoring of vital health signals. Despite great promise, the pragmatic deployment of e-textiles in clinical practice remains challenged due to the lack of a method in producing custom-designed e-textiles at high spatial resolution across a large area. To this end, a programmable dual-regime spray that enables the direct custom writing of functional nanoparticles into arbitrary fabrics at sub-millimeter resolution over meter scale is employed. The resulting e-textiles retain the intrinsic fabric properties in terms of mechanical flexibility, water-vapor permeability, and comfort against multiple uses and laundry cycles. The e-textiles tightly fit various body sizes and shapes to support the high-fidelity recording of physiological and electrophysiological signals on the skin under ambulatory conditions. Pilot field tests in a remote health-monitoring setting with a large animal, such as a horse, demonstrate the scalability and utility of the e-textiles beyond conventional devices.

         <title>Orchestrated Yolk&#8211;Shell Nanohybrids Regulate Macrophage Polarization and Dendritic Cell Maturation for Oncotherapy with Augmented Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;designed yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids Fe3O4@C/MnO2&#8208;PGEA with intrinsic immunomodulatory effects are constructed to realize oncotherapy with augmented antitumor immunity through regulating macrophage polarization and dendritic cell maturation.








Abstract
The protumoral and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments greatly limit the antitumor immune responses of nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy. Here, the intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of orchestrated nanoparticles and their ability to simultaneously trigger tumor antigen release, thereby reversing immunosuppression and achieving potent antitumor immunity and augmented cancer therapy, are explored. By optimizing both the composition and morphology, a facile strategy is proposed to construct yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids (Fe3O4@C/MnO2&#8208;PGEA, FCMP). The intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of FCMP are utilized to reprogram macrophages to M1 phenotype and induce the maturation of dendritic cells. In addition, the chemical, magnetic, and optical properties of FCMP contribute to amplified immunogenic cell death induced by multiaugmented chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and synergistic tumor treatment. Taking advantage of the unique yolk&#8211;shell structure, accurate T1&#8208;T2 dual&#8208;mode magnetic resonance imaging can be realized and CDT can be maximized through sufficient exposure of both the Fe3O4 core and MnO2 shell. Potent antitumor effects are found to substantially inhibit the growth of both primary and distant tumors. Furthermore, the strategy can be extended to the synthesis of other yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids with tailored properties. This work establishes a novel strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional nanoplatforms with yolk&#8208;shell structure for effective cancer therapy with immunomodulation&#8208;enhanced antitumor immunity.

         <title>Surfaces Decorated with Enantiomorphically Pure Polymer Nanohelices via Hierarchical Chirality Transfer across Multiple Length Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;templated approach to prepare nanohelices of chiral parylene polymers on surfaces with tunable length, pitch, and higher&#8208;order mesoscale morphologies by altering the chirality of the template and/or the precursor is described. A phenomenon of chirality transfer from molecular to mesoscale level takes places during chemical vapor deposition, allowing for detection of weak chiral signals on such surfaces.








Abstract
Mesoscale chiral materials are prepared by lithographic methods, assembly of chiral building blocks, and through syntheses in the presence of polarized light. Typically, these processes result in micrometer&#8208;sized structures, require complex top&#8211;down manipulation, or rely on tedious asymmetric separation. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization of chiral precursors into supported films of liquid crystals (LCs) are discovered to result in superhierarchical arrangements of enantiomorphically pure nanofibers. Depending on the molecular chirality of the 1&#8208;hydroxyethyl [2.2]paracyclophane precursor, extended arrays of enantiomorphic nanohelices are formed from achiral nematic templates. Arrays of chiral nanohelices extend over hundreds of micrometers and consistently display enantiomorphic micropatterns. The pitch of individual nanohelices depends on the enantiomeric excess and the purity of the chiral precursor, consistent with the theoretical model of a doubly twisted LC director configuration. During CVD of chiral precursors into cholesteric LC films, aspects of molecular and mesoscale asymmetry combine constructively to form regularly twisted nanohelices. Enantiomorphic surfaces permit the tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, such as the asymmetric induction of weak chiral systems.

         <title>Artificial Nacre with High Toughness Amplification Factor: Residual Stress&#8208;Engineering Sparks Enhanced Extrinsic Toughening Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work illustrates an anti&#8208;intuitive strategy that, with the merit of biomimetic designs, residual stress that is conventionally harmful to ceramics can inversely help improve the fracture toughness of biomimetic ceramics through nanoscale residual stress&#8208;induced platelet strengthening. This provides new insights into the design principles of nacre&#8208;like materials at the bottom level.








Abstract
The high fracture toughness of mollusk nacre is predominantly attributed to the structure&#8208;associated extrinsic mechanisms such as platelet sliding and crack deflection. While the nacre&#8208;mimetic structures are widely adopted in artificial ceramics, the extrinsic mechanisms are often weakened by the relatively low tensile strength of the platelets with a large aspect ratio, which makes the fracture toughness of these materials much lower than expected. Here, it is demonstrated that the fracture toughness of artificial nacre materials with high inorganic contents can be improved by residual stress&#8208;induced platelet strengthening, which can catalyze more effective extrinsic toughening mechanisms that are specific to the nacre&#8208;mimetic structures. Thereby, while the absolute fracture toughness of the materials is not comparable with advanced ceramic&#8208;based composites, the toughness amplification factor of the material reaches 16.1&#160;&#177; 1.1, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomimetic ceramics. The results reveal that, with the merit of nacre&#8208;mimetic structural designs, the overall fracture toughness of the artificial nacre can be improved by the platelet strengthening through extrinsic toughening mechanisms, although the intrinsic fracture toughness may decrease at platelet level due to the strengthening. It is anticipated that advanced structural ceramics with exceeding performance can be fabricated through these unconventional strategies.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Free, Low&#8208;Temperature Crystallization of Stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerosol&#8208;assisted crystallization method to prepare high&#8208;quality, pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films at only 100&#160;&#176;C without chemical additives is reported. Remarkably improved phase stability of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films and their applications in solar cells are demonstrated. The overriding mechanism of stabilizing &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is shown to be relaxation of residual tensile strains in the films.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) is attractive for photovoltaic devices due to its optimal bandgap at around 1.45&#160;eV and improved thermal stability compared with methylammonium&#8208;based perovskites. Crystallization of phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 conventionally requires high&#8208;temperature thermal annealing at 150&#160;&#176;C whilst the obtained &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is metastable at room temperature. Here, aerosol&#8208;assisted crystallization (AAC) is reported, which converts yellow &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 into black &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at only 100&#160;&#176;C using precursor solutions containing only lead iodide and formamidinium iodide with no chemical additives. The obtained &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 exhibits remarkably enhanced stability compared to the 150&#160;&#176;C annealed counterparts, in combination with improvements in film crystallinity and photoluminescence yield. Using X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray scattering, and density functional theory simulation, it is identified that relaxation of residual tensile strains, achieved through the lower annealing temperature and post&#8208;crystallization crystal growth during AAC, is the key factor that facilitates the formation of phase&#8208;stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This overcomes the strain&#8208;induced lattice expansion that is known to cause the metastability of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Accordingly, pure FAPbI3 p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells are reported, facilitated by the low&#8208;temperature (&#8804;100&#160;&#176;C) AAC processing, which demonstrates increases of both power conversion efficiency and operational stability compared to devices fabricated using 150&#160;&#176;C annealed films.

&lt;p&gt;Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is attractive for photovoltaic devices due to its optimal bandgap at around 1.45&#160;eV and improved thermal stability compared with methylammonium-based perovskites. Crystallization of phase-pure &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; conventionally requires high-temperature thermal annealing at 150&#160;&#176;C whilst the obtained &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is metastable at room temperature. Here, aerosol-assisted crystallization (AAC) is reported, which converts yellow &#948;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into black &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at only 100&#160;&#176;C using precursor solutions containing only lead iodide and formamidinium iodide with no chemical additives. The obtained &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits remarkably enhanced stability compared to the 150&#160;&#176;C annealed counterparts, in combination with improvements in film crystallinity and photoluminescence yield. Using X-ray diffraction, X-ray scattering, and density functional theory simulation, it is identified that relaxation of residual tensile strains, achieved through the lower annealing temperature and post-crystallization crystal growth during AAC, is the key factor that facilitates the formation of phase-stable &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This overcomes the strain-induced lattice expansion that is known to cause the metastability of &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Accordingly, pure FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells are reported, facilitated by the low-temperature (&#8804;100&#160;&#176;C) AAC processing, which demonstrates increases of both power conversion efficiency and operational stability compared to devices fabricated using 150&#160;&#176;C annealed films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Reversibility and Stability of Li Storage in SnO2&#8211;Mo Multilayers: Introduction of Interfacial Oxygen Redistribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In assembled SnO2&#8211;Mo multilayers with adjustable interfaces and tunable oxygen distribution, the regulating effect of the SnO2/Mo interfaces on the stability and reversibility of conversion between SnO2 and Sn/Li2O is quantified. Mo/SnO2/Mo with boosted charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, realizes a breakthrough performance with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.6% and large capacity of 1067 mA h g&#8722;1 retaining &#8776;100% after 700 cycles.








Abstract
Among the promising high&#8208;capacity anode materials, SnO2 represents a classic and important candidate that involves both conversion and alloying reactions toward Li storage. However, the inferior reversibility of conversion reactions usually results in low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE, &#8776;60%), small reversible capacity, and poor cycling stability. Here, it is demonstrated that by carefully designing the interface structure of SnO2&#8211;Mo, a breakthrough comprehensive performance with ultrahigh average ICE of 92.6%, large capacity of 1067 mA h g&#8722;1, and 100% capacity retention after 700 cycles can be realized in a multilayer Mo/SnO2/Mo electrode. Furthermore, high capacity retentions are also achieved in pouch&#8208;type Mo/SnO2/Mo||Li half cells and Mo/SnO2/Mo||LiFePO4 full cells. The amorphous SnO2/Mo interfaces, which are induced by redistribution of oxygen between SnO2 and Mo, can precisely adjust the reversible capacity and cycling stability of the multilayers, while the stable capacities are parabolic with the interfacial density. Theoretical calculations and in/ex situ investigation reveal that oxygen redistribution in SnO2/Mo heterointerfaces boosts Li&#8208;ion transport kinetics by inducing a built&#8208;in electric field and improves the reaction reversibility of SnO2. This work provides a new understanding of interface&#8211;performance relationship of metal&#8211;oxide hybrid electrodes and pivotal guidance for creating high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A PF6&#8722;&#8208;Permselective Polymer Electrolyte with Anion Solvation Regulation Enabling Long&#8208;Cycle Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PF6&#8722;&#8208;permselective polymer electrolyte with abundant quaternary ammonium motifs, which can facilitate PF6&#8722; desolvation and thus maintain the structural integrity of graphite during cycling, is designed for high&#8208;voltage dual&#8208;ion batteries. Besides, this design philosophy also improves oxidation resistance of electrolyte. Eventually, long&#8208;life 5.4&#160;V&#8208;class dual&#8208;ion batteries with superior Coulombic efficiency (CE) are achieved.








Abstract
Graphitic carbon that allows reversible anion (de)intercalation is a promising cathode material for cost&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;voltage dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs). However, one notorious but overlooked issue is the incomplete interfacial anion desolvation, which not only reduces the oxidative stability of electrolytes, but also results in solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite layers. Here, an &#8220;anion&#8208;permselective&#8221; polymer electrolyte with abundant cationic quaternary ammonium motif is developed to weaken the PF6&#8722;&#8211;solvent interaction and thus facilitates PF6&#8722; desolvation. This strategy significantly inhibits solvent co&#8208;intercalation as well as enhances the oxidation resistance of electrolyte, ensuring the structural integrity of graphite. As a result, the as&#8208;assembled graphite||Li cell achieves a superior cyclability with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.0% (vs 95.7% for baseline electrolyte) and 87.1% capacity retention after 2000 cycles even at a high cutoff potential of 5.4&#160;V versus Li+/Li. Besides, this polymer also forms a robust cathode electrolyte interface, working together to enable a long&#8208;life DIB. This strategy of tuning anion coordination environment provides a promising solution to regulate solvent co&#8208;intercalation chemistry for DIBs.

         <dc:description>
A strategy of differential polymer chain scission is developed to fabricate free&#8208;standing optical microcavities with high&#8208;quality factors by one&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam direct writing on polymer bilayers. This strategy features high materials compatibility and design flexibility for the free&#8208;standing optical microstructures, which significantly expands the application scope for versatile photonic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Control over material architectures is essential to the performance of photonic devices and systems. Optical isolation of the photonic materials from substrates can significantly enhance their performance but suffers from complicated fabrication processes and limited applications. Here a differential polymer chain scission strategy is proposed to fabricate free&#8208;standing photonic structures based on one&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam direct writing on polymer bilayers (EOB). The polymer molecular mass&#8208;dependent sensitivity to electron beam enables differential patterning of the two layers of polymers, leading to the direct formation of suspended optical microcavities. The EOB technique features high materials compatibility and design flexibility for the optical microcavities, which significantly expands the application scope of the suspended optical microcavities. As well as providing a versatile strategy for building high&#8208;performance photonic materials, the results provide a promising platform for innovative applications of optical microstructures.

         <title>Engineering Metallic Heterostructure Based on Ni3N and 2M&#8208;MoS2 for Alkaline Water Electrolysis with Industry&#8208;Compatible Current Density and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of metallic nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide is designed and fabricated for large&#8208;current alkaline water electrolysis. The constructed water electrolyzer operates at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.644&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;with &#8776;100% current density retention over 300&#160;h, superior to the performance of commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO2 (2.41&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 100&#160;h, 58.2%).








Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis is commercially desirable to realize large&#8208;scale hydrogen production. Although nonprecious catalysts exhibit high electrocatalytic activity at low current density (10&#8211;50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), it is still challenging to achieve industrially&#160;required current density over 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;due to inefficient electron transport and competitive adsorption between hydroxyl and water. Herein, the authors design a novel metallic heterostructure based on nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide (Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2) for extraordinary water electrolysis. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;composite with heterointerface provides two kinds of separated reaction sites to overcome the steric hindrance of competitive hydroxyl/water adsorption. The kinetically decoupled hydroxyl/water adsorption/dissociation and metallic conductivity of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;enable hydrogen production from Ni3N and oxygen evolution from the heterointerface at large current density. The metallic heterostructure is proved to be imperative for the stabilization and activation of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2, which can efficiently regulate the active electronic states of Ni/N atoms around the Fermi&#8208;level through the charge transfer between the active atoms of Ni3N and Mo&#63743;Mo bonds of 2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;to boost overall water splitting. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;incorporated water electrolyzer requires ultralow cell voltage of 1.644&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;with &#8776;100% retention over 300&#160;h, far exceeding the commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO2 (2.41&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 100&#160;h, 58.2%).

     alt="Engineering Metallic Heterostructure Based on Ni3N and 2M-MoS2 for Alkaline Water Electrolysis with Industry-Compatible Current Density and Stability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of metallic nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide is designed and fabricated for large-current alkaline water electrolysis. The constructed water electrolyzer operates at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.644&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;with &#8776;100% current density retention over 300&#160;h, superior to the performance of commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2.41&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 100&#160;h, 58.2%).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkaline water electrolysis is commercially desirable to realize large-scale hydrogen production. Although nonprecious catalysts exhibit high electrocatalytic activity at low current density (10&#8211;50&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), it is still challenging to achieve industrially&#160;required current density over 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;due to inefficient electron transport and competitive adsorption between hydroxyl and water. Herein, the authors design a novel metallic heterostructure based on nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide (Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N@2M-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for extraordinary water electrolysis. The Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N@2M-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;composite with heterointerface provides two kinds of separated reaction sites to overcome the steric hindrance of competitive hydroxyl/water adsorption. The kinetically decoupled hydroxyl/water adsorption/dissociation and metallic conductivity of Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N@2M-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;enable hydrogen production from Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N and oxygen evolution from the heterointerface at large current density. The metallic heterostructure is proved to be imperative for the stabilization and activation of Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N@2M-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which can efficiently regulate the active electronic states of Ni/N atoms around the Fermi-level through the charge transfer between the active atoms of Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N and Mo&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Mo bonds of 2M-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;to boost overall water splitting. The Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N@2M-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;incorporated water electrolyzer requires ultralow cell voltage of 1.644&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;with &#8776;100% retention over 300&#160;h, far exceeding the commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2.41&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 100&#160;h, 58.2%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward Exotic Layered Materials: 2D Cuprous Iodide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only a few dozen 2D crystals have been successfully prepared, though many more&#8212;including metal iodides&#8212;are predicted to exist. A major reason for this disparity is their instability under ambient conditions. A wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize 2D&#8208;CuI, stabilizing it by graphene encapsulation in a one&#8208;step process, is designed, and its chemical structure is imaged.








Abstract
Heterostructures composed of 2D materials are already opening many new possibilities in such fields of technology as electronics and magnonics, but far more could be achieved if the number and diversity of 2D materials were&#160;increased. So far, only a few dozen 2D crystals have been extracted from materials that exhibit a layered phase in ambient conditions, omitting entirely the large number of layered materials that may exist at other temperatures and pressures. This work demonstrates how such structures can be stabilized in 2D van der Waals (vdw) stacks under room temperature via growing them directly in graphene encapsulation by using graphene oxide as the template material. Specifically, an ambient stable 2D structure of copper and iodine, a material that normally only occurs in layered form at elevated temperatures between 645 and 675&#160;K, is produced. The results establish a simple route to the production of more exotic phases of materials that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to stabilize for experiments in&#160;ambient.

Anisotropic Ion Diffusion
An anisotropic ion diffusion process is developed, as reported by Masaya Fujioka and co&#8208;workers in article number 2106754. This technique can homogeneously extract Na+ from a type&#8208;II Si clathrate regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity, by skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force. The synthesis concept behind the technique is expected to expose new exploration areas for thermodynamically metastable materials.

Long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of solution&#8208;processable materials with regulated patterning, dimensions, and orientation lays foundation for the integration of high&#8208;performance devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art assembly methods developed based on superwetting interfaces are overviewed. The confined capillary liquids have been highlighted as a versatile and robust platform for the long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of organic semiconductors, metal&#8208;halide perovskites, and colloidal nanoparticles.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip integration of solution&#8208;processable materials imposes stringent and simultaneous requirements of controlled nucleation and growth, tunable geometry and dimensions, and long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly, which is challenging in solution process far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Superwetting interfaces, underpinned by programmable surface chemistry and topography, are promising for steering transport, dewetting, and microfluid dynamics of liquids, thus opening a new paradigm for micro&#8208;/nanostructure assembly in solution process. Herein, assembly methods on the basis of superwetting interfaces are reviewed for constructing long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered micro&#8208;/nanostructures. Confined capillary liquids, including capillary bridges and capillary corner menisci realized by controlling local wettability and surface topography, are highlighted for simultaneously attained deterministic patterning and long&#8208;range order. The versatility and robustness of confined capillary liquids are discussed with assembly of single&#8208;crystalline micro&#8208;/nanostructures of organic semiconductors, metal&#8208;halide perovskites, and colloidal&#8208;nanoparticle superlattices, which lead to enhanced device performances and exotic functionalities. Finally, a perspective for promising directions in this realm is provided.

         <title>Fast Ionic Storage in Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion diffusion coefficients are highly related to the size and dimension of tunnels in materials, the radius of various ions, and the coinserted or lattice H2O molecules. Monovalent and divalent ions show significant differences in reaction kinetics in materials for their unique diffusion characteristics. Therefore, comprehensive review and prospects are provided for fast ionic storage in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
The highly dynamic nature of grid&#8208;scale energy systems necessitates fast kinetics in energy storage and conversion systems. Rechargeable aqueous batteries are a promising energy&#8208;storage solution for renewable&#8208;energy grids as the ionic diffusivity in aqueous electrolytes can be up to 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than in organic systems, in addition to being highly safe and low cost. Recent research in this regard has focussed on developing suitable electrode materials for fast ionic storage in aqueous electrolytes. In this review, breakthroughs in the field of fast ionic storage in aqueous battery materials, and 1D/2D/3D and over&#8208;3D&#8208;tunnel materials are summarized, and tunnels in over&#8208;3D materials are not oriented in any direction in particular. Various materials with different tunnel sizes are developed to be suitable for the different ionic radii of Li+, Na+, K+, H+, NH4+, and Zn2+, which show significant differences in the reaction kinetics of ionic storage. New topochemical paths for ion insertion/extraction, which provide superfast ionic storage, are also discussed.

&lt;p&gt;The highly dynamic nature of grid-scale energy systems necessitates fast kinetics in energy storage and conversion systems. Rechargeable aqueous batteries are a promising energy-storage solution for renewable-energy grids as the ionic diffusivity in aqueous electrolytes can be up to 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than in organic systems, in addition to being highly safe and low cost. Recent research in this regard has focussed on developing suitable electrode materials for fast ionic storage in aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>KTaO3&#8212;The New Kid on the Spintronics Block</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
If a truly multifunctional material with a large spin&#8208;orbit coupling is looked for, it would be hard to beat KTaO3 (KTO). The 2D electron gas housed by KTO&#8208;based thin films and heterostructures exhibits spin&#8208;polarization, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, persistent photocurrent, etc., and provides a platform to realize exotic relativistic quantum particles. Read this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review for all the fascinating details.








Abstract
Long after the heady days of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity, the oxides came back into the limelight in 2004 with the discovery of the 2D electron gas (2DEG) in SrTiO3 (STO) and several heterostructures based on it. Not only do these materials exhibit interesting physics, but they have also opened up new vistas in oxide electronics and spintronics. However, much of the attention has recently shifted to KTaO3 (KTO), a material with all the &#8220;good&#8221; properties of STO (simple cubic structure, high mobility, etc.) but with the additional advantage of a much larger spin&#8208;orbit coupling. In this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review of the fascinating world of KTO, it is attempted to cover the remarkable progress made, particularly in the last five years. Certain unsolved issues are also indicated, while suggesting future research directions as well as potential applications. The range of physical phenomena associated with the 2DEG trapped at the interfaces of KTO&#8208;based heterostructures include spin polarization, superconductivity, quantum oscillations in the magnetoresistance, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, persistent photocurrent, Rashba effect, topological Hall effect, and inverse Edelstein Effect. It is aimed to discuss, on a single platform, the various fabrication techniques, the exciting physical properties and future application possibilities of this family of materials.

         <title>Tunable planar focusing based on hyperbolic phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Manipulation of the propagation and energy transport characteristics of subwavelength infrared (IR) light fields is critical for the application of nanophotonics devices in photocatalysis, biosensing, and thermal management. In this context, metamaterials are useful composite materials, although traditional metal&#8208;based structures are constrained by their weak mid&#8208;IR response and their optical propagation including focusing is limited by the size of artificial optical structure and poor performance of available active means of control. Herein, a tunable planar focusing device operating in the mid&#8208;IR region was reported by exploiting highly oriented in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3. Specifically, an unprecedented change of effective focal length of polariton waves from 0.7 to 7.4 &#181;m was demonstrated by the following three different means: the dimension of the device, light frequency, and phonon&#8211;plasmon hybridization. The high confinement characteristics of phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 permit the focal length and focal spot size to reduce to 1/15 and 1/33 of the incident wavelength, respectively. In particular, the anisotropic phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 were combined with the tunable surface plasmon polaritons in graphene to realize in situ and dynamic control of the focusing performance, thus paving the way for phonon&#8208;polariton&#8208;based planar nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Ultrathin Membranes for Separations: A New Era Driven by Advanced Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrathin membranes are at the forefront of membrane research, offering great opportunities in revolutionizing separations with ultrafast transport. Driven by advanced nanomaterials and manufacturing technology, tremendous progresses have been made over the last fifteen years in the fabrications and applications of sub&#8208;50&#160;nm membranes. Here, an overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultrathin membranes is first introduced, followed by a summary of the fabrication techniques with an emphasis on how to realize such extremely low thickness. Then, different types of ultrathin membranes, categorized based on their structures, i.e., network, laminar or framework structures, are discussed with a focus on the interplays among structure, fabrication methods and separation performances. Recent research and development trends are highlighted. Meanwhile, the performances and applications of current ultrathin membranes for representative separations (gas separation and liquid separation) are thoroughly analyzed and compared. Lastly, the challenges in material design, structure construction and coordination are given, in order to fully realize the potential of ultrathin membranes and facilitate the translation from scientific achievements to industrial productions.

         <title>Microfluidic Oxidation of Graphite in Two Minutes with Capability of Real&#8208;Time Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flow preparation of graphite oxide and the following post&#8208;treatment are achieved in microchannels, allowing the completion of the oxidization in &#8776;2 min and the capability of on&#8208;line monitoring of the oxidation process with Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Graphite oxide and its exfoliated counterpart, graphene oxide, are important precursors for the large&#8208;scale production of graphene&#8208;based materials and many relevant applications. The current batch&#8208;style preparation of graphite oxide suffers from safety concern, long reaction time, and nonuniform product quality, due to the large volume of reactors and slow energy exchange. Reaction in microchannels can largely enhance the oxidization efficiency of graphite due to the enhanced mass transfer and extremely quick energy exchange, by which the controllable oxidization of graphite is achieved in &#8776;2 min. Comprehensive characterizations show that the graphene oxide obtained through the microfluidic strategy has features like those prepared in laboratory beakers and industrial reactors, yet with the higher oxidization degree and more epoxy groups. More importantly, the microfluidic preparation allows for on&#8208;line monitoring of the oxidization by Raman spectroscopy, ready for the dynamical control of reaction condition and product quality. The capability of continuous preparation is also demonstrated by showing the assembly of fibers and reduction of graphene oxide in microfluidic channels, and the applicability of graphene oxide prepared from the microfluidic strategy for thermally and electrically conductive films.

         <title>Data Mining for Terahertz Generation Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We demonstrate a data mining approach to discover and develop new organic nonlinear optical crystals that produce intense pulses of terahertz radiation. We mine the Cambridge Structural Database for non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials and use this structural data in tandem with density functional theory calculations to predict new materials that efficiently generate terahertz radiation. This enables us to (in a relatively short time) discover, synthesize, and grow large, high&#8208;quality crystals of four promising materials and characterize them for intense terahertz generation. In a direct comparison to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic terahertz generation crystals, these new materials excel. The discovery and characterization of these novel terahertz generators validates the approach of combining data mining with density functional theory calculations to predict properties of high&#8208;performance organic materials, potentially for a host of exciting applications.

         <title>Targeting the Microenvironment of Vulnerable Atherosclerotic Plaques: An Emerging Diagnosis and Therapy Strategy for Atherosclerosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Atherosclerosis (AS) is considered one of the primary causes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Unpredictable rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques triggers adverse cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial syndrome (ACS) and even sudden cardiac death (SCD). Therefore, assessing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques and early intervention are of significant in reducing CVD mortality. Nanomedicine possesses tremendous advantages in achieving the integration of the diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerotic plaques because of its magnetic, optical, thermal, and catalytic properties. Based on the pathological characteristics of vulnerable plaques, stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoplatforms and surface&#8208;functionalized nanoagents have been designed and drawn great attention for accomplishing the precise imaging and treatment of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques due to their superior properties, such as high bioavailability, lesion&#8208;targeting specificity, on&#8208;demand cargo release, and low off&#8208;target damage. Here, we generalize the characteristics of vulnerable plaques, and systematically summarized some targeted strategies for boosting the accuracy of plaque vulnerability evaluation by imaging and the efficacy of plaque stabilization therapy (including antioxidant therapy, macrophage depletion therapy, regulation of lipid metabolism therapy, anti&#8208;inflammation therapy, etc.). In addition, we discuss existing challenges and prospects in this field, and believe it will provide new thinking for the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs in the near future.

         <title>Transferring Liquid Metal to form a Hybrid Solid Electrolyte via a Wettability&#8208;Tuning Technology for Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Integrating solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) into Li metal anodes has demonstrated a great promise to unleash the high energy density of rechargeable Li metal batteries. However, fabricating a highly cyclable SSE/Li metal anode remains a major challenge because densification of SSE is usually incompatible with reactive Li metal. Here, we propose a liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;derived hybrid solid electrolyte (HSE) and report a facile transfer technology to construct artificial HSE on Li metal. By tuning the wettability of transfer substrates, electron&#8208; and ion&#8208; conductive liquid metal was sandwiched between electron&#8208;insulating and ion&#8208;conductive LiF and oxides to form the HSE. The transfer technology renders the HSE continuous, dense, and uniform. The HSE having high ion transport, electron shut&#8208;off, and mechanical strength make the composite anode deliver excellent cyclability for over 4000 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a symmetrical cell. When pairing with LiFePO4 and sulfur cathodes, the HSE&#8208;coated Li metal dramatically enhances the performance of full cells. Therefore, this work demonstrates that tuning the interfacial wetting properties provide an alternative approach to building robust solid electrolyte, which enables high&#8208;efficient Li metal anodes.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with Rec.2020 Blue Gamut Compliance and EQE over 22% Achieved by Conformation Engineering</title>

Abstract
To achieve high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence satisfying Rec.2020 standard blue gamut, we developed two TADF emitters, 5&#8208;(2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracen&#8208;7&#8208;yl)&#8208;10,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[b,e][1,4]azasiline (TDBA&#8208;PAS) and 10&#8208;(2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracen&#8208;7&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (TDBA&#8208;DPAC). Inherited from their parented organoboron multi&#8208;resonance core, both emitters show very promising deep&#8208;blue emissions with relatively narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM, &#8764; 50&#160;nm in solution), high photoluminescence quantum yield (up to 92.3%) and short emission lifetime (&#8804; 2.49 &#956;s) with fast RISC (&gt; 106 s&#8211;1) in doped films. More importantly, replacing the spiro&#8208;centered sp3 C atom (TDBA&#8208;DPAC) with the larger radius sp3 Si atom (TDBA&#8208;PAS), enhanced conformational heterogeneities in bulky group shielded TADF molecules were observed in solution, doped film and device. Consequently, OLEDs based on TDBA&#8208;PAS retain high maximum external quantum efficiencies around 20% with suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off and color index close to Rec.2020 blue gamut over a wide doping range of 10&#8211;50 wt%. This study highlighted a new strategy to restrain spectral broadening and red&#8208;shifting and efficiency roll&#8208;off in the design of deep&#8208;blue TADF emitters.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency ITO&#8208;Free Organic Photovoltaics with Superior Flexibility and Up&#8208;Scalability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Developing ITO&#8208;free flexible organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with up&#8208;scaling capacity is of great significance for practical applications of OPVs. Unfortunately, the efficiencies of the corresponding devices lag far behind those of ITO&#8208;based rigid small&#8208;area counterparts. To address this issue, we design and fabricate an advanced device configuration featuring a top&#8208;illuminated structure with ultra&#8208;thin Ag as the transparent electrode. First, a conjugated polyelectrolyte layer, i.e., PCP&#8208;Li, is inserted to effectively connect the bottom Ag anode and the hole transport layer, achieving good photon to electron conversion. Second, charge collecting grids are deposited to suppress the increased resistance loss with the up&#8208;scaling of the device area, realizing almost full retention of device efficiency from 0.06 to 1 cm2. Third, the designed device delivers the best efficiency of 15.56% with the area of 1 cm2 on polyimide (PI) substrate, representing as the record among the ITO&#8208;free, large&#8208;area, flexible OPVs. Interestingly, the device exhibits no degradation after 100,000 bending cycles with a radius of 4&#160;mm, which is the best result for flexible OPVs. This work provides insight into device structure design and optimization for OPVs with high efficiency, low cost, superior flexibility, and up&#8208;scaling capacity, indicating the potential for the future commercialization of OPVs.

         <title>Dative epitaxy of commensurate monocrystalline covalent&#8208;van der Waals moir&#233; supercrystal</title>

Abstract
Realizing van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy in the 80's represents a breakthrough that circumvents the stringent lattice matching and processing compatibility requirements in conventional covalent heteroepitaxy. However, due to the weak vdW interactions, there is little control over film qualities by the substrate. Typically, discrete domains with a spread of misorientation angles are formed, limiting the applicability of vdW epitaxy. Here we report the epitaxial growth of monocrystalline, covalent Cr5Te8 2D crystals on monolayer vdW WSe2 by chemical vapor deposition, driven by interfacial dative bond formation. The lattice of Cr5Te8, with a lateral dimension of a few ten microns, is fully commensurate with that of WSe2 via 3 &#215; 3 (Cr5Te8)/7 &#215; 7 (WSe2) supercell matching, forming a single&#8208;crystalline moir&#233; superlattice. Our work has established a conceptually distinct paradigm of thin film epitaxy termed &#8220;dative epitaxy&#8221;, which takes full advantage of covalent epitaxy with chemical bonding for fixing the atomic registry and crystal orientation, while circumventing its stringent lattice matching and processing compatibility requirements; conversely, it ensures the full flexibility of vdW epitaxy, while avoiding its poor orientation control. Cr5Te8 2D crystals grown by dative epitaxy exhibit square magnetic hysteresis, suggesting minimized interfacial defects that can serve as pinning sites.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Material Design Enabling High&#8208;Performance Multifunctional Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics without Optical Modulations</title>

Abstract
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) have drawn great attention for promising applications in building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, providing additional power generation for daily uses. The strategy we proposed previously, &#8220;complementary NIR absorption,&#8221; has been widely applied for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs. However, rational material design towards high performance has never been achieved. In this work, an EQE model describing this strategy is developed to explore the full potential of material design on ST&#8208;OPV performance. Guided by the model, we design and synthesize a novel nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), ATT&#8208;9, which possesses optimal bandgap for ST&#8208;OPVs, achieving a record short&#8208;circuit current density of 30&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and a power conversion efficiency of 13.40%, the highest value among devices based on NFAs with bandgaps lower than 1.2&#160;eV. It is noted that at such a low bandgap, the energy loss of the device is only 0.58&#160;eV, which is attributed to the low energetic disorder confirmed by an ultralow Urbach energy of 21.6 meV. Benefiting from the optimal bandgap and low energy loss, ATT&#8208;9&#8208;based ST&#8208;OPV achieves a high light utilization efficiency of 3.33% without optical modulations, and meanwhile shows excellent thermal insulation, exceeding the commercial 3M heat&#8208;insulating window film, demonstrating the outstanding application prospects of multifunctional ST&#8208;OPVs.

         <title>Topological Antiferromagnetic Van der Waals Phase in Topological Insulator/Ferromagnet Heterostructures Synthesized by a CMOS&#8208;Compatible Sputtering Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Study of topological magnetic phases formed in topological insulators coupled with a ferromagnet is performed on a high&#8208;quality c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented Bi2Te3 thin film grown using a magnetron sputtering process. A topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase of Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 is revealed in the interface of Bi2Te3 coupled with the ferromagnet, Ni80Fe20. The Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is found to contain Ni&#8722;Te bonds and shows evidence of the formation of the topological AFM compound NiBi2Te4.








Abstract
Breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry by introducing magnetic order, thereby opening a gap in the topological surface state bands, is essential for realizing useful topological properties such as the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. In this work, a novel topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is created at the interface of a sputtered, c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented, topological insulator/ferromagnet heterostructure&#8212;Bi2Te3/Ni80Fe20 because of diffusion of Ni in Bi2Te3 (Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3). The AFM property of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interfacial layer is established by observation of spontaneous exchange bias in the magnetic hysteresis loop and compensated moments in the depth profile of the magnetization using polarized neutron reflectometry. Analysis of the structural and chemical properties of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is carried out using selected&#8208;area electron diffraction, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These studies, in parallel with first&#8208;principles calculations, indicate a solid&#8208;state chemical reaction that leads to the formation of Ni&#8722;Te bonds and the presence of topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) compound NiBi2Te4 in the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interface layer. The Ne&#233;l temperature of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is &#8776;63 K, which is higher than that of typical magnetic topological insulators (MTIs). The presented results provide a pathway toward industrial complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;process&#8208;compatible sputtered&#8208;MTI heterostructures, leading to novel materials for topological quantum devices.

         <title>An MXene&#8208;Based Metal Anode with Stepped Sodiophilic Gradient Structure Enables a Large Current Density for Rechargeable Na&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deposition&#8208;regulation strategy for Na scaffold is reported to induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of anode. The sodiophilic gradient structure of the new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;based scaffold significantly improves the affordability for high current density and areal capacity during the charging/discharging process of a Na&#8722;O2 battery.








Abstract
The metal anode is the pivotal component for advanced sodium&#8208;metal batteries such as Na&#8211;O2 batteries. Designing a 3D confinement scaffold is a promising strategy for constructing dendrite&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal anodes; however, cycling stability at a large current density (&gt;10 mA cm&#8722;2) is still difficult to realize. Herein, the design of new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h&#8208;Ti3C2) MXene based scaffolds with stepped sodiophilic gradient structure (h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG) is reported, and its thickness can be controlled (80&#8722;250&#160;&#181;m). The sodiophilic gradient structure (adjusted by h&#8208;Ti3C2) can effectively induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of the scaffold, thus inhibiting dendrite growth. h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na&#8208;based symmetrical batteries exhibit a low polarization voltage and long cycling life at a high current density (40 mA cm&#8722;2) and a high cut&#8208;off capacity (40 mAh cm&#8722;2). Moreover, a Na&#8211;O2 battery with an h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na anode exhibits a low potential gap of 0.137&#160;V after 45 cycles at 1000 mA g&#8722;1 and 1000 mAh g&#8722;1. This deposition&#8208;regulation strategy would inspire the design of 3D scaffolds for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;metal&#8208;anode&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Biomimetic and Biologically Compliant Soft Architectures via 3D and 4D Assembly Methods: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in soft material chemistry as it relates to direct ink writing and directed assembly through compressive buckling is discussed in relation to advances in 4D fabrication. The discussion focuses on the chemistry of important classes of soft materials, such as gels and elastomers, specifically in ways that allow new possibilities for biomimetic and biologically compliant forms of design.








Abstract
Recent progress in soft material chemistry and enabling methods of 3D and 4D fabrication&#8212;emerging programmable material designs and associated assembly methods for the construction of complex functional structures&#8212;is highlighted. The underlying advances in this science allow the creation of soft material architectures with properties and shapes that programmably vary with time. The ability to control composition from the molecular to the macroscale is highlighted&#8212;most notably through examples that focus on biomimetic and biologically compliant soft materials. Such advances, when coupled with the ability to program material structure and properties across multiple scales via microfabrication, 3D printing, or other assembly techniques, give rise to responsive (4D) architectures. The challenges and prospects for progress in this emerging field in terms of its capacities for integrating chemistry, form, and function are described in the context of exemplary soft material systems demonstrating important but heretofore difficult&#8208;to&#8208;realize biomimetic and biologically compliant behaviors.

         <title>Nanoengineered Neutrophils as a Cellular Sonosensitizer for Visual Sonodynamic Therapy of Malignant Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoengineered neutrophil sonosensitizers are developed for visual sonodynamic therapy (SDT) of solid malignant tumors. Acouscyte/O2 not only has an enhanced multilevel active targeting but also provides oxygen to enhance SDT effects to eliminate tumors, maintain the appearance, and real&#8208;time multimode imaging, which provides a promising theranostic strategy for solid malignant tumors.








Abstract
The rapid evolution of cell&#8208;based theranostics has attracted extensive attention due to their unique advantages in biomedical applications. However, the inherent functions of cells alone cannot meet the needs of malignant tumor treatment. Thus endowing original cells with new characteristics to generate multifunctional living cells may hold a tremendous promise. Here, the nanoengineering method is used to combine customized liposomes with neutrophils, generating oxygen&#8208;carrying sonosensitizer cells with acoustic functions, which are called Acouscyte/O2, for the visual diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Specifically, oxygen&#8208;carried perfluorocarbon and temoporfin are encapsulated into cRGD peptide modified multilayer liposomes (C&#8208;ML/HPT/O2), which are then loaded into live neutrophils to obtain Acouscyte/O2. Acouscyte/O2 can not only carry a large amount of oxygen but also exhibits the ability of long circulation, inflammation&#8208;triggered recruitment, and decomposition. Importantly, Acouscyte/O2 can be selectively accumulated in tumors, effectively enhancing tumor oxygen levels, and triggering anticancer sonodynamics in response to ultrasound stimulation, leading to complete obliteration of tumors and efficient extension of the survival time of tumor&#8208;bearing mice with minimal systemic adverse effects. Meanwhile, the tumors can be monitored in real time by temoporfin&#8208;mediated fluorescence imaging and perfluorocarbon (PFC)&#8208;microbubble&#8208;enhanced ultrasound imaging. Therefore, the nanoengineered neutrophils, i.e., Acouscyte/O2, are a new type of multifunctional cellular drug, which provides a new platform for the diagnosis and sonodynamic therapy of solid malignant tumors.

         <title>Inhaled mRNA Nanoformulation with Biogenic Ribosomal Protein Reverses Established Pulmonary Fibrosis in a Bleomycin&#8208;Induced Murine Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reverse established pulmonary fibrosis, an inhaled nanoformulation is developed with biogenic ribosomal protein for co&#8208;delivering the mRNA of matrix metalloproteinase 13 and keratinocyte growth factor. The nanoformulation&#8208;mediated treatment accelerates the clearance of overwhelming collagen and the alveolar re&#8208;epithelialization in fibrotic foci, which synergistically restores alveolar integrity and improves pulmonary function of the bleomycin&#8208;induced murine model.








Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a lethal respiratory disease with few treatment options, occurs due to repetitive microinjuries to alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and progresses with an overwhelming deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), ultimately resulting in fibrotic scars and destroyed the alveolar architecture. Here, an inhaled ribosomal protein&#8208;based mRNA nanoformulation is reported for clearing the intrapulmonary ECM and re&#8208;epithelializing the disrupted alveolar epithelium, thereby reversing established fibrotic foci in IPF. The nanoformulation is sequentially assembled by a ribosomal protein&#8208;condensed mRNA core, a bifunctional peptide&#8208;modified corona and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) with a PEGylated shielding shell. When inhaled via a nebulizer, the nanoformulations carried by microdrops are deposited in the alveoli, and penetrate into fibrotic foci, where the outer KGFs are detached after matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) triggering. The RGD motif&#8208;grafted cores then expose and specifically target the integrin&#8208;elevated cells for the intracellular delivery of mRNA. Notably, repeated inhalation of the nanoformulations accelerates the clearance of locoregional collagen by boosting the intralesional expression of MMP13 and alveolar re&#8208;epithelialization mediated by KGFs, which synergistically ameliorates the lung function of a bleomycin&#8208;induced murine model. Therefore, this work provides an alternative mRNA&#8208;inhalation delivery strategy, which shows great potential for the treatment of IPF.

         <title>Synergistic Energy Absorption Mechanisms of Architected Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique rate&#8208;dependent energy absorption behavior of architected materials based on liquid crystal elastomers is reported. The synergistic interaction between viscoelastic dissipation and snap&#8208;through buckling causes the energy absorption density to increase with strain rate according to a power&#8208;law relationship and with a number of layers for multilayered structures. The study can contribute to the development of lightweight extreme energy&#8208;absorbing metamaterials.








Abstract
A unique rate&#8208;dependent energy absorption behavior of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE)&#8208;based architected materials is reported. The architected materials consist of repeating unit cells of bistable tilted LCE beams sandwiched between stiff supports. The viscoelastic behavior of the LCE causes the energy absorption to increase with strain rate according to a power&#8208;law relationship, which can be modulated by changing the degree of mesogen alignment and the loading direction relative to the director. For a strain rate of 600 s&#8722;1, the unit cell exhibits up to a 5&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 energy absorption density, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the same structure fabricated from poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomer and is comparable to the dissipation from irreversible plastic deformation exhibited by denser metals. For a multilayered structure of unit cells, nonuniform buckling of the different layers produces additional viscoelastic dissipation. This synergistic interaction between viscoelastic dissipation and snap&#8208;through buckling causes the energy absorption density to increase with the number of layers. The sequence of cell collapse can be controlled by grading the beam thickness to further promote viscous dissipation and enhance the energy absorption density. It is envisioned that the study can contribute to the development of lightweight extreme energy&#8208;absorbing metamaterials.

         <title>Electrostatically Driven Polarization Flop and Strain&#8208;Induced Curvature in Free&#8208;Standing Ferroelectric Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic and elastic interactions between the constituent layers in free&#8208;standing ferroelectric superlattices can lead to new polarization arrangements and macroscopic curvature of the sample. In this work, the complex domain structure of ferroelectric microtubes and its response to mechanical deformation is studied using a variety of techniques, paving the way for a combined strain and electrostatic approach to engineering highly responsive materials.








Abstract
The combination of strain and electrostatic engineering in epitaxial heterostructures of ferroelectric oxides offers many possibilities for inducing new phases, complex polar topologies, and enhanced electrical properties. However, the dominant effect of substrate clamping can also limit the electromechanical response and often leaves electrostatics to play a secondary role. Releasing the mechanical constraint imposed by the substrate can not only dramatically alter the balance between elastic and electrostatic forces, enabling them to compete on par with each other, but also activates new mechanical degrees of freedom, such as the macroscopic curvature of the heterostructure. In this work, an electrostatically driven transition from a predominantly out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized to an in&#8208;plane polarized state is observed when a PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattice with a SrRuO3 bottom electrode is released from its substrate. In turn, this polarization rotation modifies the lattice parameter mismatch between the superlattice and the thin SrRuO3 layer, causing the heterostructure to curl up into microtubes. Through a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based scanning X&#8208;ray diffraction imaging, Raman scattering, piezoresponse force microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy, the crystalline structure and domain patterns of the curved superlattices are investigated, revealing a strong anisotropy in the domain structure and a complex mechanism for strain accommodation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of strain and electrostatic engineering in epitaxial heterostructures of ferroelectric oxides offers many possibilities for inducing new phases, complex polar topologies, and enhanced electrical properties. However, the dominant effect of substrate clamping can also limit the electromechanical response and often leaves electrostatics to play a secondary role. Releasing the mechanical constraint imposed by the substrate can not only dramatically alter the balance between elastic and electrostatic forces, enabling them to compete on par with each other, but also activates new mechanical degrees of freedom, such as the macroscopic curvature of the heterostructure. In this work, an electrostatically driven transition from a predominantly out-of-plane polarized to an in-plane polarized state is observed when a PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; superlattice with a SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bottom electrode is released from its substrate. In turn, this polarization rotation modifies the lattice parameter mismatch between the superlattice and the thin SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer, causing the heterostructure to curl up into microtubes. Through a combination of synchrotron-based scanning X-ray diffraction imaging, Raman scattering, piezoresponse force microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy, the crystalline structure and domain patterns of the curved superlattices are investigated, revealing a strong anisotropy in the domain structure and a complex mechanism for strain accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unblocked Electron Channels Enable Efficient Contact Prelithiation for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of electron channels leads to a low Li source utilization for contact prelithiation, and the resultant &#8220;dead Li&#8221; greatly degrades battery performance. Creating more electron channels at the Li source/anode interface not only dissipates the local current density to stabilize the electron channels, but also promotes the reaction kinetics, thus supporting an improved Li utilization for contact prelithiation.








Abstract
Contact prelithiation is strongly considered for compensating the initial capacity loss of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, exhibiting great potential for ultralong cycle life of working batteries and the application of large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems. However, the utilization of the sacrificial Li source for contact prelithiation is low (&lt;65%). Herein the fundamental mechanism of contact prelithiation is described from the perspective of the Li source/anode interfaces by regulating the initial contact state, and a clear illustration of the pathogeny for capacity attenuation is successfully delivered. Specifically, creating plentiful electron channels is an access to making contact prelithiation with a higher Li utilization, as the mitigated local current density that reduces the etching of Li dissolution and SEI extension on electron channels. A vacuum thermal evaporation for depositing the Li film enables the contact interface to possess an adequate electron channel construction, rendering a Li utilization of 91.0%, and the dead Li yield is significantly reduced in a working battery.

         <title>A Quadri&#8208;Dimensional Manipulable Laser with an Intrinsic Chiral Photoswitch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadri&#8208;dimensional manipulable laser emission with optically dynamic controllable wavelength, wavefront, spin, and orbital angular momentum is achieved, enabled by an intrinsic chiral photoswitch with excellent thermal stability and fatigue&#8208;resistance, thereby exploiting a new way toward information encoding, security imprinting, and integrated photonics.








Abstract
Dynamic and multi&#8208;dimensional manipulation of laser emission with light allows for optical coding, computing, and imaging photonic chips. However, the coupling balance between photonic resonance and transmission is a formidable challenge due to the uncontrollable chiral microcavity with photo&#8208;reversibility, which is limited to the multi&#8208;freedom of the laser with sustainable and repeatable output beams. Herein, a helical superstructure system with a unique intrinsic chiral photoswitch is developed for resolving the always pendent problems on organized defects in the microcavity. The unique intrinsic chirality based on the photoswitchable system allows laser emission with a sharp and narrow band&#8208;width, with both remarkable thermodynamic stability and robust fatigue&#8208;resistance. A quadri&#8208;dimensional manipulable laser, featuring wavelength&#8208;tunability, wavefront&#8208;shaping, spin angular momentum (SAM), and orbital angular momentum (OAM), is successfully established with the assistance of the photoresponsive intrinsic chiral superstructure with photoreversibility. This technology marks an important milestone, and sketches a future framework for the realms of nanophotonic information encoding, security imprinting, and integrated photonics.

         <title>Folding and Fracture of Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene Grown on a Cu(111) Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly oriented and long graphene folds are spontaneously formed in chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition (CVD)&#8208;grown single&#8208;crystal graphene film on a Cu(111) foil surface, and this is triggered by the formation of highly ordered bunched Cu steps under the graphene. Such folds are fractured into &#8220;back&#8208;and&#8208;forth&#8221; subfold patterns at bunched Cu step edge regions, with cracks propagating along zigzag or armchair directions.








Abstract
A single&#8208;crystal graphene film grown on a Cu(111) foil by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has ribbon&#8208;like fold structures. These graphene folds are highly oriented and essentially parallel to each other. Cu surface steps underneath the graphene are along the &lt;110&gt;&#160;and &lt;211&gt;&#160;directions, leading to the formation of the arrays of folds. The folds in the single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) are not continuous but break up into alternating patterns. A &#8220;joint&#8221; (an AB&#8208;stacked bilayer graphene) region connects two neighboring alternating regions, and the breaks are always along zigzag or armchair directions. Folds formed in bilayer or few&#8208;layer graphene are continuous with no breaks. Molecular dynamics simulations show that SLG suffers a significantly higher compressive stress compared to bilayer graphene when both are under the same compression, thus leading to the rupture of SLG in these fold regions. The fracture strength of a CVD&#8208;grown single&#8208;crystal SLG film is simulated to be about 70&#160;GPa. This study greatly deepens the understanding of the mechanics of CVD&#8208;grown single&#8208;crystal graphene and such folds, and sheds light on the fabrication of various graphene origami/kirigami structures by substrate engineering. Such oriented folds can be used in a variety of further studies.

         <title>A Library of ROS&#8208;Catalytic Metalloenzyme Mimics with Atomic Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;catalytic metalloenzyme mimics with 20 different types of atomic metal centers is synthesized to compare and disclose the catalytic activities, substrate selectivities, kinetics, and ROS products. These prepared biocatalysts not only show remarkably high ROS&#8208;catalytic performances but also clearly reveal that the catalytic paths and activities are highly related to the electronic structures of metal centers.








Abstract
Metal&#63743;N&#8208;coordinated centers supported by carbonaceous substrates have emerged as promising artificial metalloenzymes (AMEs) to mimic the biocatalytic effects of their natural counterparts. However, the synthesis of well&#8208;defined AMEs that contain different atomic metal&#63743;N centers but present similar physicochemical and coordination structures remains a substantial challenge. Here, 20 different types of AMEs with similar geometries and well&#8208;defined atomic metal&#63743;N&#8208;coordinated centers are synthesized to compare and disclose the catalytic activities, substrate selectivities, kinetics, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products. Their oxidase (OXD)&#8208;, peroxidase (POD)&#8208;, and halogen peroxidase (HPO)&#8208;mimetic catalytic behaviors are systematically explored. The Fe&#8208;AME shows the highest OXD&#8208; and HPO&#8208;mimetic activities compared to the other AMEs due to its high vmax (0.927&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;6 m s&#8722;1) and low Km (1.070&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m), while the Cu&#8208;AME displays the best POD&#8208;like performance. Furthermore, theoretical calculation reveals that the ROS&#8208;catalytic paths and activities are highly related to the electronic structures of the metal centers. Benefiting from its facile adsorption of H2O2 molecule and lower energy barrier to generating &#8226;O2&#8722;, the Fe&#8208;AME displays higher ROS&#8208;catalytic performances than the Mn&#8208;AME. The engineered AMEs show not only remarkably high ROS&#8208;catalytic performances but also provide new guidance toward developing metal&#63743;N&#8208;coordinated biocatalysts for broad application fields.

         <title>Prussian Blue Nanozyme as a Pyroptosis Inhibitor Alleviates Neurodegeneration</title>

         <dc:description>
Based on the excellent intrinsic reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging properties, intra&#8208;cerebroventricular injection of Prussian blue nanozyme (PBzyme) reduces the production of mitochondrial ROS induced by 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), inhibits the activation of microglial nucleotide&#8208;binding domain and leucine&#8208;rich repeat family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and downstream pyroptosis of microglia, and further rescues the loss of dopaminergic neurons in MPTP&#8208;induced cell and mouse models of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Current pharmacological interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) remain unsatisfactory in clinical settings. Inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis represents a potential therapeutic target for the alleviation of neurodegenerative diseases. The development of inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis agonists or antagonists may transform the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the identification of specific compounds that inhibit pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, Prussian blue nanozyme (PBzyme) is revealed as a pyroptosis inhibitor to alleviate the neurodegeneration in mouse and cell models of PD. PBzyme protects the microglia and neurons against 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). PBzyme alleviates motor deficits, attenuates the damage of mitochondrial membrane potential, and rescues dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, intra&#8208;cerebroventricular injection of PBzyme reduces dopaminergic degeneration and inhibits neuroinflammation in an MPTP&#8208;induced PD mouse model. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that PBzyme reduces the activation of microglial nucleotide&#8208;binding domain and leucine&#8208;rich repeat family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes and caspase&#8208;1 by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thereby downregulating gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage as well as inflammatory factor production, and eventually leading to the inhibition of microglia pyroptosis. Overall, this work highlights the neuroprotective effects of PBzyme as a pyroptosis inhibitor and provides valuable mechanistic insights and a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Synthetic Strategies to Advanced Optical&#8208;Electrical&#8208;Magnetic Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the synthesis of 2D COF powders, single crystals, and thin films, as well as their advanced optical, electrical, and magnetic functionalities are systematically summarized. The challenging issues and potential opportunities are also proposed for further inspiring their development in structure, synthesis, and functionalities.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), an emerging class of organic crystalline polymers with highly oriented structures and permanent porosity, can adopt 2D or 3D architectures depending on the different topological diagrams of the monomers. Notably, 2D COFs have particularly gained much attention due to the extraordinary merits of their extended in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation and topologically ordered columnar &#960;&#8208;arrays. These properties together with high crystallinity, large surface area, and tunable porosity distinguish 2D COFs as an ideal candidate for the fabrication of functional materials. Herein, this review surveys the recent research advances in 2D COFs with special emphasis on the preparation of 2D COF powders, single crystals, and thin films, as well as their advanced optical, electrical, and magnetic functionalities. Some challenging issues and potential research outlook for 2D COFs are also provided for promoting their development in terms of structure, synthesis, and functionalities.
