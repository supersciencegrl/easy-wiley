         <title>Organic Hole&#8208;Transport Layers for Efficient, Stable, and Scalable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attract great attention due to their low&#8208;temperature processing, negligible hysteresis, and superior stability. For these devices, hole&#8208;transport layers play a decisive role in carrier extraction, transport, and perovskite crystallization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the structural engineering of organic hole&#8208;transport layers utilized in inverted PSCs including conductive polymers, small molecules, and emerging self&#8208;assembled monolayers.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) are an essential component in inverted, p&#8211;i&#8211;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) where they play a decisive role in extraction and transport of holes, surface passivation, perovskite crystallization, device stability, and cost. Currently, the exploration of efficient, stable, highly transparent and low&#8208;cost HTLs is of vital importance for propelling p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs toward commercialization. Compared to their inorganic counterparts, organic HTLs offer multiple advantages such as a tunable bandgap and energy level, easy synthesis and purification, solution processability, and overall low cost. Here, recent progress of organic HTLs, including conductive polymers, small molecules, and self&#8208;assembled monolayers, as utilized in inverted PSCs is systematically reviewed and summarized. Their molecular structure, hole&#8208;transport properties, energy levels, and relevant device properties and resulting performances are presented and analyzed. A summary of design principles and a future outlook toward highly efficient organic HTLs in inverted PSCs is proposed. This review aims to inspire further innovative development of novel organic HTLs for more efficient, stable, and scalable inverted PSCs.

         <title>Wet&#8208;Adhesive On&#8208;Skin Sensors Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Wireless Monitoring of Metabolites in Sweat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials and techniques are demonstrated to achieve wearable and breathable sensing devices by integrating conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks with a flexible nanocellulose membrane. This robust sensor can self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin for the wireless and in situ monitoring of vitamin C in human sweat.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with well&#8208;defined porous structures and tailored functionalities have been widely used in chemical sensing. However, the integration of MOFs with flexible electronic devices for wearable sensing is challenging because of their low electrical conductivity and fragile mechanical properties. Herein, a wearable sweat sensor for metabolite detection is presented by integrating an electrically conductive Ni&#8208;MOF with a flexible nanocellulose substrate. The MOF&#8208;based layered film sensor with inherent conductivity, highly porous structure, and active catalytic properties enables the selective and accurate detection of vitamin C and uric acid. More importantly, the lightweight sensor can conformably self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin and exhibits high water&#8208;vapor permeability. Furthermore, a wireless epidermal nutrition tracking system for the in situ monitoring of the dynamics of sweat vitamin C is demonstrated, the results of which are comparable to those tested by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. This study opens a new avenue for integrating MOFs as the active layer in wearable electronic devices and holds promise for the future development of high&#8208;performance electronics with enhanced sensing, energy production, and catalytic capabilities through the implementation of multifunctional MOFs.

         <title>Structural Design and Fabrication of Multifunctional Nanocarbon Materials for Extreme Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocarbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have provided a variety of unique extreme environmental properties. The recent advances on nanocarbon materials for extreme environments are summarized from the feature of individual nanocarbon components, principles of structural design, fabrication technologies, while examples of their extreme environmental applications with the underlying working mechanism are given.








Abstract
Extreme environments represent numerous harsh environmental conditions, such as temperature, pressure, corrosion, and radiation. The tolerance of applications in extreme environments exemplifies significant challenges to both materials and their structures. Given the superior mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and chemical stability of nanocarbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, they are widely investigated as base materials for extreme environmental applications and have shown numerous breakthroughs in the fields of wide&#8208;temperature structural&#8208;material construction, low&#8208;temperature energy storage, underwater sensing, and electronics operated at high temperatures. Here, the critical aspects of structural design and fabrication of nanocarbon materials for extreme environments are reviewed, including a description of the underlying mechanism supporting the performance of nanocarbon materials against extreme environments, the principles of structural design of nanocarbon materials for the optimization of extreme environmental performances, and the fabrication processes developed for the realization of specific extreme environmental applications. Finally, perspectives on how CNTs and graphene can further contribute to the development of extreme environmental applications are presented.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Membranes Prepared by Rapid Electrophoretic Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;cell electrophoretic deposition strategy to assemble covalent organic frameworks (COFs) nanosheets into ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures within several minutes is reported. The constructed COF membranes exhibit outstanding separation performance toward the negatively charged probe molecules with a dimension larger than 1&#160;nm due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a disruptive material platform for various novel applications including nanofiltration for water purification due to their excellent physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the currently available approaches for preparing COF membranes need stringent synthesis conditions, prolonged fabrication time, and tedious post&#8208;processing, leading to poor productivity. Herein, a simple and efficient layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking assembly strategy is developed based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to rapidly generate ionic COF membranes due to the uniform driving force for nanosheet assembly. A new two&#8208;cell EPD design avoids the usual EPD problems such as bubbles and acidic/alkaline microenvironments in the near&#8208;electrode region in aqueous EPD processes. Ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures can be produced within several minutes. Consequently, the prepared COF membranes exhibit outstanding permselectivity and possess good stability and anti&#8208;pressure ability due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.

         <title>Tailoring Materials for Epilepsy Imaging: From Biomarkers to Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A framework for understanding potential biomarkers of epilepsy is provided and they are classified them into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis. Then, the materials used to fabricate the imaging probes and their performances in defining the epileptic foci are highlighted. Imaging strategies overcoming the heterogenous nature of epilepsy are thoroughly discussed.








Abstract
Excising epileptic foci (EF) is the most efficient approach for treating drug&#8208;resistant epilepsy (DRE). However, owing to the vast heterogeneity of epilepsies, EF in one&#8208;third of patients cannot be accurately located, even after exhausting all current diagnostic strategies. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that truly represent the status of epilepsy and fabricating probes with high targeting specificity are prerequisites for identifying the &#8220;concealed&#8221; EF. However, no systematic summary of this topic has been published. Herein, the potential biomarkers of EF are first summarized and classified into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis, a procedure of nonepileptic brain biasing toward epileptic tissue. The materials used to fabricate these imaging probes and their performance in defining the EF in preclinical and clinical studies are highlighted. Finally, perspectives for developing the next generation of probes and their challenges in clinical translation are discussed. In general, this review can be helpful in guiding the development of imaging probes defining EF with improved accuracy and holds promise for increasing the number of DRE patients who are eligible for surgical intervention.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Robust Full&#8208;Color Organic Afterglow through 2D Superlattices Embedment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and universal strategy is proposed to prepare high&#8208;performance and robust organic afterglow with high figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit by 2D&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices embedment of phosphors. Deep&#8208;blue organic afterglow with high efficiency up to 65%, ultralong lifetime over 1300 ms, and robust emission that can resist the quenching effects from oxygen, solvent, stress, and heat is achieved.








Abstract
Purely organic afterglow (POA) originating from the slow radiative decay of stabilized triplet excited states has shown amazing potential in many fields. However, achieving highly stable POA with high phosphorescent quantum yield (PhQY) and long lifetime is still a formidable challenge owing to the intrinsically active and sensitive nature of triplet excitons. Here, triplet excitons of phosphors are protected and stabilized by embedding in tricomponent trihapto self&#8208;assembled 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices, which not only enables deep&#8208;blue POA with high PhQY (up to 65%), ultralong lifetime (over 1300&#160;ms) and the highest figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit at room temperature, but also achieves excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, solvent, pressure, light, and heat. In addition, the POA color is tuned from deep&#8208;blue to red via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the deep&#8208;blue POA emitters to the fluorophores. Moreover, with the high&#8208;performance, robust, and full&#8208;color POA materials, flexible anti&#8208;counterfeit displays and direct&#8208;current (DC)&#8208;driven lifetime&#8208;encrypted color Morse Code applications are facilely realized.

         <title>Catalase&#8208;Mimetic Artificial Biocatalysts with Ru Catalytic Centers for ROS Elimination and Stem&#8208;Cell Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalase&#8208;mimetic artificial biocatalysts with Ru catalytic centers are constructed for reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination. The activity merits and structure diversities of different Ru catalytic sites are systematically disclosed. Notably, the biocatalysts with Ru clusters present exceptional ROS&#8208;elimination activity, thus providing efficient rescue ability for the survival, adhesion, and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in high ROS conditions.








Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;efficiency reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;elimination materials is of great importance for combating oxidative stress in diverse diseases, especially stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based biotherapeutics. By mimicking the Fe&#63743;N active centers of natural catalase, here, an innovative concept to design ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts with Ru catalytic centers for stem&#8208;cell protection is reported. The experimental studies and theoretical calculations have systematically disclosed the activity merits and structure diversities of different Ru sites when serving as ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts. Benefiting from the metallic electronic structures and synergetic effects of multiple sites, the artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers present exceptional ROS&#8208;elimination activity; notably, it shows much higher catalytic efficiency per Ru atom on decomposing H2O2 when compared to the isolated single&#8208;atom Ru sites, which is more efficient than that of the natural antioxidants and recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ROS&#8208;scavenging biocatalysts. The systematic stem&#8208;cell protection studies reveal that the catalase&#8208;like artificial biocatalysts can provide efficient rescue ability for survival, adhesion, and differentiation functions of human mesenchymal stem cells in high ROS level conditions. It is suggested that applying these artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers will offer a new pathway for engineering high&#8208;performance ROS&#8208;scavenging materials in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics and many other ROS&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing of Prussian Blue Analogues with Electrochemically Driven Morphological Rejuvenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon of self&#8208;healing can be determined through kinetic dynamics under an electric field in terms of an &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic morphology variations in Prussian blue analogue electrodes.








Abstract
Maintaining the morphology of electrode materials with high invertibility contributes to the prolonged cyclic stability of battery systems. However, the majority of electrode materials tend to degrade during the charge&#8211;discharge process owing to the inevitable increase in entropy. Herein, a self&#8208;healing strategy is designed to promote morphology rejuvenation in Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes by cobalt doping. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrate that a trace amount of cobalt can decelerate the crystallization process and restore the cracked areas to ensure perfect cubic structures of PBA cathodes. The electric field controls the kinetic dynamics, rather than the conventional thermodynamics, to realize the &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic self&#8208;healing phenomenon. The properties of electron transportation and ion diffusion in bulk PBA are also improved by the doping strategy, thus boosting the cyclability with 4000 cycles in a diluent electrolyte. This discovery provides a new paradigm for the construction of self&#8208;healing electrodes for cathodes.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Socketed Sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Copper for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing perovskite&#8211;Cu heteronanostructures through in situ socketing sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu onto perovskite backbones provides a favorable platform for efficient and stable CO2 electroreduction (CER) to C2+ products. Within such heteronanostructures, the significant strong metal&#8211;support interactions, which modulate electronic structure of active Cu and strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion, play key roles in simultaneously enhancing CER activity, selectivity for C2+ products, and stability.








Abstract
In situ socketing metal nanoparticles onto perovskite oxides has shown great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but its employment in boosting ambient CO2 electroreduction (CER) is unexplored. Here, a CER catalyst of perovskite&#8208;socketed sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu equipped with strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSIs) is constructed to promote efficient and stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For such a catalyst, plentiful sub&#8208;3&#160;nm ellipsoid Cu particles are homogeneously and epitaxially anchored on the perovskite backbones, with concomitant creation of significant SMSIs. These SMSIs are able to not only modulate electronic structure of active Cu and facilitate adsorption/activation of key intermediates, but also to strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion and intensify resistance to structural degradation. Beneficial from these advantageous merits, when evaluated in CER, it performs comparably to or better than most reported Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures. Relative to a physical&#8208;mixture counterpart, it features marked improvements (up to 6.2 folds) in activity and selectivity for C2+, together with greatly boosted stability (&gt;80&#160;h). This work gives a new avenue to rationally design more advanced Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures for CER.

         <dc:description>
Phenethylammonium bromine&#8208;modified CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are successfully introduced into perovskite film to passivate the intrinsic defects and accelerate the energy&#8208;transfer process. Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate/poly[9,9&#8208;dioctylfluoreneco&#8208;N&#8208;[4&#8208;(3&#8208;methylpropyl)]diphenylamine]:black phosphorus is also constructed to enhance carrier injection and charge&#8208;transport ability.

Quasi&#8208;2D perovskites have emerged as a promising luminescent material for perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;LEDs). However, efficiency and stability are still obstacles to practical application due to numerous defects and inefficient energy transfer of perovskite films. Herein, functional phenethylammonium bromine&#8208;modified CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 NCs) are first introduced as multifunctional additive to simultaneously improve abovementioned problems. PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 NCs not only serve as heteronuclear seeds and trigger growth, thus greatly reducing leakage current, but also deliver Cs+ and Br&#8722; to passivate the intrinsic defects inside film. More importantly, the PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 construct a new carrier&#8208;transfer pathway from the small&#8208;n phase of the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite to the PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3, which not only accelerates the energy&#8208;transfer process but also promotes radiation recombination of carriers due to stronger quantum confinement effect. Afterward, the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate/poly[9,9&#8208;dioctylfluoreneco&#8208;N&#8208;[4&#8208;(3&#8208;methylpropyl)]diphenylamine]:black phosphorus quantum dot double hole&#8208;transport layer is successfully constructed to enhance its carrier&#8208;injection and charge&#8208;transport abilities. Consequently, a champion external quantum efficiency of 25.32% and maximal brightness of 128&#8239;842&#160;cd m&#8722;2 are achieved, which is the record efficiency of the quasi&#8208;2D Pe&#8208;LED with pure green emission at 530&#160;nm. Moreover, an impressive 174&#160;min lifetime is obtained at T50, which is about five times longer than the control device.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Production of Rectorite Nanosheets and their Co&#8208;Assembly with Aramid Nanofibers for High&#8208;Performance Electrical Insulating Nanopapers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gram&#8208;scale rectorite nanosheets (RNs) with ultrathin thickness (&#8776;5 nm) are efficiently prepared from raw rectorite microplatelets via a scalable exfoliation approach and rapidly separated from their suspension by an efficient poly(dienedimethylammonium chloride)&#8208;assisted sedimentation strategy. Then, the RNs are co&#8208;assembled with aramid nanofibers into large&#8208;scale nacre&#8208;mimetic nanopapers, achieving considerably enhanced mechanical, electrical insulating, and high&#8208;temperature resistant properties.








Abstract
Compared with raw rectorite microplatelets (RMs), rectorite nanosheets (RNs) have considerably greater application prospects in the preparation of advanced composite materials because of their larger aspect ratio, higher surface reactivity, and intrinsically superior mechanical and physical properties. However, the difficulty in the efficient preparation of RNs significantly limits their large&#8208;scale applications. Here, a scalable poly(vinylpyrrolidone)&#8208;assisted stirring approach is developed to prepare ultrathin RNs from the abundant natural RMs. A higher production rate (&#8776;0.675&#160;g h&#8722;1) is achieved compared with that of most other nanosheets. Additionally, instead of using conventional time&#8208; and energy&#8208;consuming high&#8208;speed centrifugation, an efficient poly(dienedimethylammonium chloride)&#8208;assisted sedimentation strategy is proposed here to rapidly separate the exfoliated RNs from the RN dispersion. Then, the RNs are co&#8208;assembled with aramid nanofibers (ANFs) into large&#8208;scale nacre&#8208;mimetic ANF&#8208;RN nanopapers with considerably enhanced mechanical, electrical insulating, and high&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant&#160;properties compared with pure ANF nanopapers and ANF&#8208;RM micropapers. Moreover, these properties are superior to those of previously reported ANF&#8208;based nanopapers and commercial insulating micropapers.

         <title>Transfer&#8208;Tattoo&#8208;Like Cell&#8208;Sheet Delivery Induced by Interfacial Cell Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a transfer&#8208;tattoo&#8208;like cell&#8208;sheet delivery platform is described, based on interfacial cell migration. The use of a commercially available flexible parylene film facilitates the manipulation of cell sheets and the creation of freeform designs. The efficacy of a multilayered cell&#8208;sheet skin substitute in promoting re&#8208;epithelialization and re&#8208;vascularization of wounds in mouse models is demonstrated.








Abstract
A direct transfer of a cell sheet from a culture surface to a target tissue is introduced. Commercially available, flexible parylene is used as the culture surface, and it is proposed that the UV&#8208;treated parylene offers adequate and intermediate levels of cell adhesiveness for both the stable cell attachment during culture and for the efficient cell transfer to a target surface. The versatility of this cell&#8208;transfer process is demonstrated with various cell types, including MRC&#8208;5, HDFn, HULEC&#8208;5a, MC3T3&#8208;E1, A549, C2C12 cells, and MDCK&#8208;II cells. The novel cell&#8208;sheet engineering is based on a mechanism of interfacial cell migration between two surfaces with different adhesion preferences. Monitoring of cytoskeletal dynamics and drug treatments during the cell&#8208;transfer process reveals that the interfacial cell migration occurs by utilizing the existing transmembrane proteins on the cell surface to bind to the targeted surface. The re&#8208;establishment and reversal of cell polarity after the transfer process are also identified. Its unique capabilities of 3D multilayer stacking, freeform design, and curved surface application are demonstrated. Finally, the therapeutic potential of the cell&#8208;sheet delivery system is demonstrated by applying it to cutaneous wound healing and skin&#8208;tissue regeneration in mice models.

Abstract
Hierarchically structural engineering of electrodes is critical to achieving high energy density and high power density in electrochemical energy storage (EES). However, rational regulation of the mesoscopic structure that coordinates microscopic and macroscopic structural features simultaneously remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the construction of electrodes with well&#8208;defined hierarchical pores spanning multiple length scales from 1&#160;nm to 50&#160;&#956;m. Vertically aligned two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) nanoplatelets with a thickness around 30&#160;nm were in&#8208;situ grown on macroporous graphene aerogel scaffold by a reversible polycondensation&#8208;termination strategy. The obtained electrode thus combines abundant accessible active sites and efficient transport expressways for both ions and electrons. When used for supercapacitors, a superior gravimetric capacitance of 289 F&#183;g&#8722;1 as well as outstanding capacitance retention at both high charge/discharge rates of 77% from 0.5 A&#183;g&#8722;1 to 50 A&#183;g&#8722;1 and high mass loading of 74% from 1.2 mg&#183;cm&#8722;2 to 10.4 mg&#183;cm&#8722;2 are achieved. Hierarchical engineering of mesostructured 2D COF units on the macroporous scaffold will bring unprecedented structural designability and performance enhancement for EES electrodes.

         <title>Regulation of Outer Solvation Shell toward Superior Low&#8208;temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are well regarded among the next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies due to their low cost and high safety. However, the unstable stripping/plating process leading to severe dendrite growth under high current density and low temperature impede their practical application. Herein, we demonstrate that the addition of 2&#8208;propanol can regulate the outer solvation shell structure of Zn2+ by replacing water molecules to establish a &#8220;eutectic solvation shell&#8221;, which provides strong affinity with the Zn (101) crystalline plane and fast desolvation kinetics during the plating process, rendering homogeneous Zn deposition without dendrite formation. As a result, the Zn anode exhibits promising cycle stability over 500 hours under an elevated current density of 15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and high depth of discharge of 51.2%. Furthermore, remarkable electrochemical performance was achieved in a 150 mAh Zn|V2O5 pouch cell over 1000 cycles at low temperature of &#8208;20&#176;C. This work not only offers a new strategy to achieve excellent performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries under harsh conditions, but also reveals electrolyte structure designs that can be applied in related energy storage and conversion fields.

Herein, we demonstrate that the addition of 2-propanol can regulate the outer solvation shell structure of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by replacing water molecules to establish a &#8220;eutectic solvation shell&#8221;, which provides strong affinity with the Zn (101) crystalline plane and fast desolvation kinetics during the plating process, rendering homogeneous Zn deposition without dendrite formation. As a result, the Zn anode exhibits promising cycle stability over 500 hours under an elevated current density of 15&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and high depth of discharge of 51.2%. Furthermore, remarkable electrochemical performance was achieved in a 150 mAh Zn|V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell over 1000 cycles at low temperature of -20&#176;C. This work not only offers a new strategy to achieve excellent performance of aqueous Zn-ion batteries under harsh conditions, but also reveals electrolyte structure designs that can be applied in related energy storage and conversion fields.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Visualized Gallium/Lyticase&#8208;Integrated Antifungal Strategy for Fungal Keratitis Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Fungal keratitis has been one of the common corneal infections that causes blindness, but an effective antifungal strategy remains a challenge. The exopolysaccharides both in fungal cell walls and biofilms are a key that acts as a permeation barrier to weaken the therapeutic effect of antifungal agents. Herein, we present lyticase and gallium ions co&#8208;integrated nanosystems (MLPGa) that could degrade exopolysaccharides and then effectively eradicate both the planktonic C. albicans and mature biofilms. The potential antifungal mechanism involves ROS production and metabolic interference of antioxidant&#8208;related genes, exopolysaccharide&#8208;related genes, iron ion utilization&#8208;related genes, fungal/biofilm development&#8208;related genes, and virulence genes. Meanwhile, the Raman signals generated by the chelation between nanosystems and gallium ions provide a real&#8208;time visualization tool to monitor Ga release. Finally, the MLPGa&#8208;based antifungal strategy with good biocompatibility achieves a satisfactory therapeutic effect in a fungal keratitis mouse model. This study provides a unique approach to the effective treatment of fungal keratitis in clinical practice.

         <title>Machine learning&#8211;accelerated development of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides as the air electrodes for protonic ceramic cells</title>

Abstract
Currently, the development of high&#8208;performance protonic ceramic cells (PCCs) is limited by the scarcity of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides that can act as air electrodes to satisfy the high protonic conductivity of electrolytes. Despite the extensive research efforts in the past decades, the development of mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides still remains in a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process, which is extremely time&#8208;consuming and high&#8208;cost. Herein, based on the data acquired from published literature, the machine learning (ML) method is introduced to accelerate the discovery of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Accordingly, the hydrated proton concentration (HPC) of 3200 oxides is predicted to evaluate the proton conduction that is essential for enhancing the electrochemical performances of PCCs. Subsequently, feature importance for HPC is evaluated to establish a guideline for rapid and accurate design and development of high&#8208;efficiency mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Thereafter, screened (La0.7Ca0.3)(Co0.8Ni0.2)O3 (LCCN7382) is prepared, and the experimental HPC adequately corresponds with the predicted results. Moreover, the PCC with LCCN7382 exhibited satisfactory electrochemical performances in electrolysis and fuel cell modes. In addition to the development of a promising air electrode for PCC, this study establishes a new avenue for ML&#8208;based development of mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;heteroaromatic Material for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries with Ultrahigh Rate and Extremely Long Life</title>

Abstract
Electroactive organic materials with tailored functional groups are of great importance for aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries due to their green and renewable nature. Herein, we designed and synthesized a completely new N&#8208;heteroaromatic material, hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;phenazine (HATN&#8208;PNZ), by an acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation reaction, and demonstrated its use as an ultrahigh performance cathode for Zn ion batteries. Compared with a phenazine monomer, we reveal that the &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of N&#8208;heteroaromatics can effectively increase electron delocalization, thereby improving its electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the enlarged aromatic structure noticeably suppresses its dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus enabling high structural stability. As expected, the HATN&#8208;PNZ cathode delivers a large reversible capacity of 257 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1, ultrahigh rate capability of 144 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1, and extremely long cycle life of 45,000 cycles at 50 A g&#8722;1. Charge storage mechanism investigation demonstrated the synergistic coordination of both Zn2+ and H+ cations with phenanthroline groups, with Zn2+ first followed by H+, accompanying the reversible formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate hydrate. Our work provides a molecular engineering strategy for superior organic materials and add new insights to understand the charge storage behavior of aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries.

Abstract
Developing fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8208;air battery is crucial for widening its application but remains challenging owing to the limitation of sluggish OER kinetics and insufficient active sites of electrocatalysts. To solve this issue, the reconstructed amorphous FeCoNiSx electrocatalyst with high&#8208;density efficient active sites, yielding low OER overpotentials of 202, 255 and 323&#160;mV at 10, 100 and 500&#160;mA/cm2, respectively, was developed for fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8208;air battery with low charging voltages at 100&#8211;400&#160;mA/cm2. Furthermore, the fabricated 3241.8 mAh (20&#160;mA/cm2, 25&#160;&#176;C) quasi&#8208;solid Zn&#8208;air battery shows long lifetime of 500&#160;h at &#8208;10 and 25&#160;&#176;C as well as 150&#160;h at 40&#160;&#176;C under charging 100&#160;mA/cm2. The detailed characterizations combine with DFT calculation indicate that the defect&#8208;rich crystalline /amorphous ternary metal (oxy) hydroxide formed by the reconstruction of amorphous multi&#8208;metallic sulfide, where the electron coupling effect among multi active sites and migration of intermediate O* from Ni site to Fe site breaks the scaling relationship to lead to a low theoretical OER overpotential of 170&#160;mV, accounting for the outstanding fast&#8208;charging property. This work not only provides insights into designing advanced OER catalysts by the self&#8208;reconstruction of pre&#8208;catalyst but also pioneers the pathway for the practical fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <title>Solution Processed Ternary Tin (II) Alloy as Hole&#8208;Transport Layer of Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) narrow bandgap (NBG) perovskites show great potential in both single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by low charge collection efficiency and poor stability. Here, we report a ternary Sn (II) alloy of SnOCl as the hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) with a work function of 4.95&#160;eV for Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs. The solution processed SnOCl layer has a texture structure which not only reduces the optical loss of the devices but also changes grain growth of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites and boosts the carrier diffusion length to 3.63&#160;&#956;m. The formation of small perovskite grains at the HTM/perovskite interface is suppressed. These result in an almost constant internal quantum efficiency of 96 &#177; 2% across the absorption spectrum of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. The SnOCl HTM significantly enhances the stability of Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with 87% of its initial efficiency retained after 1&#8208;sun illumination for 1,200&#160;h, and keep 85% efficiency under 85&#176;C thermal stress for 1,500&#160;h. The hybrid HTM further improve the stabilized efficiencies of single&#8208;junction Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells to 23.2% and 25.9%, respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tin-lead (Sn-Pb) narrow bandgap (NBG) perovskites show great potential in both single-junction and all-perovskite tandem solar cells. Sn-Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by low charge collection efficiency and poor stability. Here, we report a ternary Sn (II) alloy of SnOCl as the hole-transport material (HTM) with a work function of 4.95&#160;eV for Sn-Pb PSCs. The solution processed SnOCl layer has a texture structure which not only reduces the optical loss of the devices but also changes grain growth of Sn-Pb perovskites and boosts the carrier diffusion length to 3.63&#160;&#956;m. The formation of small perovskite grains at the HTM/perovskite interface is suppressed. These result in an almost constant internal quantum efficiency of 96 &#177; 2% across the absorption spectrum of Sn-Pb perovskites. The SnOCl HTM significantly enhances the stability of Sn-Pb PSCs with 87% of its initial efficiency retained after 1-sun illumination for 1,200&#160;h, and keep 85% efficiency under 85&#176;C thermal stress for 1,500&#160;h. The hybrid HTM further improve the stabilized efficiencies of single-junction Sn-Pb PSCs and all-perovskite tandem solar cells to 23.2% and 25.9%, respectively. This discovery opens an avenue to the multi-component metal alloys as HTM in PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Quantum Advantage in A Molecular Spintronic Engine that Harvests Thermal Fluctuation Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent theory and experiments have showcased how to harness quantum mechanics to assemble heat/information engines with efficiencies that surpass the classical Carnot limit. So far, this has required atomic engines that are driven by cumbersome external electromagnetic sources. Here, using molecular spintronics, we propose an implementation that is both electronic and autonomous. Our spintronic quantum engine heuristically deploys several known quantum assets by having a chain of spin qubits formed by the paramagnetic Co centers of phthalocyanine (Pc) molecules electronically interact with electron&#8208;spin selecting Fe/C60 interfaces. Density functional calculations reveal that transport fluctuations across the interface can stabilize spin coherence on the Co paramagnetic centers, which host spin flip processes. Across vertical molecular nanodevices, we measure enduring dc current generation, output power above room temperature, two quantum thermodynamical signatures of the engine's processes, and a record 89% spin polarization of current across the Fe/C60 interface. It is crucially this electron spin selection that forces, through demonic feedback and control, charge current to flow against the built&#8208;in potential barrier. Further research into spintronic quantum engines, insight into the quantum information processes within spintronic technologies, and retooling the spintronic&#8208;based information technology chain, could help accelerate the transition to clean energy.

         <title>Many&#8208;Body Molecular Interactions in a Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By maneuvering the supramolecular dynamics in a molecular memristor, a wide variation of functionalities starting from diode and passing between nonvolatile and volatile, unipolar and bipolar memristors with sharp and gradual transitions within a single circuit element is captured. A mathematical design space evolves thereof that can enable almost all possible characteristic variations, desirable in neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
Electronic transitions in molecular&#8208;circuit elements hinge on complex interactions between molecules and ions, offering a multidimensional parameter space to embed, access, and optimize material functionalities for target&#8208;specific applications. This opportunity is not cultivated in molecular memristors because their low&#8208;temperature charge transport, which is a route to decipher molecular many&#8208;body interactions, is unexplored. To address this, robust, temperature&#8208;resilient molecular memristors based on a Ru complex of an azo aromatic ligand are designed, and current&#8211;voltage sweep measurements from room temperature down to 2 K with different cooling protocols are performed. By freezing out or activating different components of supramolecular dynamics, the local Coulombic interactions between the molecules and counterions that affect the electronic transport can be controlled. Operating conditions are designed where functionalities spanning bipolar, unipolar, nonvolatile, and volatile memristors with sharp as well as gradual analog transitions are captured within a single device. A mathematical design space evolves, thereof comprising 36 tuneable parameters in which all possible steady&#8208;state functional variations in a memristor characteristic can be attainable. This enables a deterministic design route to engineer neuromorphic devices with unprecedented control over the transformation characteristics governing their functional flexibility and tunability.

         <title>Black Phosphorous Mediates Surface Charge Redistribution of CoSe2 for Electrochemical H2O2 Production in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black phosphorus chemically nailed on metallic cobalt diselenide mediates surface charge redistribution, which enables a selective and efficient two&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen toward&#160;hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in acid. The catalyst exhibits a 91% Faradic efficiency for H2O2 at an overpotential of 300 mV, and a high production rate of &#8776;1530&#160;mg L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a flow&#8208;cell reactor.








Abstract
Electrochemical generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction offers a green method to mitigate the current dependence on the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process, promising its on&#8208;site applications. Unfortunately, in alkaline environments, H2O2 is not stable and undergoes rapid decomposition. Making H2O2 in acidic electrolytes can prevent its decomposition, but choices of active, stable, and selective electrocatalysts are significantly limited. Here, the selective and efficient two&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen toward H2O2 in acid by a composite catalyst that is composed of black phosphorus (BP) nailed chemically on the metallic cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) surface is reported. It is found that this catalyst exhibits a 91% Faradic efficiency for H2O2 product at an overpotential of 300 mV. Moreover, it can mediate oxygen to H2O2 with a high production rate of &#8776;1530&#160;mg L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a flow&#8208;cell reactor. Spectroscopic and computational studies together uncover a BP&#8208;induced surface charge redistribution in CoSe2, which leads to a favorable surface electronic structure that weakens the HOO* adsorption, thus enhancing the kinetics toward H2O2 formation.

         <title>Stability of Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: Existing Issues and Mitigation Strategies Related to Both Material and Device Aspects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Present perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are sensitive to light, humidity, heat, and electric field, and their limited stability constitutes severe bottleneck for display applications. Strategies including structure design, composition adjustment, shell protection, dimensionality control, heat dissipation, and defect passivation, which can be applied to improve the PeLED stability, are reviewed, and future opportunities and challenges are considered.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites combine excellent electronic and optical properties, such as defect tolerance and high photoluminescence efficiency, with the benefits of low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;area, solution&#8208;based processing. Composition&#8208; and dimension&#8208;tunable properties of perovskites have already been utilized in bright and efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). At the same time, there are still great challenges ahead to achieving operational and spectral stability of these devices. In this review, the origins of instability of perovskite materials, and reasons for their degradation in LEDs are considered. Then, strategies for improving the stability of perovskite materials are reviewed, such as compositional engineering, dimensionality control, defect passivation, suitable encapsulation matrices, and fabrication of core/shell perovskite nanocrystals. For improvement of the operational stability of perovskite LEDs, the use of inorganic charge&#8208;transport layers, optimization of charge balance, and proper thermal management are considered. The review is concluded with a detailed account of the current challenges and a perspective on the key approaches and opportunities on how to reach the goal of stable, bright, and efficient perovskite LEDs.

         <title>One&#8208;Phototransistor&#8211;One&#8208;Memristor Array with High&#8208;Linearity Light&#8208;Tunable Weight for Optic Neuromorphic Computing</title>

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;phototransistor&#8211;one&#8208;memristor array is proposed that works as an artificial optic neural network for image recognition. The device shows highly&#160;linear, light&#8208;tunable conductance weight during the online training process of the optic artificial neural network and yields a recognition accuracy of 99.33% after only ten training epochs, indicating the potential in highly efficient optic neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The recent advances in optic neuromorphic devices have led to a subsequent rise in use for construction of energy&#8208;efficient artificial&#8208;vision systems. The widespread use can be attributed to their ability to capture, store, and process visual information from the environment. The primary limitations of existing optic neuromorphic devices include nonlinear weight updates, cross&#8208;talk issues, and silicon process incompatibility. In this study, a highly&#160;linear, light&#8208;tunable, cross&#8208;talk&#8208;free, and silicon&#8208;compatible one&#8208;phototransistor&#8211;one&#8208;memristor (1PT1R) optic memristor is experimentally demonstrated for the implementation of an optic artificial neural network (OANN). For optic image recognition in the experiment, an OANN is constructed using a 16&#160;&#215;&#160;3 1PT1R memristor array, and it is trained on an online platform. The model yields an accuracy of 99.3% after only ten training epochs. The 1PT1R memristor, which shows good performance, demonstrates its ability as an excellent hardware solution for highly efficient optic neuromorphic and edge computing.

         <title>Hydro/Organo/Ionogels: &#8220;Controllable&#8221; Electromagnetic Wave Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy of the co&#8208;contribution of functional polymer frameworks and diverse liquids with strong absorption properties is proposed. These gels show a comprehensive controllability from composition, microstructure, and dielectric properties to electromagnetic wave absorption properties, offering a conceptually novel platform to develop customizable and low&#8208;cost functional absorbers.








Abstract
Demand for electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbers continues to increase with technological advances in wearable electronics and military applications. In this study, a new strategy to overcome the drawbacks of current absorbers by employing the co&#8208;contribution of functional polymer frameworks and liquids with strong EMW absorption properties is proposed. Strongly polar water, dimethyl sulfoxide/water mixtures, and highly conductive 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate ([EMI][ES]) are immobilized in dielectrically inert polymer networks to form different classes of gels (hydrogels, organogels, and ionogels). These gels demonstrate a high correlation between their dielectric properties and polarity/ionic conductivity/non&#8208;covalent interaction of immobilized liquids. Thus, the EMW absorption performances of the gels can be precisely tuned over a wide range due to the diversity and stability of the liquids. The prepared hydrogels show good shielding performance (shielding efficiency &gt; 20&#160;dB) due to the high dielectric constants, while organogels with moderate attenuation ability and impedance matching achieve full&#8208;wave absorption in X&#8208;band (8.2&#8211;12.4&#160;GHz) at 2.5 &#177; 0.5&#160;mm. The ionogels also offer a wide effective absorption bandwidth (10.79&#8211;16.38&#160;GHz at 2.2&#160;mm) via prominent ionic conduction loss. In short, this work provides a conceptually novel platform to develop high&#8208;efficient, customizable, and low&#8208;cost functional absorbers.

         <title>Information Storage Expansion Enabled by a Resilient Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Active Nanocomposite Hydrogel</title>

Abstract
Advanced materials with high performance and distinctive function are one of the main driving forces for the development of human society. The selection of appropriate materials and adequately utilizing their features to apply them in a specific area rationally are of great significance but remain challenging. Herein, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel is developed by introducing a pH&#8208;responsive AIE luminogen (AIEgen) into a Laponite XLS/polyacrylamide&#8208;based NC hydrogel. The AIEgen can protonate to interact with the negatively charged clay through the electrostatic interaction, which results in a drastic fluorescence enhancement due to the restriction of intramolecular motion by the rigid clay to the protonated AIEgen. This behavior facilitates the input of fluorescent information with a high contrast ratio in the hydrogel by acid stimulation. What's more, by utilizing the excellent resilience of the hydrogel, hierarchically inputting and displaying the information in the original and stretched states of the hydrogel film is realized, which achieves information storage expansion and dual&#8208;encryption via switching between stretching and restoring the film. This work showcases fully and synergistically utilizing the superiorities of various advanced materials to achieve superior applications and should guide the future development of advanced materials in emerging areas.

         <title>Controlled Covalent Self&#8208;Assembly of a Homopolymer for Multiscale Materials Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism to induce controlled polymer self&#8208;assembly is reported. By crosslinking a ketone homopolymer, it self&#8208;assembles into nano&#8208; to macroscale materials, which is sorely driven by covalent bonding. The covalent self&#8208;assembly demonstrates exceptionally high levels of processability with a simple protocol compared to non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly. Covalent self&#8208;assembly yields materials which are previously complicated to synthesize.








Abstract
Polymer self&#8208;assembly is a crucial process in materials engineering. Currently, almost all polymer self&#8208;assembly is limited to non&#8208;covalent bonding methods, even though these methods have drawbacks as they require complicated synthesis techniques and produce relatively unstable structures. Here, a novel mechanism of covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly is discovered and employed to address drawbacks of non&#8208;covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly. A simple ketone homopolymer is found to self&#8208;assemble into nano&#8208; to macroscale hydrogels during covalent crosslinking. In contrast to non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly, the covalent self&#8208;assembly is independent of and unaffected by solvent conditions (e.g., polarity and ionic strength) and does not require additional agents, e.g., organic solvents and surfactants. The covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly is subjected to a new mechanism of control by tuning the covalent crosslinking rate. This leads to nanogels with an unprecedented and tightly controlled range of dimensions from less than 10&#160;nm to above 100&#160;nm. Moreover, the crosslinking rate also regulates the assembly behavior of microgels fabricated by microfluidics. The microgels self&#8208;assemble into granular fibers, which is 3D printed into stable porous scaffolds. The novel covalent polymer assembly method has enormous potential to revolutionize multiscale materials fabrication for applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and many other fields.

         <title>Approaching the External Quantum Efficiency Limit in 2D Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy for constructing 2D photovoltaic devices with high performances is demonstrated. The device based on 2D WS2 exhibits nearly ideal external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 92% and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.0%, which are attributed to the defect&#8208;free interface and recombination&#8208;free channel. The nearly ideal EQE provides great potential for PCE approaching the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for realizing ultrathin and high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of most 2D photovoltaic devices face great challenges in exceeding 50% and 3%, respectively, due to the low efficiency of photocarrier separation and collection. Here, this study demonstrates photovoltaic devices with defect&#8208;free interface and recombination&#8208;free channel based on 2D WS2, showing high EQE of 92% approaching the theoretical limit and high PCE of 5.0%. The high performances are attributed to the van der Waals metal contact without interface defects and Fermi&#8208;level pinning, and the fully depleted channel without photocarrier recombination, leading to intrinsic photocarrier separation and collection with high efficiency. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the strategy can be extended to other TMDs such as MoSe2 and WSe2 with EQE of 92% and 94%, respectively. This work proposes a universal strategy for building high&#8208;performance 2D photovoltaic devices. The nearly ideal EQE provides great potential for PCE approaching the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.

         <title>Efficient and Stable 3D/2D Perovskite Solar Cells through Vertical Heterostructures with (BA)4AgBiBr8 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
(BA)4AgBiBr8 2D perovskite nanosheets are used to construct vertical heterostructures with 3D perovskite to serve as a barrier layer to suppress the ion diffusion and nonradiation recombination from 3D perovskite to metal electrode. The performance and stability of perovskite solar cells are simultaneously enhanced after the incorporation of the 2D nanosheets.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have drawn great attention due to their high processability and superior photovoltaic properties. However, their further development is often hindered by severe nonradiative recombination at interfaces that decreases power conversion efficiency (PCE). To this end, a facile strategy to construct a 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to reduce the energy loss in PVSCs is developed. The heterostructure is contrived through the van der Waals integration of 2D perovskite ((BA)4AgBiBr8) nanosheets onto the surface of 3D&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites. The large bandgap of (BA)4AgBiBr8 enables the formation of type&#8208;I heterojunction with 3D&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites, which serves as a barrier to suppress the trap&#8208;assisted recombination at the interface. As a result, a satisfying PCE of 24.48% is achieved with an improved open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.13 to 1.17&#160;V. Moreover, the 2D perovskite nanosheets can effectively mitigate the iodide ion diffusion from perovskite to the metal electrode, hence enhancing the device stability. 3D/2D architectured devices retain &#8776;90% of their initial PCE under continuous illumination or heating after 1000 h, which are superior to 3D&#8208;based devices. This work provides an effective and controllable strategy to construct 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to simultaneously boost the efficiency and stability of PVSCs.

         <title>Challenging Bendable Organic Single Crystal and Transistor Arrays with High Mobility and Durability toward Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area, ultrathin, and highly aligned organic single&#8208;crystal arrays are readily available for flexible electronics through a polymer&#8208;template&#8208;assisted molecular&#8208;assembly strategy. The proposed strategy is shown to be applicable to a variety of semiconductor molecules, demonstrating its effectiveness. The resulting transistor devices exhibit high mobility, low operating voltage, and high bendable durability.








Abstract
Bendable organic single crystals are promising candidates for flexible electronics owing to their superior charge&#8208;transport properties. However, large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality organic single crystals are rarely available on the polymer substrates generally used in flexible electronics. Here, a surface&#8208;assisted assembly strategy based on a polymer modification, poly(amic acid) (PAA), is developed to grow large&#8208;area organic singe crystals on polymer substrates using a simple drop&#8208;casting method. The unique surface properties of PAA that enable molecular solution superwetting and promote molecular ordered assembly produce an extraordinary self&#8208;driven &#8220;meniscus&#8208;guided coating&#8221; behavior, enabling the fabrication of millimeter&#8208;sized, highly aligned organic single crystals for a variety of organic semiconductors. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on a mode molecule of 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophene demonstrate the highest (average) mobility of 18.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (15.9 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), attractively low operating voltage of &#8722;3&#160;V, and high flexible durability. The results shed light on the large&#8208;area fabrication of organic single crystals on polymer dielectrics toward high&#8208;performance and integrated plastic electronics.

         <title>Ultratough Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Bridged Phosphorene Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultratough hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged phosphorene films, which exhibit much higher Young's modulus (316&#160;GPa) than the theoretical value (94&#160;GPa) of black phosphorene, are prepared using the electrochemical intercalation method and further proved by physical characterizations. The underlying mechanism of its excellent mechanical properties is revealed using theoretical calculations.








Abstract
The rapid development of flexible electronic devices, especially based on 2D materials, has triggered the demand for high&#8208;strength materials. Mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer phosphorene with excellent electronic properties has attracted extensive attention. However, phosphorene is affected by its low Young's modulus when applied to flexible electronic devices. Here, a strategy via ion intercalation to significantly improve the mechanical properties of black phosphorus to generate hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged phosphorene films with Young's modulus as high as 316&#160;GPa is reported. This value is several times larger than the theoretical values of 166&#160;GPa in the zigzag direction, 44&#160;GPa in the armchair direction, and the averaged Young's modulus among all directions of 94&#160;GPa. The impact of intercalation on mechanical properties is also explored. Experimental nanoindentation results obtained by atomic force microscopy indicate that the relationship between the ratio of intercalated ions to phosphorus atoms and the corresponding Young's modulus satisfies the formula E=eae&#8722;[ln(x)+b]2c(0&lt;x&#8804;1.80)\[E{\bm{ = }}{e^{a{e^{\frac{{{\bm{ - }}{{[\ln (x){\bm{ + }}b]}^2}}}{c}}}}}(0{\bm{ &amp;lt; }}x{\bm{ \le }}1.80)\]. Furthermore, a flexible NO2 gas sensor device based on this ultratough material presents excellent performance, even after 10&#160;000 bending cycles. The results provide new insight into the potential for practical applications of black phosphorus devices.

         <title>A 2D Nanoradiosensitizer Enhances Radiotherapy and Delivers STING Agonists to Potentiate Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) functions as a potent nanoradiosensitizer and a nanocarrier for agonists of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) for cancer treatment. STING agonists are conjugated onto an MOL via phosphate linkages, resulting in prolonged tumor retention and enhanced STING activation. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade extends the scope of this local treatment to elicit systemic antitumor responses.








Abstract
Despite potent preclinical antitumor activity, activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) has shown modest therapeutic effects in clinical studies. Many STING agonists, including 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), show poor pharmacokinetic properties for sustaining STING activation in tumors and achieving optimal antitumor efficacy. Improved delivery of STING agonists and their effective combination with other treatments are needed to enhance their therapeutic effects. Herein, a 2D nanoplatform, cGAMP/MOL, is reported via conjugating cGAMP to a nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) for simultaneous STING activation and radiosensitization. The MOL not only exhibits strong radiosensitization effects for enhanced cancer killing and induction of immunogenic cell death, but also retains cGAMP in tumors for sustained STING activation. Compared to free cGAMP, cGAMP/MOL elicits stronger STING activation and regresses local tumors upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. Further combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor bridges innate and adaptive immune systems by activating the tumor microenvironment to elicit systemic antitumor responses.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Degradable 3D Microstructures in Aqueous Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoresist for the additive manufacturing technique direct laser writing is realized, which is degradable upon irradiation with visible light (&#955;max&#160;=&#160;415&#8211;435&#160;nm) in water. The degradation of microstructures fabricated using the degradable photoresist is quantified using atomic force microscopy. Multimaterial 3D microstructures that incorporate the degradable material are fabricated.








Abstract
The additive manufacturing technique direct laser writing (DLW), also known as two&#8208;photon laser lithography, is becoming increasingly established as a technique capable of fabricating functional 3D microstructures. Recently, there has been an increasing effort to impart microstructures fabricated using DLW with advanced functionalities by introducing responsive chemical entities into the underpinning photoresists. Herein, a novel photoresist based on the photochemistry of the bimane group is introduced that can be degraded upon exposure to very mild conditions, requiring only water and visible light (&#955;max&#160;=&#160;415&#8211;435&#160;nm) irradiation. The degradation of the microstructures is tracked and quantified using AFM measurements of their height. The influence of the writing parameters as well as the degradation conditions is investigated, unambiguously evidencing effective visible light degradation in aqueous environments. Finally, the utility of the photodegradable resist system is demonstrated by incorporating it into multimaterial 3D microstructures, serving as a model for future applications.

         <title>Molecularly Distorted Local Structure in Bi2CuO4 Oxide to Stabilize Lattice Oxygen for Efficient Formate Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi2CuO4 oxide precatalyst delivers high&#8208;efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion electrocatalysis. Benefiting from the molecularly distorted local structure with [CuO4]6&#8722; square&#8208;planar units rotation, more lattice oxygen can be retained during the electrochemical CO2 reduction process. The retained local lattice oxygen can optimize the adsorption of *OCHO intermediate, thereby promoting the CO2 reduction efficiency.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an economically feasible way for converting green energy into valuable chemical feedstocks and fuels. Great progress has been achieved in the understanding and synthesis of oxidized&#8208;based precatalysts; however, their dynamical changes of local structure under operando conditions still hinder their further applications. Here a molecularly distorted Bi2CuO4 precatalyst for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion is reported. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) results and theoretical calculations suggest that the distorted structure with molecularly like [CuO4]6&#8722; unit rotation is more conducive to the structural stability of the sample. Operando XAFS and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) results prove that quite a bit of lattice oxygen can remain in the distorted sample after CO2RR. Electrochemical measurements of the distorted sample show an excellent activity and selectivity with a high formate partial current density of 194.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an extremely low overpotential of &#8722;400&#160;mV. Further in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the retained oxygen can optimize the adsorption of *OCHO intermediate for the enhanced CO2RR performance.

         <title>Piezoelectricity across 2D Phase Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric responses at 2D&#8208;material phase boundaries are studied and a strong piezoelectric response at the 2H&#8211;1T&#8242; junction is observed, owing to the charge transfer across the semiconducting and metallic junctions, resulting in the formation of dipoles and excess charge density, allowing the engineering of piezoelectric response in atomically thin materials.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity in low&#8208;dimensional materials and metal&#8211;semiconductor junctions has attracted recent attention. Herein, a 2D in&#8208;plane metal&#8211;semiconductor junction made of multilayer 2H and 1T&#8242; phases of molybdenum(IV) telluride (MoTe2) is investigated. Strong piezoelectric response is observed using piezoresponse force microscopy at the 2H&#8211;1T&#8242; junction, despite that the multilayers of each individual phase are weakly piezoelectric. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations suggest that the amplified piezoelectric response observed at the junction is due to the charge transfer across the semiconducting and metallic junctions resulting in the formation of dipoles and excess charge density, allowing the engineering of piezoelectric response in atomically thin materials.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Interfacial Design of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient and Selective Electrocatalysis of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks enable the integration of electron&#8208;conduction and mass&#8208;transport interfaces via one&#8208;pot polycondensation reaction into well&#8208;defined catalytic skeletons, so that the ordered &#960; skeletons promote electron motion and the hydrophobic channels facilitate CO2 delivery to the catalytic centers. The systematic interface design boosts catalytic activity and selectivity to achieve a benchmark electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Assembling molecular catalytic centers into crosslinked networks is widely used to fabricate heterogeneous catalysts but they often suffer loss in activity and selectivity accompanied by unclear causes. Here, a strategy for the construction of heterogeneous catalysts to induce activity and selectivity by bottom&#8208;up introduction of segregated electron&#8208;conduction and mass&#8208;transport interfaces into the catalytic materials is reported. The catalytic skeletons are designed to possess different &#960; orderings for electron motion and the open channels are tailored to install finely engineered walls for mass transport, so that origins of activity and selectivity are correlated. The resultant covalent organic framework catalysts with ordered &#960; skeletons and solvophobic pores increase activity by two orders of magnitude, enhance selectivity and energy efficiency by 70&#8208;fold, and broaden the voltage range, to promote CO2 transformation under ambient conditions. The results open a way to precise interfacial design of actionable heterogeneous catalysts for producing feedstocks from CO2.

         <title>Enabling High&#8208;Voltage &#8220;Superconcentrated Ionogel&#8208;in&#8208;Ceramic&#8221; Hybrid Electrolyte with Ultrahigh Ionic Conductivity and Single Li+&#8208;Ion Transference Number</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique &#8220;superconcentrated ionogel&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic&#8221; electrolyte is newly developed by conglutinating garnet with superconcentrated ionogel. Such electrolyte not only demonstrates a superior ionic conductivity of 1.33 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, but also a large Li+&#8208;ion transference number of 0.89. The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries using this electrolyte reveal excellent cycling performance.








Abstract
High room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivities, large Li+&#8208;ion transference numbers, and good compatibility with both Li&#8208;metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes of the solid electrolytes are the essential requirements for practical solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, a unique &#8220;superconcentrated ionogel&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic&#8221; (SIC) electrolyte prepared by an in situ thermally initiated radical polymerization is reported. Solid&#8208;state static 7Li NMR and molecular dynamics simulation reveal the roles of ceramic in Li+ local environments and transport in the SIC electrolyte. The SIC electrolyte not only exhibits an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 1.33 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, but also a Li+&#8208;ion transference number as high as 0.89, together with a low electronic conductivity of 3.14 &#215; 10&#8722;10 S cm&#8722;1 and a wide electrochemical stability window of 5.5&#160;V versus Li/Li+. Applications of the SIC electrolyte in Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 and Li||LiFePO4 batteries further demonstrate the high rate and long cycle life. This study, therefore, provides a promising hybrid electrolyte for safe and high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A unique &#8220;superconcentrated ionogel-in-ceramic&#8221; electrolyte is newly developed by conglutinating garnet with superconcentrated ionogel. Such electrolyte not only demonstrates a superior ionic conductivity of 1.33 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#160;&#176;C, but also a large Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ion transference number of 0.89. The quasi-solid-state lithium-metal batteries using this electrolyte reveal excellent cycling performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High room-temperature ionic conductivities, large Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ion transference numbers, and good compatibility with both Li-metal anodes and high-voltage cathodes of the solid electrolytes are the essential requirements for practical solid-state lithium-metal batteries. Herein, a unique &#8220;superconcentrated ionogel-in-ceramic&#8221; (SIC) electrolyte prepared by an in situ thermally initiated radical polymerization is reported. Solid-state static &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li NMR and molecular dynamics simulation reveal the roles of ceramic in Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; local environments and transport in the SIC electrolyte. The SIC electrolyte not only exhibits an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 1.33 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25 &#176;C, but also a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ion transference number as high as 0.89, together with a low electronic conductivity of 3.14 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a wide electrochemical stability window of 5.5&#160;V versus Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Applications of the SIC electrolyte in Li||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; batteries further demonstrate the high rate and long cycle life. This study, therefore, provides a promising hybrid electrolyte for safe and high-energy lithium-metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>4D Printing of Freestanding Liquid Crystal Elastomers via Hybrid Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hybrid 4D printing method, which integrates laser&#8208;assisted direct ink writing and Digital Light Processing, is developed to fabricate freestanding liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; with optional structural or removable materials. Various architectures, including hybrid active lattices, active tensegrities, loading&#8208;bearing actuators, and spatial LCE lattices, can be successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) are appealing candidates among active materials for 4D printing, due to their reversible, programmable and rapid actuation capabilities. Recent progress has been made on direct ink writing (DIW) or Digital Light Processing (DLP) to print LCEs with certain actuation. However, it remains a challenge to achieve complicated structures, such as spatial lattices with large actuation, due to the limitation of printing LCEs on the build platform or the previous layer. Herein, a novel method to 4D print freestanding LCEs on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by using laser&#8208;assisted DIW with an actuation strain up to &#8722;40% is proposed. This process is further hybridized with the DLP method for optional structural or removable supports to create active 3D architectures in a one&#8208;step additive process. Various objects, including hybrid active lattices, active tensegrity, an actuator with tunable stability, and 3D spatial LCE lattices, can be additively fabricated. The combination of DIW&#8208;printed functionally freestanding LCEs with the DLP&#8208;printed supporting structures thus provides new design freedom and fabrication capability for applications including soft robotics, smart structures, active metamaterials, and smart wearable devices.

         <title>Bionic Regulators Break the Ecological Niche of Pathogenic Bacteria for Modulating Dysregulated Microbiome in Colitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the specific binding between the mannose&#8208;rich yeast cell wall (YCW) and Escherichia coli strains, a bionic regulator (CaWO4@YCW) is developed to regulate the gut microbiome. CaWO4@YCW can efficiently and precisely reprogram the gut microbiome by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and providing prebiotics, resulting in an extraordinary therapeutic advantage for DSS&#8208;induced colitis.








Abstract
Therapeutic approaches that reprogram the gut microbiome are promising strategies to alleviate and cure inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, abnormal expansion of Escherichia coli during inflammation can promote pathogenic bacteria occupying ecological niches to resist reprogramming of the microbiome. Herein, a bionic regulator (CaWO4@YCW) is developed to efficiently and precisely regulate the gut microbiome by specifically suppressing the abnormal expansion of E. coli during colitis and boosting probiotic growth. Inspired by the binding of E. coli strains to the mannose&#8208;rich yeast cell wall (YCW), YCW is chosen as the bionic shell to encapsulate CaWO4. It is demonstrated that the YCW shell endows CaWO4 with superior resistance to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract and adheres to the abnormally expanded E. coli in colitis, specifically as a positioner. Notably, the high expression of calprotectin at the colitis site triggers the release of tungsten ions through calcium deprivation in CaWO4, thus inhibiting E. coli growth by replacing molybdenum in the molybdopterin cofactor. Moreover, YCW functions as a prebiotic and promotes probiotic growth. Consequently, CaWO4@YCW can efficiently and precisely reprogram the gut microbiome by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and providing prebiotics, resulting in an extraordinary therapeutic advantage for DSS&#8208;induced colitis.

         <title>Achieving Sustainable and Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries by Leaf&#8208;Bioinspired Nanofluidic Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A leaf&#8208;bioinspired electrode configuration with nanofluidic flow is proposed. When applied in K&#63743;CoS2 and K&#63743;S battery systems, the designed sustainable electrodes show advanced steady cycling stability and rapid energy conversion. This biomimetic integrated electrode engineering can enable anisotropic electrolyte flux to achieve regulated surface shielding, which may be a universal way to tackle the shuttle problems facing high&#8208;capacity electrodes.








Abstract
In nature, living systems have evolved integrated structures, matching optimized nanofluidics to adapt to external conditions. In rechargeable batteries, high&#8208;capacity electrodes are often plagued by the crucial and universal bottleneck of dissolution and shuttle of active substance into electrolyte, posing obstacles of inevitable capacity degradation. Introducing the concept of intelligent nanofluidics to electrodes, a leaf&#8208;bioinspired electrode configuration with hierarchical architecture to tackle this problem is proposed. This integrated structure with fine&#8208;tuned surface pores and unobstructed interior porous media, can spatially control the anisotropic nanofluidic flux, in an efficient and self&#8208;protectable way: tailoring the outflow across the electrode's surface and free transport in interior, to ensure speedy and stable energy conversion. As proofs of concept, applications of sustainable electrodes rejuvenated from fallen leaf and spent commercial batteries, are designed with leaf&#8208;bioinspired architecture. Both K&#63743;CoS2 and K&#63743;S battery systems show advanced steady cycling with effectively mitigated shuttle issues in this smart architecture (0.15% and 0.21% capacity decay per cycle), even at high areal mass loading, when compared with open porous structure (0.60% and 0.39%). This work may pave a new way from a biomimetic view to integrated electrode engineering with regulated surface shielding to conquer the universal dissolution&#8211;shuttle problems facing high&#8208;capacity materials.

         <title>Fully Depleted Self&#8208;Aligned Heterosandwiched Van Der Waals Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel metal&#8208;mirror&#8208;enhanced n&#8211;p&#8211;n van der Waals heterostructure is designed. The device exhibits excellent performance including high blackbody photoresponsivity up to 0.77 A W&#8722;1, high specific detectivity of 8.61&#160;&#215;&#160;1010 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 under blackbody radiation, and fast response speed of &#8776;4 &#181;s.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;operating highly sensitive mid&#8208;wavelength&#160;infrared (MWIR) photodetectors are utilized in a large number of important applications, including night vision, communications, and optical radar. Many previous studies have demonstrated uncooled MWIR photodetectors using 2D narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductors. To date, most of these works have utilized atomically thin flakes, simple van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, or atomically thin p&#8211;n junctions as absorbers, which have difficulty in meeting the requirements for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MWIR photodetectors with a blackbody response. Here, a fully depleted self&#8208;aligned MoS2&#8208;BP&#8208;MoS2 vdW heterostructure sandwiched between two electrodes is reported. This new type of photodetector exhibits competitive performance, including a high blackbody peak photoresponsivity up to 0.77&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and low noise&#8208;equivalent power of 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;14&#160;W&#160;Hz&#8722;1/2, in the MWIR region. A peak specific detectivity of 8.61&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;cm Hz1/2&#160;W&#8722;1 under blackbody radiation is achieved at room temperature in the MWIR region. Importantly, the effective detection range of the device is twice that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MWIR photodetectors. Furthermore, the device presents an ultrafast response of &#8776;4&#160;&#181;s both in the visible and short&#8208;wavelength infrared bands.

&lt;p&gt;A novel metal-mirror-enhanced n&#8211;p&#8211;n van der Waals heterostructure is designed. The device exhibits excellent performance including high blackbody photoresponsivity up to 0.77 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, high specific detectivity of 8.61&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; cm Hz&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under blackbody radiation, and fast response speed of &#8776;4 &#181;s.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room-temperature-operating highly sensitive mid-wavelength&#160;infrared (MWIR) photodetectors are utilized in a large number of important applications, including night vision, communications, and optical radar. Many previous studies have demonstrated uncooled MWIR photodetectors using 2D narrow-bandgap semiconductors. To date, most of these works have utilized atomically thin flakes, simple van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, or atomically thin p&#8211;n junctions as absorbers, which have difficulty in meeting the requirements for state-of-the-art MWIR photodetectors with a blackbody response. Here, a fully depleted self-aligned MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-BP-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vdW heterostructure sandwiched between two electrodes is reported. This new type of photodetector exhibits competitive performance, including a high blackbody peak photoresponsivity up to 0.77&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and low noise-equivalent power of 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;14&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;W&#160;Hz&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, in the MWIR region. A peak specific detectivity of 8.61&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm Hz&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under blackbody radiation is achieved at room temperature in the MWIR region. Importantly, the effective detection range of the device is twice that of state-of-the-art MWIR photodetectors. Furthermore, the device presents an ultrafast response of &#8776;4&#160;&#181;s both in the visible and short-wavelength infrared bands. These results provide an ideal platform for realizing broadband and highly sensitive room-temperature MWIR photodetectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rationally Structured Triboelectric Nanogenerator Arrays for Harvesting Water&#8208;Current Energy and Self&#8208;Powered Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paired nanogenerators capable of integrating massively into a thin flexible layer as a structured triboelectric surface are demonstrated for harvesting water&#8208;current energy. Through novel gas packet exchange structure and rigid&#8211;flexible coupling deformation mechanism, the device can work effectively even in deep water with greatly enhanced performance, providing universal strategies to fabricate high&#8208;frequency triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) under large pressure.








Abstract
Water&#8208;current energy is an enormous and widely distributed clean energy in nature, with different scales from large ocean flow to small local turbulence. However, few effective technologies have been proposed to make use of different forms of water currents as a power source. Here, high&#8208;performance paired triboelectric nanogenerators (P&#8208;TENGs) capable of integrating massively into a thin flexible layer as a structured triboelectric surface (STS) are demonstrated for harvesting water&#8208;current energy. Novel gas packet exchange structure and rigid&#8211;flexible coupling deformation mechanism are introduced to ensure that the device can work very effectively even in deep water under high water pressure. The rationally designed TENG array in the STS enables highly efficient power take&#8208;off from the flow. Typically, the STS demonstrates a high&#8208;frequency output up to 57&#160;Hz, largely superior to current TENG devices, and the power density is improved by over 100 times for triboelectric devices harvesting current energy. The flexible STS is capable of attaching to various surfaces or applying independently for self&#8208;powered sensing and underwater power supply, showing great potential for water&#8208;current energy utilization. Moreover, the work also initiates universal strategies to fabricate high&#8208;frequency devices under large environment pressure, which may profoundly enrich the design of TENGs.

         <title>Dynamic Liquid Metal Catalysts for Boosted Lithium Polysulfides Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium&#8211;tin alloy, one of the promising liquid metals at room temperature, is applied to lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries as a novel liquid electrocatalyst with a dynamic feature, which can drastically reduce the activation energy barrier of the lithium polysulfides redox reaction, enhance the overall electrochemical kinetics, and achieve improvement of the specific energy density of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Designing efficient electrocatalysts with high electroconductivity, strong chemisorption, and superior catalytical efficiency to realize rapid kinetics of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion process is crucial for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery applications. Unfortunately, most current electrocatalysts cannot maintain long&#8208;term stability due to the possible failure of catalytic sites. Herein, a novel dynamic electrocatalytic strategy with the liquid metal (i.e., gallium&#8211;tin, EGaSn) to facilitate LiPSs redox reaction is reported. The combined theoretical simulations and microstructure experiment analysis reveal that Sn atoms dynamically distributed in the liquid Ga matrix act as the main active catalytic center. Meanwhile, Ga provides a uniquely dynamic environment to maintain the long&#8208;term integrity of the catalytic system. With the participation of EGaSn, a tailor&#8208;made 2 Ah Li&#8211;S pouch cell with a specific energy density of 307.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is realized. This work opens up new opportunities for liquid&#8208;phase binary alloys as electrocatalysts for high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>3D Printing Flexible Sodium&#8208;Ion Microbatteries with Ultrahigh Areal Capacity and Robust Rate Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prototype of fully 3D&#8208;printed planar flexible sodium&#8208;ion microbatteries is demonstrated with 3D interconnected conductive thick microelectrodes via multilayer printing for ultrahigh areal capacity and robust rate capability, benefiting from the elaborate printable inks and impressive ion/charge&#8208;transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion microbatteries (NIMBs) constructed using low&#8208;cost and abundant raw materials in planar configuration with both cathode and anode on the same substrate hold promise for powering coplanar microelectronics, but are hindered by the low areal capacity owing to the thin microelectrodes. Here, a prototype of planar and flexible 3D&#8208;printed NIMBs is demonstrated with 3D interconnected conductive thick microelectrodes for ultrahigh areal capacity and boosted rate capability. Rationally optimized 3D printable inks with appropriate viscosities and high conductivity allow the multilayer printing of NIMB microelectrodes reaching a very high thickness of &#8776;1200&#160;&#181;m while maintaining effective ion and electron&#8208;transfer pathways in them. Consequently, the 3D&#8208;printed NIMBs deliver superior areal capacity of 4.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 (2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art printed microbatteries. The NIMBs show enhanced rate capability with 3.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and robust long&#8208;term cycle life up to 6000 cycles. Furthermore, the planar NIMB microelectrodes, despite the large thickness, exhibit decent mechanical flexibility under various bending conditions. This work opens a new avenue for the construction of high&#8208;performance NIMBs with thick microelectrodes capable of powering flexible microelectronics.

         <title>Reversible Phase Transition for Durable Formamidinium&#8208;Dominated Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation and growth mechanisms of the phase transition between &#945; and &#948; phase of formamidinium (FA)1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 are proposed. Based on these understandings, the lifetime of FA&#8208;dominated perovskite solar cells is successfully extended under humidity through either heat healing (leads to &#948;&#8208;to&#8208;&#945; phase transition) or continuous 60&#160;&#176;C heating (kinetically stabilized &#945; phase).








Abstract
Phase instability is one of the major obstacles to the wide application of formamidinium (FA)&#8208;dominated perovskite solar cells (PSCs). An in&#8208;depth investigation on relevant phase transitions is urgently needed to explore more effective phase&#8208;stabilization strategies. Herein, the reversible phase&#8208;transition process of FA1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 perovskite between photoactive phase (&#945; phase) and non&#8208;photoactive phase (&#948; phase) under humidity, as well as the reversible healing of degraded devices, is monitored. Moreover, through in situ atomic force microscopy, the kinetic transition between &#945; and &#948; phase is revealed to be the &#8220;nucleation&#8211;growth transition&#8221; process. Density functional theory calculation implies an enthalpy&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;to&#8208;&#948; degradation process during humidity aging and an entropy&#8208;driven &#948;&#8208;to&#8208;&#945; healing process at high temperatures. The &#945; phase of FA1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 can be stabilized at elevated temperature under high humidity due to the increased nucleation barrier, and the resulting non&#8208;encapsulated PSCs retain &gt;90% of their initial efficiency after &gt;1000 h at 60&#160;&#176;C and 60% relative humidity. This finding provides a deepened understanding on the phase&#8208;transition process of FA1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 from both thermodynamics and kinetics points of view, which also presents an effective means to stabilize the &#945; phase of FA&#8208;dominated perovskites and devices for practical applications.

&lt;/i&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are proposed. Based on these understandings, the lifetime of FA-dominated perovskite solar cells is successfully extended under humidity through either heat healing (leads to &#948;-to-&#945; phase transition) or continuous 60&#160;&#176;C heating (kinetically stabilized &#945; phase).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase instability is one of the major obstacles to the wide application of formamidinium (FA)-dominated perovskite solar cells (PSCs). An in-depth investigation on relevant phase transitions is urgently needed to explore more effective phase-stabilization strategies. Herein, the reversible phase-transition process of FA&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cs&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite between photoactive phase (&#945; phase) and non-photoactive phase (&#948; phase) under humidity, as well as the reversible healing of degraded devices, is monitored. Moreover, through in situ atomic force microscopy, the kinetic transition between &#945; and &#948; phase is revealed to be the &#8220;nucleation&#8211;growth transition&#8221; process. Density functional theory calculation implies an enthalpy-driven &#945;-to-&#948; degradation process during humidity aging and an entropy-driven &#948;-to-&#945; healing process at high temperatures. The &#945; phase of FA&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cs&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be stabilized at elevated temperature under high humidity due to the increased nucleation barrier, and the resulting non-encapsulated PSCs retain &amp;gt;90% of their initial efficiency after &amp;gt;1000 h at 60&#160;&#176;C and 60% relative humidity. This finding provides a deepened understanding on the phase-transition process of FA&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cs&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from both thermodynamics and kinetics points of view, which also presents an effective means to stabilize the &#945; phase of FA-dominated perovskites and devices for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spleen&#8208;Targeted Glabridin&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles Regulate Polarization of Monocyte/Macrophage (Mo/M&#966;) for the Treatment of Cerebral Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>

         <dc:description>
Glabridin (Gla)&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPGla&#8208;5k) can selectively deliver Gla to the spleen and regulate the polarization of monocyte/macrophages (Mo/M&#966;). By inhibiting Mo/M&#966; mediated inflammatory damage and enhancing its repairing effect, NPGla&#8208;5k treatment improves nervous system function in mice with cerebral I&#8208;R injury.








Abstract
During cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion (I&#8208;R) injury, the infiltration of monocyte/macrophages (Mo/M&#966;) into the ischemic penumbra causes inflammatory damage but also regulates tissue repair in the penumbra. The regulation and balance of Mo/M&#966; polarization is considered as a potential therapeutic target for treating cerebral I&#8208;R injury. Herein, these findings demonstrate that glabridin (Gla)&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (i.e., NPGla&#8208;5k) can effectively inhibit M1&#8208;polarization and enhance M2&#8208;polarization of Mo/M&#966;. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging shows that NPGla&#8208;5k can selectively accumulate in the spleen following intravenous injection. Spleen&#8208;targeted Cy5&#8208;NPGla&#8208;5k can co&#8208;localize with peripheral macrophages in the penumbra at 24&#160;h after tail&#8208;vein injection. Interestingly, NPGla&#8208;5k treatment can reduce inflammatory damage, protect dying neurons, and improve nervous system function. The protective effect of spleen&#8208;targeted NPGla&#8208;5k against cerebral I&#8208;R injury in mice encourages an exploration of their use for clinical treatment of patients with cerebral I&#8208;R injury.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer&#8208;Particle Electrode Design for Practical Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode with vertically aligned charge&#8208;transport pathways is designed, which address the issue of slow charge transport of common high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity electrodes caused by their high tortuosity and interparticle resistance, and simultaneously realizes a fast&#8208;charging capability and high energy density of Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Efforts to enable fast charging and high energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are hampered by the trade&#8208;off nature of the traditional electrode design: increasing the areal capacity usually comes with sacrificing the fast charge transfer. Here a single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode design is reported, where red&#8208;phosphorus active material is embedded in nanochannels of vertically aligned graphene (red&#8208;P/VAG) assemblies. Such an electrode design addresses the sluggish charge transfer stemming from the high tortuosity and inner particle/electrode resistance of traditional electrode architectures consisting of randomly stacked active particles. The vertical ion&#8208;transport nanochannels and electron&#8208;transfer conductive nanowalls of graphene confine the direction of charge transfer to minimize the transfer distance, and the incomplete filling of nanochannels in the red&#8208;P/VAG composite buffers volume change locally, thus avoiding the variation of electrodes thickness during cycling. The single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode displays a high areal capacity (5.6 mAh cm&#8722;2), which is the highest among the reported fast&#8208;charging battery chemistries. Paired with a high&#8208;loading LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathode, a pouch cell shows stable cycling with high energy and power densities. Such a single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode design can be extended to other advanced battery systems and boost the development of LIBs with fast&#8208;charging capability and high energy density.

         <title>Flat&#8211;Zigzag Interface Design of Chalcogenide Heterostructure toward Ultralow Volume Expansion for High&#8208;Performance Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable interface design strategy is presented that two metal chalcogenides with totally different layer&#8208;morphologies are stacked to form large K+ transport channels, rendering ultralow interlayer expansion. As a proof of concept, the flat&#8211;zigzag MoS2/Bi2S3 heterostructures stacked with zigzag&#8208;morphology Bi2S3 and flat&#8208;morphology MoS2 present an ultralow expansion ratio versus MoS2 and Bi2S3, which deliver an ultrahigh potassium storage capacity.








Abstract
Heterostructure construction of layered metal chalcogenides can boost their alkali&#8208;metal storage performance, where the charge transfer kinetics can be promoted by the built&#8208;in electric fields. However, these heterostructures usually undergo interface separation due to severe layer expansion, especially for large&#8208;size potassium accommodation, resulting in the deconstruction of heterostructures and battery performance fading. Herein, first a stable interface design strategy where two metal chalcogenides with totally different layer&#8208;morphologies are stacked to form large K+ transport channels, rendering ultralow interlayer expansion, is presented. As a proof of concept, the flat&#8211;zigzag MoS2/Bi2S3 heterostructures stacked with zigzag&#8208;morphology Bi2S3 and flat&#8208;morphology MoS2 present an ultralow expansion ratio (1.98%) versus MoS2 (9.66%) and Bi2S3 (9.61%), which deliver an ultrahigh potassium storage capacity of above 600 mAh g&#8722;1 and capacity retention of 76% after 500 cycles, together with the built&#8208;in electric field of heterostructures. Once the heterostructures are used as an anode for potassium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (K&#8208;DIBs), it achieves a superior full&#8208;cell capacity of &#8776;166 mAh g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 71% after 400 cycles, which is an outstanding performance among the reported K&#8208;DIBs. This proposed interface stacking strategy may offer a new way toward stable heterostructure design for metal ions storage and transport applications.

         <title>Eliminating the Micropore Confinement Effect of Carbonaceous Electrodes for Promoting Zn&#8208;Ion Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Zn2+ storage capability of carbonaceous materials is boosted by eliminating the micropore confinement effect and synchronously enhancing the utilization of active sites. Systematic ex situ characterizations coupled with in situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and Raman spectra certify that the excellent Zn2+ storage capability is attributed to the synergistic effect of Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8211; co&#8208;adsorption mechanism and invertible chemical adsorption.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs) are promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage by integrating the attributes of supercapacitors and zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, the insufficient Zn2+&#8208;storage active sites of carbonaceous cathode materials and the mismatch of pore sizes with charge carriers lead to unsatisfactory Zn2+ storage capability. Herein, new insights for boosting Zn2+ storage capability of activated nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon materials (ANHPC&#8208;x) are&#160;reported by effectively eliminating the micropore confinement effect and synchronously elevating the utilization of active sites. Therefore, the best&#8208;performed ANHPC&#8208;2 delivers impressive electrochemical properties for ZICs in terms of excellent capacity (199.1 mAh g&#8722;1), energy density (155.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), and durability (65&#160;000 cycles). Systematic ex situ&#160;characterizations together with in situ&#160;electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and Raman spectra measurements reveal that the remarkable electrochemical performance is assigned to the synergism of the Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8722; co&#8208;adsorption mechanism and reversible chemical adsorption. Furthermore, the ANHPC&#8208;2&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZIC demonstrates excellent electrochemical capability with an ultralong lifespan of up to 100 000 cycles. This work not only provides a promising strategy to improve the Zn2+ storage capability of carbonaceous materials but also sheds lights on charge&#8208;storage mechanism and advanced electrode materials&#8217; design for ZICs toward practical applications.

         <title>Surface Co&#8208;Modification of Halide Anions and Potassium Cations Promotes High&#8208;Rate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface fluorine&#8208;bonded, single potassium&#8208;atom&#8208;modified Cu(111) nanocrystal (K&#8211;F&#8211;Cu&#8211;CO2) is prepared by in situ electrochemical reconstruction of KCuF3 perovskite. The K&#8211;F&#8211;Cu&#8211;CO2 electrocatalyst exhibits a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol partial current density of 423 &#177; 30 mA cm&#8722;2 with corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 52.9 &#177; 3.7%, and a high electrochemical stability at large current densities.








Abstract
The high&#8208;rate electrochemical CO2 conversion to ethanol with high partial current density is attractive but challenging, which requires competing with other reduction products as well as hydrogen evolution. This work demonstrates the in situ reconstruction of KCuF3 perovskite under CO2 electroreduction conditions to fabricate a surface fluorine&#8208;bonded, single&#8208;potassium&#8208;atom&#8208;modified Cu(111) nanocrystal (K&#8211;F&#8211;Cu&#8211;CO2). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the co&#8208;modification of both F and K atoms on the Cu(111) surface can promote the ethanol pathway via stabilization of the C&#63743;O bond and selective hydrogenation of the C&#63742;C bond in the CH2&#63742;CHO* intermediate, while the single modification of either F or K is less effective. The K&#8211;F&#8211;Cu&#8211;CO2 electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol partial current density of 423 &#177; 30 mA cm&#8722;2 with the corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 52.9 &#177; 3.7%, and a high electrochemical stability at large current densities, thus suggesting an attractive means of surface co&#8208;modification of halide anions and alkali&#8208;metal cations on Cu catalysts for high&#8208;rate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol electrosynthesis.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Site Engineering of Defective Fe&#8211;N4 Nanozymes with Boosted Catalase&#8208;Like Performance for Retinal Vasculopathies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Fe&#8208;SANzyme) with defective Fe&#8211;N4 sites is fabricated by edge&#8208;site engineering. The abundant edge&#8208;hosted Fe&#8211;N4 sites endow Fe&#8208;SANzyme with boosted catalase&#8208;like activity, which is significantly higher than the reference with integral Fe&#8211;N4 sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, pathological vascular dysfunction is effectively alleviated in animal models of retinal vasculopathies treated with antioxidant Fe&#8208;SANzyme.








Abstract
Extensive efforts are devoted to refining metal sites for optimizing the catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SANzymes), while the contribution of the defect environment of neighboring metal sites lacks attention. Herein, an iron&#8208;based SANzyme (Fe&#8208;SANzyme) is rationally designed by edge&#8208;site engineering, which intensively exposes edge&#8208;hosted defective Fe&#8211;N4 atomic sites anchored in hierarchical mesoporous structures. The Fe&#8208;SANzyme exhibits excellent catalase&#8208;like activity capable of efficiently catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 and H2O, with a catalytic kinetic KM value superior to that of natural catalase and reported nanozymes. The mechanistic studies depict that the defects introduce notable charge transfer from the Fe atom to the carbon matrix, making the central Fe more activated to strengthen the interaction with H2O2 and weaken the O&#63743;O bond. By performing catalase&#8208;like catalysis, the Fe&#8208;SANzyme significantly scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviates oxidative stress, thus eliminating the pathological angiogenesis in animal models of retinal vasculopathies without affecting the repair of normal vessels. This work provides a new way to refine SANzymes by engineering the defect environment and geometric structure around metal sites, and demonstrates the potential therapeutic effects of the nanozyme on retinal vasculopathies.

         <title>Impact of Side&#8208;Chain Hydrophilicity on Packing, Swelling, and Ion Interactions in Oxy&#8208;Bithiophene Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular dynamics and X&#8208;ray diffraction is used to characterize mixed&#8208;transport conjugated polymers packing, ability to swell, and chelate with ions. It is shown that glycol side chains can induce tilted &#960;&#8208;stacks, allow water flow into the lamellar stack, and form single and double bound chelates.








Abstract
Exchanging hydrophobic alkyl&#8208;based side chains to hydrophilic glycol&#8208;based side chains is a widely adopted method for improving mixed&#8208;transport device performance, despite the impact on solid&#8208;state packing and polymer&#8208;electrolyte interactions being poorly understood. Presented here is a molecular dynamics (MD) force field for modeling alkoxylated and glycolated polythiophenes. The force field is validated against known packing motifs for their monomer crystals. MD simulations, coupled with X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), show that alkoxylated polythiophenes will pack with a &#8220;tilted stack&#8221; and straight interdigitating side chains, whilst their glycolated counterpart will pack with a &#8220;deflected stack&#8221; and an s&#8208;bend side&#8208;chain configuration. MD simulations reveal water penetration pathways into the alkoxylated and glycolated crystals&#8212;through the &#960;&#8208;stack and through the lamellar stack respectively. Finally, the two distinct ways triethylene glycol polymers can bind to cations are revealed, showing the formation of a metastable single bound state, or an energetically deep double bound state, both with a strong side&#8208;chain length dependence. The minimum energy pathways for the formation of the chelates are identified, showing the physical process through which cations can bind to one or two side chains of a glycolated polythiophene, with consequences for ion transport in bithiophene semiconductors.

4D Printing
In article number 2204890, Ruike Renee Zhao, H. Jerry Qi, and co&#8208;workers report a hybrid 4D printing method to fabricate freestanding liquid crystal elastomers &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; by using laser&#8208;assisted direct ink writing. This process is integrated with Digital Light Processing for printing optional structural or sacrificial materials to create active architectures, such as active tensegrities, loading&#8208;bearing actuators, and 3D liquid crystal lattices, in a one&#8208;step additive process.

In article number 2205324, Zhenglin Yang, Xiyun Yan, Kelong Fan, and co&#8208;workers report a high&#8208;performance catalase&#8208;like iron single&#8208;atom nanozyme prepared by edge&#8208;site engineering. Hierarchical mesoporous and edge&#8208;hosted atomic sites are formed during the pyrolysis process, enabling efficient catalytic decomposition of H2O2 into O2 and H2O. Based on the catalase&#8208;like activity, effective treatment of retinal vasculopathies is realized by intravitreal administration of the nanozyme.

Covalent Polymer Self&#8208;Assembly
In article number 2109701, Yang Shi and co&#8208;workers introduce a new mechanism of polymer self&#8208;assembly via covalent bonding. The covalent approach uses a homopolymer and simple protocols but shows much better robustness and controllability than non&#8208;covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly. The new strategy builds up hierarchical nano&#8208; to macroscale materials.

The covalent approach uses a homopolymer and simple protocols but shows much better robustness and controllability than non-covalent polymer self-assembly. The new strategy builds up hierarchical nano- to macroscale materials.

         <title>Isolating Single and Few Atoms for Enhanced Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 39, September 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts have become an attractive frontier in the field of catalysis. The latest advances in synthesis strategies, local environment regulation, and catalytic applications, covering single&#8208;atom, dual&#8208;atom, and atomic cluster catalysts, are reviewed, while practical solutions to inspire the microenvironment regulation of active sites in the isolated few atom systems are provided.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts have triggered great interest in the field of catalysis owing to their unique features. Isolated single or few metal atoms can be anchored on substrates via chemical bonding or space confinement to maximize atom utilization efficiency. The key challenge lies in precisely regulating the geometric and electronic structure of the active metal centers, thus significantly influencing the catalytic properties. Although several reviews have been published on the preparation, characterization, and application of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the comprehensive understanding of SACs, dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), and atomic clusters has never been systematically summarized. Here, recent advances in the engineering of local environments of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SACs, DACs, and atomic clusters for enhanced catalytic performance are highlighted. Firstly, various synthesis approaches for SACs, DACs, and atomic clusters are presented. Then, special attention is focused on the elucidation of local environments in terms of electronic state and coordination structure. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary of isolated single and few atoms for the applications of thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis is provided. Finally, the potential challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field are presented. This review will pave the way to regulate the microenvironment of the active site for boosting catalytic processes.

         <title>Recent Progress in 1D Contacts for 2D&#8208;Material&#8208;Based Devices</title>

         <dc:description>
Van der Waals gap&#8208;free 1D contacts to 2D materials, toward their large&#8208;scale application to 2D electronic and quantum devices, are reviewed. 1D edge contacts enable low contact resistivity, scattering&#8208;free carrier transport, high&#8208;density transistor integration, and double&#8208;gate transistor operation. In addition, an outlook of the 1D contact methods is presented.








Abstract
Recent studies have intensively examined 2D materials (2DMs) as promising materials for use in future quantum devices due to their atomic thinness. However, a major limitation occurs when 2DMs are in contact with metals: a van der Waals (vdW) gap is generated at the 2DM&#8208;metal interfaces, which induces metal&#8208;induced gap states that are responsible for an uncontrollable Schottky barrier (SB), Fermi&#8208;level pinning (FLP), and high contact resistance (RC), thereby substantially lowering the electronic mobility of 2DM&#8208;based devices. Here, vdW&#8208;gap&#8208;free 1D edge contact is reviewed for use in 2D devices with substantially suppressed carrier scattering of 2DMs with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation. The 1D contact further enables uniform carrier transport across multilayered 2DM channels, high&#8208;density transistor integration independent of scaling, and the fabrication of double&#8208;gate transistors suitable for demonstrating unique quantum phenomena of 2DMs. The existing 1D contact methods are reviewed first. As a promising technology toward the large&#8208;scale production of 2D devices, seamless lateral contacts are reviewed in detail. The electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices developed via 1D contacts are subsequently discussed. Finally, the challenges regarding the reliability of 1D contacts are addressed, followed by an outlook of 1D contact methods.

         <title>Puffball&#8208;Inspired Microrobotic Systems with Robust Payload, Strong Protection, and Targeted Locomotion for On&#8208;Demand Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by features of natural puffball fungi, including a fruitbody to store trillions of spores and a barrier cap to provide payload protection and stimuli&#8208;triggered release, a bioinspired microrobotic system with an internal chamber and near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive sealing layer is presented for drug delivery. The microrobots show robust payload capacity, strong payload protection, on&#8208;demand release, and targeted locomotion.








Abstract
Microrobots are recognized as transformative solutions for drug delivery systems (DDSs) because they can navigate through the body to specific locations and enable targeted drug release. However, their realization is substantially limited by insufficient payload capacity, unavoidable drug leakage/deactivation, and strict modification/stability criteria for drugs. Natural puffballs possess fascinating features that are highly desirable for DDSs, including a large fruitbody for storing spores, a flexible protective cap, and environmentally triggered release mechanisms. This report presents a puffball&#8208;inspired microrobotic system which incorporates an internal chamber for loading large drug quantities and spatial drug separation, and a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive top&#8208;sealing layer offering strong drug protection and on&#8208;demand release. These puffball&#8208;inspired microrobots (PIMs) display tunable loading capacities up to high concentrations and enhanced drug protection with minimal drug leakage. Upon near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, on&#8208;demand drug delivery with rapid release efficiency is achieved. The PIMs also demonstrate translational motion velocities, switchable motion modes, and precise locomotion under a rotating magnetic field. This work provides strong proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a DDS that combines the superior locomotion capability of microrobots with the unique characteristics of puffballs, thereby illustrating a versatile avenue for development of a new generation of microrobots for targeted drug delivery.

         <title>Triclinic Metamaterials by Tristable Origami with Reprogrammable Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring full anisotropy (triclinic symmetry) of material microstructures can lead to surprising discoveries. A class of origami&#8208;inspired triclinic metamaterials is proposed, which couples shear and normal strains, and leads to reversible auxeticity, in the changing triclinic frame. In the tessellation, linear and point defects emerge as a result of geometric frustration, which can be reprogrammed into distinct frustrated material states.








Abstract
Geometrical&#8208;frustration&#8208;induced anisotropy and inhomogeneity are explored to achieve unique properties of metamaterials that set them apart from conventional materials. According to Neumann's principle, to achieve anisotropic responses, the material unit cell should possess less symmetry. Based on such guidelines, a triclinic metamaterial system of minimal symmetry is presented, which originates from a Trimorph origami pattern with a simple and insightful geometry: a basic unit cell with four tilted panels and four corresponding creases. The intrinsic geometry of the Trimorph origami, with its changing tilting angles, dictates a folding motion that varies the primitive vectors of the unit cell, couples the shear and normal strains of its extrinsic bulk, and leads to an unusual Poisson effect. Such an effect, associated with reversible auxeticity in the changing triclinic frame, is observed experimentally, and predicted theoretically by elegant mathematical formulae. The nonlinearities of the folding motions allow the unit cell to display three robust stable states, connected through snapping instabilities. When the tristable unit cells are tessellated, phenomena that resemble linear and point defects emerge as a result of geometric frustration. The frustration is reprogrammable into distinct stable and inhomogeneous states by arbitrarily selecting the location of a single or multiple point defects. The Trimorph origami demonstrates the possibility of creating origami metamaterials with symmetries that are hitherto nonexistent, leading to triclinic metamaterials with tunable anisotropy for potential applications such as wave propagation control and compliant&#160;microrobots.

A new acceptor of FTCC&#63743;Br and frequently&#8208;used ITCC is studied, due to their similar optical and electrochemistry properties. Under a light intensity of 1000 lux, the PB2:ITCC&#8208;based device with a small electrostatic potential (ESP) offset gives a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.4%, while the PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br&#8208;based device with a large ESP offset achieves a record PCE of 30.2%.

The correlation between molecular structure and photovoltaic performance is lagging for constructing high&#8208;performance indoor organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Herein, this relationship is investigated in depth by employing two medium&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). The newly synthesized NFA of FTCC&#63743;Br exhibits a similar bandgap and molecular energy level, but a much stronger dipole moment and larger average electrostatic potential (ESP) compared with ITCC. After blending with the polymer donor PB2, the PB2:ITCC and PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br blends exhibit favorable bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphologies and the same driving force, but the PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br blend exhibits a large ESP difference. In OPV cells, the PB2:ITCC&#8208;based device produces a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.0%, whereas the PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br&#8208;based device gives an excellent PCE of 14.8% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.05&#160;V, which is the highest value among OPV cells with VOC values above 1.0&#160;V. When both acceptor&#8208;based devices work under a 1000 lux of 3000 K light&#8208;emitting diode, the PB2:ITCC&#8208;based 1 cm2 device yields a good PCE of 25.4%; in contrast, the PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br&#8208;based 1 cm2 device outputs a record PCE of 30.2%. These results suggest that a large ESP offset in photovoltaic materials is important for achieving high&#8208;performance OPV cells.

         <title>Roughness Suppression in Electrochemical Nanoimprinting of Si for Applications in Silicon Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel chip&#8208;scale near&#8208;infrared optics requires scalable fabrication of 3D&#160;freeform nano&#8208; and microstructures in silicon. This manuscript investigates the origin of silicon roughening during metal&#8208;assisted electrochemical nanoimprinting and minimizes it to levels comparable with plasma etching. Functional imprinted rib waveguides on silicon&#8208;on&#8208;insulator wafers are demonstrated, paving the way for its broad use to micromachine 3D photonic devices at scale.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;assisted electrochemical nanoimprinting (Mac&#8208;Imprint) scales the fabrication of micro&#8208; and nanoscale 3D freeform geometries in silicon and holds the promise to enable novel chip&#8208;scale optics operating at the near&#8208;infrared spectrum. However, Mac&#8208;Imprint of silicon concomitantly generates mesoscale roughness (e.g., protrusion size&#160;&#8776;45&#160;nm) creating prohibitive levels of light scattering. This arises from the requirement to coat stamps with nanoporous gold catalyst that, while sustaining etchant diffusion, imprints its pores (e.g., average diameter&#160;&#8776;42&#160;nm) onto silicon. In this work, roughness is reduced to sub&#8208;10&#160;nm levels, which is in par with plasma etching, by decreasing pore size of the catalyst via dealloying in far&#8208;from equilibrium conditions. At this level, single&#8208;digit nanometric details such as grain&#8208;boundary grooves of the catalyst are imprinted and attributed to the resolution limit of Mac&#8208;Imprint, which is argued to be twice the Debye length (i.e., 1.7&#160;nm)&#8212;a finding that broadly applies to metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching. Last, Mac&#8208;Imprint is employed to produce single&#8208;mode rib&#8208;waveguides on pre&#8208;patterned silicon&#8208;on&#8208;insulator wafers with root&#8208;mean&#8208;square line&#8208;edge roughness less than 10&#160;nm while providing depth uniformity (i.e., 42.9&#160;&#177;&#160;5.5&#160;nm), and limited levels of silicon defect formation (e.g., Raman peak shift&#160;&lt;&#160;0.1&#160;cm&#8722;1) and sidewall scattering.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic PtRhBiSnSb Nanoplates for Highly Efficient Alcohol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy PtRhBiSnSb intermetallic nanoplates with intrinsically isolated Pt/Rh/Bi/Sn/Sb atoms are successfully constructed via a one&#8208;pot method. Benefiting from the synergism of the chosen five elements, these well&#8208;defined PtRhBiSnSb intermetallic nanoplates achieve ultrahigh performance toward the electrochemical oxidation of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol in alkaline electrolytes, emerging as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multifunctional electrocatalyst for the alcohol oxidation reactions.








Abstract
The control of multimetallic ensembles at the atomic&#8208;level is challenging, especially for high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) possessing five or more elements. Herein, the one&#8208;pot synthesis of hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed (hcp) PtRhBiSnSb high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoplates with intrinsically isolated Pt, Rh, Bi, Sn, and Sb atoms is reported, to boost the electrochemical oxidation of liquid fuels. Taking advantage of these combined five metals, the well&#8208;defined PtRhBiSnSb HEI nanoplates exhibit a remarkable mass activity of 19.529, 15.558, and 7.535 A mg&#8722;1Pt+Rh toward the electrooxidation of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol in alkaline electrolytes, respectively, representing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multifunctional electrocatalyst for alcohol oxidation reactions. In particular, the PtRhBiSnSb HEI achieves record&#8208;high methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity in an&#160;alkaline environment. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the introduction of the fifth metal Rh enhances the electron&#8208;transfer efficiency in PtRhBiSnSb HEI nanoplates, which contributes to the improved oxidation capability. Meanwhile, robust electronic structures of the active sites are achieved due to the synergistic protections from Bi, Sn, and Sb sites. This work offers significant research advances in developing well&#8208;defined HEA with delicate control over compositions and properties.

         <dc:description>
Ambipolar transport and nonvolatile programming of MoTe2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) are exploited to enable a low&#8208;power, compact, and multibit digital modulator, which can be used in internet&#8208;of&#8208;things edge communication.








Abstract
Energy, area, and bandwidth efficient communication primitives are essential to sustain the rapid increase in connectivity among internet&#8208;of&#8208;things (IoT) edge devices. While IoT edge&#8208;sensing, edge&#8208;computing, and edge&#8208;storage have witnessed innovation in materials and devices, IoT edge communication is yet to experience such transformation. The aging silicon (Si)&#8208;based complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology continues to remain the mainstay of communication devices where they are used to implement amplitude, frequency, and phase shift keying (amplitude&#8208;shift keying [ASK]/frequency&#8208;shift keying [FSK]/phase&#8208;shift keying [PSK]). Keying allows digital information to be communicated over a radio channel. While CMOS&#8208;based keying devices have evolved over the years, their hardware footprint and energy consumption are major concerns for resource constrained IoT communication. Furthermore, separate circuit designs and hardware elements are needed for each keying scheme and achieving multibit modulation to improve bandwidth efficiency remains a challenge. Here, a reconfigurable modulator is introduced that exploits unique ambipolar transport and programmable Dirac voltage in ultrathin MoTe2 field&#8208;effect transistors to achieve ASK, FSK, and PSK modulation. Furthermore, by integrating two programmed MoTe2 field&#8208;effect transistors, multibit data modulation is demonstrated, which improves the bandwidth efficiency by 200%. Finally, a frequency quadrupler is also realized exploiting the unique &#8220;double&#8208;well&#8221; transfer characteristic.

         <title>Ion Migration Mechanism: An Overall Understanding of Anionic Redox Activity in Metal Oxide Cathodes of Li/Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted extensive attention in recent years due to its potential to enhance the reversible capacity of cathode materials in Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). However, the understanding of its activation mechanism is still limited by the insufficient mastering of the underlying thermodynamics and kinetics. In this work, a series of Mg/Li/Zn&#8208;substituted NaxMnO2 and LixMnO2 cathode materials are designed to investigate their ARR behaviors. It is found that ARR can be activated in only Li&#8208;substituted LixMnO2 but not for Mg and Zn&#8208;substituted ones, while all Mg/Li/Zn&#8208;substituted NaxMnO2 cathode materials exhibit ARR activities. Combining ab initio calculations with experimental XRD refinements, such a huge difference between Li and Na cathodes, with Mg substituted compounds as a proof of concept, was revealed to be closely related to the migration of Mg2+ from the transition metal (TM) layer to the alkali metal (AM) layer in a kinetic aspect. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration of Mg2+ ions can merely occur in the Na compound but not in Li one, thus generating unique Na&#8208;O&#8208;&#9633;TM and/or &#9633;Na&#8208;O&#8208;&#9633;TM configurations and reducing reaction activation energy to trigger the ARR. Based on these findings, an ion migration mechanism is proposed for the first time to explain the different ARR behaviors between the NaxMnO2 and LixMnO2, which can not only reveal the origin of ARR in the kinetic aspect, but also provide a new insight for the development of high&#8208;capacity metal oxide cathode materials for LIBs/SIBs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted extensive attention in recent years due to its potential to enhance the reversible capacity of cathode materials in Li/Na-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). However, the understanding of its activation mechanism is still limited by the insufficient mastering of the underlying thermodynamics and kinetics. In this work, a series of Mg/Li/Zn-substituted Na&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode materials are designed to investigate their ARR behaviors. It is found that ARR can be activated in only Li-substituted Li&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but not for Mg and Zn-substituted ones, while all Mg/Li/Zn-substituted Na&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode materials exhibit ARR activities. Combining ab initio calculations with experimental XRD refinements, such a huge difference between Li and Na cathodes, with Mg substituted compounds as a proof of concept, was revealed to be closely related to the migration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from the transition metal (TM) layer to the alkali metal (AM) layer in a kinetic aspect. The out-of-plane migration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions can merely occur in the Na compound but not in Li one, thus generating unique Na-O-&#9633;&lt;sub&gt;TM&lt;/sub&gt; and/or &#9633;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;-O-&#9633;&lt;sub&gt;TM&lt;/sub&gt; configurations and reducing reaction activation energy to trigger the ARR. Based on these findings, an ion migration mechanism is proposed for the first time to explain the different ARR behaviors between the Na&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which can not only reveal the origin of ARR in the kinetic aspect, but also provide a new insight for the development of high-capacity metal oxide cathode materials for LIBs/SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electro&#8208;thermal Characterization of Dynamical VO2 Memristors via Local Activity Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Translating the surging interest in neuromorphic electronic components, such as those based on nonlinearities near Mott transitions, into large&#8208;scale commercial deployment faces steep challenges in the current lack of means to identify and design key material parameters. These issues are exemplified by the difficulties in connecting measurable material properties to device behavior via circuit element models. Here we use the principle of Local Activity to build a model of VO2 / SiN Mott threshold switches by sequentially accounting for constraints from a minimal set of quasi&#8208;static and dynamic electrical and high spatial resolution thermal data obtained via in&#8208;situ thermoreflectance mapping. By combining independent data sets for devices with varying dimensions, we distill the model to measurable material properties and established device scaling laws. The model can accurately predict electrical and thermal conductivities and capacitances and locally active dynamics (especially persistent spiking self&#8208;oscillations). The systematic procedure by which we develop this model has been a missing link in predictively connecting neuromorphic device behavior with their underlying material properties, and should enable rapid screening of material candidates before employing expensive manufacturing processes and testing procedures.

         <title>Functional Coating from Amyloid Superwetting Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tailoring the hydrophilicity of solid surfaces with a strong affinity to water has been extensively explored in the last 20 years, but studies have been limited to the single function of wettability. Here, we extend the multifunctional properties of tailored surface films from exhibiting superwettability to facilitating biological activities. We show that amyloid fibrils can be universally coated onto various substrates, such as fabrics (non&#8208;woven organic masks), metal meshes, polyethersulfone (PES), glass and more, endowing the resulting surfaces with excellent performance in oil/water mixture and emulsion separation, antifouling, and antifogging. Moreover, the biocompatible crosslinked amyloid fibrils coatings can serve as a platform for biocatalytic activities by immobilizing enzymes, as we show in the ABTS oxidation and RB5 degradation by laccase from Trametes versicolor. The study provides a universal approach to modifying surface morphology and chemical properties via fibrous protein templates, opening the way to unexplored bio&#8208;based applications and functionalities.

         <title>A Calcium Fluoride Nanozyme for Ultrasound&#8208;Amplified and Ca2+&#8208;Overload&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct valence&#8208;invariable CaF2 nanozyme with ultrasound&#8208;enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity is rationally designed and engineered for efficient Ca2+&#8208;overload&#8208;enhanced catalytic tumor nanotherapy, which is the first paradigm of Ca&#8208;based nanozymes for catalytic cancer treatment.








Abstract
The anticancer mechanism of nanozymes is dominantly associated with the capacity for generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by the valence change of metal elements. However, very little research is focused on and has achieved the exploration and development of enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities of valence&#8208;invariable metal compounds. Herein, a distinct valence&#8208;invariable calcium fluoride (CaF2) nanozyme with ultrasound (US)&#8208;enhanced peroxidase (POD)&#8208;mimicking activity is rationally designed and engineered for efficient calcium (Ca2+)&#8208;overload&#8208;enhanced catalytic tumor nanotherapy, which is the first paradigm of Ca&#8208;based nanozymes for catalytic cancer treatment. The release of exogenous Ca2+ ions from CaF2 nanocrystals and deleterious ROS generation derived from US&#8208;amplified POD&#8208;mimicking properties facilitate intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and achieve Ca2+&#8208;overload&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction through introducing exogenous Ca2+ ions and regulating calcium&#8208;pumping channels of neoplastic cells. Especially, US as an exogenous energy input is capable of substantially amplifying POD&#8208;mimicking catalytic activities of CaF2 nanozyme, ultimately achieving efficient anti&#8208;neoplastic outcome on both 4T1 breast tumor and H22 hepatic carcinoma animal models. Such a discovery of enzyme&#8208;like activity of valence&#8208;invariable metal compounds can broaden the cognition scope of nanozymes and effectively serves the field of catalytic and chemoreactive nanomedicine.

         <title>Advances on Thermally Conductive Epoxy&#8208;Based Composites as Electronic Packaging Underfill Materials&#8212;A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Underfill materials with high thermal conductivity play crucial roles in ensuring the reliability and performance of microelectronic devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances that have been made to meet the key requirements of capillary underfill materials are reviewed. Perspectives and an outlook for designing high&#8208;performance underfill materials with novel microstructures in electronic packaging are provided.








Abstract
The integrated circuits industry has been continuously producing microelectronic components with ever higher integration level, packaging density, and power density, which demand more stringent requirements for heat dissipation. Electronic packaging materials are used to pack these microelectronic components together, help to dissipate heat, redistribute stresses, and protect the whole system from the environment. They serve an important role in ensuring the performance and reliability of the electronic devices. Among various packaging materials, epoxy&#8208;based underfills are often employed in flip&#8208;chip packaging. However, widely used capillary underfill materials suffer from their low thermal conductivity, unable to meet the growing heat dissipation required of next&#8208;generation IC chips with much higher power density. Many strategies have been proposed to improve the thermal conductivity of epoxy, but its application as underfill materials with complex performance requirements is still difficult. In fact, optimizing the combined thermal&#8211;electrical&#8211;mechanical&#8211;processing properties of underfill materials for flip&#8208;chip packaging remains a great challenge. Herein, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances that have been made to satisfy the key requirements of capillary underfill materials are reviewed. Based on these studies, the perspectives for designing high&#8208;performance underfill materials with novel microstructures in electronic packaging for high&#8208;power density electronic devices are provided.

Cu&#8208;ion dissolution in copper fluoride (CuF2) cathodes is successfully suppressed by in&#160;situ formation of a Cu2+&#8208;coordinated sodium alginate&#160;layer on the surface of CuF2&#160;nanoparticles during the electrode&#8208;fabrication, which can selectively enable the transportation of Li ions while blocking the mobility of Cu ions, reduce the undesirable interaction between electrolyte/electrode interface, and thus improving the cyclic stability of CuF2.








Abstract
Copper fluoride (CuF2) has the highest energy density among all metal fluoride cathodes owing to its high theoretical potential (3.55&#160;V) and high capacity (528&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). However, CuF2&#160;can only survive for less than five cycles, mainly due to serious Cu&#8208;ion dissolution during charge/discharge cycles. Herein, copper dissolution is successfully suppressed by forming Cu2+&#8208;coordinated sodium alginate (Cu&#8208;SA) on the surface of CuF2&#160;particles during the electrode fabrication process, by using water as a slurry solvent and sodium alginate (SA) as a binder. The trace dissolved Cu2+ in water from CuF2&#160;can in situ cross&#8208;link with SA binder forming a conformal Cu&#8208;SA layer on CuF2&#160;surface. After water evaporation during the electrode dry process, the Cu&#8208;SA layer is Li&#8208;ion conductor but Cu2+ insulator, which can effectively suppress the dissolution of Cu&#8208;ions in the organic 4&#160;m LiClO4/ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolyte, enhancing the reversibility of CuF2. CuF2&#160;electrode with SA binder delivers a reversible capacity of 420.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;after 50&#160;cycles at 0.05&#160;C, reaching an energy density of 1009.1&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8208;1. Cu2+ cross&#8208;link polymer coating on CuF2&#160;opens the door for stabilizing the high&#8208;energy and low&#8208;cost CuF2&#160;cathode for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Intrinsic (Trap&#8208;Free) Transistors Based on Epitaxial Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic (trap&#8208;free) field&#8208;effect transistors based on epitaxial single&#8208;crystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite films are reported. Extensive structural, electrical, and gated Hall&#8208;effect characterization confirms outstanding quality of the material and a nearly ideal transistor behavior. Hole mobility of 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature, monotonically increasing on cooling to 250 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at 50 K, is measured in these transistors.








Abstract
The first experimental realization of the intrinsic (not dominated by defects) charge conduction regime in lead&#8208;halide perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) is reported. The advance is enabled by: i) a new vapor&#8208;phase epitaxy technique that results in large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystalline cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) films with excellent structural and surface properties, including atomically flat surface morphology, essentially free from defects and traps at the level relevant to device operation; ii) an extensive materials analysis of these films using a variety of thin&#8208;film and surface probes certifying the chemical and structural quality of the material; and iii) the fabrication of nearly ideal (trap&#8208;free) FETs with characteristics superior to any reported to date. These devices allow the investigation of the intrinsic FET and (gated) Hall&#8208;effect carrier mobilities as functions of temperature. The intrinsic mobility is found to increase on cooling from &#8776;30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature to &#8776;250 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at 50 K, revealing a band transport limited by phonon scattering. Establishing the intrinsic (phonon&#8208;limited) mobility provides a solid test for theoretical descriptions of carrier transport in perovskites, reveals basic limits to the technology, and points to a path for future high&#8208;performance perovskite electronic devices.

         <title>A Unique NiOOH@FeOOH Heteroarchitecture for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution in Saline Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiOOH@FeOOH heteroarchitecture shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 292&#160;mV to drive the current density of 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. An unconventional dual&#8208;sites mechanism is proposed to address the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process on NiOOH@FeOOH and show that the FeOOH underlayer plays a critical role on the enhanced OER activity of NiOOH.








Abstract
The development of highly efficient non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in low&#8208;grade or saline water is currently of great importance for the large&#8208;scale production of hydrogen. In this study, by using an electrochemical activation pretreatment, metal oxy(hydroxide) nanosheet structures derived from self&#8208;supported nickel&#8211;iron phosphide and nitride nanoarrays grown on Ni foam are successfully fabricated for OER catalysis in saline water. It is demonstrated that the different NiOOH and NiOOH@FeOOH (NiOOH grown on FeOOH) structures are generated from nickel&#8211;iron nitride and phosphide, respectively, after electrochemical activation. In particular, the NiOOH@FeOOH heteroarchitecture shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 292&#160;mV to drive the current density of 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. An unconventional dual&#8208;sites mechanism (UDSM) is proposed to address the OER process on NiOOH@FeOOH and show that the FeOOH underlayer plays a critical role regarding the enhanced OER activity of NiOOH. The new possible UDSM involving two reaction sites presents a different understanding of the OER process on multi&#8208;OH layer complexes, which is expected to guide the design of heteroarchitecture electrocatalysts.

         <title>Nanochitin and Nanochitosan: Chitin Nanostructure Engineering with Multiscale Properties for Biomedical and Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanochitins have recently attracted attention as a source of advanced green materials. Recent advances in molecular&#8208; and nanoscience have enabled the development of chitin nanostructures exhibiting physicochemical and biological properties depending on the length scale. This review summarizes new perspectives in developing sustainable advanced functional materials based on nanochitins with multiscale properties.








Abstract
Nanochitin and nanochitosan (with random&#8208;copolymer&#8208;based multiscale architectures of glucosamine and N&#8208;acetylglucosamine units) have recently attracted immense attention for the development of green, sustainable, and advanced functional materials. Nanochitin and nanochitosan are multiscale materials from small oligomers, rod&#8208;shaped nanocrystals, longer nanofibers, to hierarchical assemblies of nanofibers. Various physical properties of chitin and chitosan depend on their molecular&#8208; and nanostructures; translational research has utilized them for a wide range of applications (biomedical, industrial, environmental, and so on). Instead of reviewing the entire extensive literature on chitin and chitosan, here, recent developments in multiscale&#8208;dependent material properties and their applications are highlighted; immune, medical, reinforcing, adhesive, green electrochemical materials, biological scaffolds, and sustainable food packaging are discussed considering the size, shape, and assembly of chitin nanostructures. In summary, new perspectives for the development of sustainable advanced functional materials based on nanochitin and nanochitosan by understanding and engineering their multiscale properties are described.

         <title>Doping Engineering in the MoS2/SnSe2 Heterostructure toward High&#8208;Rejection&#8208;Ratio Solar&#8208;Blind UV Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The staggered large band offset heterojunction based on MoS2 and SnSe2 is an ideal structure for the separation of photogenerated carriers. Combined with doping engineering, a photodetector based on the doped MoS2/SnSe2 heterostructure exhibits excellent solar&#8208;blind UV photoresponse ability compared to the pure MoS2/SnSe2 heterostructure. The rejection ratio is significantly improved by about five orders of magnitude.








Abstract
The intentionally designed band alignment of heterostructures and doping engineering are keys to implement device structure design and device performance optimization. According to the theoretical prediction of several typical materials among the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and group&#8208;IV metal chalcogenides, MoS2 and SnSe2 present the largest staggered band offset. The large band offset is conducive to the separation of photogenerated carriers, thus MoS2/SnSe2 is a theoretically ideal candidate for fabricating photodetector, which is also verified in the experiment.

In terms of the photoelectric performance evaluation, the rejection ratio R254/R532 of the photodetector based on doped MoS2/SnSe2 is five orders of magnitude higher than that of pure MoS2/SnSe2, while the response time is obviously optimized by 3 orders. The results demonstrate that the combination of band alignment and doping engineering provides a new pathway for constructing SBUV photodetectors.

&lt;p&gt;The staggered large band offset heterojunction based on MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SnSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an ideal structure for the separation of photogenerated carriers. Combined with doping engineering, a photodetector based on the doped MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SnSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure exhibits excellent solar-blind UV photoresponse ability compared to the pure MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SnSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure. The rejection ratio is significantly improved by about five orders of magnitude.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Mismatch&#8208;Driven Small&#8208;Angle Moir&#233; Twists in Epitaxially Grown 2D Vertical Layered Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epitaxially grown vertical layered heterostructures (VLHs) of mixed 2D layered materials are often thought to align without angular misorientation. However, it is shown that high&#8208;mismatch VLHs show discrete and sometimes non&#8208;zero twist angles dependent on their natural lattice mismatch value. This opens a pathway for scalable Moire VLH systems.








Abstract
Artificially introduced small twist angles at the interfaces of vertical layered heterostructures (VLHs) have allowed deterministic tuning of electronic and optical properties such as strongly correlated electronic phases and Moir&#233; excitons. But creating a Moir&#233; twist in van der Waals (vdWs) systems by manual stacking is challenging in reproducibility, uniformity, and accuracy of the twist angle, which hinders future studies. Here, it is demonstrated that contrary to the commonly believed 0&#176;&#8208;orientation in vdWs epitaxy, these VLHs show small twist angles controlled by the low&#8208;order commensurate phase with low energy and local atomic relaxation. A commensurate multilevel map is proposed to predict possible orientations. Remarkably, high&#8208;mismatch VLHs show discrete and sometimes non&#8208;zero twist angles dependent on their natural mismatch value. Such framework is experimentally confirmed in five epitaxially grown VLHs under high&#8208;angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), and can provide significant insights for large&#8208;scale engineering of twist angle in VLHs.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Sieve Electrolyte Membrane enables Separator&#8208;Free Zinc Batteries with Ultralong Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular&#8208;sieves&#8208;based electrolyte membranes are designed to regulate the activity of water, and inhibit dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution on the Zn anode, which greatly prolongs the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The poor stability of the zinc&#8208;metal anode is a main bottleneck for practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a series of molecular sieves with various channel sizes are investigated as an electrolyte host to regulate the ionic environment of Zn2+ on the surface of the zinc anode and to realize separator&#8208;free batteries. Based on the ZSM&#8208;5 molecular sieve, a solid&#8211;liquid mixed electrolyte membrane is constructed to uniformize the transport of zinc ions and foster dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. Side reactions can also be suppressed through tailoring the solvation sheath and restraining the activity of water molecules in electrolyte. A V2O5||ZSM&#8208;5||Zn full cell shows significantly enhanced performance compared to cells using glass fiber separator. Specifically, it exhibits a high specific capacity of 300 mAh g&#8722;1, and a capacity retention of 98.67% after 1000 cycles and 82.67% after 3000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. It is attested that zeolites (ZSM&#8208;5, H&#8208;&#946;, and Bate) with channel sizes of 5&#8211;7 &#197; result in best cycle stability. Given the low cost and recyclability of the ZSM and its potent function, this work may further lower the cost and boost the industrial application of AZIBs.

         <title>Multifaceted Catalytic ROS&#8208;Scavenging via Electronic Modulated Metal Oxides for Regulating Stem Cell Fate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electronic modulated metal oxide via Mn&#8208;atom substitutions in Co3O4 (Mn&#8208;Co3O4) is synthesized for reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging and regulating stem cells fates. The experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that Mn&#8208;Co3O4 displays excellent intrinsic and broad&#8208;spectrum catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging activities, which can efficiently protect mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from ROS attack, reverse the apoptotic fates, and rescue their functions in oxidative stress microenvironments.








Abstract
Developing reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging nanostructures to protect and regulate stem cells has emerged as an intriguing strategy for promoting tissue regeneration, especially in trauma microenvironments or refractory wounds. Here, an electronic modulated metal oxide is developed via Mn atom substitutions in Co3O4 nanocrystalline (Mn&#8208;Co3O4) for highly efficient and multifaceted catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging to reverse the fates of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in oxidative&#8208;stress microenvironments. Benefiting from the atomic Mn&#8208;substitution and charge transfer from Mn to Co, the Co site in Mn&#8208;Co3O4 displays an increased ratio of Co2+/Co3+ and improved redox properties, thus enhancing its intrinsic and broad&#8208;spectrum catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging activities, which surpasses most of the currently reported metal oxides. Consequently, the Mn&#8208;Co3O4 can efficiently protect the MSCs from ROS attack and rescue their functions, including adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. This work not only establishes an efficient material for catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics but also provides a new avenue to design biocatalytic metal oxides via modulation of electronic structure.

         <title>Isolating Contiguous Ir Atoms and Forming Ir&#8208;W Intermetallics with Negatively Charged Ir for Efficient NO Reduction by CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The lack of efficient catalysts with a wide working temperature window and vital O2 and SO2 resistance for selective catalytic reduction of NO by CO (CO&#8208;SCR) largely hinders its implementation. Here a novel Ir&#8208;based catalyst with only 1 wt% Ir loading is reported for efficient CO&#8208;SCR. In this catalyst, contiguous Ir atoms are isolated into single atoms, and Ir&#8208;W intermetallic nanoparticles are formed, which are supported on ordered mesoporous SiO2 (KIT&#8208;6). Notably, this catalyst enabled complete NO conversion to N2 at 250&#176;C in the presence of 1% O2 and had a wide temperature window (250&#8211;400&#176;C), outperforming the comparison samples with Ir isolated&#8208;single&#8208;atomic&#8208;sites and Ir nanoparticles, respectively. Also, it possessed a high SO2 tolerance. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that single Ir atoms are negatively charged, dramatically enhancing the NO dissociation, while the Ir&#8208;W intermetallic nanoparticles accelerate the reduction of the N2O and NO2 intermediates by CO.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable, Highly&#8208;Efficient Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Polymer Donors Featuring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Spacers</title>

Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs), consisting of all stretchable layers, are attracting significant attention as a future power source for wearable electronics. However, most of the efficient active layers for OSCs are mechanically brittle due to their rigid molecular structures designed for high electrical and optical properties. Here, we develop a series of new polymer donors (PDs, PhAmX) featuring phenyl amide (PhAm)&#8208;based flexible spacer (FS) inducing hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) interactions. These PDs enable IS&#8208;OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.73% and excellent stretchability (PCE retention &gt; 80% of the initial value at 32% strain), representing the best performances among the reported IS&#8208;OSCs to date. The incorporation of PhAm&#8208;based FS enhances the molecular ordering of PDs as well as their interactions with a Y7 acceptor, enhancing the mechanical stretchability and electrical properties simultaneously. We also find that in rigid OSCs, the PhAm5:Y7 blend achieves a much higher PCE of 17.5% compared to that of the reference PM6:Y7 blend. The impact of the PhAm&#8208;FS linker on the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of OSCs is thoroughly investigated.

         <title>low&#8208;fouling zwitterionic polymeric colloids as resuscitation fluids for hemorrhagic shock</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloids, known as volume expanders, have been used as resuscitation fluids for hypovolemic shock for decades, as they increase plasma oncotic pressure and expand intravascular volume. However, recent studies show that commonly used synthetic colloids have adverse interactions with human biological systems. In this work, we design a low&#8208;fouling amine(N)&#8208;oxide based zwitterionic polymer as an alternative volume expander with improved biocompatibility and efficacy. We demonstrate that the polymer possesses anti&#8208;fouling ability, resisting cell interaction and deposition in major organs, and is rapidly cleared via renal filtration and hepatic circulation, reducing the risk of long&#8208;term side effects. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies showed an absence of adverse effects on hemostasis or any acute safety risks. Finally, we show that, in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head comparison with existing colloids and plasma, the zwitterionic polymer serves as more potent oncotic agents for restoring intravascular volume in a hemorrhagic shock model. Our design of N&#8208;oxide&#8208;based zwitterionic polymers may lead to the development of alternative fluid therapies to treat hypovolemic shocks and to improve fluid management in general.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Structure Dynamics of Nanocrystals Revealed by In&#8208;Situ and Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanocrystals are of great importance in material sciences and industry. Engineering nanocrystals with desired structures and properties is no doubt one of the most important challenges in the field, which requires deep insight into atomic&#8208;scale dynamics of nanocrystals during the process. The rapid developments of in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), especially environmental TEM have revealed insights into nanocrystals to digest. According to the considerable progress based on in&#8208;situ electron microscopy, we will give a comprehensive review on nanocrystal dynamics from three aspects: nucleation and growth, structure evolution, and dynamics in reaction conditions. In the nucleation and growth part, we organize existing nucleation theories and growth pathways based on liquid and gas&#8208;solid phases. In the structure evolution part, we focus on in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the evolution, including defects, phase, and disorder/order transitions. In the part of dynamics in reaction conditions, we discuss solid&#8208;solid and gas&#8208;solid interfaces of nanocrystals in atmosphere and correlate the structure&#8208;property relationship. Even though impressive progress has been made, additional efforts are required to develop the integrated and operando TEM methodologies for unveiling nanocrystal dynamics with high spatial, energy, and temporal resolutions.

         <title>Revisiting the Design Strategies for Metasurfaces: Fundamental Physics, Optimization, and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Over the last two decades, the capabilities of metasurfaces in light modulation with subwavelength thickness have been proven, and metasurfaces are expected to miniaturize conventional optical components and add various functionalities. In this review article, various metasurface design strategies are reviewed thoroughly. First, we revisit the scalar diffraction theory to provide the basic principle of light propagation. Then, we discuss widely used design methods based on the unit&#8208;cell approach. The methods include a set of simplified steps, including the phase map retrieval and meta&#8208;atom unit&#8208;cell design. Then, we introduce recently emerging metasurfaces that may not be accurately designed using unit&#8208;cell approach. We examine unconventional metasurfaces where the conventional design methods fail and finally discuss potential design methods for such metasurfaces.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Zirconium&#8208;Based Perovskites for Large&#8208;Area and Ultraflexible X&#8208;ray Scintillator Screens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite Cs2ZrCl6 is employed to fabricate large&#8208;area flexible X&#8208;ray scintillator screens. Joint experiment&#8211;theory characterizations indicate the broadband emission of Cs2ZrCl6 originates from the triplet emission of self&#8208;trapped excitons. The thermally activated delayed fluorescence feature of Cs2ZrCl6 provides a large Stokes shift and supports luminescence collection. The flexible scintillator screen achieves high&#8208;quality imaging of non&#8208;flat and dynamic objects.








Abstract
Flexible scintillator screens with environmental stability, high sensitivity, and low cost have emerged as candidates for X&#8208;ray imaging applications. Here, a large&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;efficient solution synthesis of the vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite Cs2ZrCl6, which is characterized by thermal activation delayed fluorescence (TADF) dominated by triplet emission under X&#8208;ray irradiation, is demonstrated. The large Stokes shift and efficient luminescence collection of TADF effectively ensure the light outcoupling efficiency. Further, flexible X&#8208;ray scintillator screens with an area of 400 cm2 are prepared using poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as the carrier, exhibiting&#160;excellent scintillation properties with light yields as high as 49&#160;400 photons MeV&#8722;1, spatial resolutions up to 18 lp mm&#8722;1 and detection limits as low as 65 nGy s&#8722;1. Finally, the high&#8208;quality imaging results of non&#8208;planar and dynamic objects by such screens are demonstrated. It is believed that the explored Cs2ZrCl6@PDMS flexible scintillator screens would offer a big step toward expanding the application range of scintillators in different environments.

         <title>50C Fast&#8208;Charge Li&#8208;Ion Batteries using a Graphite Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical kinetics for Li+ transport will be dramatically enhanced by the rational design of electrolytes with low &#916;Edsv of Li+, high ionic conductivities, as well as the ability to form thin and robust solid electrolyte interphase on the graphite surfaces. Following the criterion, 50C fast&#8208;charge Li&#8208;ion batteries using graphite anode are successfully developed.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries have made inroads into the electric vehicle market with high energy densities, yet they still suffer from slow kinetics limited by the graphite anode. Here, electrolytes enabling extreme fast charging (XFC) of a microsized graphite anode without Li plating are designed. Comprehensive characterization and simulations on the diffusion of Li+ in the bulk electrolyte, charge&#8208;transfer process, and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) demonstrate that high ionic conductivity, low desolvation energy of Li+, and protective SEI are essential for XFC. Based on the criterion, two fast&#8208;charging electrolytes are designed: low&#8208;voltage 1.8&#160;m LiFSI in 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (for LiFePO4||graphite cells) and high&#8208;voltage 1.0&#160;m LiPF6 in a mixture of 4&#8208;fluoroethylene carbonate and acetonitrile (7:3 by vol) (for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||graphite cells). The former electrolyte enables the graphite electrode to achieve 180 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50C (1C = 370 mAh g&#8722;1), which is 10 times higher than that of a conventional electrolyte. The latter electrolyte enables LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||graphite cells (2 mAh cm&#8722;2, N/P ratio = 1) to provide a record&#8208;breaking reversible capacity of 170 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4C charge and 0.3C discharge. This work unveils the key mechanisms for XFC and provides instructive electrolyte design principles for practical fast&#8208;charging LIBs with graphite anodes.

         <title>Mechanically Induced Nanoscale Architecture Endows a Titanium Carbide MXene Electrode with Integrated High Areal and Volumetric Capacitance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Worm&#8208;like expanded titanium carbide MXene powders are synthesized in highly viscous reaction media and form binder&#8208;free densely packed electrodes under mechanical compression of 300&#160;MPa. Buckling of the MXene stacks and intrinsic intercalation structure translate to the hierarchical architecture at the nanoscale which brings excellent performance in both areal and volumetric capacitances.








Abstract
Complete utilization of electrochemically active materials while maintaining the high areal/volumetric packing density is a goal to be achieved in miniaturized supercapacitor devices, which therefore display both high volumetric and areal energy density. Although critical, it is usually challenging to achieve this goal by optimizing the electrode architecture. Dense packing of active materials maximizes the volumetric capacitance but&#160;also results in sluggish diffusion of the electrolyte. Structurization of the electrode by forming large pores creates a pathway for electrolyte penetration but reduces the volumetric energy density. Here, densified electrodes with hierarchical porous architecture at the nanoscale are reported, which provide an alternative solution. Worm&#8208;like expanded titanium carbide MXene powders are produced in highly viscous reaction media and assembled by mechanical compression. The expanded morphology of the MXene powders translates into a buckling microstructure in the electrodes, resulting in 28.2 &#177; 4.1% porosity mainly in the form of nanosized pores. At the sub&#8208;nanometer scale, the diffusion of electrolytes is enhanced in interlayer space of the bended lattice with pillared intercalants. These hierarchical structural features lead to both high areal and volumetric capacitance (11.4&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;2 coupled with 770&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3) in hundred&#8208;micrometers&#8208;thick electrodes, which inspires the design of high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage devices.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Engineered Nonporous Copper(I) Coordination Polymer Nanoplatform for Cuproptosis&#8208;Based Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;engineered cupreous nanomaterial capable of inducing cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;based synergistic therapy in cancer cells is reported, which may invigorate studies pursuing rational design of effective cancer therapy strategies based on cuproptosis.








Abstract
Cuproptosis, a newly identified form of regulated cell death that is copper&#8208;dependent, offers great opportunities for exploring the use of copper&#8208;based nanomaterials inducing cuproptosis for cancer treatment. Here, a glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;engineered nonporous copper(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate ([Cu(tz)]) coordination polymer (CP) nanoplatform, denoted as GOx@[Cu(tz)], for starvation&#8208;augmented cuproptosis and photodynamic synergistic therapy is developed. Importantly, the catalytic activity of GOx is shielded in the nonporous scaffold but can be &#8220;turned on&#8221; for efficient glucose depletion only upon glutathione (GSH) stimulation in cancer cells, thereby proceeding cancer starvation therapy. The depletion of glucose and GSH sensitizes cancer cells to the GOx@[Cu(tz)]&#8208;mediated cuproptosis, producing aggregation of lipoylated mitochondrial proteins, the target of copper&#8208;induced toxicity. The increased intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, due to the oxidation of glucose, activates the type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy of GOx@[Cu(tz)]. The in vivo experimental results indicate that GOx@[Cu(tz)] produces negligible systemic toxicity and inhibits tumor growth by 92.4% in athymic mice bearing 5637 bladder tumors. This is thought to be the first report of a cupreous nanomaterial capable of inducing cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;based synergistic therapy in bladder cancer, which should invigorate studies pursuing rational design of efficacious cancer therapy strategies based on cuproptosis.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Engineered Multifunctional Graphene&#8211;Glass Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser processing of graphene oxide on a plastic substrate covered by glass makes chemical transformations, mass transfer, and integration into the glass. This new and scalable technology can revolutionize glass electronics by making devices more robust, free&#8208;form, and cheaper than ever before.








Abstract
Glass electronics inspire the emergence of smart functional surfaces. To evolve this concept to the next level, developing new strategies for scalable, inexpensive, and electrically conductive glass&#8208;based robust nanocomposites is crucial. Graphene is an attractive material as a conductive filler; however, integrating it firmly into a glass with no energy&#8208;intensive sintering, melting, or harsh chemicals has not been possible until now. Moreover, these methods have very limited capability for fabricating robust patterns for electronic circuits. In this work, a conductive (160&#160;O&#937; sq&#8722;1) and resilient nanocomposite between glass and graphene is achieved via single&#8208;step laser&#8208;induced backward transfer (LIBT). Beyond conventional LIBT involving mass transfer, this approach simultaneously drives chemical transformations in glass including silicon compound formation and graphene oxide (GO) reduction. These processes take place together with the generation and transfer of the highest&#8208;quality laser&#8208;reduced GO (rGO) reported to date (Raman intensity ratio ID/IG&#160;= 0.31) and its integration into the glass. The rGO&#8208;LIBT nanocomposite is further functionalized with silver to achieve a highly sensitive (10&#8722;9&#160;m) dual&#8208;channel plasmonic optical and electrochemical sensor. Besides the electrical circuit demonstration,&#160;an electrothermal heater is fabricated that reaches&#160;temperatures above 300&#160;&#176;C and continuously operates&#160;for over 48&#160;h.

The two key interfaces in flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) are mechanically reinforced simultaneously: one between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the 3D metal halide perovskite (MHP) thin film using self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM), and the other between the 3D&#8208;MHP thin film and the hole transport layer (HTL) using an in situ&#8208;grown low&#8208;dimensional (LD) MHP capping layer. The interfacial mechanical properties are measured and modeled. This rational interface engineering results in not only enhancement of the mechanical properties of both interfaces but also of their optoelectronic properties holistically. As a result, the new class of dual&#8208;interface reinforced f&#8208;PSCs have an unprecedented combination of the following three important performance parameters: high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.03% (with reduced hysteresis), enhanced operational stability of 1,000&#160;h T90 (duration at 90% initial PCE retained), and enhanced mechanical reliability of 10,000 cycles n88 (number of bending cycles at 88% initial PCE retained). The scientific underpinnings of these synergistic enhancements are elucidated.

         <title>Prospects for Simultaneously Capturing Carbon Dioxide and Harvesting Water from Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capturing carbon dioxide alongside water in direct air capture (DAC) operations can alleviate water stress while also providing net negative greenhouse gas emissions. The immense volumes of air processed by DAC units suggest that significant quantities of water can be removed alongside carbon dioxide. Material and process considerations toward realizing this enticing target are critically discussed.








Abstract
Mitigation of anthropogenic climate change is expected to require large&#8208;scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal strategies. Prominent among these strategies is direct air capture with sequestration (DACS), which encompasses the removal and long&#8208;term storage of atmospheric CO2&#160;by purely engineered means. Because it does not require arable land or copious amounts of freshwater, DACS is already attractive in the context of sustainable development, but opportunities to improve its sustainability still exist. Leveraging differences in the chemistry of CO2&#160;and water adsorption within porous solids, here, the prospect of simultaneously removing water alongside CO2&#160;in direct air capture operations is investigated. In many cases, the co&#8208;adsorbed water can be desorbed separately from chemisorbed CO2&#160;molecules, enabling efficient harvesting of water from air. Depending upon the material employed and process conditions, the desorbed water can be of sufficiently high purity for industrial, agricultural, or potable use and can thus improve regional water security. Additionally, the recovered water can offset a portion of the costs associated with DACS. In this Perspective, molecular&#8208; and process&#8208;level insights are combined to identify routes toward realizing this nascent yet enticing concept.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Scale Integration Design of Sn&#8211;ZnO Catalyst toward Efficient and Stable CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To increase the energy efficiency while maintaining long durability of catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to CO, a dual&#8208;scale delicate design of a non&#8208;noble Sn&#8211;ZnO active interface inserted into nanopores of high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon nanospheres, through d&#8208;bandwidth tuning of Sn and ZnO at the electronic scale, and local environment regulation from the nanoconfinement effect of tailored nanopores, is reported.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO is a potential sustainable strategy for alleviating CO2 emission and producing valuable fuels. In the quest to resolve its current problems of low&#8208;energy efficiency and insufficient durability, a dual&#8208;scale design strategy is proposed by implanting a non&#8208;noble active Sn&#8211;ZnO heterointerface inside the nanopores of high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon nanospheres (Sn&#8211;ZnO@HC). The metal d&#8208;bandwidth tuning of Sn and ZnO alters the extent of substrate&#8211;molecule orbital mixing, facilitating the breaking of the *COOH intermediate and the yield of CO. Furthermore, the confinement effect of tailored nanopores results in a beneficial pH distribution in the local environment around the Sn&#8211;ZnO nanoparticles and protects them against leaching and aggregating. Through integrating electronic and nanopore&#8208;scale control, Sn&#8211;ZnO@HC achieves a quite low potential of &#8722;0.53&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with 91% Faradaic efficiency for CO and an ultralong stability of 240 h. This work provides proof of concept for the multiscale design of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Building a Self&#8208;Adaptive Protective Layer on Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes to Enhance the Cycle Stability of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slide&#8208;ring polymer featuring high elasticity and self&#8208;adaptive ability is designed to improve the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries via relieving the cracks of cathode particles and retarding parasitic interfacial side reactions during cycling.








Abstract
Layered Ni&#8208;rich lithium transition metal oxides are promising battery cathodes due to their high specific capacity, but their poor cycling stability due to intergranular cracks in secondary particles restricts their practical applications. Surface engineering is an effective strategy for improving a cathode's cycling stability, but most reported surface coatings cannot adapt to the dynamic volume changes of cathodes. Herein, a self&#8208;adaptive polymer (polyrotaxane&#8208;co&#8208;poly(acrylic acid)) interfacial layer is built on LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2. The polymer layer with a slide&#8208;ring structure exhibits high toughness and can withstand the stress caused by particle volume changes, which can prevent the cracking of particles. In addition, the slide&#8208;ring polymer acts as a physicochemical barrier that suppresses surface side reactions and alleviates the dissolution of transition metallic ions, which ensures stable cycling performance. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared cathode shows significantly improved long&#8208;term cycling stability in situations in which cracks may easily occur, especially under high&#8208;rate, high&#8208;voltage, and high&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Sieving Janus Separator toward Planar Electrodeposition for Deeply Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus separator is constructed to continuously regulate the Zn(002) planar electrodeposition on the surface of a&#160;Zn anode and provide single&#8208;ion channels for Zn2+ ions to suppress side reactions. This work provides new insights to stabilize metal anodes (e.g., Li, Na, K, Zn, Al, Ca, and Mg) in rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
The irregular and random electrodeposition of zinc has emerged as a non&#8208;negligible barrier for deeply rechargeable aqueous zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), yet traditional texture regulation of the Zn substrate cannot continuously induce uniform Zn deposition. Here, a Janus separator is constructed via parallelly grown graphene sheets modified with sulfonic cellulose on one side of the commercial glass fiber separator through the spin&#8208;coating technique. The Janus separator can consistently regulate Zn growth toward a locked crystallographic orientation of Zn(002) texture to intercept dendrites. Furthermore, the separator can spontaneously repel SO42&#8722; and anchor H+ while allowing effective transport of Zn2+ to alleviate side reactions. Accordingly, the Zn symmetric cell harvests a long&#8208;term lifespan over 1400&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/10 mAh cm&#8722;2 and endures stable cycling over 220&#160;h even at a high depth of discharge (DOD) of 56%. The Zn/carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8211;MnO2 cell achieves an outstanding capacity retention of 95% at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 1900 cycles. Furthermore, the Zn/NH4V4O10 pouch cell with a Janus separator delivers an initial capacity of 178 mAh g&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of 87.4% after 260 cycles. This work provides a continuous regulation approach to achieve crystallographic homogeneity of the Zn anode, which can be suitable for other metal batteries.

         <title>Engineering the Ni&#63743;N&#63743;C Catalyst Microenvironment Enabling CO2 Electroreduction with Nearly 100% CO Selectivity in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The working microenvironment of electrocatalysts influences the activity and selectivity. In this work, the working microenvironment of a structurally engineered Ni&#63743;N&#63743;C catalyst for acidic CO2 electrolysis is probed and optimized by adding hydrophobic poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) nanoparticles in the catalytic layer of a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode. The PTFE&#8208;modified electrode displays substantially decreased overpotential, nearly 100% CO selectivity, and outstanding water&#8208;flooding&#8208;resistant ability.








Abstract
CO2 electrolysis in acid has emerged as a promising route to achieve high CO2 utilization due to the inhibition of undesired carbonate formation that generally occurs in alkaline or neutral conditions. However, the efficiency and stability of this system need to be further improved through tailoring of the electrocatalyst and its working environment. Here, a working microenvironment of structurally engineered Ni&#63743;N&#63743;C catalyst for acidic CO2 electrolysis is probed and optimized by adding hydrophobic poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) nanoparticles in the catalytic layer of gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. The PTFE&#8208;modified electrode delivers nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at an industry&#8208;relevant current density of 250&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and a high single&#8208;pass CO2 utilization of 75.7% at a current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under 20 sccm CO2 gas flow rate. Moreover, compared to a conventional electrode without added PTFE, the PTFE&#8208;modified electrode exhibits a substantially enhanced water&#8208;flooding&#8208;resistant ability. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a moderate PTFE modification can optimize the local CO2/H2O ratio in the catalytic layer, favoring the reduction of the diffusion layer thickness and the formation of a highly active and stable solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas interfacial microenvironment.

         <title>Experimental Realization of a Superdispersion&#8208;Enabled Ultrabroadband Terahertz Cloak</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Invisibility has been a topic of long&#8208;standing interest, but still faces an open challenge of narrow bandwidth. In this work, it is found that by judiciously harnessing the material dispersion, one can significantly increase the bandwidth of a cloak. As a proof of concept, an ultrabroadband terahertz carpet cloak is experimentally demonstrated in both time&#8208; and frequency&#8208;domain systems. The work presents a feasible invisibility strategy that is closer to practical applications.








Abstract
Invisibility has been a topic of long&#8208;standing interest owing to the advent of metamaterials and transformation optics, but still faces open challenges after its tremendous development in recent decades. One of the big challenges is the narrow bandwidth, as the realization of an invisibility cloak is usually based on a metamaterial&#8212;an artificial composite material composed of subwavelength resonator structures that are always associated with dispersion. Different from previous works that have tried to eliminate the material dispersion to enhance the bandwidth of an&#160;invisibility cloak, here, it is found that by judiciously harnessing the material dispersion, the bandwidth of the cloak can still be significantly increased. Interestingly, the material dispersion does not violate the law of causality. As a proof of concept, an ultrabroadband terahertz (THz) carpet cloak is experimentally demonstrated through an array of superdispersive microparticles, rendering the target object invisible to detection by both time&#8208; and frequency&#8208;domain wideband systems. The work presents a feasible invisibility strategy that is closer to practical applications and may pave a brand&#8208;new way for the development of dispersion&#8208;dominated ultrabroadband metadevices.

         <title>Shaping 90 wt% NanoMOFs into Robust Multifunctional Aerogels Using Tailored Bio&#8208;Based Nanofibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sustainable material strategy is reported to fabricate wet&#8208;stable, mechanically robust, and elastic multifunctional nanoMOF&#8208;CNF aerogels with the highest reported nanoMOF loading of 90&#160;wt%, enabled by high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cationic CNFs. The carbonized and non&#8208;carbonized aerogels are effectively demonstrated for water purification, CO2 and CH4 gas storage and separation, flame retardancy, and energy storage.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid porous crystalline networks with tunable chemical and structural properties. However, their excellent potential is limited in practical applications by their hard&#8208;to&#8208;shape powder form, making it challenging to assemble MOFs into macroscopic composites with mechanical integrity. While a binder matrix enables hybrid materials, such materials have a limited MOF content and thus limited functionality. To overcome this challenge, nanoMOFs are combined with tailored same&#8208;charge high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) to manufacture robust, wet&#8208;stable, and multifunctional MOF&#8208;based aerogels with 90 wt% nanoMOF loading. The porous aerogel architectures show excellent potential for practical applications such as efficient water purification, CO2 and CH4 gas adsorption and separation, and fire&#8208;safe insulation. Moreover, a one&#8208;step carbonization process enables these aerogels as effective structural energy&#8208;storage electrodes. This work exhibits the unique ability of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CNFs to bind large amounts of nanoMOFs in structured materials with outstanding mechanical integrity&#8212;a quality that is preserved even after carbonization. The demonstrated process is simple and fully discloses the intrinsic potential of the nanoMOFs, resulting in synergetic properties not found in the components alone, thus paving the way for MOFs in macroscopic multifunctional composites.

         <title>In Situ Characterization of the Protein Corona of Nanoparticles In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most standard characterization techniques cannot capture the subtle complexity of the protein corona. A novel approach using differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) on a simple fluorescence microscope makes possible simultaneous measurements of protein adsorption, particle size, and fractal dimension of aggregates. The new insights obtained from this technique shed light on the protein corona (PC) complexity within in vitro and in vivo setups.








Abstract
A new theoretical framework that enables the use of differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) in fluorescence imaging mode to quantify in situ protein adsorption onto nanoparticles (NP) while simultaneously monitoring for NP aggregation is proposed. This methodology is used to elucidate the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the protein corona (PC) in vitro and in vivo. The results show that protein adsorption triggers particle aggregation over a wide concentration range and that the formed aggregate structures can be quantified using the proposed methodology. Protein affinity for polystyrene (PS) NPs is observed to be dependent on particle concentration. For complex protein mixtures, this methodology identifies that the PC composition changes with the dilution of serum proteins, demonstrating a Vroman effect never quantitatively assessed in situ on NPs. Finally, DDM allows monitoring of the evolution of the PC in vivo. This results show that the PC composition evolves significantly over time in zebrafish larvae, confirming the inherently dynamic nature of the PC. The performance of the developed methodology allows to obtain quantitative insights into nano&#8208;bio interactions in a vast array of physiologically relevant conditions that will serve to further improve the design of nanomedicine.

         <title>Manipulating Offense and Defense Signaling to Fight Cold Tumors with Carrier&#8208;Free Nanoassembly of Fluorinated Prodrug and siRNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new carrier&#8208;free delivery platform consisting of doxorubicin (DOX), melittin (MPI), and anti&#8208;TOX small interfering RNA (thymocyte selection&#8208;associated high mobility group box protein, TOX) is designed as an &#8220;offense&#160;and&#160;defense&#8221; signaling manipulator to fight &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. Such a novel system represents an accessible delivery platform and promising strategy to produce potent immune response through synergistically regulating T&#8208;cell infiltration and exhaustion.








Abstract
Chemoimmunotherapy has shown great potential to activate an immune response, but the immunosuppressive microenvironment associated with T cell exhaustion remains a challenge in cancer therapy. The proper immune&#8208;modulatory strategy to provoke a robust immune response is to simultaneously regulate T&#8208;cell exhaustion and infiltration. Here, a new kind of carrier&#8208;free nanoparticle is developed to simultaneously deliver chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin, DOX), cytolytic peptide (melittin, MPI), and anti&#8208;TOX small interfering RNA (thymocyte selection&#8208;associated high mobility group box protein, TOX) using a fluorinated prodrug strategy. In this way, the enhanced immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by the combination of DOX and MPI can act as &#8220;offense&#8221; signaling to increase CD8+ T&#8208;cell infiltration, while the decreased TOX expression interfered with siTOX can serve as &#8220;defense&#8221; signaling to mitigate CD8+ T&#8208;cell exhaustion. As a result, the integration of DOX, MPI, and siTOX in such a bifunctional system produced a potent antitumor immune response in liver cancer and metastasis, making it a promising delivery platform and effective strategy for converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones.

         <title>Accurate Wavelength Tracking by Exciton Spin Mixing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for wavelength tracking from a simple single&#8208;pixel sensor is presented. The concept is based on the excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent spin mixing ratio of a blended film comprising organic room&#8208;temperature phosphors and colloid quantum dots, and can discriminate wavelength shifts below 1&#160;nm. Potential application scenarios and the respective adaptations to the material system and evaluation routine are discussed.








Abstract
Wavelength&#8208;discriminating systems typically consist of heavy benchtop&#8208;based instruments, comprising diffractive optics, moving parts, and adjacent detectors. For simple wavelength measurements, such as lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip light source calibration or laser wavelength tracking, which do not require polychromatic analysis and cannot handle bulky spectroscopy instruments, lightweight, easy&#8208;to&#8208;process, and flexible single&#8208;pixel devices are attracting increasing attention. Here, a device is proposed for monotonously transforming wavelength information into the time domain with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence at the heart of its functionality, which demonstrates a resolution down to 1 nm and below. It is solution&#8208;processed from a single host&#8211;guest system comprising organic room&#8208;temperature phosphors and colloidal quantum dots. The share of excited triplet states within the photoluminescent layer is dependent on the excitation wavelength and determines the afterglow intensity of the film, which is tracked by a simple photodetector. Finally, an all&#8208;organic thin&#8208;film wavelength sensor and two applications are demonstrated where this novel measurement concept successfully replaces a full spectrometer.

         <title>Noncovalent Polymerization&#8208;Activated Ultrastrong Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Energy Transfer Assembly in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient noncovalent polymerization&#8208;activated phosphorescence&#8208;harvesting system is successfully constructed in aqueous solution based on the stepwise confinement of cucurbit[7]uril and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;grafted hyaluronic acid, which shows high phosphorescence energy transfer efficiency accompanied by a long&#8208;lived near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting performance, and is ultimately applied for NIR&#160;targeted imaging of cancer cells.








Abstract
Noncovalent macrocycle&#8208;confined supramolecular purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is a current research hotspot. Herein, a high&#8208;efficiency noncovalent polymerization&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive RTP&#8208;harvesting system in aqueous solution based on the stepwise confinement of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;grafted hyaluronic acid (HACD), is reported. Compared with the dodecyl&#8208;chain&#8208;bridged 6&#8208;bromoisoquinoline derivative (G), the dumbbell&#8208;shaped assembly G&#8834;CB[7] presents an appeared complexation&#8208;induced RTP signal at 540&#160;nm via the first confinement of CB[7]. Subsequently, benefitting from the stepwise confinement encapsulation of the &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin cavity, the subsequent noncovalent polymerization of the binary G&#8834;CB[7] assembly enabled by HACD can contribute to the further&#8208;enhanced RTP emission intensity approximately eight&#160;times in addition to an increased lifetime from 59.0&#160;&#181;s to 0.581&#160;ms. Moreover, upon doping a small amount of two types of organic dyes, Nile blue or tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)porphyrin as an acceptor into the supramolecular confinement assembly G&#8834;CB[7]&#8202;@&#8202;HACD, efficient RTP energy transfer occurs accompanied by a long&#8208;lived NIR&#8208;emitting performance (680 and 710&#160;nm) with a high donor/acceptor ratio. Intriguingly, the prepared RTP&#8208;harvesting system is successfully applied for targeted NIR imaging of living tumor cells by utilizing the targeting ability of hyaluronic acid, which provides a new strategy to create advanced water&#8208;soluble NIR phosphorescent materials.

         <dc:description>
A novel design and scalable fabrication of zero&#8208;volume&#8208;expansion lithium&#8208;composite anodes with high electrochemical and mechanical stability through simple roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing processes is proposed. The sandwich&#8208;like trilayer structure of zero&#8208;volume&#8208;expansion lithium&#8208;composite anodes can simultaneously suppress dendrite formation, eliminate volume change during cycling, and provides excellent mechanical robustness.








Abstract
The lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anode offers a promising solution for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, the significant volume expansion of the Li metal during charging results in poor cycling stability as a result of the dendritic deposition and broken solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, a facile one&#8208;step roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll fabrication of a zero&#8208;volume&#8208;expansion Li&#8208;metal&#8208;composite anode (zeroVE&#8208;Li) is proposed to realize high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs with outstanding electrochemical and mechanical stability. The zeroVE&#8208;Li possesses a sandwich&#8208;like trilayer structure, which consists of an upper electron&#8208;insulating layer and a bottom lithiophilic layer that synergistically guides the Li deposition from the bottom up, and a middle porous layer that eliminates volume expansion. This sandwich structure eliminates dendrite formation, prevents volume change during cycling, and provides outstanding flexibility to the Li&#8208;metal anode even at a practical areal capacity over 3.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Pairing zeroVE&#8208;Li with a commercial NMC811 or LCO cathode, flexible LMBs that offer a record&#8208;breaking figure of merit (FOM, 45.6), large whole&#8208;cell energy density (375&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1, based on the volume of the anode, separator, cathode, and package), high&#8208;capacity retention (&gt; 99.8% per cycle), and remarkable mechanical robustness under practical conditions are demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;The lithium (Li)-metal anode offers a promising solution for high-energy-density lithium-metal batteries (LMBs). However, the significant volume expansion of the Li metal during charging results in poor cycling stability as a result of the dendritic deposition and broken solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, a facile one-step roll-to-roll fabrication of a zero-volume-expansion Li-metal-composite anode (zeroVE-Li) is proposed to realize high-energy-density LMBs with outstanding electrochemical and mechanical stability. The zeroVE-Li possesses a sandwich-like trilayer structure, which consists of an upper electron-insulating layer and a bottom lithiophilic layer that synergistically guides the Li deposition from the bottom up, and a middle porous layer that eliminates volume expansion.

Compared with the traditional grain growth of pristine PbTe, a cleavage&#8208;fracture strategy for grain shrinking is developed in a Pb0.98Sb0.02Te sample during sintering. A hierarchical grain&#8208;boundary structure forms during grain shrinking process and a record&#8208;high ZT value of &#8776;1.9 is obtained at 815 K, which is &#8776;2.2 times that of pristine PbTe.








Abstract
Nanostructure engineering is a key strategy for tailoring properties in the fields of batteries, solar cells, thermoelectrics, and so on. Limited by grain coarsening, however, the nanostructure effect gradually degrades during the materials&#8217; manufacturing and in&#8208;service period. Herein, a strategy of cleavage&#8208;fracture for grain shrinking is developed in a Pb0.98Sb0.02Te sample during sintering, and the grain size remains stable after repeated tests. Moreover, the initial grain boundary is filled by fractured slender grains and enriched by dislocations, evolving into a hierarchical grain&#8208;boundary structure. The lattice thermal conductivity (klat) is greatly reduced to approach the amorphous limit. As a result, a record&#8208;high ZT value of &#8776;1.9 is obtained at 815 K in the n&#8208;type Pb0.98Sb0.02Te sample and a decent efficiency of 6.7% in thermoelectric device. This strategy for grain shrinking will shed light on the application of nanostructure engineering under high temperature and extreme conditions in other material systems.

         <title>Harnessing Polymer&#8208;Matrix&#8208;Mediated Manipulation of Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer for Near&#8208;Infrared Security Applications</title>

Via regulation of the intermolecular interaction between TTF and TCNB in the polymer network, a charge&#8208;transfer complex&#160;(CTC)&#160;filter shows tunable absorption from the visible to NIR region with a relatively high penetration of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation (&#8776;80%). The CTC filter can highlight NIR information hidden in a complex environment, providing a convenient tool for different security applications.








Abstract
Precise recognition of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) signals holds great prospects in optical communication, remote sensing, information security, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. For these applications, filters with good NIR transparency are typically essential components. Currently, such NIR transparent filters are dominated by inorganic materials such as chalcogenide glasses. There are, so far, only a handful of organic molecules with suitable optical properties due to the rarity of organic materials with good NIR transparency and relatively flat absorption over the UV&#8211;visible region. Here, it is found that the library of NIR&#8208;transparent organic materials can be expanded by forming a charge&#8208;transfer complex (CTC) between a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) molecule&#160;that are commercially available. Via regulating the D&#63743;A interaction, the CTC filter shows tunable absorption from the visible to NIR region with a relatively high penetration of NIR radiation (&#8776;80%). The CTC filter can successfully highlight NIR information hidden in a complex environment and allow reading of NIR security images for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Moreover, the CTC filter can be used for viewing protected NIR information with good resolution, and thus provide a convenient tool for different security applications using NIR&#8208;encoded information.

         <title>Microstructured BN Composites with Internally Designed High Thermal Conductivity Paths for 3D Electronic Packaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the magnetically assisted slip casting method, microstructures of boron nitride composites are purposely designed and highly oriented to achieve unusually high thermal conductivity and directional heat transfer toward specific areas along the direction of microplatelet alignment, opening up the solutions for the next&#8208;generation thermal management for 3D electronic packaging.








Abstract
Miniaturized and high&#8208;power&#8208;density 3D electronic devices pose new challenges on thermal management. Indeed, prompt heat dissipation in electrically insulating packaging is currently limited by the thermal conductivity achieved by thermal interface materials (TIMs) and by their capability to direct the heat toward heat sinks. Here, high thermal conductivity boron nitride (BN)&#8208;based composites that are able to conduct heat intentionally toward specific areas by locally orienting magnetically functionalized BN microplatelets are created using magnetically assisted slip casting. The obtained thermal conductivity along the direction of alignment is unusually high, up to 12.1&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, thanks to the high concentration of 62.6 vol% of BN in the composite, the low concentration in polymeric binder, and the high degree of alignment. The BN composites have a low density of 1.3&#160;g cm&#8722;3, a high stiffness of 442.3&#160;MPa, and are electrically insulating. Uniquely, the approach is demonstrated with proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept composites having locally graded orientations of BN microplatelets to direct the heat away from two vertically stacked heat sources. Rationally designing the microstructure of TIMs to direct heat strategically provides a promising solution for efficient thermal management in 3D integrated electronics.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Radiation&#8208;Driven Ultrafast Crystallization of Perovskite Films Under Heavy Humidity for Efficient Inverted Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabricating high&#8208;quality perovskite film in the ambient air is significantly important for upcoming commercial production. Here, the perovskite crystallization process by a two&#8208;step sequential solution deposition in a glovebox and air is systematically studied. Thermal&#8208;radiation&#8208;assisted ultrafast conversion from the intermediates to perovskite is demonstrated, and a comparable performance for the device from the glovebox is acheived.








Abstract
Fabricating perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in air is conducive to low&#8208;cost commercial production; nevertheless, it is rather difficult to achieve comparable device performance as that in an inert atmosphere because of the poor moisture toleration of perovskite materials. Here, the perovskite crystallization process is systematically studied using two&#8208;step sequential solution deposition in an inert atmosphere (glovebox) and air. It is found that moisture can stabilize solvation intermediates and prevent their conversion into perovskite crystals. To address this issue, thermal radiation is used to accelerate perovskite crystallization for integrated perovskite films within 10&#160;s in air. The as&#8208;formed perovskite films are compact, highly oriented with giant grain size, superior photoelectric properties, and low trap density. When the films are applied to PSC devices, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.8% is obtained, one of the best results for air&#8208;processed inverted PSCs under high relative humidity (60&#160;&#177;&#160;10%). This work substantially assists understanding and modulation to perovskite crystallization kinetics under heavy humidity. Also, the ultrafast conversion strategy by thermal radiation&#160;provides unprecedented opportunities to manufacture high&#8208;quality perovskite films for low&#8208;temperature, eco&#8208;friendly, and air&#8208;processed efficient inverted PSCs.

         <title>Suppressing Charged Cation Antisites via Se Vapor Annealing Enables p&#8208;Type Dopability in AgBiSe2&#8211;SnSe Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
AgBiSe2&#8208;based thermoelectric materials show poor p&#8208;type dopability, but an underlying mechanism remains controversial. In this work, it is revealed that charged antisites are principal hole&#8208;killer defects by density functional theory calculations, and that selenium vapor annealing is an effective strategy to effectively stabilize p&#8208;type conductivity in AgBiSe2&#8211;SnSe solid solutions.








Abstract
Cation disordering is commonly found in multinary cubic compounds, but its effect on electronic properties has been neglected because of difficulties in determining the ordered structure and defect energetics. An absence of rational understanding of the point defects present has led to poor reproducibility and uncontrolled conduction type. AgBiSe2 is a representative compound that suffers from poor reproducibility of thermoelectric properties, while the origins of its intrinsic n&#8208;type conductivity remain speculative. Here, it is demonstrated that cation disordering is facilitated by BiAg charged antisite defects in cubic AgBiSe2 which also act as a principal donor defect that greatly controls the electronic properties. Using density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy, how saturation annealing with selenium vapor can stabilize p&#8208;type conductivity in cubic AgBiSe2 alloyed with SnSe at high temperatures is elucidated. With stable and controlled hole concentration, a peak is observed in the weighted mobility and the density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass in AgBiSnSe3, implying an increased valley degeneracy in this system. These findings corroborate the importance of considering the defect energetics for exploring the dopability of ternary thermoelectric chalcogenides and engineering electronic bands by controlling self&#8208;doping.

&lt;p&gt;Cation disordering is commonly found in multinary cubic compounds, but its effect on electronic properties has been neglected because of difficulties in determining the ordered structure and defect energetics. An absence of rational understanding of the point defects present has led to poor reproducibility and uncontrolled conduction type. AgBiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a representative compound that suffers from poor reproducibility of thermoelectric properties, while the origins of its intrinsic n-type conductivity remain speculative. Here, it is demonstrated that cation disordering is facilitated by Bi&lt;sub&gt;Ag&lt;/sub&gt; charged antisite defects in cubic AgBiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which also act as a principal donor defect that greatly controls the electronic properties. Using density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy, how saturation annealing with selenium vapor can stabilize p-type conductivity in cubic AgBiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; alloyed with SnSe at high temperatures is elucidated. With stable and controlled hole concentration, a peak is observed in the weighted mobility and the density-of-states effective mass in AgBiSnSe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, implying an increased valley degeneracy in this system. These findings corroborate the importance of considering the defect energetics for exploring the dopability of ternary thermoelectric chalcogenides and engineering electronic bands by controlling self-doping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optothermally Programmable Liquids with Spatiotemporal Precision and Functional Complexity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquids usually lack spatial order or self&#8208;supported shape to be compatible with precision processing or advanced functionality. Here, an optothermal strategy is reported to dynamically control phase&#8208;separated liquids with an unprecedented level of spatiotemporal addressability to realize liquid painting and liquid animation, leading to a rich variety of functions such as information encryption, payload transportation, and reaction localization.








Abstract
Due to the intrinsic lack of spatial order and self&#8208;supported shape, liquids are often incompatible with precision manufacturing/processing and are potentially limited for advanced functionality. Herein, an optothermal strategy is developed to fully command phase&#8208;separated liquids with unprecedented spatiotemporal addressability. Specifically, a laser is focused onto an Au film to create a hot spot that locally demixes a temperature&#8208;responsive solution to produce a single optothermal droplet. Spatial precision is assured by the well&#8208;defined thermal field and temporal accuracy guaranteed by the fast heating and response rate. Time&#8208;multiplexed laser foci are deployed to engineer the thermal landscape as desired, which in turn dictates the formation/dissolution, positioning, shaping, and dynamic reconfiguration of the phase&#8208;separated liquids. Further, laser foci are programmed to orchestrate the liquid patterns in a time&#8208;continuous manner to produce liquid animations on the microscale with high fidelity. While focused lasers are routinely used to manipulate solid particles or to microfabricate solid materials, the current strategy embraces the merits of liquids and features functional complexity in information encryption, payload transportation, and reaction localization. The strategy is further applicable in scenarios such as subcellular organization of biomolecular condensates and programmable modulation of non&#8208;equilibrium systems.

         <title>Stacking and Twisting of Freestanding Complex Oxide Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new platform is developed for assembling freestanding oxide thin films with different materials and orientations into artificial stacks of heterointerfaces. The heterointerfaces can be tailored by controlling the stacking sequences, as well as the twist angle between the constituent layers with atomically sharp interfaces, leading to distinct moir&#233; patterns.








Abstract
The integration of dissimilar materials in heterostructures has long been a&#160;cornerstone of modern materials science&#8212;seminal examples are 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures. Recently, new methods have been developed that enable the realization of ultrathin freestanding oxide films approaching the 2D limit. Oxides offer new degrees of freedom, due to the strong electronic interactions, especially the 3d orbital electrons, which give rise to rich exotic phases. Inspired by this progress, a new platform for assembling freestanding oxide thin films with different materials and orientations into artificial stacks with heterointerfaces is developed. It is shown that the oxide stacks can be tailored by controlling the stacking sequences, as well as the twist angle between the constituent layers with atomically sharp interfaces, leading to distinct moir&#233; patterns in the transmission electron microscopy images of the full stacks. Stacking and twisting is recognized as a key degree of structural freedom in 2D materials but, until now, has never been realized for oxide materials. This approach opens unexplored avenues for fabricating artificial 3D oxide stacking heterostructures with freestanding membranes across a broad range of complex oxide crystal structures with functionalities not available in conventional 2D materials.

         <title>A Novel 19$\sqrt {19} $ &#215; 19$\sqrt {19} $ Superstructure in Epitaxially Grown 1T&#8208;TaTe2</title>

A novel 19&#215;19$\sqrt {19} \times \sqrt {19} $ charge order is observed in few&#8208;layer thick 1T&#8208;TaTe2 films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The photoemission and scanning probe measurements demonstrate that monolayer 1T&#8208;TaTe2 exhibits various metastable charge density wave orders, including the 19&#215;19$\sqrt {19} \times \sqrt {19} $ superstructure, which can be selectively stabilized by postgrowth annealing. In 1T&#8208;TaTe2 films thicker than a monolayer, only the 19&#215;19$\sqrt {19} \times \sqrt {19} $ order persists.








Abstract
The spontaneous formation of electronic orders is a crucial element for understanding complex quantum states and engineering heterostructures in 2D materials. A novel 19$\sqrt {19} $ &#215;19$\sqrt {19} $ charge order in few&#8208;layer&#8208;thick 1T&#8208;TaTe2 transition metal dichalcogenide films grown by molecular beam epitaxy, which has not been realized, is report. The photoemission and scanning probe measurements demonstrate that monolayer 1T&#8208;TaTe2 exhibits a variety of metastable charge density wave orders, including the 19$\sqrt {19} $ &#215; 19$\sqrt {19} $ superstructure, which can be selectively stabilized by controlling the post&#8208;growth annealing temperature. Moreover, it is found that only the 19$\sqrt {19} $ &#215; 19$\sqrt {19} $ order persists in 1T&#8208;TaTe2 films thicker than a monolayer, up to 8 layers. The findings identify the previously unrealized novel electronic order in a much&#8208;studied transition metal dichalcogenide and provide a viable route to control it within the epitaxial growth process.

         <title>Coherent Precipitates with Strong Domain Wall Pinning in Alkaline Niobate Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coherent precipitates are introduced in lithium sodium niobate polycrystalline piezoceramics. The strong pinning effect on domain walls is demonstrated by a largely reduced polarization hysteresis and enhanced mechanical quality factor Qm by one order of magnitude from &#8776;80 to &#8776;600. while the piezoelectric coefficient remains nearly unchanged. This enhancement in Qm is stable at a large vibration velocity up to 0.8&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1.








Abstract
High&#8208;power piezoelectric applications are predicted to share approximately one&#8208;third of the lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramic market in 2024 with alkaline niobates as the primary competitor. To suppress self&#8208;heating in high&#8208;power devices due to mechanical loss when driven by large electric fields, piezoelectric hardening to restrict domain wall motion is required. In the present work, highly effective piezoelectric hardening via coherent plate&#8208;like precipitates in a model system of the (Li,Na)NbO3 (LNN) solid solution delivers a reduction in losses, quantified as an electromechanical quality factor, by a factor of ten. Various thermal aging schemes are demonstrated to control the average size, number density, and location of the precipitates. The established properties are correlated with a detailed determination of short&#8208; and long&#8208;range atomic structure by X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function analysis, respectively, as well as microstructure determined by transmission electron microscopy. The impact of microstructure with precipitates on both small&#8208; and large&#8208;field properties is also established. These results pave the way to implement precipitate hardening in piezoelectric materials, analogous to precipitate hardening in metals, broadening their use cases in applications.

         <title>Charge Transport in Twisted Organic Semiconductor Crystals of Modulated Pitch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>

The effect of temperature&#8208;dependent, growth&#8208;induced twisting of crystallites of a monocomponent organic semiconductor, 2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (BDT), on charge mobility is analyzed. Organic field&#8208;effect transistor measurements and electrical potential simulation suggest that the twisting&#8208;enhanced mobility is mainly controlled by the organization of fibers in the film, not their individual forms.








Abstract
Many molecular crystals (approximately one third) grow as twisted, helicoidal ribbons from the melt, and this preponderance is even higher in restricted classes of materials, for instance, charge&#8208;transfer complexes. Previously, twisted crystallites of such complexes present an increase in carrier mobilities. Here, the effect of twisting on charge mobility is better analyzed for a monocomponent organic semiconductor, 2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (BDT), that forms twisted crystals with varied helicoidal pitches and makes possible a correlation of twist strength with carrier mobility. Films are analyzed by X&#8208;ray scattering and Mueller matrix polarimetry to characterize the microscale organization of the polycrystalline ensembles. Carrier mobilities of organic field&#8208;effect transistors are five times higher when the crystals are grown with the smallest pitches (most twisted), compared to those with the largest pitches, along the fiber elongation direction. A tenfold increase is observed along the perpendicular direction. Simulation of electrical potential based on scanning electron microscopy images and density functional theory suggests that the twisting&#8208;enhanced mobility is mainly controlled by the fiber organization in the film. A greater number of tightly packed twisted fibers separated by numerous smaller gaps permit better charge transport over the film surface compared to fewer big crystallites separated by larger gaps.

         <title>Polishing the Lead&#8208;Poor Surface&#160;for Efficient Inverted CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically lead&#8208;poor surface is found on CsPbI3 films and it limits the efficiency improvement of inverted CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells for inferior electron transfer and serious nonradiative recombination at CsPbI3/6,6&#8208;phenyl C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester interface. Compared to molecular passivation, 1,4&#8208;butanediamine can polish the lead&#8208;poor surface for fluent electron transfer, and significantly improve the Voc and fill factor with a recorded efficiency of 19.84% and excellent stability.








Abstract
Triiodide cesium lead perovskite (CsPbI3) has promising prospects in the development of efficient and stable photovoltaics in both single&#8208;junction and tandem structures. However, achieving inverted devices that provide good stability and are compatible to tandem devices remains a challenge, and the deep insights are still not understood. This study finds that the surface components of CsPbI3 are intrinsically lead&#8208;poor and the relevant traps are of p&#8208;type with localized states. These deep&#8208;energy&#8208;level p traps induce inferior transfer or electrons and serious nonradiative recombination at the CsPbI3/PCBM interface, leading to the considerable open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss and reduction of fill factor (FF). Compared to molecular passivation, polishing treatment with 1,4&#8208;butanediamine can eliminate the nonstoichiometric components and root these intrinsically lead&#8208;poor traps for superior electron transfer. The polishing treatment significantly improves the FF and Voc of the inverted CsPbI3 photovoltaics, creating an efficiency promotion from 12.64% to 19.84%. Moreover, 95% of the initial efficiency of the optimized devices is maintained after the output operation for 1000 h.

         <title>A Soft Magnetoelastic Generator for Wind&#8208;Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamentally new wind&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting technology based on the giant magnetoelastic effect in a soft composite system is reported. Wind&#8208;induced mechanical deformation alters the magnetic field in the soft system, which is able to convert the wind energy into electricity via electromagnetic induction from arbitrary directions. It features a high current density of 1.17&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 and intrinsic waterproofness.








Abstract
The current energy crises and imminent danger of global warming severely limit the ability to scale societal development sustainably. As such, there is a pressing need for utilizing renewable, green energy sources, such as wind energy, which is ubiquitously available on Earth. In this work, a fundamentally new wind&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting technology is reported, which is based on the giant magnetoelastic effect in a soft composite system, namely, magnetoelastic generators. Its working principle is based on wind&#8208;induced mechanical deformation, which alters the magnetic field in a soft system converting the&#160;wind energy into electricity via electromagnetic induction from arbitrary directions. The wind&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting system features a low internal impedance of 68&#8201;&#937;, a high current density of 1.17&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8211;2, and a power density of 0.82&#8201;mW&#8201;cm&#8211;2 under ambient natural wind. The system is capable of sustainably driving small electronics and electrolytically splitting water. The system can generate hydrogen at a rate of 7.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8211;2&#8201;mL&#8201;h&#8211;1 with a wind speed of 20&#8201;m&#8201;s&#8722;1. Additionally, since magnetic fields can penetrate water molecules, the magnetoelastic generators are intrinsically waterproof and work stably in harsh environments. This work paves a new way for wind&#8208;energy harvesting with compelling features, which can contribute largely to the hydrogen economy and the sustainability of human civilization.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of High&#8208;Optical&#8208;Quality Large&#8208;Area Monolayer Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayers of Janus SeMoS with asymmetric top (Se) and bottom (S) chalcogen atomic planes with respect to the central transition metal (Mo) atoms are synthesized using a one&#8208;pot chemical vapor deposition process and its high optical quality is demonstrated by low&#8208;temperature magneto optical spectroscopy.








Abstract
One&#8208;pot chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of large&#8208;area Janus SeMoS monolayers is reported, with the asymmetric top (Se) and bottom (S) chalcogen atomic planes with respect to the central transition metal (Mo) atoms. The formation of these 2D semiconductor monolayers takes place upon the thermodynamic&#8208;equilibrium&#8208;driven exchange of the bottom Se atoms of the initially grown MoSe2 single crystals on gold foils with S atoms. The growth process is characterized by complementary experimental techniques including Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and the growth mechanisms are rationalized by first principle calculations. The remarkably high optical quality of the synthesized Janus monolayers is demonstrated by optical and magneto&#8208;optical measurements which reveal the strong exciton&#8211;phonon coupling and enable an exciton g&#8208;factor of &#8722;3.3.

A floatable polystyrene&#8208;sphere&#8208;supported TiO2/Bi2O3 S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst is fabricated, which exhibits a high yield of H2O2 and furoic acid in the triphase system. Detailed spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal the step&#8208;scheme mechanism and pathways of H2O2 and furoic acid evolution, respectively. The merits of the S&#8208;scheme and triphase system are responsible for the extraordinary photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Cooperative coupling of photocatalytic H2O2 production with organic synthesis has an expansive perspective in converting solar energy into storable chemical energy. However, traditional powder photocatalysts suffer from severe agglomeration, limited light absorption, poor gas reactant accessibility, and reusable difficulty, which greatly hinders their large&#8208;scale application. Herein, floatable composite photocatalysts are synthesized by immobilizing hydrophobic TiO2 and Bi2O3 on lightweight polystyrene (PS) spheres via hydrothermal and photodeposition methods. The floatable photocatalysts are not only solar transparent, but also upgrade the contact between reactants and photocatalysts. Thus, the floatable step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) TiO2/Bi2O3 photocatalyst exhibits a drastically enhanced H2O2 yield of 1.15&#160;mm h&#8722;1 and decent furfuryl alcohol conversion to furoic acid synchronously. Furthermore, the S&#8208;scheme mechanism and dynamics are systematically investigated by in situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectrum analyses. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism of furoic acid evolution. The ingenious design of floatable photocatalysts not only furnishes insight into maximizing photocatalytic reaction kinetics but also provides a new route for highly efficient heterogeneous catalysis.

CO2 Electroreduction
It remains challenging to increase the energy efficiency while maintaining long durability of catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to CO. In article number 2204637, Xin Wang,  Ming Feng, Aiping Yu, Zhongwei Chen, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a dual&#8208;scale delicate design of a non&#8208;noble Sn&#8211;ZnO active interface inserted into nanopores of high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon nanospheres, through d&#8208;bandwidth tuning and nanoconfinement tailoring to develop efficient and stable CO2 electroreduction.

Thermoelectric Materials
In article number 2204132, G. Jeffrey Snyder, Yeon Sik Jung, Min&#8208;Wook Oh, and co&#8208;workers show that charged cation antisites are principal defects forestalling p&#8208;type dopability of AgBiSe2&#8208;based thermoelectric materials via saturation annealing under selenium vapor. This finding offers a rational design rule for stabilizing thermoelectric properties of chalcogenide&#8208;based materials.

In article number 2205226, Bernhard Urbaszek, Antony George, Andrey Turchanin, and co&#8208;workers present a new method to grow large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;structural&#8208;quality SeMoS Janus monolayers on Au substrates. Their high optical quality is demonstrated by optical and magneto&#8208;optical measurements which reveal the strong exciton&#8208;phonon coupling and enable an exciton g&#8208;factor of &#8722;3.3 to be obtained.

         <title>Metamaterial Absorbers: From Tunable Surface to Structural Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metamaterial absorbers (MAs), designed using artificial subwavelength structures, feature low profile and unique absorption. Employing active components into the element designs facilitate multifunction and miniaturization of MAs. A comprehensive and systematical review covering the work essentially conducted in the domain of cutting&#8208;edge active MAs is presented, highlighting innovative materials and unique strategies to manipulate electromagnetic response at frequencies up to optical regions.








Abstract
Since the first demonstration, remarkable progress has been made in the theoretical analysis, structural design, numerical simulation, and potential applications of metamaterial absorbers (MAs). With the continuous advancement of novel materials and creative designs, the absorption of MAs is significantly improved over a wide frequency spectrum from microwaves to the optical regime. Further, the integration of active elements into the MA design allows the dynamical manipulation of electromagnetic waves, opening a new platform to push breakthroughs in metadevices. In the last several years, numerous efforts have been devoted to exploring innovative approaches for incorporating tunability to MAs, which is highly desirable because of the progressively increasing demand on designing versatile metadevices. Here, a comprehensive and systematical overview of active MAs with adaptive and on&#8208;demand manner is presented, highlighting innovative materials and unique strategies to precisely control the electromagnetic response. In addition to the mainstream method by manipulating periodic patterns, two additional approaches, including tailoring dielectric spacer and transforming overall structure are called back. Following this, key parameters, such as operating frequency, relative tuning range, and switching speed are summarized and compared to guide for optimum design. Finally, potential opportunities in the development of active MAs are discussed.

         <title>Responsive Hydrogels Based on Triggered Click Reactions for Liver Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 38, September 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;linked hydrophilic polymer chains that can form gels are widely utilized for biomedical applications, such as drug delivery. Various studies have also demonstrated the effects of particle size and surface morphology on drug release from particles in liver cancer therapy. Mechanistic understandings of responsive hydrogels in responsive stimuli are provided, by which better clinical choices may be approached.








Abstract
Globally, liver cancer, which is one of the major cancers worldwide, has attracted the growing attention of technological researchers for its high mortality and limited treatment options. Hydrogels are soft 3D network materials containing a large number of hydrophilic monomers. By adding moieties such as nitrobenzyl groups to the network structure of a cross&#8208;linked nanocomposite hydrogel, the click reaction improves drug&#8208;release efficiency in vivo, which improves the survival rate and prolongs the survival time of liver cancer patients. The application of a nanocomposite hydrogel drug delivery system can not only enrich the drug concentration at the tumor site for a long time but also effectively prevents the distant metastasis of residual tumor cells. At present, a large number of researches have been working toward the construction of responsive nanocomposite hydrogel drug delivery systems, but there are few comprehensive articles to systematically summarize these discoveries. Here, this systematic review summarizes the synthesis methods and related applications of nanocomposite responsive hydrogels with actions to external or internal physiological stimuli. With different physical or chemical stimuli, the structural unit rearrangement and the controlled release of drugs can be used for responsive drug delivery in different states.

         <title>Electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical failure of solid electrolyte induced by growth of internal lithium filaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Growth of lithium (Li) filaments within solid electrolytes, leading to the mechanical degradation of electrolyte and even short circuit of cell under high current density, is a great barrier to commercial adoption of solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries. Understanding of this electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical phenomena is usually hindered by the challenge of tracking local fields such as stress, displacement, and electric fields inside solid electrolyte by experimental techniques. Here, we report a multiphysics simulation aiming to investigate the evolution of mechanical failure of solid electrolyte induced by the electrochemical plating of Li inside. Visualization of local stress, resulted damage and crack propagation within solid electrolyte enables comprehensive examination of critical factors dominating the degradation process, including the geometry, number, and size of Li filaments as well as pre&#8208;existing voids in the electrolyte. The relative damage induced by locally high stress is found to preferentially occur at the region with great fluctuation at the solid electrolyte/Li filament interface. Under the condition of multiple Li filaments in the solid electrolyte pellet, high number density of Li filament or voids triggers the integration of damage and crack networks by the enhanced propagation between adjacent filaments. Our model is built on the synchronous coupling of the mechanical behavior of solid electrolyte and the electrochemical plating of Li inside, revealing the evolution of multi&#8208;physical fields that can barely be captured by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art experimental techniques. The understanding for the mechanical degradation of solid electrolyte with presence of Li filaments paves the way to design advanced solid electrolyte for future solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

         <title>Implanting CoOx Clusters on Ordered Macroporous ZnO Nanoreactors for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoOx nanoclusters are anchored in hierarchically ordered interconnected porous N/C co&#8208;doped ZnO (N&#8208;C&#8208;ZnO) nanoreactors for efficient CO2 photoreduction. Benefitting from the optimized chemical composition, a unique hollow scaffold with highly ordered porous channels, and exposure of abundant accessible active sites, the obtained catalyst shows a superior performance for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion powered by visible light.








Abstract
Despite suffering from slow charge&#8208;carrier mobility, photocatalysis is still an attractive and promising technology toward producing green fuels from solar energy. An effective approach is to design and fabricate advanced architectural materials as photocatalysts to enhance the performance of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Herein, metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;derived hierarchically ordered porous nitrogen and carbon co&#8208;doped ZnO (N&#8208;C&#8208;ZnO) structures are developed as nanoreactors with decorated CoOx nanoclusters for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion driven by visible light. Introduction of hierarchical nanoarchitectures with highly ordered interconnected meso&#8211;macroporous channels shows beneficial properties for photocatalytic reduction reactions, including enhanced mobility of charge carriers throughout the highly accessible framework, maximized exposure of active sites, and inhibited recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the key role of CoOx nanoclusters with high affinity to CO2 molecules, and the Co&#63743;O bonds formed on the surface of the composite exhibit stronger charge redistribution. As a result, the obtained CoOx/N&#8208;C&#8208;ZnO demonstrates enhanced photocatalysis performance in terms of high CO yield and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Benchmarking Noise and Dephasing in Emerging Electrical Materials for Quantum Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

The available data on low&#8208;frequency fluctuations in electrical properties are reviewed to benchmark dephasing and noise in materials that are of direct interest to quantum technologies. The physical processes causing dephasing and noise are elaborated, the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is evaluated, and it is hoped that a clearer pathway to design, characterize and implement both material and devices for quantum&#160;applications is thus provided.








Abstract
As quantum technologies develop, a specific class of electrically conducting materials is rapidly gaining interest because they not only form the core quantum&#8208;enabled elements in superconducting qubits, semiconductor nanostructures, or sensing devices, but also the peripheral circuitry. The phase coherence of the electronic wave function in these emerging materials will be crucial when incorporated in the quantum architecture. The loss of phase memory, or dephasing, occurs when a quantum system interacts with the fluctuations in the local electromagnetic environment, which manifests in &#8220;noise&#8221; in the electrical conductivity. Hence, characterizing these materials and devices therefrom, for quantum applications, requires evaluation of both dephasing and noise, although there are very few materials where these properties are investigated simultaneously. Here, the available data on magnetotransport and low&#8208;frequency fluctuations in electrical conductivity are reviewed to benchmark the dephasing and noise. The focus is on new materials that are of direct interest to quantum technologies. The physical processes causing dephasing and noise in these systems are elaborated, the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from materials synthesis and devices realization are evaluated, and it is hoped that a clearer pathway to design and characterize both material and devices for quantum&#160;applications is thus provided.

         <title>3D Printing Nanostructured Solid Polymer Electrolytes with High Modulus and Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) were 3D printed using a visible light photopolymerization induced microphase separation approach. By forming two chemically independent nanodomains, SPEs with high conductivity (up to 3 &#215; 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1) and high elastic modulus (G&#8242; &gt; 108 Pa) were obtained. The SPEs were 3D printed into complex architectures and readily applied as functional supercapacitor electrolytes.








Abstract
The development of advanced solid&#8208;state energy&#8208;storage devices is contingent upon finding new ways to produce and manufacture scalable, high&#8208;modulus solid&#8208;state electrolytes that can simultaneously provide high ionic conductivity and robust mechanical integrity. In this work, an efficient one&#8208;step process to manufacture solid polymer electrolytes composed of nanoscale ion&#8208;conducting channels embedded in a rigid crosslinked polymer matrix via Digital Light Processing 3D printing&#160;is reported. A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated polymerization&#8208;induced microphase&#8208;separation approach is utilized, which produces materials with two chemically independent nanoscale domains with highly tunable nanoarchitectures. By producing materials containing a poly(ethylene oxide) domain swelled with an ionic liquid, robust solid polymer electrolytes with outstanding room&#8208;temperature (22&#160;&#176;C) shear modulus (G&#8217; &gt; 108 Pa) and ionic conductivities up to &#963;&#160;= 3 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S&#160;cm&#8722;1 are achieved. The nanostructured 3D&#8208;printed electrolytes are fabricated into a custom geometry and employed in a symmetric carbon supercapacitor, demonstrating the scalability of the fabrication and the functionality of the electrolyte. Critically, these high&#8208;performance materials are manufactured on demand using inexpensive and commercially available 3D printers, which allows the facile modular design of solid polymer electrolytes with custom geometries.

         <title>Colossal Room&#8208;Temperature Terahertz Topological Response in Type&#8208;II Weyl Semimetal NbIrTe4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With development of room&#8208;temperature (RT) terahertz (THz) detectors, layered materials with topological band structure have stimulated burgeoning research interest. In this work, type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal NbIrTe4&#160;is applied in RT THz detection, which, compared with other known layered materials, exhibits the highest photoresponsivity, the largest anisotropic ratio of intrinsic conductance&#160;and THz photocurrent, and excellent air stability.








Abstract
The electromagnetic spectrum between microwave and infrared light is termed the &#8220;terahertz (THz) gap,&#8221; of which there is an urgent lack of feasible and efficient room&#8208;temperature (RT) THz detectors. Type&#8208;II Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have been predicted to host significant RT topological&#160;photoresponses in low&#8208;frequency regions, especially in the THz gap, well addressing the shortcomings of THz detectors. However, such devices have&#160;not&#160;been&#160;experimentally realized yet. Herein, a type&#8208;II WSM (NbIrTe4) is selected to fabricate THz detector, which exhibits a photoresponsivity of 5.7&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;V&#160;W&#8722;1 and a one&#8208;year air stability at RT. Such excellent THz&#8208;detection performance can be attributed to the topological effect of type&#8208;II WSM in which the effective mass of photogenerated electrons can be reduced by the large tilting angle of Weyl nodes to further improve mobility and photoresponsivity. Impressively, this device shows a giant intrinsic anisotropic conductance (&#963;max/&#963;min&#160;=&#160;339) and THz response (Iph&#8208;max/Iph&#8208;min&#160;= 40.9), both of which are record values known. The findings open a new avenue for the realization of uncooled and highly sensitive THz detectors by exploring type&#8208;II WSM&#8208;based devices.

         <title>A Polymeric Strategy Empowering Vascular Cell Selectivity and Potential Application Superior to Extracellular Matrix Peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric strategy for designing and finding the endothelial cell&#8208;selective biomaterials is reported, which is superior to extracellular matrix derived endothelial cell&#8208;selective REDV peptide regarding the cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration of endothelial cell versus smooth muscle cell and displays great potential in vascular&#8208;related biomaterial study and application.








Abstract
Endothelialization of vascular implants plays a vital role in maintaining the long&#8208;term vascular patency. In situ endothelialization and re&#8208;endothelialization is generally achieved by selectively promoting endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and, meanwhile, suppressing smooth muscle cell (SMC) adhesion. Currently, such EC versus SMC selectivity is achieved and extensively used in vascular&#8208;related biomaterials utilizing extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;derived EC&#8208;selective peptides, dominantly REDV and YIGSR. Nevertheless, the application of EC&#8208;selective peptides is limited due to their easy proteolysis, time&#8208;consuming synthesis, and expensiveness. To address these limitations, a polymeric strategy in designing and finding EC&#8208;selective biomaterials using amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;peptide polymers by tuning serum protein adsorption is reported. The optimal &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer displays EC versus SMC selectivity even superior to EC&#8208;selective REDV peptide regarding cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration of ECs versus SMCs. Study of the mechanism indicates that surface adsorption of bovine serum albumin, an abundant and anti&#8208;adhesive serum protein, plays a critical role in the ECs versus SMCs selectivity of &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer. In addition, surface modification of the optimal &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer effectively promotes the endothelialization of vascular implants and inhibits intimal hyperplasia. This study provides an alternative strategy in designing and finding EC&#8208;selective biomaterials, implying great potential in the vascular&#8208;related biomaterial study and application.

         <title>Nondestructive Photopatterning of Heavy&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nondestructive direct photopatterning for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free quantum dots is presented by using branched light&#8208;driven ligand crosslinkers containing multiple azide units. The branched crosslinkers effectively interlock quantum dot films without compromising the intrinsic photoluminescence and electroluminescence properties of quantum dots. This nondestructive method can be directly adapted to photolithography facilities widely available in industry.








Abstract
Electroluminescence from quantum dots (QDs) is a suitable photon source for futuristic displays offering hyper&#8208;realistic images with free&#8208;form factors. Accordingly, a nondestructive and scalable process capable of rendering multicolored QD patterns on a scale of several micrometers needs to be established. Here, nondestructive direct photopatterning for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free QDs is reported using branched light&#8208;driven ligand crosslinkers (LiXers) containing multiple azide units. The branched LiXers effectively interlock QD films via photo&#8208;crosslinking native aliphatic QD surface ligands without compromising the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of QDs. Using branched LiXers with six sterically engineered azide units, RGB QD patterns are achieved on the micrometer scale. The photo&#8208;crosslinking process does not affect the photoluminescence and electroluminescence characteristics of QDs and extends the device lifetime. This nondestructive method can be readily adapted to industrial processes and make an immediate impact on display technologies, as it uses widely available photolithography facilities and high&#8208;quality heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free QDs with aliphatic ligands.

Accordingly, a nondestructive and scalable process capable of rendering multicolored QD patterns on a scale of several micrometers needs to be established. Here, nondestructive direct photopatterning for heavy-metal-free QDs is reported using branched light-driven ligand crosslinkers (LiXers) containing multiple azide units. The branched LiXers effectively interlock QD films via photo-crosslinking native aliphatic QD surface ligands without compromising the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of QDs. Using branched LiXers with six sterically engineered azide units, RGB QD patterns are achieved on the micrometer scale. The photo-crosslinking process does not affect the photoluminescence and electroluminescence characteristics of QDs and extends the device lifetime. This nondestructive method can be readily adapted to industrial processes and make an immediate impact on display technologies, as it uses widely available photolithography facilities and high-quality heavy-metal-free QDs with aliphatic ligands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of smart aggregates: towards rapid clinical diagnosis of hyperlipidemia in human blood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular aggregates with environmental responsive property are desired for their wide practical applications such as bio&#8208;probes. Here, we report a series of smart near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens for hyperlipidemia (HLP) diagnosis. The aggregates of these molecules exhibit the twisted intramolecular charge transfer effect in aqueous medium, but aggregation&#8208;induced emission in high viscous medium due to the restriction of the intramolecular motion. We describe these aggregates, which can autonomously respond to different environments via switching of the aggregation state without changing their chemical structures, as &#8220;smart aggregates&#8221;. Intriguingly, these luminogens demonstrate NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;III luminescence with ultra&#8208;large Stokes shifts (&gt; 950&#160;nm). Both in vitro detection and in vivo imaging of HLP can be realized in a mouse model. Linear relationships exist between the emission intensity and multiple pathological parameters in blood samples of HLP patients. Thus, the design of smart aggregate facilitates rapid and accurate detection of HLP and provides a promising attempt in aggregate science.

         <title>Freestanding and Scalable Force&#8208;softness Bimodal Sensor Arrays for Haptically Body Feature Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tactile technologies that can identify human body features are valuable in clinical diagnosis and human&#8208;machine interactions. Previously cutting&#8208;edge tactile platforms can identify structured non&#8208;living objects; however, human body feature identification remains challenging mainly because of the irregular contour and heterogeneous spatial distribution of softness. Here we develop freestanding and scalable tactile platforms of force&#8208;softness bimodal sensor arrays, enabling tactile gloves to identify body features using machine learning methods. The bimodal sensors are engineered by adding a protrusion on a piezoresistive pressure sensor, endowing the resistance signals with combined information of pressure and the softness of samples. The simple design enables 112 bimodal sensors to be integrated into the thin, conformal, and stretchable tactile glove, allowing the tactile information to be digitalized while hand skills are performed on the human body. The tactile glove shows high accuracy (98%) in identifying four body features of a real person, and four organ models (healthy and pathological) inside an abdominal simulator, demonstrating body feature identification of the bimodal tactile platforms and showing their potential use in future healthcare and robotics.

         <title>Spatially Band Separation in Surface Doped Heterolayered Structure for Realizing Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) with electrical neutrality and long lifetime holds great promise in producing high value&#8208;added chemicals via selective oxidation reaction. However, photocatalytic 1O2 generation via charge&#8208;transfer mechanism still suffers from low efficiency due to mismatched redox capacities and low concentration of photo&#8208;generated carriers in confined systems. Herein, by taking bismuth oxysilicate (Bi2O2SiO3) with alternating heterogeneous layered structure as a model, we show that iodine doping can facilitate the spatial redistributions of bands on alternated [Bi2O2] and [SiO3] layers, which could promote the separation and transfer of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers. Meanwhile, the band positions of Bi2O2SiO3 was optimized to match the redox potential of 1O2 generation. Benefiting from these features, iodine doped Bi2O2SiO3 exhibits efficient 1O2 generation with respect to its pristine counterpart, leading to promoted performance in selective sulfide oxidation reaction. This study offers a new strategy for optimizing charge transfer&#8208;mediated 1O2 generation.

         <title>Electron Transport Layers Employing Strongly&#8208;Bound Ligands Enhance Stability in Colloidal Quantum Dot Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed photodetectors based on colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light sensing applications. Present&#8208;day CQD photodetectors employ a CQD active layer sandwiched between carrier transport layers in which the electron transport layer (ETL) is composed of metal oxides. Herein we develop a new class of ETLs using n&#8208;type CQDs, finding that these benefit from quantum&#8208;size effect tuning of band energies, as well as from surface ligand engineering. We demonstrate 1450&#160;nm&#8208;operating photodetectors using CQDs with tailored functionalities for each of the transport layers and the active layer. By optimizing the band alignment between the ETL and the active layer, we report CQD photodetectors that combine low dark current of &#8764;1 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;mA/cm2 with high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8764;66% at 1&#160;V, outperforming prior reports of &gt;1400&#160;nm&#8208;operating CQD photodetectors that relied on metal oxides as ETLs. We show that stable CQD photodetectors rely on well&#8208;passivated CQDs: for ETL CQDs, a strongly&#8208;bound organic ligand trans&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)cinnamic acid (TFCA) provides improved passivation compared to the weakly&#8208;bound inorganic ligand tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI). TFCA suppresses bias&#8208;induced ion migration inside the ETL and improves the operating stability of photodetectors by 50x compared to TBAI.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Graded Electrodes Mitigate the Mismatch between Mechanical Reliability and Energy Density for Foldable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density are highly desirable for wearable electronics. However, current approaches for designing flexible LIBs are diffcult to achieve the excellent flexibility and high energy density simultaneously. To mitigate the mismatch, mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to endow high&#8208;loading&#8208;mass slurry&#8208;coating electrodes with brilliant intrinsic flexibility without sacrificing energy density. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the up&#8208;graded LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cathodes (&#8764;15&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8764;70&#160;&#956;m) and graphite anodes (&#8764;8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8764;105&#160;&#956;m) can tolerate an extremely low bending radius of 400&#160;&#956;m and 600&#160;&#956;m, respectively. Finite element analysis (FEA) reveals that, compared with conventionally homogeneous electrodes, the flexibility of up&#8208;graded electrodes is enhanced by specifically strengthening the upper layer and avoiding crack initiation. Benefiting from this, the foldable pouch cell (required bending radius of &#8764;600&#160;&#956;m) successfully realized a remarkable figure of merit (FOM, energy density versus bending radius) of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3. Moreover, the up&#8208;graded electrodes&#8208;based pouch cells can deliver a stable power supply, even under various deformation modes, such as twisting, folding, and knotting. This work proposes new insights for harmonizing mechanics and electrochemistry of energy storage devices to achieve high energy density under flexible extremes.

Benefiting from this, the foldable pouch cell (required bending radius of &#8764;600&#160;&#956;m) successfully realized a remarkable figure of merit (FOM, energy density versus bending radius) of 121.3 mWh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the up-graded electrodes-based pouch cells can deliver a stable power supply, even under various deformation modes, such as twisting, folding, and knotting. This work proposes new insights for harmonizing mechanics and electrochemistry of energy storage devices to achieve high energy density under flexible extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bioactive Iridium Nanoclusters with Glutathione Depletion Ability for Enhanced Sonodynamic&#8208;Triggered Ferroptosis&#8208;like Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ferroptosis is a regulated form of necrotic cell death that involves the accumulation of lipid peroxide (LPO) species in an iron&#8208; and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;dependent manner. Previous investigations reported that ferroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy could overcome the limitations of traditional therapeutics targeting the apoptosis pathway. However, it is still challenging to enhance the antitumor efficacy of ferroptosis due to intrinsic cellular regulation. In this study, ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent, i.e., chlorine e6 (Ce6)&#8208;conjugated human serum albumin&#8208;iridium oxide (HSA&#8208;Ce6&#8208;IrO2, HCIr) nanoclusters were developed to achieve sonodynamic therapy (SDT)&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cells death. The sonosensitizing role of both Ce6 and IrO2 within the HCIr nanoclusters exhibited highly efficient 1O2 generation capacity upon ultrasound stimulation, which promoted the accumulation of LPO and subsequently induced ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the HCIr could deplete glutathione (GSH) by accelerating Ir (IV)&#8208;Ir (III) transition, which further suppressed the activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to enhance the ferroptosis efficacy. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that HCIr possessed tremendous capacity to reduce the intracellular GSH content, which enhanced SDT&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death. We developed iridium nanoclusters&#8208;based ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent providing a promising strategy for inducing ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death.

&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a regulated form of necrotic cell death that involves the accumulation of lipid peroxide (LPO) species in an iron- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. Previous investigations reported that ferroptosis-based cancer therapy could overcome the limitations of traditional therapeutics targeting the apoptosis pathway. However, it is still challenging to enhance the antitumor efficacy of ferroptosis due to intrinsic cellular regulation.

         <title>Tuning the Dynamics of Viral Factories&#8208;Inspired Compartments Formed by Peptide&#8208;RNA Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation</title>

Abstract
Viral factories are intracellular microcompartments formed by mammalian viruses in their host cells, and contain necessary machinery for viral genome replication, capsid assembly and maturation, thus serve as &#8220;factories&#8221; for formation of new viral particles. Recent evidence suggest that these compartments are formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of viral proteins and nucleic acids and present dynamic properties. Inspired by the remarkable functionalities of viral factories we designed dynamic compartments that are formed by complexation between a minimalistic, disordered peptide and RNA. By systematic studies using sequence variants we show that the material properties of the compartments can be modulated by changes to the peptide sequence, at a single amino acid level. Moreover, by taking this approach to the next step, we developed liquid compartments with light&#8208;induced tunable dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the material properties of liquid droplets can be temporally regulated by increasing peptide polarity and charge, and that these changes can be further utilized for controlled partitioning and release of payloads from the compartments.

         <title>Zwitterionic Dendrimersomes: A Closer Xenobiotic Mimic of Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Building functional mimics of cell membranes is an important task toward the development of synthetic cells. So far, lipid and amphiphilic block copolymers are the most widely used amphiphiles with the bilayers by the former lacking stability while membranes by the latter are typically characterized by very slow dynamics. Herein, we introduce a new type of Janus dendrimer containing a zwitterionic phosphocholine hydrophilic headgroup (JDPC) and a 3,5&#8208;substituted dihydrobenzoate&#8208;based hydrophobic dendron. JDPC self&#8208;assembles in water into zwitterionic dendrimersomes (z&#8208;DSs) that faithfully recapitulate the cell membrane in thickness, flexibility, and fluidity, while being resilient to harsh conditions and displaying faster pore closing dynamics in the event of membrane rupture. This enables the fabrication of hybrid DSs with components of natural membranes, including pore&#8208;forming peptides, structure&#8208;directing lipids, and glycans to create raft&#8208;like domains or onion vesicles. Moreover, z&#8208;DSs can be used to create active synthetic cells with life&#8208;like features that mimic vesicle fusion and motility as well as environmental sensing. Despite their fully synthetic nature, z&#8208;DSs are minimal cell mimics that can integrate and interact with living matter with the programmability to imitate life&#8208;like features and beyond.

         <title>Interface Capture Effect Printing Atomic&#8208;thick Two&#8208;dimensional Semiconductor Thin Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor crystals offer the opportunity to further extend Moore's law to the atomic scale. For practical and low&#8208;cost electronic applications, directly printing devices on substrates is advantageous compared to conventional microfabrication techniques that utilize expensive photolithography, etching, and vacuum metallization processes. However, the currently printed 2D transistors are plagued by unsatisfactory electrical performance, thick semiconductor layers, and low device density. Herein, we demonstrate a facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to fabricate high&#8208;quality and atomic&#8208;thick semiconductor thin&#8208;film arrays without additional surfactants. Printed robust thin&#8208;film transistors using 2D semiconductors (e.g., MoS2) and 2D conductive electrodes (e.g., graphene) exhibit high electrical performance, including a carrier mobility of up to 6.7 cm2&#183;V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio of 2&#215;106 at 25&#176;C. As a proof of concept, we printed 2D transistors with a density of &#8764;47000 devices per square centimeter. In addition, this method can be applied to many other 2D materials, such as NbSe2, Bi2Se3, and black phosphorus, for printing diverse high&#8208;quality thin films. Thus, the strategy of printable 2D thin&#8208;film transistors provide a scalable pathway for the facile manufacturing of high&#8208;performance electronics at an affordable cost.

         <title>Chiral Rashba Ferroelectrics for Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Direct detection of circularly polarized light (CPL) is a challenging task due to limited materials and ambiguous structure&#8208;property relationships that lead to low distinguishability of the light helicities. Perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors incorporating chirality provide new opportunities in dealing with this issue. Herein, we report a pair of 2D chiral perovskite ferroelectrics with enhanced CPL detection performance due to interplays among lattice, photon, charge, spin, and orbit. The chirality&#8208;transfer induced chiral&amp;polar ferroelectric phase enhances the asymmetric nature of the photo&#8208;active sublattice and achieves a switchable self&#8208;powered detection via the bulk photovoltaic effect. The single&#8208;crystal&#8208;based device exhibits a CPL&#8208;sensitive detection performance under 430&#160;nm with an asymmetric factor of 0.20 for left&#8208; and right&#8208;CPL differentiation, about two times of pure chiral counterparts. The enhanced CPL detection performance is ascribed to the Rashba&#8208;Dresselhaus effect that originates from the bulk inversion asymmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, shown with a large Rashba coefficient that is demonstrated by DFT calculation and circularly polarized light excited photoluminescence measurement. Our results provide new perspectives on chiral Rashba ferroelectric semiconductors for direct CPL detection and ferroelectrics&#8208;based chiroptics and spintronics.

         <title>Transformable ECM Deprivation System Effectively Suppresses Renal Cell Carcinoma by Reversing Anoikis Resistance and Increasing Chemotherapy Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformable extracellular matrix (ECM) deprivation system (EDS) deprives the ECM of tumors and restraints cancer progression by targeting fibronectin (FN). The cage&#8208;like nanofibers deprive the ECM of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells, which block the FN&#8208;mediated tumor&#8208;promoting signaling and ultimately reverse anoikis resistance and ameliorate cell adhesion&#8208;mediated drug resistance (CAM&#8208;DR).








Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial in various biological functions during tumor progression, including induction of anoikis resistance and cell adhesion&#8208;mediated drug resistance (CAM&#8208;DR). Fibronectin (FN) is a vital ECM component with direct regulatory effects on ECM&#8208;mediated anoikis resistance and CAM&#8208;DR, making it an attractive and innovative therapeutic target for depriving ECM in tumor tissue. Herein, an ECM deprivation system (EDS) is developed based on FN targeting self&#8208;assembly peptide for constructing nanofibers in the ECM of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which contributes to: i) targeting and recognizing FN to form nanofibers for long&#8208;term retention in ECM, ii) reversing anoikis resistance via arresting the FN signaling pathway, and iii) serving as a drug&#8208;loading platform for sensitizing chemotherapy by ameliorating CAM&#8208;DR. The results reveal that EDS significantly reverses anoikis resistance of RCC cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation of FAK, a positive regulator of the FN signaling pathway. Meanwhile, EDS serves as a chemotherapy&#8208;sensitizer of cancer, exerting significant synergistic effects with doxorubicin (DOX). In vivo validation experiments show that EDS effectively suppresses metastasis and tumor growth with chemotherapy resistance. Collectively, the innovative EDS notably inhibits the tumor&#8208;promoting effect of ECM and may provide a novel approach for suppressing ECM and enhancing chemo&#8208;drug sensitivity.

         <title>Enhanced Competition at the Nano&#8211;Bio Interface Enables Comprehensive Characterization of Protein Corona Dynamics and Deep Coverage of Proteomes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By increasing competition at the nano&#8211;bio interface, protein corona diversity and detection of low&#8208;abundance proteins such as cytokines and chemokines are significantly improved. Quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) data captures corona dynamics for 3000 individual proteins and provides a crucial resource for in&#8208;depth modeling of nano&#8211;bio interactions and the Vroman effect for in vitro and in vivo applications of nanomaterials.








Abstract
Introducing engineered nanoparticles (NPs) into a biofluid such as blood plasma leads to the formation of a selective and reproducible protein corona at the particle&#8211;protein interface, driven by the relationship between protein&#8211;NP affinity and protein abundance. This enables&#160;scalable systems that leverage protein&#8211;nano interactions to&#160;overcome current limitations of deep plasma proteomics in large cohorts. Here the importance of the protein to NP&#8208;surface ratio (P/NP) is demonstrated and protein corona formation dynamics are modeled, which determine the competition between proteins for binding. Tuning the P/NP ratio significantly modulates the protein corona composition, enhancing depth and precision of a fully automated NP&#8208;based deep proteomic workflow (Proteograph). By increasing the binding competition on engineered NPs, 1.2&#8211;1.7&#215; more proteins with 1% false discovery rate are identified on the surface of each NP, and up to 3&#215; more proteins compared to a standard plasma proteomics workflow. Moreover, the data suggest P/NP plays a significant role in determining the in vivo fate of nanomaterials in biomedical applications. Together, the study showcases the importance of P/NP as a key design element for biomaterials and nanomedicine in vivo and as a powerful tuning strategy for accurate, large&#8208;scale NP&#8208;based deep proteomic studies.

         <title>Carbon Surface Chemistry: New Insight into the Old Story</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significant progress in the synthesis of novel carbon materials and the promising prospects of their applications in various advanced areas bring an unprecedented boom in the carbon community. In this work, properties of different defective structures related to carbon surface chemistry, which may lead to an important influence on their performance without being noticed, are discussed.








Abstract
The enormous complexity of the carbon material family has provoked a phenomenological approach to develop its potential in different applications. Although the electronic, chemical, mechanical, and magnetic properties of carbon materials have been widely discussed based on defect control engineering, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of the carbon surface chemistry, which leads to many controversial conclusions. Here, by analyzing various defects on carbon surface, some commonly neglected aspects and misunderstandings in this field are pointed out, clarifying how surface chemistry affects the chemical behaviors of carbon in some specific chemical reactions. With this full&#8208;scale consideration of the carbon surface chemistry, the behaviors of carbon materials with various functions can be well defined, which is indispensable for their scalable applications. Perspectives on future developments of carbon surface chemistry are also provided to enable practically accessible design of advanced carbon in those applications.

         <title>Macroscopic Heterostructure Membrane of Graphene Oxide /Porous Graphene/Graphene Oxide for Selective Separation of Deuterium Water from Natural Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Deuterium water (D2O) is strategic material that is widely used in nuclear weapons, civilian nuclear energy, and scientific research. However, its content in natural water is extremely low. Therefore, the development of a room temperature technology for achieving simple, efficient, and low&#8208;cost separation of D2O from natural water is challenging. In this study, porous graphene (PG) nanosheets with &#8220;crater&#8208;like&#8221; pores were sandwiched between two layers of graphene oxide (GO) membranes to prepare a GO/PG/GO membrane with a macroscopic heterostructure, which can be used to separate D2O and H2O by pressure&#8208;driven filtration. At 25 &#176;C, the rejection rate of D2O was approximately 97%, the selectivity of H2O/D2O was approximately 35.2, and the excellent performance could be attributed to the difference of transmembrane resistance and flow state of H2O and D2O in the confinement state. In addition, the D2O concentration in natural water was successfully enriched from 0.013% to 0.059% using only one stage and the membrane exhibited excellent structural and cycling stability. Therefore, this method did not require ultra&#8208;low temperatures, high energy supplies, complex separation equipment, or the introduction of toxic chemicals. Thus, it can be directly applied to the large&#8208;scale industrial production and removal of D2O.

         <title>Making Highly Elastic and Tough Hydrogels from Doughs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A hydrogel is often fabricated from preexisting polymer chains by covalently crosslinking them into a polymer network. The crosslinks make the hydrogel swell&#8208;resistant but brittle. This conflict is resolved here by making a hydrogel from a dough. The dough is formed by mixing long polymer chains with a small amount of water and photoinitiator. The dough is then homogenized by kneading and annealing at elevated temperatures, during which the crowded polymer chains densely entangle. The polymer chains are then sparsely crosslinked into a polymer network under an ultraviolet lamp, and submerged in water to swell to equilibrium. The resulting hydrogel is both swell&#8208;resistant and tough. The hydrogel also has near&#8208;perfect elasticity, high strength, high fatigue resistance, and low friction. The method is demonstrated with widely used polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) and cellulose. These hydrogels have never been made swell&#8208;resistant, elastic, and tough before. The method is generally applicable to synthetic and natural polymers, and is compatible with industrial processing technologies, opening doors to the development of sustainable, high&#8208;performance hydrogels.

         <title>Unique Role of GeO2 as a Noninvasive Promoter of Nano&#8208;sized Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The synthesis of zeolites with nano&#8208;sized dimensions is often limited to a narrow design space that conventionally relies upon the design of organics to direct hierarchical materials. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of an inorganic modifier, germanium oxide, to a zeolite growth mixture directs the formation of crystals with ultra&#8208;small dimensions. This effect was observed for both MEL&#8208; and MFI&#8208;type frameworks over a range of synthesis conditions wherein the role of GeO2 in zeolite crystallization deviates from its typical function as a heteroatom. Notably, the final products contain trace amounts of Ge, which indicates the inorganic modifier does not compete for sites in the zeolite framework based on its formation of a discrete phase that enables GeO2 recovery. Catalytic tests using the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction reveal significant enhancement in the performance of zeolite catalysts prepared with GeO2 compared to reported examples of nano&#8208;sized MFI and MEL zeolites. These findings highlight a potentially generalizable and commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass transport limitations in zeolites for diverse applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Polymeric Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Chemotherapy Potentiates Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy via Amplification of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction</title>

Abstract
Construction of multifunctional nanoplatforms to elevate chemotherapeutic efficacy and induce long&#8208;term antitumor immunity still remains to be an extreme challenge. Herein, we report the design of an advanced redox&#8208;responsive nanomedicine formulation based on phosphorus dendrimer&#8208;copper(II) complexes (1G3&#8208;Cu)&#8208; and toyocamycin (Toy)&#8208;loaded polymeric nanoparticles (GCT NPs) coated with cancer cell membranes (CM). The designed GCT@CM NPs with a size of 210 nm are stable under a physiological condition but are rapidly dissociated in the reductive tumor microenvironment to deplete glutathione and release drugs. The co&#8208;loading of 1G3&#8208;Cu and Toy within the NPs causes significant tumor cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death through 1G3&#8208;Cu&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction and Toy&#8208;mediated amplification of endoplasmic reticulum stress, respectively, thus effectively suppressing tumor growth, promoting dendritic cell maturation, and increasing tumor&#8208;infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Likewise, the coated CM and the loaded 1G3&#8208;Cu render the GCT@CM NPs with homotypic targeting and T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging of tumors, respectively. With the assistance of programmed cell death ligand 1 antibody, the GCT@CM NP&#8208;mediated chemotherapy can significantly potentiate tumor immunotherapy for effective inhibition of tumor recurrence and metastasis. The developed GCT@CM NPs hold a great potential for chemotherapy&#8208;potentiated immunotherapy of different tumor types through different mechanisms or synergies.

         <title>Engineering Electro&#8208;Optic BaTiO3 Nanocrystals via Efficient Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electro&#8208;optic (EO) modulators provide electrical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal conversion relevant to optical communications. Barium titanate (BaTiO3) is a promising material system for EO modulation in light of its optical ultrafast nonlinearity, low optical loss, and high refractive index. To enhance further its spontaneous polarization, BaTiO3 can be doped at the Ba and Ti sites; however, doping is often accompanied by ion migration, which diminishes EO performance. Here we investigate donor&#8208;acceptor doping and its effect on EO efficiency, finding that La&#8208;doped BaTiO3 achieves an EO coefficient of 42 pm/V at 1&#160;kHz, fully twice that of the pristine specimen; however, we also observe that, with this single&#8208;element doping, the EO response falls off rapidly with frequency. From impedance spectroscopy, we find that frequency&#8208;dependent EO is correlated with ion migration. Density functional theory calculations predict that the ion migration barrier decreases with La3+ doping but can be recovered with further Mn2+ doping, a finding that prompts us to prevent ion migration by incorporating Mn2+ into the Ti&#8208;site to compensate for the charge imbalance.

         <title>Multi Jet Fusion 3D voxel printing of conductive elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) voxel printing enables site&#8208;specific variation of materials and properties at a voxel scale in one printed part, but it is currently limited to building voxelated parts with varying mechanical properties and colors. Here, we report the design and fabrication of voxelated conductive elastomers using Multi Jet Fusion 3D voxel printing actualized by a newly developed multifunctional agent (MA). The MA mainly consists of carbon nanotubes and poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate, serving as an infrared absorbing colorant, reinforcement, and conductive fillers. By controlling drop&#8208;on&#8208;demand agent dispensing on thermoplastic polyurethane powder, a wide range of electrical conductivity, ranging from 10&#8211;10 S/cm to 10&#8211;1 S/cm, can be tailored across a single printed part at a voxel resolution of &#8764;100&#160;&#956;m. Assembly&#8208;free strain sensors comprising conductive sensing layers and insulating frames are fabricated to demonstrate the capability of the technique in manufacturing all&#8208;printed wearable devices.

         <title>Greenificated Molecularly Imprinted Materials for Advanced Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greenificated molecularly imprinted polymers (GMIPs), possessing the potential to meet all current &#8220;sustainability&#8221; requirements, are being intensively developed to solve the key issues related to revolutionary technologies. Herein, a comprehensive review of the advanced applications of GMIPs in fast&#8208;growing and emerging fields is summarized, involving &#8220;GREENIFICATION&#8221; principles, preparation strategies, GMIPs&#8217; features, obscure technical challenges, critical thoughts, and prospective trends.








Abstract
Molecular imprinting technology (MIT) produces artificial binding sites with precise complementarity to substrates and thereby is capable of exquisite molecular recognition. Over five decades of evolution, it is predicted that the resulting host imprinted materials will overtake natural receptors for research and application purposes, but in practice, this has not yet been realized due to the unsustainability of their life cycles (i.e., precursors, creation, use, recycling, and end&#8208;of&#8208;life). To address this issue, greenificated molecularly imprinted polymers (GMIPs) are a new class of plastic antibodies that have approached sustainability by following one or more of the greenification principles, while also demonstrating more far&#8208;reaching applications compared to their natural counterparts. In this review, the most recent developments in the delicate design and advanced application of GMIPs in six fast&#8208;growing and emerging fields are surveyed, namely biomedicine/therapy, catalysis, energy harvesting/storage, nanoparticle detection, gas sensing/adsorption, and environmental remediation. In addition, their distinct features are highlighted, and the optimal means to utilize these features for attaining incredibly far&#8208;reaching applications are discussed. Importantly, the obscure technical challenges of the greenificated MIT are revealed, and conceivable solutions are offered. Lastly, several perspectives on future research directions are proposed.

Self&#8208;doping is a particular doping method that has been applied to a wide range of organic semiconductors. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding the relationship between dopant structure and function. A structurally diverse series of self&#8208;n&#8208;doped perylene diimides (PDIs) is investigated to study the impact of steric encumbrance, counterion selection, and dopant/PDI tether distance on functional parameters such as doping, stability, morphology, and charge&#8208;carrier mobility. The studies show that self&#8208;n&#8208;doping is best enabled by the use of sterically encumbered ammoniums with short tethers and Lewis basic counterions. Additionally, water is found to inhibit doping, which concludes that thermal degradation is merely a phenomenological feature of certain dopants, and that residual solvent evaporation is the primary driver of thermally activated doping. In situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering studies show that sample annealing increases the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance and shrinks grain boundaries for improved long&#8208;range ordering. These features are then correlated to contactless carrier&#8208;mobility measurements with time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity before and after thermal annealing. The collective relationships between structural features and functionality are finally used to establish explicit self&#8208;n&#8208;dopant design principles for the future design of materials with improved functionality.

         <title>Thermoformable Boron Nitride Based All&#8208;Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically insulating thermoformable ceramic matrix composites, for low&#8208;profile thermal management, take advantage of phononic conducting networks to transport heat from the heat source. This advancement and new field of study outlined in this work, show significant promise to enable size reduction and effective cooling advantage over the incumbent aluminum metal heat sinks.








Abstract
Thermoforming processing, traditionally reserved for thermoplastic polymers and sheet metals, is extended here to boron&#8208;based all&#8208;ceramics. Specifically, sintered boron nitride composite sheets manufactured via a combined vibration and tape&#8208;casting photopolymerization process exhibit a highly oriented microstructure that allows these preform sheets to flow as viscous Bingham pseudoplastics during compression molding. These sintered all&#8208;ceramic preforms are thermoformed into thin, complex parts with features down to 200&#160;&#181;m. Further, a new workflow is leveraged to generate bespoke all&#8208;ceramic heat spreaders that can be press&#8208;fit onto printed circuit boards and outperform metal heat sinks as a low&#8208;profile thermal management solution. This work offers a route for other all&#8208;ceramics that may be thermoformed through first fabricating pre&#8208;forms with highly&#8208;ordered anisotropic microstructures.

         <title>Effect of Magnetic Impurities on Superconductivity in LaH10</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anderson's theorem states that nonmagnetic impurities do not affect the isotropic order parameter in Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors, whereas scattering on paramagnetic centers is very efficient in destroying the s&#8208;wave superconductivity. This work&#160;demonstrates that LaH10, the best so far known superconductor, obeys Anderson's theorem, which makes it possible to adjust its critical temperature for a specific application.








Abstract
Polyhydrides are a novel class of superconducting materials with extremely high critical parameters, which is very promising for sensor applications. On the other hand, a complete experimental study of the best so far known superconductor, lanthanum superhydride LaH10, encounters a serious complication because of the large upper critical magnetic field HC2(0), exceeding 120&#8211;160&#160;T. It is found that partial replacement of La atoms by magnetic Nd atoms results in significant suppression of superconductivity in LaH10: each at% of Nd causes a decrease in TC by 10&#8211;11&#160;K, helping to control the critical parameters of this compound. Strong pulsed magnetic fields up to 68&#160;T are used to study the Hall effect, magnetoresistance, and the magnetic phase diagram of ternary metal polyhydrides for the first time. Surprisingly, (La,Nd)H10 demonstrates completely linear HC2(T)&#160;&#8733;&#160;|T &#8211;&#160;TC|, which calls into question the applicability of the Werthamer&#8211;Helfand&#8211;Hohenberg model for polyhydrides. The suppression of superconductivity in LaH10 by magnetic Nd atoms and the robustness of TC with respect to nonmagnetic impurities (e.g., Y, Al, C) under Anderson's theorem gives new experimental evidence of the isotropic (s&#8208;wave) character of conventional electron&#8211;phonon pairing in lanthanum decahydride.

         <title>Biomimetic dendrite&#8208;free multivalent metal batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable multivalent metal (e.g., zinc (Zn) and aluminum (Al)) batteries are ideal choices for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their intrinsic low cost and safety. However, the poor compatibility between metallic anodes and electrolytes strongly hampers their practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate that confining multivalent metals in a biomimetic scaffold (Bio&#8208;scaffold) can achieve highly efficient multivalent metal plating/stripping. This Bio&#8208;scaffold is well&#8208;tailored through the synergy of a parallel&#8208;aligned array of fractal copper branches and a CaTiO3 (CTO)&#8208;based coating layer. By virtue of this design strategy, the as&#8208;developed Bio&#8208;scaffold&#8208;based Zn and Al metal anodes exhibited dendrite&#8208;free morphologies with high reversibility and long lifespan, as well as excellent performance for Zn and Al full batteries. Theoretical modeling and experimental investigations reveal that the fractal copper array not only facilitates multivalent ion diffusion and electrolyte wetting, but also effectively reduces the local current densities during cycling; Meanwhile, the CTO&#8208;based coating layer effectively blocks interfacial side reactions and enables a homogeneous ionic flux. This work opens a new avenue for developing multivalent metal batteries.

         <title>Understanding H2 evolution electrochemistry to minimize solvated water impact on zinc anode performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
H2 evolution is the reason for poor reversibility and limited cycle stability with Zn metal anodes, and impedes practical application in aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIB). Here we demonstrate for the first time, using combined gas chromatography experiment and computation, that H2 evolution primarily originates from solvated water, rather than free water without interaction with Zn2+. We evidence, using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in salt electrolytes that H2 evolution occurs at a more negative potential than zinc reduction because of high overpotential against H2 evolution on Zn metal. We test our hypothesis and confirm, using glycine additive to reduce solvated water, that H2 evolution and &#8220;parasitic&#8221; side reactions are suppressed on the Zn anode. We evidence that this electrolyte additive suppresses H2 evolution, reduces corrosion and gives a uniform Zn deposition in Zn|Zn and Zn|Cu cells when compared with bare ZnSO4 electrolyte. We demonstrate Zn|PANI (highly conductive polyaniline) full cells exhibit boosted electrochemical performance in 1&#160;M ZnSO4&#8208;3&#160;M glycine electrolyte and, a high reversible capacity of 100 mAh g&#8722;1 in a practical Zn|PANI pouch cell. We conclude that this new understanding of electrochemistry of H2 evolution can be used for design of relatively low&#8208;cost and safe AZIB for practical large&#8208;scale energy storage. Findings will be of immediate benefit in electrolyte design for high performance rechargeable batteries and therefore of wide interest to researchers and manufacturers.

         <title>Stable Sodium Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes Achieved by Bifunctional, Sustainable Separators with Tailored Alignment</title>

Abstract
Sodium (Na) is the most appealing alternative to lithium as an anode material for cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage systems by virtue of its high theoretical capacity and abundance as a resource. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na dendrites and the limited cell cycle life impede the large&#8208;scale practical implementation of Na&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) in commonly&#8208;used and low&#8208;cost carbonate electrolytes. Herein, the employment of a novel bifunctional electrospun nanofibrous separator comprising the well&#8208;ordered, uniaxially&#8208;aligned arrays and abundant sodiophilic functional groups is presented for SMBs. By tailoring the alignment degree, this unique separator integrates with the merits of serving as highly&#8208;aligned ion&#8208;redistributors to self&#8208;orientate/homogenize the Na&#8208;ions flux from a chemical molecule level and physically suppressing the Na dendrites puncture at a mechanical structure level. Remarkably, unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performances at high current densities (&#8805; 1000&#160;h at 1 and 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, &#8805; 700&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) of symmetric cells are achieved in additive&#8208;free carbonate electrolytes. Moreover, the corresponding sodium&#8208;organic battery demonstrates a high energy density and prolonged cyclability over 1000 cycles. This work opens up a new and facile avenue for the development of stable, low&#8208;cost, and safe&#8208;credible SMBs, which could be readily extended to other alkali&#8208;metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Sodium (Na) is the most appealing alternative to lithium as an anode material for cost-effective, high-energy-density energy storage systems by virtue of its high theoretical capacity and abundance as a resource. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na dendrites and the limited cell cycle life impede the large-scale practical implementation of Na-metal batteries (SMBs) in commonly-used and low-cost carbonate electrolytes. Herein, the employment of a novel bifunctional electrospun nanofibrous separator comprising the well-ordered, uniaxially-aligned arrays and abundant sodiophilic functional groups is presented for SMBs. By tailoring the alignment degree, this unique separator integrates with the merits of serving as highly-aligned ion-redistributors to self-orientate/homogenize the Na-ions flux from a chemical molecule level and physically suppressing the Na dendrites puncture at a mechanical structure level. Remarkably, unprecedented long-term cycling performances at high current densities (&#8805; 1000&#160;h at 1 and 3&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &#8805; 700&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of symmetric cells are achieved in additive-free carbonate electrolytes.

         <title>Impact of Planar and Vertical Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors on Flexible Electronics</title>

Abstract
The development of flexible and conformable devices, whose performance can be maintained while being continuously deformed, provides a significant step towards the realization of next&#8208;generation wearable and e&#8208;textiles applications. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are particularly interesting for flexible and lightweight products, because of their low&#8208;temperature solution processability, and the mechanical flexibility of organic materials that endows OFETs the natural compatibility with plastic and biodegradable substrates. Here, an in&#8208;depth review of two competing flexible OFET technologies, planar and vertical OFETs (POFETs and VOFETs, respectively) is provided. The electrical, mechanical, and physical properties of POFETs and VOFETs are critically discussed, with a focus on four pivotal applications (integrated logic circuits, light&#8208;emitting devices, memories, and sensors). It is pointed out that the flexible function of the relatively newer VOFET technology, along with its perspective on advancing the applicability of flexible POFETs, has not been reviewed so far, and the direct comparison regarding the performance of POFET&#8208; and VOFET&#8208;based flexible applications is most likely absent. With discussions spanning printed and wearable electronics, materials science, biotechnology, and environmental monitoring, this contribution is a clear stimulus to researchers working in these fields to engage towards the plentiful possibilities that POFETs and VOFETs offer to flexible electronics.

         <title>Antiferromagnetic Inverse Spin Hall Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) is one of the accessible and reliable methods to detect spin current. ISHE signals dependent on the N&#233;el vector in Mn2Au/[Co/Pd] are observed, and they are much stronger when the converted charge current is parallel to the N&#233;el vector compared with its orthogonal counterpart. The finding enriches the Hall effect family, and makes antiferromagnetic spintronics more flexible.








Abstract
The inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) is one of the accessible and reliable methods to detect spin current. The magnetization&#8208;dependent inverse spin Hall effect has been observed in magnets, expanding the dimension for spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. However, antiferromagnetic N&#233;el&#8208;vector&#8208;dependent ISHE, which has been long time highly pursued, is still elusive. Here, ISHE in Mn2Au/[Co/Pd] heterostructures is investigated by terahertz emission and spin Seebeck effect measurements, where [Co/Pd] possesses perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized spin current generation and Mn2Au is a collinear antiferromagnet for the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization (&#963;z) is rotated toward in&#8208;plane by the N&#233;el vectors in Mn2Au, then the spin current is converted into charge current at two staggered spin sublattices. The ISHE signal is much stronger when the converted charge current is parallel to the N&#233;el vector compared with its orthogonal counterpart. The N&#233;el vector and resultant ISHE signals, which is termed as antiferromagnetic inverse spin Hall effect, can be switched. The finding not only adds a new member to the Hall effect family, but also makes antiferromagnetic spintronics more flexible.

&lt;p&gt;The inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) is one of the accessible and reliable methods to detect spin current. The magnetization-dependent inverse spin Hall effect has been observed in magnets, expanding the dimension for spin-to-charge conversion.

         <title>A Universal Chemotactic Targeted Delivery Strategy for Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Above 50% of deaths can be attributed to chronic inflammatory diseases, thus the construction of drug delivery system based on effective interaction of inflammatory factors with chemotactic nanoparticles is meaningful. Herein, we propose a zwitterion&#8208;based artificial chemotactic nanomotor for universal precise targeting strategy in vivo, where the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in inflammatory sites are used as chemoattractants. And the multi&#8208;dimensional static models, dynamic models and in vivo models are established to evaluate chemotactic performance. Results show that the up&#8208;regulated ROS and iNOS can induce the chemotaxis of nanomotors to diseased tissues in inflammation&#8208;related disease models. Further, the mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations are performed to explain the chemotactic behavior of nanomotors. Such chemotactic delivery strategy is expected to improve the delivery efficiency and may be applicable to a variety of inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Nanomaterials Mediated Co&#8208;Stimulation of toll&#8208;like Receptors and CD40 for Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Toll&#8208;like Receptors (TLRs) and CD40 related&#8208;signaling pathways represent critical bridges between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Here, we develop an immunotherapy regimen that enables co&#8208;stimulation of TLR7/8 and CD40 mediated pathways. TLR7/8 agonist resiquimod (R848) derived amino lipids, RAL1 and RAL2, are synthesized and formulated into RAL&#8208;derived lipid nanoparticles (RAL&#8208;LNPs). The RAL2&#8208;LNPs show efficient CD40 mRNA delivery to DCs both in vitro (90.8 &#177; 2.7%) and in vivo (61.3 &#177; 16.4%). When combined with agonistic anti&#8208;CD40 antibody, this approach can produce effective antitumor activities in mouse melanoma tumor models, thereby suppressing tumor growth, prolonging mouse survival, and establishing antitumor memory immunity. Overall, RAL2&#8208;LNPs provide a novel platform towards cancer immunotherapy by integrating innate and adaptive immunity.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Realizing both ultra&#8208;low breakdown voltage and ultra&#8208;high gain has been one of the major challenges in the development of high&#8208;performance avalanche photodetector. Here, we report that an ultra&#8208;high avalanche gain of 3 &#215; 105 can be realized in the graphite/InSe Schottky photodetector at a breakdown voltage down to 5.5 V. Remarkably, the threshold breakdown voltage can be further reduced down to 1.8 V by raising the operating temperature, approaching the theoretical limit of 1.5Eg${\mathcal{E}_g}$/e with Eg${\mathcal{E}_g}$ the band gap of semiconductor. We develop a two&#8208;dimensional impact ionization model and uncover that observation of high gain at low breakdown voltage arises from reduced dimensionality of electron&#8208;phonon (e&#8208;ph) scattering in the layered InSe flake. Our findings open up a promising avenue for developing novel weak&#8208;light detectors with low energy consumption and high sensitivity.

         <title>Electric&#8208;field&#8208;reinforced Hydrophobic Cationic Sieve Lowers the Concentration Threshold of Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolytes</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;concentration Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt (WIS) electrolytes expand the stable electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes, leading to the advent of high&#8208;voltage (above 2&#160;V) aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries (ALIBs). However, the high lithium salt concentration electrolytes of ALIBs results in their high cost and deteriorates kinetic performance. Therefore, it is challenging for ALIBs to explore aqueous electrolytes with appropriate concentration to balance the electrochemical window and kinetic performance as well as the cost. In contrast to maintaining high concentrations of aqueous electrolytes (&gt;20 m), we introduced a small number of hydrophobic cations to a much lower electrolyte concentration (13.8 m) and found that, compared with WIS electrolytes, ALIBs with these concentration&#8208;lowered electrolytes possess a compatible stable electrochemical window (3.23&#160;V) and achieve better kinetic performance. These findings originate from the added cations, which form an electric&#8208;field&#8208;reinforced hydrophobic cationic sieve (HCS) that blocks water away from the anode and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the lower electrolyte concentration provides significant benefits to ALIBs, including lower cost, better rate capability (lower viscosity of 18 cP and higher ionic conductivity of 22 mS/cm at 25 &#730;C), and improved low&#8208;temperature performance (liquidus temperature of &#8208;10.18 &#730;C).

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Amorphous Porous Polymers for Rapid Adsorption of Micro&#8208;pollutants and Solar&#8208;Powered Volatile Organic Compounds Management</title>

Abstract
Freshwater shortage is becoming one of the most critical global challenges owing to severe water pollution caused by micropollutants and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, current purification technology shows slow adsorption of micropollutants and requires energy&#8208;intensive process for VOCs removal from water. In this study, a highly efficient molecularly engineered covalent triazine framework (CTF) for rapid adsorption of micropollutants and VOC&#8208;intercepting performance using solar distillation is reported. Supramolecular design and mild oxidation of CTFs (CTF&#8208;OXs) enable hydrophilic internal channels and improve molecular sieving of micropollutants. CTF&#8208;OX shows rapid removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt; 99.9% in 10 s) and could be regenerated several times without performance loss. Uptake rates of selected micropollutants are high, with initial pollutant uptake rates of 21.9&#160;g mg&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, which are the highest rates recorded for bisphenol A (BPA) adsorption. Additionally, photothermal composite membrane fabrication using CTF&#8208;OX exhibits high VOC rejection rate (up to 98%) under 1 sun irradiation (1&#160;kW m&#8722;2). A prototype of synergistic purification system composed of adsorption and solar&#8208;driven membrane can efficiently remove over 99.9% of mixed phenol derivatives. This study provides an effective strategy for rapid removal of micropollutants and high VOC rejection via solar&#8208;driven evaporation process.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
As an essential micronutrient, manganese (Mn) participates in various physiological processes, and plays important roles in host immune system, hematopoiesis, endocrine function, and oxidative stress regulation. Mn&#8208;based nanoparticles are considered to be biocompatible and shown versatile applications in nanomedicine, in particular utilized in tumor immunotherapy in the following ways: (1) acting as a biocompatible nanocarrier to deliver immunotherapeutic agents for tumor immunotherapy; (2) serving as an adjuvant to regulate tumor immune microenvironment and enhance immunotherapy; (3) activating host's immune system through the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to trigger tumor immunotherapy; (4) real&#8208;time monitoring tumor immunotherapy effect by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since Mn2+ ions are ideal MRI contrast agent which can significantly enhance the T1&#8208;weighted MRI signal after binding to proteins. This comprehensive review focuses on the most recent progress of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms in tumor immunotherapy. The characteristics of Mn are first discussed to guide the design of Mn&#8208;based multifunctional nanoplatforms. Then the biomedical applications of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy&#8208;involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging&#8208;guided immunotherapy are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and future developments of Mn&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy are highlighted.

         <title>Polaritons in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayers supporting a wide variety of highly confined plasmons, phonon polaritons, and exciton polaritons can be vertically stacked in vdWHs with controlled constituent layers, stacking sequence, and even twist angles. Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) combine advantages of 2D material polaritons, rich optical structure design and atomic scale integration, which have greatly extended the performance and functions of polaritons, such as wide frequency range, long lifetime, ultrafast all&#8208;optical modulation, and photonic crystals for nanoscale light. Here, we review the state of the art of 2D material polaritons in vdWHs from the perspective of design principles and potential applications. We start by discussing some fundamental properties of polaritons in vdWHs, and then cover recent discoveries of plasmons, phonon polaritons, exciton polaritons and their hybrid modes in vdWHs, respectively. We conclude with a perspective discussion on potential applications of these polaritons such as nanophotonic integrated circuits, which will benefit from the intersection between nanophotonics and materials science.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Sb Rhombohedron with Unconventional Rhombohedral Phase as Trifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Crystal phase engineering is an important strategy for designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts with optimized activity and stability. From the thermodynamic point of view, it remains a great challenge to synthesize unconventional phases of noble metals. Here, a new class of Pd&#8208;based nanostructure with unconventional rhombohedral Pd20Sb7 phase has been successfully synthesized. Benefiting from the high proportion of the unique exposed Pd20Sb7 (003) surface, Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra display much enhanced ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance compared with commercial Pd/C. Moreover, Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra are also demonstrated as effective air cathode in non&#8208;aqueous Li&#8211;air battery with an overpotential of only 0.24&#160;V. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unique exposed facets of Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra can not only reduce the excessive adsorption of CH3CO* to CH3COOH on Pd for promoting EOR process, but also weaken the CO binding and CO poisoning. This work provides a new class of unconventional intermetallic nanomaterials with enhanced electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Ru doping Induced Spin Frustration and Enhancement of the Room&#8208;temperature Anomalous Hall effect in La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 films</title>

Abstract
In transition&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide heterostructures, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a powerful tool for detecting the magnetic state and revealing intriguing interfacial magnetic orderings. However, achieving a larger AHE at room temperature in oxide heterostructures is still challenging due to the dilemma of mutually strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and magnetic exchange interactions. Here, we exploit the Ru doping&#8208;enhanced AHE in La2/3Sr1/3Mn1&#8208;xRuxO3 epitaxial films. As the B&#8208;site Ru doping level increases up to 20%, the anomalous Hall resistivity at room temperature can be enhanced from n&#937;&#8729;cm to &#956;&#937;&#8729;cm scale. Ru doping leads to strong competition between ferromagnetic double&#8208;exchange interaction and antiferromagnetic super&#8208;exchange interaction. The resultant spin frustration and spin&#8208;glass state facilitate a strong skew&#8208;scattering process, thus significantly enhancing the extrinsic AHE. Our findings could pave a feasible approach for boosting the controllability and reliability of oxide&#8208;based spintronic devices.

         <title>Optical Memory, Switching, and Neuromorphic Functionality in Metal Halide Perovskite Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskite&#8208;based materials have emerged over the past few decades as remarkable solution&#8208;processable opto&#8208;electronic materials with many intriguing properties and potential applications. These emerging materials have recently been considered for their promise in low&#8208;energy memory and information processing applications. In particular, their large optical cross&#8208;sections, high photoconductance contrast, large carrier diffusion lengths, and mixed electronic/ionic transport mechanisms are attractive for enabling memory elements and neuromorphic devices that are written and/or read in the optical domain. Here, we review recent progress towards memory and neuromorphic functionality in metal halide perovskite materials and devices where photons are used as a critical degree of freedom for switching, memory, and neuromorphic functionality.

         <title>Janus Helical Ribbon Structure of Ordered Nanowire Films for Flexible Solar Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar thermoelectric devices play a significant role in handling the global warming problem, owing to its unique feature of converting both waste heat and solar energy directly into electricity. Herein, we design a flexible three&#8208;dimensional Janus helical&#160;ribbon architecture starting from well&#8208;aligned tellurium (Te) nanowire film, using an in&#8208;situ redox process reacting with Ag+ and Cu2+ resulting in the n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one film. Remarkably, the device shows all&#8208;day electricity generation and large temperature gradient by coupling cold side with passive radiative cooling technique and hot side with selective solar absorption technique, showing a temperature gradient of 29.5 K which is much higher than previously reported devices under low solar radiation of only 614&#160;W m&#8722;2. Interestingly, the device can still generate electricity even at night. The present designed strategy offers a new way for heat management by efficiently utilizing solar energy and the cold of the universe.

         <title>Observation of H2 Evolution and Electrolyte Diffusion on MoS2 Monolayer by in situ Liquid&#8208;phase Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Unit cell&#8208;thick MoS2 is a promising electrocatalyst for a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to its tunable catalytic activity, which has been determined based on the energetics and molecular interactions of different types of HER active sites. Kinetic responses of MoS2 active sites, including the reaction onset, diffusion of the electrolyte and H2 bubbles, and continuation of these processes, are important factors affecting the catalytic activity of MoS2. Investigating these factors requires a direct real&#8208;time analysis of the HER occurring on spatially independent active sites. Herein, the H2 evolution and electrolyte diffusion on the MoS2 surface are observed in real time by in situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM). Time&#8208;dependent LPTEM observations reveal that different types of active sites are sequentially activated under the same conditions. Furthermore, the electrolyte flow to these sites is influenced by the reduction potential and site geometry, which affects the bubble detachment and overall HER activity of MoS2.

         <title>Rapid Regeneration of A Neoartery with Elastic Lamellae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Native arteries contain a distinctive intima&#8208;media comprised of organized elastin and an adventitia containing mature collagen fibrils. In contrast, implanted biodegradable small&#8208;diameter vascular grafts do not present spatially regenerated, organized elastin. The elastin&#8208;containing structures within the intima&#8208;media region encompass the elastic lamellae (EL) and internal elastic lamina (IEL) and are crucial for normal arterial function. Here, we describe the development of a novel electrospun small&#8208;diameter vascular graft that facilitates de novo formation of a structurally appropriate elastin&#8208;containing intima&#8208;media region following implantation. The graft comprise a non&#8208;porous microstructure characterized by tropoelastin fibers that are embedded in a PGS matrix. After implantation in mouse abdominal aorta, the graft develops distinct cell and extracellular matrix profiles that approximate the native adventitia and intima&#8208;media by 8 weeks. Within the newly formed intima&#8208;media region there are circumferentially aligned smooth muscle cell layers that alternate with multiple EL similar to that found in the arterial wall. By 8 months, the developed adventitia region contains mature collagen fibrils and the neoartery presents a distinct IEL with thickness comparable to that in mouse abdominal aorta. We propose that this new class of material can generate the critically required, organized elastin needed for arterial regeneration.

         <title>Spintronic Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Field&#8208;free Spin&#8208;orbit Torque Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Physically unclonable function (PUF) utilizes inherent random physical variations of solid&#8208;state devices and is a core ingredient of hardware security primitives. PUF promises more robust information security than that provided by the conventional software&#8208;based approaches. While silicon&#8208; and memristor&#8208;based PUFs are advancing, their reliability and scalability require further improvements. These are currently limited by output fluctuations and associated additional peripherals. Here, we demonstrate highly reliable spintronic PUFs that exploit field&#8208;free spin&#8208;orbit torque switching in IrMn/CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB structures. We show that the stochastic switching polarity of the perpendicular magnetization of the top CoFeB can be achieved by manipulating the exchange bias directions of the bottom IrMn/CoFeB. This serves as an entropy source for the spintronic PUF, which is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability and digital output. Furthremore, our device ensures a zero bit&#8208;error&#8208;rate under repetitive operations and robustness against external magnetic fields, and offers scalable and energy&#8208;efficient device implementations.

Furthremore, our device ensures a zero bit-error-rate under repetitive operations and robustness against external magnetic fields, and offers scalable and energy-efficient device implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Heterogeneous&#8208;Interface&#8208;Enhanced Adsorption of Organic and Hydroxyl for Biomass Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CuO&#8211;PdO heterogeneous interface, which exhibits a low onset potential of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction and high current density, is successfully synthesized. The analytical results show that the CuO&#8211;PdO heterogeneous interface can strengthen the adsorption and activation capacity of organic molecules and OH&#8722; species, and promote the dehydrogenation and electron transfer in the process of 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid&#8594;2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides an efficient way to obtain high&#8208;value&#8208;added biomass&#8208;derived chemicals.&#160;Compared with other transition metal oxides, CuO exhibits poor oxygen evolution reaction performance, leading to high Faraday efficiency for HMF oxidation.&#160;However, the weak adsorption and activation ability of CuO to OH&#8722; species restricts its further development. Herein, the CuO&#8211;PdO heterogeneous interface is successfully constructed, resulting in an advanced onset&#8208;potential of the HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR), a higher current density than CuO. The results of open&#8208;circuit potential, in&#160;situ infrared spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations indicate that the introduction of PdO enhances the adsorption capacity of the organic molecule.&#160;Meanwhile, the CuO&#8211;PdO heterogeneous interface promotes the adsorption and activation of OH&#8722; species, as demonstrated by zeta potential and electrochemical measurements. This work elucidates the adsorption enhancement mechanism of heterogeneous interfaces and provides constructive guidance for designing efficient multicomponent electrocatalysts in organic electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Exceptionally High Saturation Magnetic Flux Density and Ultralow Coercivity via an Amorphous&#8211;Nanocrystalline Transitional Microstructure in an FeCo&#8208;Based Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative compositional design concept enables the construction of a unique transitional microstructure between traditional amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys, which results in an alloy with an unprecedented combination of exceptionally high saturation magnetic flux density (Bs&#160;= 1.94 T) and ultralow coercivity (Hc&#160;= 4.3 A m&#8722;1), breaking the general trade&#8208;off between Bs and Hc in the soft&#8208;magnetic&#8208;material family.








Abstract
High saturation magnetic flux density (Bs) of soft magnetic materials is essential for increasing the power density of modern magnetic devices and motor machines. Yet, increasing Bs is always at the expense of high coercivity (Hc), presenting a general trade&#8208;off in the soft magnetic material family. Here, superior comprehensive soft magnetic properties, i.e., an exceptionally high Bs of up to 1.94 T and Hc as low as 4.3 A m&#8722;1 are unprecedentedly combined in an FeCo&#8208;based alloy. This alloy is obtained through a composition design strategy to construct a transitional microstructure between amorphous and traditional nanocrystalline alloys, with nanocrystals (with &lt; 5 nm&#8208;sized crystal&#8208;like regions around) sparsely dispersed in an amorphous matrix. Such transitional microstructure possesses extremely low magnetic anisotropy caused by the annihilation of quasi&#8208;dislocation dipoles, and a strong magnetic exchange interaction, which leads to excellent comprehensive magnetic properties. The results provide useful guidelines for the development of the next generation of soft magnetic materials, which are promising for applications of high&#8208;frequency, high&#8208;efficiency, and energy&#8208;saving devices.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Transitional Bismuth&#8208;Based Metals enable Rapid Embolotherapy, Hyperthermia, and Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional bismuth&#8208;based liquid embolic agent with rapid liquid&#8211;solid phase transition is proposed for administrating simultaneous embolotherapy, hyperthermia, and biomedical imaging. This high&#8208;image&#8208;contrast material is demonstrated with fast embolization of arteriovenous vessels and tumor nutrient supply vessels and enhanced treatment efficacy via combination with hyperthermia, which holds big promises in future embolism and theranostic platform.








Abstract
Embolization has been an important minimally invasive therapy for occlusion of malfunctioned vasculature and tumor treatment via target delivering embolic agents. The limitation of conventional embolic agents, such as fabrication process, precipitation time, invisibility, and lack of integrated functions often leads to insufficient embolization efficacy. To overcome these drawbacks, a multifunctional bismuth (Bi)&#8208;based liquid embolic agent for simultaneous realization of embolotherapy, thermotherapy, as well as high&#8208;contrast biomedical imaging is proposed. Benefitting from the suitable melting point, flexible nature, metallic merit, and easygoing operation via injection, the versatile embolic agent can achieve rapid liquid&#8211;solid phase transition, magnetic hyperthermia, and multimodal imaging capability. The Bi&#8208;based materials are demonstrated with excellent arteriovenous embolization efficiency and favorable biocompatibility according to in vivo investigations. Introduction of the liquid embolic agent to tumor arteries achieves evident tumor regression and rather clear imaging under computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging&#160;(MRI), and thermographs for consistently tracking the implants over the biological body. Further, the combined therapy coupled with thermotherapy exhibits improved therapeutic efficiency with formation of necrosis and total tumor eradiation at day 15&#160;after the treatment. The present innovative embolic agent and the surgical principle provide a promising modality for embolization and potential theranostic platform of tumors.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The predicting process of immunotherapy utilizing imaging technology holds huge promise in boosting the response rate of clinical patients. Here, the latest progress in imaging&#8208;guided nanosystem&#8208;based biomaterials for real&#8208;time monitoring of immune cells and immune signaling molecules is summarized to predict the efficacy of immunotherapy, and future directions and main challenges for the visualization of response rates are also discussed.








Abstract
Immunotherapy is one of the most promising clinical modalities for the treatment of malignant tumors and has shown excellent therapeutic outcomes in clinical settings. However, it continues to face several challenges, including long treatment cycles, high costs, immune&#8208;related adverse events, and low response rates. Thus, it is critical to predict the response rate to immunotherapy by using imaging technology in the preoperative and intraoperative. Here, the latest advances in nanosystem&#8208;based biomaterials used for predicting responses to immunotherapy via the imaging of immune cells and signaling molecules in the immune microenvironment are comprehensively summarized. Several imaging methods, such as fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography imaging, ultrasound imaging, and photoacoustic imaging, used in immune predictive imaging, are discussed to show the potential of nanosystems for distinguishing immunotherapy responders from nonresponders. Nanosystem&#8208;based biomaterials aided by various imaging technologies are expected to enable the effective prediction and diagnosis in cases of tumors, inflammation, and other public diseases.

LiCoO2 (LCO) is widely applied in today's rechargeable battery markets for consumer electronic devices. However, LCO operations at high voltage are hindered by accelerated structure degradation and electrode/electrolyte interface decomposition. To overcome these challenges, co&#8208;modified LCO (defined as CB&#8208;Mg&#8208;LCO)&#160;that couples pillar structures with interface shielding are successfully synthesized for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and structurally stable cathode material. Benefitting from the &#8220;Mg&#8208;pillar&#8221; effect, irreversible phase transitions are significantly suppressed and highly reversible Li+ shuttling is enabled. Interestingly, bonding effects between the interfacial lattice oxygen of CB&#8208;Mg&#8208;LCO and amorphous CoxBy coating layer are found to elevate the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, thereby considerably mitigating lattice oxygen loss and inhibiting irreversible phase transformation. Meanwhile, interface shielding effects are also beneficial for mitigating parasitic electrode/electrolyte reactions, subsequent Co dissolution, and ultimately enable a robust electrode/electrolyte interface. As a result, the as&#8208;designed CB&#8208;Mg&#8208;LCO cathode achieves a high capacity and excellent cycle stability with 94.6% capacity retention at an extremely high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V. These findings provide new insights for cathode material modification methods, which serves to guide future cathode material design.

         <title>Polarisation Topology at the Nominally Charged Domain Walls in Uniaxial Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls provide a fertile environment for novel materials physics. If a polarisation discontinuity arises, it can drive a redistribution of electronic carriers and changes in band structure, which often result in emergent two&#8208;dimensional conductivity. If such a discontinuity is not tolerated, then its amelioration usually involves the formation of complex topological patterns, such as flux&#8208;closure domains, dipolar vortices, skyrmions, merons or Hopfions. The degrees of freedom required for the development of such patterns, in which dipolar rotation is a hall mark, are readily found in multiaxial ferroelectrics. In uniaxial ferroelectrics, where only two opposite polar orientations are possible, it has been assumed that discontinuities are unavoidable when antiparallel components of polarisation meet. This perception has been borne out by the appearance of charged conducting domain walls in systems such as hexagonal manganites and lithium niobate. Here, experimental and theoretical investigations on lead germanate (Pb5Ge3O11) reveal that polar discontinuities can be obviated at head&#8208;to&#8208;head and tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail domain walls by mutual domain bifurcation along two different axes, creating a characteristic saddle&#8208;point domain wall morphology and associated novel dipolar topology, removing the need for screening charge accumulation and associated conductivity enhancement.

         <title>Time&#8208;division Position Sensitive Detector Image System for High&#8208;speed Multitarget Trajectory Tracking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;speed trajectory tracking with real&#8208;time processing capability is particularly important in the fields of pilotless automobiles, guidance systems, robotics, and filmmaking. The conventional optical approach to high&#8208;speed trajectory tracking involves CCD or CMOS image sensors, which suffer from trade&#8208;offs between resolution and framerates, complexity of the system, and enormous data analysis processes. Here, we design a high&#8208;speed trajectory tracking system by using a time&#8208;division position sensitive detector (TD&#8208;PSD) based on a graphene&#8208;silicon Schottky heterojunction. Benefiting from the high&#8208;speed optoelectronic response and submicrometer positional accuracy of the TD&#8208;PSD, multitarget real&#8208;time trajectory tracking is realized, with a maximum image output framerate of up to 62000 frames per second. Moreover, multichannel trajectory tracking and image distortion correction functionalities are realized by TD&#8208;PSD systems through frequency&#8208;related image preprocessing, which significantly improves the capacity of real&#8208;time information processing and image quality in complicated light environments.

         <title>Magnetic Ordering in a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of open&#8208;shell organic molecules that magnetically order at room temperature and which can be practically applied remains a grand challenge in chemistry, physics, and materials science. Despite the exploration of a vast chemical space, design paradigms for organic paramagnetic centers generally result in unpaired electron spins that are unstable or isotropic. Here, we demonstrate a high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer, comprised of alternating cyclopentadithiophene and benzo[1,2&#8208;c;4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole heterocycles, in which macromolecular structure and topology coalesce to promote spin center generation and intermolecular exchange coupling. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is consistent with spatially localized spins, while magnetic susceptibility measurements show clear anisotropic spin ordering and exchange interactions that persist at room temperature. The application of long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations for spin center generation promotes remarkable stability. This work offers a fundamentally new approach to the implementation of this long sought&#8208;after physical phenomenon within organic materials and the integration of manifold properties within emerging technologies.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions with Unconventional Helicity Polarization in a Van Der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic skyrmions with unconventional helicity polarization are observed in a van der Waals ferromagnet Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2. The helicity of the dipole skyrmions in Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2 is polarized, namely, the &#960;/2 and &#8722;&#960;/2 helicities are not equally populated. The short&#8208;range order of Fe split sites results in a localized Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction contribution, which breaks the degeneracy of the opposite helicities.








Abstract
Skyrmion helicity, which defines the spin swirling direction, is a fundamental parameter that may be utilized to encode data bits in future memory devices. Generally, in centrosymmetric ferromagnets, dipole skyrmions with helicity of &#8722;&#960;/2 and &#960;/2 are degenerate in energy, leading to equal populations of both helicities. On the other hand, in chiral materials where the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) prevails and the dipolar interaction is negligible, only a preferred helicity is selected by the type of DMI. However, whether there is a rigid boundary between these two regimes remains an open question. Herein, the observation of dipole skyrmions with unconventional helicity polarization in a van der Waals ferromagnet, Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2, is reported. Combining magnetometry, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, electrical transport measurements, and micromagnetic simulations, the short&#8208;range superstructures in Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2 resulting in a localized DMI contribution, which breaks the degeneracy of the opposite helicities and leads to the helicity polarization, is demonstrated. Therefore, the helicity feature in Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2 is controlled by both the dipolar interaction and DMI that the former leads to Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions with helicity of &#177;&#960;/2 whereas the latter breaks the helicity degeneracy. This work provides new insights into the skyrmion topology in van der Waals materials.

         <title>Simultaneously Enhancing Exciton/Charge Transport in Organic Solar Cells by an Organoboron Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exciton diffusion and charge transport of PM6:Y6&#8208;based organic solar cells are simultaneously enhanced by trans&#8208;bis(dimesitylboron)stilbene (BBS), and the PM6:Y6:BBS devices achieve a higher efficiency of 17.6% relative to that without BBS (16.2%).








Abstract
Efficient exciton diffusion and charge transport play a vital role in advancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, a facile strategy is presented to simultaneously enhance exciton/charge transport of the widely studied PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs by employing highly emissive trans&#8208;bis(dimesitylboron)stilbene (BBS) as a solid additive. BBS transforms the emissive sites from a more H&#8208;type aggregate into a more J&#8208;type aggregate, which benefits the resonance energy transfer for PM6 exciton diffusion and energy transfer from PM6 to Y6. Transient gated photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements indicate that addition of BBS improves the exciton diffusion coefficient of PM6 and the dissociation of PM6 excitons in the PM6:Y6:BBS film. Transient absorption spectroscopy measurements confirm faster charge generation in PM6:Y6:BBS. Moreover, BBS helps improve Y6 crystallization, and current&#8208;sensing atomic force microscopy characterization reveals an improved charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length in PM6:Y6:BBS. Owing to the enhanced exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, charge generation, and charge transport, as well as reduced charge recombination and energy loss, a higher PCE of 17.6% with simultaneously improved open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current density, and fill factor is achieved for the PM6:Y6:BBS devices compared to the devices without BBS (16.2%).

         <title>Observation of Coexisting Dirac Bands and Moir&#233; Flat Bands in Magic&#8208;Angle Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magic&#8208;angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) hosts robust superconductivity with unique properties, including the Pauli&#8208;limit violating and re&#8208;entrant behaviors. A systematic investigation combining nanometer&#8208;scale spatially resolved angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy on MATTG revealing the coexistence of the Dirac band and the moir&#233; flat band serves as a stepstone for further understanding of the unconventional superconductivity in MATTG.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices that consist of two or more layers of 2D materials stacked together with a small twist angle have emerged as a tunable platform to realize various correlated and topological phases, such as Mott insulators, unconventional superconductivity, and quantum anomalous Hall effect. Recently, magic&#8208;angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has shown both robust superconductivity similar to magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene and other unique properties, including the Pauli&#8208;limit violating and re&#8208;entrant superconductivity. These rich properties are deeply rooted in its electronic structure under the influence of distinct moir&#233; potential and mirror symmetry. Here, combining nanometer&#8208;scale spatially resolved angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, the as&#8208;yet unexplored band structure of MATTG near charge neutrality is systematically measured. These measurements reveal the coexistence of the distinct dispersive Dirac band with the emergent moir&#233; flat band, showing nice agreement with the theoretical calculations. These results serve as a stepstone for further understanding of the unconventional superconductivity in MATTG.

         <title>Synthetic Nanoarchitectonics of Functional Organic&#8211;Inorganic 2D Germanane Heterostructures via Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Succeeding graphene, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) inorganic materials made of reactive van der Waals layers, like 2D Germanane (2D&#8208;Ge) derivatives, have attracted great attention because their physicochemical characteristics can be entirely tuned by modulating the nature of the surface substituent. Although very interesting from a scientific point of view, almost all the reported works involving 2D&#8208;Ge derivatives are focused on computational studies. Herein, a first prototype of organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge heterostructure has been synthesized by covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich carbon dots (CD&#8211;SH) onto 2D allyl Germanane (2D&#8208;aGe) via a simple and green &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; click chemistry approach. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics of the carbon nanomaterial provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks&#8212;e.g., as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing system triggered by supramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions&#8212;that are inaccessible for the pristine 2D&#8208;aGe counterpart. Consequently, this work builds a foundation toward the robust achievement of functional organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge nanoarchitectonics through covalently assembling thiol&#8208;rich carbon nanoallotropes on commercially available 2D&#8208;aGe.

Abstract
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising and versatile tools in various biomedical, sensing, decontamination, and manipulation applications, as they are uniquely capable of performing tasks at small length scales. With the miniaturization of robots from the macroscale to millimeter&#8208;, micrometer&#8208;, and nanometer&#8208;scales, the viscous and surface forces, namely adhesive forces and surface tension have become dominant. These forces significantly impact motion efficiency. Surface engineering of robots with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic functionalization presents a brand&#8208;new pathway to overcome motion resistance and enhance the ability to target and regulate robots for various tasks. This review focuses on the current progress and future perspectives of SSRs with hydrophilic and hydrophobic modifications (including both tethered and untethered robots). The study emphasizes the distinct advantages of SSRs, such as improved maneuverability and reduced drag forces, and outlines their potential applications. With continued innovation, rational surface engineering is expected to endow SSRs with exceptional mobility and functionality, which can broaden their applications, enhance their penetration depth, reduce surface fouling, and inhibit bacterial adhesion.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inorganic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials offer a new approach to control mass diffusion at the nanoscale. Controlling ion transport in nanofluidics is key to energy conversion, energy storage, water purification, and numerous other applications wherein persistent challenges for efficient separation must be addressed. We herein discuss the recent development of 2D membranes in the emerging field of energy harvesting, water desalination, and proton/Li&#8208;ion production in the context of green energy and environmental technology. We highlight the fundamental mechanisms, 2D membrane fabrication, and challenges toward practical applications. Finally, we outline the fundamental issues of thermodynamics and kinetics along with potential membrane designs that must be resolved to bridge the gap between lab&#8208;scale experiments and production levels.

         <title>Metasurface Enabled On&#8208;Chip Generation and Manipulation of Vector Beams from Vertical Cavity Surface&#8208;Emitting Lasers</title>

Abstract
Metasurface polarization optics that consist of two&#8208;dimensional array of birefringent nano&#8208;antennas have proven remarkable capabilities to generate and manipulate vectorial fields with subwavelength resolution and high efficiency. Integrating this new type of metasurface with the standard VCSEL platform enables an ultracompact and powerful solution to control both phase and polarization properties of the laser on a chip, which allows to structure a VCSEL into vector beams with on&#8208;demand wavefronts. Here, we demonstrate this concept by directly generating versatile vector beams from commercially available VCSELs through on&#8208;chip integration of high&#8208;index dielectric metasurfaces. Experimentally, the versatility of our approach for the development of vectorial VCSELs are validated by implementing a variety of functionalities, including directional emission of multibeam with specified polarizations, vectorial holographic display, and vector vortex beams generations. Notably, the proposed vectorial VCSELs integrated with a single layer of beam shaping metasurface bypass the requirements of multiple cascaded optical components, and thus have the potential to promote the advancements of ultracompact, lightweight, and scalable vector beams sources, enriching and expanding the applications of VCSELs in optical communications, laser manipulation and processing, information encryption, and quantum optics.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets on Graphene as the Cathode for Long&#8208;Life High&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sophisticated covalent organic framework (COF)&#160;predesign and synthetic strategy, with the assistance of materials processing technology, results in a new COF&#8208;based high&#8208;performance organic cathode for practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries, with a specific capacity of 285&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at current density of 0.2&#160;C, and retained capacity of 170&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 after 6000 cycles at 5&#160;C.








Abstract
The poor electronic and ionic conductivities of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) severely restrict the development of COF&#8208;based electrodes for practical rechargeable batteries, therefore inspiring more research interest from the direction of both material synthesis and technology. Herein, a dual&#8208;porous COF, USTB&#8208;6, with good crystallinity and rich redox&#8208;active sites is conceived and fabricated by the polymerization of 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl)diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine and 2,7&#8208;diaminopyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone. In particular, the heterogeneous polymerization of the same starting materials in the presence of graphene affords uniformly dispersed COF nanosheets with a thickness of 8.3&#160;nm on a conductive carbon substrate, effectively enhancing the electronic conductivity of the COF&#8208;based electrode. Such a graphene&#8208;supported USTB&#8208;6 nanosheets cathode when used in a lithium&#8208;ion battery exhibits a specific capacity of 285&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.2&#160;C and excellent rate performance with a prominent capacity of 188&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;C. More importantly, a capacity of 170&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 is retained by using the USTB&#8208;6 nanosheets cathode after 6000 cycles charge and discharge measurement at 5&#160;C.

         <title>Tuning Zn&#8208;Ion Solvation Chemistry with Chelating Ligands toward Stable Aqueous Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability constant (K) of ligand, which reflects its interaction with Zn ions, is proposed to ean ideal parameter to decode how the solvation chemistry intrinsically regulates the corrosion current density and nucleation overpotential of a stable Zn anode, toward long&#8208;life aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Changing the solvation sheath of hydrated Zn ions is an effective strategy to stabilize Zn anodes to obtain a practical aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery. However, key points related to the rational design remain unclear including how the properties of the solvent molecules intrinsically regulate the solvated structure of the Zn ions. This study proposes the use of&#160;a stability constant (K), namely, the equilibrium constant of the complexation reaction, as a universal standard to make an accurate selection of ligands in the electrolyte to improve the anode stability. It is found that K greatly impacts the corrosion current density and nucleation overpotential. Following this, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid with a superhigh K effectively suppresses Zn corrosion and induces uniform Zn&#8208;ion deposition. As a result, the anode has an excellent stability of over 3000&#160;h. This work presents a general principle to stabilize anodes by regulating the solvation chemistry, guiding the development of novel electrolytes for sustainable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Polarized Cu&#8211;Bi Site Pairs for Non&#8208;Covalent to Covalent Interaction Tuning toward N2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;confined doping strategy is developed to prepare Bi24O31Br10 materials incorporating isolated Cu (Fe, Co, Ni) atoms. The polarized Cu&#8211;Bi site pairs favor better electron delocalization for effective N2 activation, and can work as reactive sites to tune the non&#8208;covalent interactions of the intermediates, optimize the covalent bond order in N&#63743;N, and alter the hydrogenation pathways.








Abstract
A universal atomic layer confined doping strategy is developed to prepare Bi24O31Br10 materials incorporating isolated Cu atoms. The local polarization can be created along the Cu&#63743;O&#63743;Bi atomic interface, which enables better electron delocalization for effective N2 activation. The optimized Cu&#8208;Bi24O31Br10 atomic layers show 5.3&#215; and 88.2&#215; improved photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity than Bi24O31Br10 atomic layer and bulk Bi24O31Br10, respectively, with the NH3 generation rate reaching 291.1&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. The polarized Cu&#8211;Bi site pairs can increase the non&#8208;covalent interaction between the catalyst's surface and N2 molecules, then further weaken the covalent bond order in N&#63743;N. As a result, the hydrogenation pathways can be altered from the associative distal pathway for Bi24O31Br10 to the alternating pathway for Cu&#8208;Bi24O31Br10. This strategy provides an accessible pathway for designing polarized metal site pairs or tuning the non&#8208;covalent interaction and covalent bond order.

         <title>Enriched&#8208;Bromine Surface State for Stable Sky&#8208;Blue Spectrum Perovskite QLEDs With an EQE of 14.6%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enriched&#8208;bromine surface state is controlled by employing PbBr2 stock solution for anion&#8208;exchange based on Cd&#8208;doping perovskite quantum dots (QDs), which shows good passivation to the vacancy defects, resulting in boosted optical properties and stability. The stable sky&#8208;blue spectrum quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) based on the controlled QDs are conducted with a record EQE of 14.6% and current efficiency (CE) of 19.9 Cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Halogen vacancies are of great concern in blue&#8208;emitting perovskite quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes because they affect their efficiency and spectral shift. Here, an enriched&#8208;bromine surface state is realized using a facile strategy that employs a PbBr2 stock solution for anion exchange based on Cd&#8208;doped perovskite quantum dots.

     alt="Enriched-Bromine Surface State for Stable Sky-Blue Spectrum Perovskite QLEDs With an EQE of 14.6%"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enriched-bromine surface state is controlled by employing PbBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stock solution for anion-exchange based on Cd-doping perovskite quantum dots (QDs), which shows good passivation to the vacancy defects, resulting in boosted optical properties and stability. The stable sky-blue spectrum quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) based on the controlled QDs are conducted with a record EQE of 14.6% and current efficiency (CE) of 19.9 Cd A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halogen vacancies are of great concern in blue-emitting perovskite quantum-dot light-emitting diodes because they affect their efficiency and spectral shift. Here, an enriched-bromine surface state is realized using a facile strategy that employs a PbBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stock solution for anion exchange based on Cd-doped perovskite quantum dots. It is found that the doped Cd ions are expected to reduce the formation energy of halogen vacancies filled by the external bromine ions, and the excess free bromine ions in solution are enriched in the surface by anchoring with halogen vacancies as sites, accompanied with the shedding of surface long-chain ligands during the anion exchange process, resulting in a Br-rich and &#8220;neat&#8221; surface. Moreover, the surface state exhibits good passivation of the surface defects of the controlled perovskite QDs and simultaneously increases the exciton binding energy, leading to excellent optical properties and stability. Finally, the sky-blue emitting perovskite quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) (490&#160;nm) are conducted with a record external quantum efficiency of 14.6% and current efficiency of 19.9&#160;cd A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Meanwhile, the electroluminescence spectra exhibit great stability with negligible shifts under a constant operating voltage from 3 to 7&#160;V.

         <title>Surface Lattice Plasmon Resonances by Direct In Situ Substrate Growth of Gold Nanoparticles in Ordered Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticle plasmonic ordered arrays are fabricated by an unconventional in situ approach where gold precursors are reduced directly at specific pre&#8208;patterned locations on substrates. Nanoparticle morphology and array periodicity are easily tuned using this method. The substrates exhibit far&#8208;field plasmonic coupling via the emergence of lattice plasmon resonances, constituting a major step forward for in situ growth techniques.








Abstract
Precise arrangements of plasmonic nanoparticles on substrates are important for designing optoelectronics, sensors and metamaterials with rational electronic, optical and magnetic properties. Bottom&#8208;up synthesis offers unmatched control over morphology and optical response of individual plasmonic building blocks. Usually, the incorporation of nanoparticles made by bottom&#8208;up wet chemistry starts from batch synthesis of colloids, which requires time&#8208;consuming and hard&#8208;to&#8208;scale steps like ligand exchange and self&#8208;assembly. Herein, an unconventional bottom&#8208;up wet&#8208;chemical synthetic approach for producing gold nanoparticle ordered arrays is developed. Water&#8208;processable hydroxypropyl cellulose stencils facilitate the patterning of a reductant chemical ink on which nanoparticle growth selectively occurs. Arrays exhibiting lattice plasmon resonances in the visible region and near infrared (quality factors of &gt;20) are produced following a rapid synthetic step (&lt;10&#160;min), all without cleanroom fabrication, specialized equipment, or self&#8208;assembly, constituting a major step forward in establishing in situ growth approaches. Further, the technical capabilities of this method through modulation of the particle size, shape, and array spacings directly on the substrate are demonstrated. Ultimately, establishing a fundamental understanding of in situ growth has the potential to inform the fabrication of plasmonic materials; opening the door for in situ growth fabrication of waveguides, lasing platforms, and plasmonic sensors.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystal Photoelectric Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferred (100) surface engineering of CsPbBr3 perovskite single&#8208;crystals enables a low surface bandgap energy (2.33&#160;eV) and high&#8208;rate carrier mobility up to 241&#160;&#956;m2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, inherently boosting their light&#8208;harvesting and carrier transport capability. Meanwhile, polar (111) surface engineering induces &#8776;0.16&#160;eV upward surface&#8208;band bending and ultrahigh surface defect density of 1.49&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, which may be beneficial for enhancing surface&#8208;defects&#8208;catalyzed reactions.








Abstract
Engineering surface structure can precisely and effectively tune the optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites, but are incredibly challenging. Herein, the design and fabrication of uniform all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 cubic/tetrahedral single&#8208;crystals are reported with precise control of the (100) and (111) surface anisotropy, respectively. By combining&#160;with theoretical calculations, it is demonstrated that the preferred (100) surface engineering of the CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystals enables a lowest surface bandgap energy (2.33&#160;eV) and high&#8208;rate carrier mobility up to 241&#160;&#956;m2&#160;V&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1, inherently boosting their light&#8208;harvesting and carrier&#8208;transport capability. Meanwhile, the polar (111) surface induces &#8776;0.16&#160;eV upward surface&#8208;band bending and ultrahigh surface defect density of 1.49&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8208;3, which is beneficial for enhancing surface&#8208;defects&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The work highlights the anisotropic surface engineering for boosting perovskite optoelectronic devices and beyond.

         <title>Wireless Stand&#8208;Alone Trimodal Interactive Display Enabled by Direct Capacitive Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wireless stand&#8208;alone trimodal interactive display is presented where finger touch is displayed with three types of outputs of field&#8208;induced electroluminescence, inverse piezoelectric sound, and tactile vibration remotely powered by unique alternating current (AC)&#8208;to&#8208;AC power transfer based on direct capacitive coupling, making the device potentially suitable for a smart three&#8208;mode braille display.








Abstract
With recent advances in interactive displays, the development of a stand&#8208;alone interactive display with no electrical interconnection is of great interest. Here, a wireless stand&#8208;alone interactive display (WiSID), enabled by direct capacitive coupling, consisting of three layers: two in&#8208;plane metal electrodes separated by a gap, a composite layer for field&#8208;induced electroluminescence (EL) and inverse piezoelectric sound, and a stimuli&#8208;responsive layer, from bottom to top, is presented. Alternating current power necessary for field&#8208;induced EL and inverse piezoelectric sound is wirelessly transferred from a power unit, with two in&#8208;plane electrodes remotely separated from the WiSID. The unique in&#8208;plane power transfer through the stimuli&#8208;sensitive polar bridge allows stand&#8208;alone operation of the WiSID, making it suitable for the wireless dynamic monitoring of medical fluids. Moreover, a haptic wireless stand&#8208;alone trimodal interactive display mounted on a human finger is demonstrated, whereby touch is wirelessly displayed in various outputs of EL, inverse piezoelectric sound, and tactile vibration, making it suitable for a wireless three&#8208;mode smart braille display.

         <title>Unlocking Layered Double Hydroxide as a High&#8208;Performance Cathode Material for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trinary layered double hydroxide (LDH) with hydrogen vacancies is proposed as a new cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. With the existence of H vacancies and the synergy of trinary transitional metal cations in LDH, the electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 328 mAh g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 85%.








Abstract
Advanced cathode materials play an important role in promoting aqueous battery technology for safe energy storage. Transition metal double hydroxides are usually elusive as a stable cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their unstable crystal structure, sluggish ion transportation, and insufficient active sites for zinc&#8208;ion storage. Here, a trinary layered double hydroxide (LDH) with hydrogen vacancies (Ni3Mn0.7Fe0.3&#8208;LDH) is reported as a new cathode material for AZIBs. A reversible high capacity up to 328 mAh g&#8722;1 can be obtained and cycle stably over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 85%. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the hydrogen vacancies in LDH can expose lattice oxygen atoms as active sites for zinc&#8208;ion storage and accelerate ion diffusion by reducing the electrostatic interactions between zinc ions and the host structure. In addition, the synergy of the trinary transitional metal cations can suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of manganese (III) oxide octahedron and enable long cycle stability. This work provides not only a series of high&#8208;performance cathode materials for AZIBs but also a novel materials design strategy that can be extended to other multi&#8208;valence metal&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced cathode materials play an important role in promoting aqueous battery technology for safe energy storage. Transition metal double hydroxides are usually elusive as a stable cathode for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their unstable crystal structure, sluggish ion transportation, and insufficient active sites for zinc-ion storage. Here, a trinary layered double hydroxide (LDH) with hydrogen vacancies (Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;-LDH) is reported as a new cathode material for AZIBs. A reversible high capacity up to 328 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; can be obtained and cycle stably over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 85%. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the hydrogen vacancies in LDH can expose lattice oxygen atoms as active sites for zinc-ion storage and accelerate ion diffusion by reducing the electrostatic interactions between zinc ions and the host structure. In addition, the synergy of the trinary transitional metal cations can suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of manganese (III) oxide octahedron and enable long cycle stability. This work provides not only a series of high-performance cathode materials for AZIBs but also a novel materials design strategy that can be extended to other multi-valence metal-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Interfacial Electron Transfer of Ruthenium Phosphides by Homologous Core&#8211;Shell Design toward Efficient Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A system where homologous core&#8211;shell RuP@RuP2 nanoparticles are well dispersed on functional carbon nanosheets (RuP@RuP2/C) is synthesized via a phosphatization&#8208;controlled phase&#8208;transformation strategy. The emergent interfacial functionality enables very efficient electron transfer from the RuP core to the RuP2 shell, leading to accelerated hydrogen adsorption/desorption kinetics of RuP@RuP2/C toward high&#8208;efficiency alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation, which are among the best reported bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in alkaline electrolytes is of critical importance for realizing renewable hydrogen technologies. Ruthenium phosphides (RuPx) are promising candidates to substitute Pt&#8208;based electrodes; however, great challenges still remain in their electronic structure regulation for optimizing intermediate adsorption. Herein, it is reported that a homologous RuP@RuP2 core&#8211;shell architecture constructed by a phosphatization&#8208;controlled phase&#8208;transformation strategy enables strong electron coupling for optimal intermediate adsorption by virtue of the emergent interfacial functionality. Density functional theory calculations show that the RuP core and RuP2 shell present efficient electron transfer, leading to a close to thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy of 0.04&#160;eV. Impressively, the resulting material exhibits superior HER/HOR activities in alkaline media, which outperform the benchmark Pt/C and are among the best reported bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts. The present work not only provides an efficient and cost&#8208;effective bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalyst, but also offers a new synthetic protocol to rationally synthesize homologous core&#8211;shell nanostructures for widespread applications.

         <title>Fingerprints Indicating Superior Properties of Internal Interfaces in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;poor and Cu&#8208;rich Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorbers are investigated using correlative microscopy based on the atom probe tomography technique. With that, typical fingerprints for superior properties of internal interfaces necessary for maintaining a lower recombination activity in the cell are discovered. These are Cu&#8208;depleted and Cd&#8208;enriched Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber surfaces, as well as negative Cu factor (&#8710;&#946;) and high Na content at the grain boundaries.








Abstract
Growth of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorbers under Cu&#8208;poor conditions gives rise to incorporation of numerous defects into the bulk, whereas the same absorber grown under Cu&#8208;rich conditions leads to a stoichiometric bulk with minimum defects. This suggests that CIGS absorbers grown under Cu&#8208;rich conditions are more suitable for solar cell applications. However, the CIGS solar cell devices with record efficiencies have all been fabricated under Cu&#8208;poor conditions, despite the expectations. Therefore, in the present work, both Cu&#8208;poor and Cu&#8208;rich CIGS cells are investigated, and the superior properties of the internal interfaces of the Cu&#8208;poor CIGS cells, such as the p&#8211;n junction and grain boundaries, which always makes them the record&#8208;efficiency devices, are shown. More precisely, by employing a correlative microscopy approach, the typical fingerprints for superior properties of internal interfaces necessary for maintaining a lower recombination activity in the cell is discovered. These are a Cu&#8208;depleted and Cd&#8208;enriched CIGS absorber surface, near the p&#8211;n junction, as well as&#160;a negative Cu factor (&#8710;&#946;) and high Na content (&gt;1.5 at%) at the grain boundaries. Thus, this work provides key factors governing the device performance (efficiency), which can be considered in the design of next&#8208;generation solar cells.

         <title>Herpesvirus&#8208;Mimicking DNAzyme&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles as a Mitochondrial DNA Stress Inducer to Activate Innate Immunity for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herpesvirus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (Vir&#8208;ZM@TD) that activate antitumor innate immunity are reported. DNAzyme&#8208;loaded manganese&#8209;doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks&#8209;90 (ZIF&#8208;90) nanoparticles (ZM@TD) mimic the virus nucleocapsid containing the genome; the erythrocyte membrane mimics the viral envelope; and two functional peptides, RGD and HA2 peptides, resemble the surface glycoprotein spikes of herpesvirus. The system effectively primes cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated innate immunity with 68% complete regression of primary tumors and extends the median survival time of 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice by 32 days.








Abstract
Virus&#8208;based immunotherapy is a promising approach to treat tumor. Closely mimicking the structure and sequential infection processes of natural viruses is highly desirable for effective tumor immunotherapy but remains challenging. Here, inspired by the robust innate immunity induced by herpesvirus, a herpesvirus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticle (named Vir&#8208;ZM@TD) is engineered for tumor therapy by mimicking the structure and infection processes of herpesvirus. In this biomimetic system, DNAzyme&#8208;loaded manganese&#8209;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8209;90 (ZIF&#8208;90) nanoparticles (ZM@TD) mimic the virus nucleocapsid containing the genome; the erythrocyte membrane mimics the viral envelope; and two functional peptides, RGD and HA2 peptides, resemble the surface glycoprotein spikes of herpesvirus. Vir&#8208;ZM@TD can both effectively evade rapid clearance in the blood circulation and closely mimic the serial infection processes of herpesvirus, including specific tumor targeting, membrane fusion&#8208;mediated endosomal escape, and TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial) deficiency&#8208;triggered mitochondrial DNA stress, as well as the release of manganese ions (Mn2+) from organelles into the cytosol, ultimately effectively priming cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated innate immunity with 68% complete regression of primary tumors and extending by 32 days the median survival time of 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Supramolecular Nitric Oxide Depot for Hypoxic Tumor Vessel Normalization and Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular nitric oxide (NO) depot (SupraNO) for &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;controlled NO release is reported. SupraNO can provide low&#8208;dose NO continuously and release a large amount of NO immediately on&#8208;demand providing an effective solution for both vessel normalization by low&#8208;dose long&#8208;time NO supply and radiosensitization by temporary high&#8208;dose stimulation in hypoxic tumor.








Abstract
In cancer radiotherapy, the lack of fixed DNA&#160;damage by oxygen in hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors often leads to severe radioresistance. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent radiosensitizer that acts in two ways. It can directly react with the radical DNA thus fixing the damage. It also normalizes the abnormal tumor vessels, thereby increasing blood perfusion and oxygen supply. To achieve these functions, the dosage and duration of NO treatment need to be carefully controlled, otherwise it will lead to the exact opposite outcomes. However, a delivery method that fulfills both requirements is still lacking. A NO depot is designed for the control of NO releasing both over quantity and duration for hypoxic tumor vessel normalization and radiosensitization. In B16&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the depot can provide low dosage NO continuously and release large amount of NO immediately before irradiation for a short period of time. These two modes of treatment work in synergy to reverse the radioresistance of B16&#160;tumors more efficiently than releasing at single dosage.

         <title>Synergizing Hydrogen Spillover and Deprotonation by the Internal Polarization Field in a MoS2/NiPS3 Vertical Heterostructure for Boosted Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The internal polarization field (IPF) in a bicomponent MoS2/NiPS3 electrocatalyst can engineer both interfacial hydrogen spillover (HSo) and dual&#8208;path deprotonation (DeP) to empower the catalyst with a bifunctional water&#8208;splitting activity. This research puts forward the IPF as the criterion in the rational design of HSo/DeP&#8208;unified non&#8208;precious catalysts for highly efficient water electrolysis.








Abstract
Hydrogen spillover (HSo) has emerged to upgrade the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Pt&#8208;support electrocatalysts, but it is not applicable to the deprotonated oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Non&#8208;precious catalysts that can perform well in both HSo and deprotonation (DeP) are extremely desirable for a sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, an affordable MoS2/NiPS3 vertical heterostructure catalyst is presented to synergize HSo and DeP for efficient water electrolysis. The internal polarization field (IPF) is clarified as the driving force of HSo in HER electrocatalysis. The HSo from the MoS2 edge to NiPS3 can activate the NiPS3 basal plane to boost the HER activity of the MoS2/NiPS3 heterostructure (112&#160;mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2), while for OER, the IPF in the heterostructure can facilitate the hydroxyl diffusion and render MoS2&#8208;to&#8208;NiPS3/P&#8208;to&#8208;S dual&#8208;pathways for DeP. As a result, the stacking of OER&#8208;inactive MoS2 on the NiPS3 surface still brings intriguing OER enhancements. With them serving as electrode couples, the overall water splitting is attested stably with a cell voltage of 1.64&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This research puts forward the IPF as the criterion in the rational design of HSo/DeP&#8208;unified non&#8208;precious catalysts for efficient water electrolysis.

         <title>An Ultrahigh Rate and Stable Zinc Anode by Facet&#8208;Matching&#8208;Induced Dendrite Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of dendrite regulation,&#160;growing tiny, identical, and homogeneously distributed Zn dendrites by facet matching of Cu(111)/Zn(002),&#160;can achieve reversible Zn plating/stripping and long&#8208;life Zn anode at ultrahigh current densities.








Abstract
Resource&#8208;abundant metal (e.g., zinc) batteries feature intrinsic advantages of safety and sustainability. Their practical feasibility, however, is impeded by the poor reversibility of metal anodes, typically caused by the uncontrollable dendrite enlargement. Significant effort is exerted to completely prevent dendrites from forming, but this seems less effective at high current densities. Herein, this work presents an alternative dendrite regulation strategy of forming tiny, homogeneously distributed, and identical zinc dendrites by facet matching, which effectively avoids undesirable dendrite enlargement. Confirmed by multiscale theoretical screening and characterization, the regularly exposed Cu(111) facets at the ridges of a copper nanowire are capable of such dendrite regulation by forming a low&#8208;mismatched Zn(002)/Cu(111) interface. Consequently, reversible zinc electroplating/stripping is achieved at an unprecedentedly high rate of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 30&#160;000 cycles, corresponding to an accumulative areal capacity up to 30 Ah cm&#8722;2. A full cell using this anode shows a high capacity of 308.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of 91.4% after 800 cycles. This strategy is also viable for magnesium and aluminum anodes, thus opening up a promising and universal avenue toward long&#8208;life and high&#8208;rate metal anodes.

         <title>Ultrathin Suspended Chiral Metasurfaces for Enantiodiscrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;aligned suspended chiral bilayer metasurface is developed with single&#8208;step electron beam lithography. A huge optical chirality of 221&#176;&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 is achieved by the freestanding metasurfaces with overall thickness of 100&#160;nm. The bilayer metasurface demonstrates label&#8208;free discrimination of chiral molecules at zeptomoles level with orders of magnitude larger than conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy.








Abstract
Chiral metasurfaces can exhibit a strong circular dichroism, but it is limited by the complicated fabrication procedure and alignment errors. Here, a new type of self&#8208;aligned suspended chiral bilayer metasurface with only one&#8208;step electron beam lithography exposure is demonstrated. A significant optical chirality of 221&#176;&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 can be realized using suspended metasurfaces with a thickness of 100&#160;nm. Furthermore, this study experimentally demonstrates that such a structure is capable of label&#8208;free discrimination of the chiral molecules at zeptomole level, exhibiting a much higher sensitivity (orders of magnitude) compared to the conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy. The fundamental principles for chiral sensing using molecules&#8211;metasurfaces interactions are explored. Benefiting from the giant chiroptical response, the proposed metadevice may offer promising applications for ultrathin circular polarizers, chiral molecular detectors, and asymmetry information processing.

         <title>Enabling Electron Injection for Microbial Electrosynthesis with n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating Shewanella oneidensis&#160;MR&#8208;1 with a newly synthesized n&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte forms a 3D conductive network that allows efficient electron transfer from electrode to living cells, thereby enabling microbial electrosynthesis. The one&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly process offers a simple and effective strategy to improve bioelectrochemical systems.








Abstract
Microbial electrosynthesis&#8212;using renewable electricity to stimulate microbial metabolism&#8212;holds the promise of sustainable chemical production. A key limitation hindering performance is slow electron&#8208;transfer rates at biotic&#8211;abiotic interfaces. Here a new n&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte is rationally designed and synthesized and its use is demonstrated as a soft conductive material to encapsulate electroactive bacteria Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1. The self&#8208;assembled 3D living biocomposite amplifies current uptake from the electrode &#8776;674&#8208;fold over controls with the same initial number of cells, thereby enabling continuous synthesis of succinate from fumarate. Such functionality is a result of the increased number of bacterial cells having intimate electronic communication with the electrode and a higher current uptake per cell. This is underpinned by the molecular design of the polymer to have an n&#8208;dopable conjugated backbone for facile reduction by the electrode and zwitterionic side chains for compatibility with aqueous media. Moreover, direct arylation polycondensation is employed instead of the traditional Stille polymerization to avoid non&#8208;biocompatible tin by&#8208;products. By demonstrating synergy between living cells with n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials, these results provide new strategies for improving the performance of bioelectrosynthesis technologies.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Assisted In Situ Recrystallization for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable crystallization is particularly significant for tin perovskites because their fast crystallization rate usually causes high trap density and low photoluminescence quantum efficiency, thus resulting in low light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) efficiencies. In this work, a vapor&#8208;assisted spin&#8208;coating technique is developed to retard crystallization and improve the external quantum efficiency of tin perovskite LEDs up to 5.3%.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskites are a promising candidates to replace their toxic lead&#8208;based counterparts in optoelectronic applications, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the development of tin perovskite LEDs is slow due to the challenge of obtaining high&#8208;quality tin perovskite films. Here, a vapor&#8208;assisted spin&#8208;coating method is developed to achieve high&#8208;quality tin perovskites and high&#8208;efficiency LEDs. It is revealed that solvent vapor can lead to in situ recrystallization of tin perovskites during the film&#8208;formation process, thus significantly improving the crystalline quality with reduced defects. An antioxidant additive is further introduced to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and increase the photoluminescence quantum efficiency up to &#8776;30%, which is an approximately fourfold enhancement in comparison with that of the control method. As a result, efficient tin perovskite LEDs are achieved with a peak external quantum efficiency of 5.3%, which is among the highest efficiency of lead&#8208;free perovskite LEDs.

         <title>Highly Orientated Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solid with a high orientation and substantially diminished nonradiative recombination is constructed using precursor engineering accompanied by a chemical stripping treatment of the PQDs. Consequently, the resultant inorganic PQD solar cell (PQDSC) delivers a high power conversion efficiency of up to 16.25%, among the highest efficiencies of inorganic PQDSCs.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have emerged&#160;as competitive optoelectronic materials for photovoltaic applications due to their ideal bandgap energy, high defect tolerance, and solution processability. However, the highly dynamic surface and imperfect cubic structure of PQDs generally result in unfavorable charge&#8208;carrier transport within the PQD solids and serious nonradiative recombination. Herein, a highly orientated PQD solid is demonstrated using precursor engineering accompanied by a chemical stripping treatment (CST). A combination of systematic experimental studies and theoretical calculations is conducted to fundamentally understand the resurfacing of PQDs using the CST approach. The results reveal that the highly ordered PQDs can result in a high orientation of PQD solids, significantly promoting charge&#8208;carrier transport within the PQD solids. Meanwhile, the ideal cubic&#8208;structured PQD with an iodine&#8208;rich surface dramatically decreases surface trap states, thereby substantially diminishing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the inorganic PQD solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of up to 16.25%. This work provides a feasible avenue to construct highly orientated PQD solids with improved photophysical properties for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Toward Tissue&#8208;Like Material Properties: Inducing In Situ Adaptive Behavior in Fibrous Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature's gels, intracellular and extracellular are highly adaptive, which is very difficult to recreate in the lab. In this work, a synthetic fibrous network, functional cross&#8208;linkers, and a tailorable interaction between the two components are used to reversibly manipulate mechanical properties on&#8208;demand.








Abstract
The materials properties of biological tissues are unique. Nature is able to spatially and temporally manipulate (mechanical) properties while maintaining responsiveness toward a variety of cues; all without majorly changing the material's composition. Artificial mimics, synthetic or biomaterial&#8208;based are far less advanced and poorly reproduce the natural cell microenvironment. A viable strategy to generate materials with advanced properties combines different materials into nanocomposites. This work describes nanocomposites of a synthetic fibrous hydrogel, based on polyisocyanide (PIC), that is noncovalently linked to a responsive cross&#8208;linker. The introduction of the cross&#8208;linker transforms the PIC gel from a static fibrous extracellular matrix mimic to a highly dynamic material that maintains biocompatibility, as demonstrated by in situ modification of the (non)linear mechanical properties and efficient self&#8208;healing properties. Key in the material design is cross&#8208;linking at the fibrillar level using nanoparticles, which, simultaneously may be used to introduce more advanced properties.

         <title>Tackling Disorder in &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is attracting increasing attention in applications such as power electronics and photodetectors due to its rich structural space and resulting electronic structure. This work explores the influence of structural disorder on a range of crucial material parameters of &#947;&#8208;phase Ga2O3 by combining density functional theory and machine learning with a range of experimental probes.








Abstract
Ga2O3 and its polymorphs are attracting increasing attention. The rich structural space of polymorphic oxide systems such as Ga2O3 offers potential for electronic structure engineering, which is of particular interest for a range of applications, such as power electronics. &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3 presents a particular challenge across synthesis, characterization, and theory due to its inherent disorder and resulting complex structure&#8211;electronic&#8208;structure relationship. Here, density functional theory is used in combination with a machine&#8208;learning approach to screen nearly one million potential structures, thereby developing a robust atomistic model of the &#947;&#8208;phase. Theoretical results are compared with surface and bulk sensitive soft and hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy experiments representative of the occupied and unoccupied states of &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3. The first onset of strong absorption at room temperature is found at 5.1&#160;eV from spectroscopic ellipsometry, which agrees well with the excitation maximum at 5.17&#160;eV obtained by photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy, where the latter shifts to 5.33&#160;eV at 5&#160;K. This work presents a leap forward in the treatment of complex, disordered oxides and is a crucial step toward exploring how their electronic structure can be understood in terms of local coordination and overall structure.

         <title>Determination of Crystallographic Orientation and Exposed Facets of Titanium Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2 nanosheets with dominant {001} and {111} facets are identified by transmission electron microscopy, which are very close because of similar morphology and lattice parameters. The importance of the determination of exposed facets, which is the prerequisite of surface performance study, is emphasized and a paradigm applied to all nanocrystalline materials is given.








Abstract
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocrystals have attracted great attention in heterogeneous photocatalysis and photoelectricity fields for decades. However, contradicting conclusions on the crystallographic orientation and exposed facets of TiO2 nanocrystals frequently appear in the literature. Herein, using anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with highly exposed {001} facets as a model, the misleading conclusions that exist on anatase nanocrystals are clarified. Although TiO2&#8208;001 nanocrystals are recognized to be dominated by {001} facets, in fact, anatase nanocrystals with both dominant {001} and {111} facets always co&#8208;exist due to the similarities in the lattice fringes and intersection angles between the two types of facets (0.38&#160;nm and 90&#176; in the [001] direction, 0.35&#160;nm and 82&#176; in the [111] direction). A paradigm for determining the crystallographic orientation and exposed facets based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, which provides a universal methodology to nanomaterials for determining the orientation and exposed facets, is also given.

A paradigm for determining the crystallographic orientation and exposed facets based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, which provides a universal methodology to nanomaterials for determining the orientation and exposed facets, is also given.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring the Desorption Behavior of Hygroscopic Gels for Atmospheric Water Harvesting in Arid Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygroscopic gel is developed for atmospheric water harvesting in arid climates by integrating a hygroscopic salt, LiCl, with a cross&#8208;linked hydrophilic polymeric network, polyacrylamide. The interactions between the polymer network and the captured water increase the free/weakly bonded water content compared with pure salt sorbent, lowering the desorption heat to achieve a high water yield of &#8776;7&#160;g g&#8722;1 per day in a 20% relative humidity environment.








Abstract
The ubiquitous nature of atmospheric moisture makes it a significant water resource available at any geographical location. Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology, which extracts moisture from the ambient air to generate clean water, is a promising strategy to realize decentralized water production. The high water uptake by&#160;salt&#8208;based sorbents makes them attractive for AWH, especially in arid environments. However, they often have relatively high desorption heat, rendering water release an energy&#8208;intensive process. A &#160;LiCl&#8208;incorporating polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAM&#8211;LiCl)&#160;capable of effective moisture harvesting from arid environments is proposed. The interactions between the hydrophilic hydrogel network and the captured water generate more free and weakly bonded water, significantly lowering the desorption heat compared with conventional neat salt sorbents. Benefiting from the affinity for swelling of the polymer backbones, the developed PAM&#8211;LiCl achieves a high water uptake of &#8776;1.1&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20%&#160;RH with fast sorption kinetics of &#8776;0.008&#160;g g&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1&#160;and further demonstrates a daily water yield up to &#8776;7&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at this condition. These findings provide a new pathway for the synthesis of materials with efficient water absorption/desorption properties, to reach energy&#8208;efficient water release for AWH in arid climates.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Mixed&#8208;Phase Domain Architectures and Topological Transitions in Pb1&#8722;xSrxTiO3 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is numerically and experimentally shown that, by controlling strontium content and in turn manipulating strain, topologically non&#8208;trivial phase arrangements appear in hierarchical, mixed&#8208;phase domains structure of Pb1&#8722;xSrxTiO3. These phases showcase a variety of pattern defects that can be manipulated via thermal treatment. In turn, the dielectric response, which is strongly correlated with domain structure, can be widely varied.








Abstract
The potential for creating hierarchical domain structures, or mixtures of energetically degenerate phases with distinct patterns that can be modified continually, in ferroelectric thin films offers a pathway to control their mesoscale structure beyond lattice&#8208;mismatch strain with a substrate. Here, it is demonstrated that varying the strontium content provides deterministic strain&#8208;driven control of hierarchical domain structures in Pb1&#8722;xSrxTiO3&#160;solid&#8208;solution thin films wherein two types, c/a and a1/a2, of nanodomains can coexist. Combining phase&#8208;field simulations, epitaxial thin&#8208;film growth, detailed structural, domain, and physical&#8208;property characterization, it is observed that the system undergoes a gradual transformation (with increasing strontium content) from droplet&#8208;like a1/a2&#160;domains in a c/a domain matrix, to a connected&#8208;labyrinth geometry of c/a domains, to a disconnected labyrinth structure of the same, and, finally, to droplet&#8208;like c/a domains in an a1/a2&#160;domain matrix. A relationship between the different mixed&#8208;phase modulation patterns and its topological nature is established. Annealing the connected&#8208;labyrinth structure leads to domain coarsening forming distinctive regions of parallel c/a and a1/a2&#160;domain stripes, offering additional design flexibility. Finally, it is found that the connected&#8208;labyrinth domain patterns exhibit the highest dielectric permittivity.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Regulated Electrostatic Shielding Layer toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 37, September 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building stable electrolytes is very crucial for constructing stable Zn batteries as hydrogen reaction and the dendritic growth of Zn&#8208;metal anodes. Here, a rare metal salts additive (CeCl3) is employed to stabilize the electrolyte in Zn batteries via the formation of a self&#8208;regulated electrostatic shielding layer. The rare metal salts additive strategy affords emerging chances for rational electrolyte design for stable Zn batteries.








Abstract
Although aqueous Zn batteries have become a more sustainable alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to their intrinsic security, their practical applications are limited by dendrite formation and hydrogen reactions. The first application of a rare earth metal type addition to Zn batteries, cerium chloride (CeCl3), as an effective, low&#8208;cost, and green electrolyte additive that facilitates the formation of a dynamic electrostatic shielding layer around the Zn protuberance to induce uniform Zn deposition is presented. After introducing CeCl3 additives, the electrochemical characterizations, in situ optical microscopy observation, in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, along with density functional theory calculations, and finite element method simulations reveal resisted Zn dendritic growth and enhanced electrolyte stability. As a result, the Zn&#8211;Zn cells using the CeCl3 additive exhibit a long cycling stability of 2600 h at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, an impressive cumulative areal capacity of 3.6 Ah cm&#8722;2 at 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and a high Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.7%. The fact that the Zn&#8211;LiFePO4 cells with proposed electrolyte retain capacity significantly better than the additive&#8208;free case is even more exciting.

A self&#8208;aligned suspended chiral bilayer metasurface via single&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam lithography is reported by Tun Cao, Yan Jun Liu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2203956. A huge optical chirality of 221&#176; &#956;m&#8722;1 is achieved by the free&#8208;standing metasurfaces with overall thickness of 100 nm. The bilayer metasurface demonstrates label&#8208;free discrimination of chiral molecules at zeptomole level, with sensitivity orders of magnitude larger than conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy.

Plasmonic Arrays
In article number 2205330, Leonardo Scarabelli and co&#8208;workers report on the in situ growth of gold nanoparticle plasmonic ordered arrays. In situ growth is an unconventional fabrication approach where gold precursors are reduced directly at specific chemically patterned areas on the substrate. Taking advantage of bottom&#8208;up wet&#8208;chemistry synthesis principles, nanoparticle morphology and array periodicity can be easily tuned using this method. The plasmonic arrays display narrow lattice plasmon resonances, constituting a major step forward for this class of techniques.

Dendrite Regulation
In article number 2203835, Liqun Wang, Feng Hou, Ji Liang, and co&#8208;workers present Cu nanowires that have regularly exposed (111) planes at the edges, which induces tiny, homogeneously distributed, and uniform Zn dendrites by matching Zn(002)/Cu(111) facets. This dendrite regulation strategy is extremely effective in improving Zn&#8208;anode reversibility in ultrahigh current densities and promising in stabilizing other metal species as well.

Microbial Electrosynthesis
Microbial electrosynthesis holds the promise of sustainable chemical production. In article number 2203480, Guillermo C. Bazan and co&#8208;workers show that 3D living biocomposites integrating electroactive bacteria with an n&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte allow efficient long&#8208;range electron transfer from electrode to living cells, thereby enabling microbial electrosynthesis. The one&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly process offers a simple and effective strategy to improve bioelectrochemical systems.

         <dc:description>
Liquid metals (LMs) with good biosafety, deformability, functionalizability, and stimulus responsiveness have great potential in biomedicine. Here, the advantages of LMs are presented. Recent advances in the design and application of LM&#8208;based biomaterials are comprehensively summarized to provide deep insights into structure&#8211;property relationships and guide their on&#8208;demand design and performance optimization for therapeutics, bioimaging, biosensors, and tissue repair.








Abstract
Liquid metals (LMs) as emerging biomaterials possess unique advantages including their favorable biosafety, high fluidity, and excellent electrical and thermal conductivities, thus providing a unique platform for a wide range of biomedical applications ranging from drug delivery, tumor therapy, and bioimaging to biosensors. The structural design and functionalization of LMs endow them with enhanced functions such as enhanced targeting ability and stimuli responsiveness, enabling them to achieve better and even multifunctional synergistic therapeutic effects. Herein, the advantages of LMs in biomedicine are presented. The design of LM&#8208;based biomaterials with different scales ranging from micro&#8208;/nanoscale to macroscale and various components is explored in&#8208;depth to promote the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships, guiding their performance optimization and applications. Furthermore, the related advanced progress in the development of LM&#8208;based biomaterials in biomedicine is summarized. Current challenges and prospects of LMs in the biomedical field are also discussed.

The intrinsic protein&#8208;mimicking properties of nanoparticles (NPs) have great potential in biological and biomedical applications. Representative categories of protein&#8208;mimicking NPs that act as mimics of enzymes, mimics of fluorescent proteins, interacting partners of specific proteins or DNA sequences, and mimics of protein scaffolds in biosystems are summarized.








Abstract
Proteins are essential elements for almost all life activities. The emergence of nanotechnology offers innovative strategies to create a diversity of nanoparticles (NPs) with intrinsic capacities of mimicking the functions of proteins. These artificial mimics are produced in a cost&#8208;efficient and controllable manner, with their protein&#8208;mimicking performances comparable or superior to those of natural proteins. Moreover, they can be endowed with additional functionalities that are absent in natural proteins, such as cargo loading, active targeting, membrane penetrating, and multistimuli responding. Therefore, protein&#8208;mimicking NPs have been utilized more and more often in biosystems for a wide range of applications including detection, imaging, diagnosis, and therapy. To highlight recent progress in this broad field, herein, representative protein&#8208;mimicking NPs that fall into one of the four distinct categories are summarized: mimics of enzymes (nanozymes), mimics of fluorescent proteins, NPs with high affinity binding to specific proteins or DNA sequences, and mimics of protein scaffolds. This review covers their subclassifications, characteristic features, functioning mechanisms, as well as the extensive exploitation of their great potential for biological and biomedical purposes. Finally, the challenges and prospects in future development of protein&#8208;mimicking NPs are discussed.

Here, recent research and developments in design strategies for structurally controlled polymer surfaces via cyclophane&#8208;based chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization with precise control over chemical functionalities and post&#8208;CVD fabrication via orthogonal surface functionalization that facilitates the formation of designable biointerfaces are summarized. Particular discussion about innovative approaches for the templated synthesis of shape&#8208;controlled CVD polymers, ranging from 1D to 3D architecture, including inside confined nanochannels, nanofibers/nanowires synthesis into an anisotropic media such as liquid crystals, and CVD polymer nanohelices via hierarchical chirality transfer across multiple length scales is provided. Aiming at multifunctional polymer surfaces via CVD copolymerization of multiple precursors, the structural and functional design of the fundamental [2.2]paracyclophane (PCP) precursor molecules, that is, functional CVD monomer chemistry is also described. Technologically advanced and innovative surface deposition techniques toward topological micro&#8208; and nanostructuring, including microcontact printing, photopatterning, photomask, and lithographic techniques such as dip&#8208;pen nanolithography, showcasing research from the authors&#8217; laboratories as well as other's relevant important findings in this evolving field are highlighted that have introduced new programmable CVD polymerization capabilities.

         <title>Energy Interplay in Materials: Unlocking Next&#8208;Generation Synchronous Multisource Energy Conversion with Layered 2D Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered 2D crystals are exemplar energy conversion materials, able to convert light, heat, or motion to electricity. These energy conversion processes can also occur synchronously, leading to complex energy interplay networks during energy harvesting/transducing. This synchronous multisource energy conversion needs to be studied and understood to enable the fabrication of next&#8208;generation energy harvesting and conversion systems.








Abstract
Layered 2D crystals have unique properties and rich chemical and electronic diversity, with over 6000 2D crystals known and, in principle, millions of different stacked hybrid 2D crystals accessible. This diversity provides unique combinations of properties that can profoundly affect the future of energy conversion and harvesting devices. Notably, this includes catalysts, photovoltaics, superconductors, solar&#8208;fuel generators, and piezoelectric devices that will receive broad commercial uptake in the near future. However, the unique properties of layered 2D crystals are not limited to individual applications and they can achieve exceptional performance in multiple energy conversion applications synchronously. This synchronous multisource energy conversion (SMEC) has yet to be fully realized but offers a real game&#8208;changer in how devices will be produced and utilized in the future. This perspective highlights the energy interplay in materials and its impact on energy conversion, how SMEC devices can be realized, particularly through layered 2D crystals, and provides a vision of the future of effective environmental energy harvesting devices with layered 2D crystals.

         <title>The Third Dimension of Ferroelectric Domain Walls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tomographic microscopy techniques are applied to image the 3D&#160;network of ferroelectric domain walls in ErMnO3 with nanoscale spatial resolution. The study reveals how electrical currents propagate through the domain wall network and demonstrates the importance of local corrugation phenomena for the electronic transport behavior.








Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls are quasi&#8208;2D systems that show great promise for the development of nonvolatile memory, memristor technology, and electronic components with ultrasmall feature size. Electric fields, for example, can change the domain wall orientation relative to the spontaneous polarization and switch between resistive and conductive states, controlling the electrical current. Being embedded in a 3D&#160;material, however, the domain walls are not perfectly flat and can form networks, which leads to complex physical structures. In this work, the importance of the nanoscale structure for the emergent transport properties is demonstrated, studying electronic conduction in the 3D network of neutral and charged domain walls in ErMnO3. By combining tomographic microscopy techniques and finite element modeling, the contribution of domain walls within the bulk is clarified and the significance of curvature effects for the local conduction is shown down to the nanoscale. The findings provide insights into the propagation of electrical currents in domain wall networks, reveal additional degrees of freedom for their control, and provide quantitative guidelines for the design of domain&#8208;wall&#8208;based technology.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Casting&#8208;Assisted Liquid Additive Engineering for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot casting is shown to allow for reduced loading of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in perovskite precursor inks, and remnant DMSO in films. This suppresses formation of undesired byproducts. The resulting perovskite layers show fewer defects, while their solar cells exhibit superior operational stability under considerable UV&#8208;containing simulated solar exposure over 3000&#160;h.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance inorganic&#8211;organic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are often fabricated with a liquid additive such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which retards crystallization and reduces roughness and pinholes in the perovskite layers. However, DMSO can be trapped during perovskite film formation and induce voids and undesired reaction byproducts upon later processing steps. Here, it is shown that the amount of residual DMSO can be reduced in as&#8208;spin&#8208;coated films significantly through use of preheated substrates, or a so&#8208;called hot&#8208;casting method. Hot casting increases the perovskite film thickness given the same concentration of solutions, which allows for reducing the perovskite solution concentration. By reducing the amount of DMSO in proportion to the concentration of perovskite precursors and using hot casting, it is possible to fabricate perovskite layers with improved perovskite&#8211;substrate interfaces by suppressing the formation of byproducts, which increase trap density and accelerate degradation of the perovskite layers. The best&#8208;performing PSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.4% (23.0% stabilized efficiency) under simulated solar illumination. Furthermore, encapsulated devices show considerably reduced post&#8208;burn&#8208;in decay, retaining 75% and 90% of their initial and post&#8208;burn&#8208;in efficiencies after 3000&#160;h of operation with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under high power of ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;containing continuous light exposure.

         <title>Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficiency Exceeding 25% Realized by Co&#8208;Spacer Cations</title>

By mixing m&#8208;F&#8208;PEA and NMAI to act as large organic cations in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, the phase distribution control and defect passivation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films are realized. As a result, excellent red light emission is achieved with recorded efficiency as high as 25.8% and the maximum luminance exceeding 1300 cd cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have received great attention in recent years due to their narrow emission bandwidth and tunable emission spectrum. Efficient red emission is one of most important parts for lighting and displays. Quasi&#8208;2D perovskites can deliver high emission efficiency due to the strong carrier confinement, while the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of red quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs are inefficient at present, which is due to the complex distribution of different n&#8208;value phases in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. In this work, the phase distribution of the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite is finely controlled by mixing two different large organic cations, which effectively reduces the amount of smaller n&#8208;index phases, meanwhile the passivation of lead and halide defects in perovskite films is realized. Accordingly, the PeLEDs show 25.8% EQE and 1300&#160;cd m&#8722;2 maximum brightness at 680&#160;nm, which exhibits the highest performance for red PeLEDs up to now.

Mixed&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskite compositions represent a promising route toward achieving stable and efficient solar cells. Here, the structural evolution of these absorber layers during full device operation is investigated via operando X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. A stabilizing compressive strain effect leading to the remixing of the halide population is unveiled, providing insight into new strategies toward increased device lifetimes and stability.








Mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskites are among the most promising perovskite compositions for application in a variety of optoelectronic devices due to their high performance, low cost, and bandgap&#8208;tuning capabilities. Instability pathways such as those driven by ionic migration, however, continue to hinder their further progress. Here, an operando variable&#8208;pitch synchrotron grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering technique is used to track the surface and bulk structural changes in mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation perovskite solar cells under continuous load and illumination. By monitoring the evolution of the material structure, it is demonstrated that halide remixing along the electric field and illumination direction during operation hinders phase segregation and limits device instability. Correlating the evolution with directionality&#8208; and depth&#8208;dependent analyses, it is proposed that this halide remixing is induced by an electrostrictive effect acting along the substrate out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. However, this stabilizing effect is overwhelmed by competing halide demixing processes in devices exposed to humid air or with poorer starting performance. The findings shed new light on understanding halide de&#8208; and re&#8208;mixing competitions and their impact on device longevity. These operando techniques allow real&#8208;time tracking of the structural evolution in full optoelectronic devices and unveil otherwise inaccessible insights into rapid structural evolution under external stress&#160;conditions.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity rechargeable K&#8211;Te battery is successfully fabricated. The kinetic barrier in the thick Te cathode is knocked down by the in situ electrochemical self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous Cu1.4Te as a fast ionic pathway, and meanwhile, the K&#8208;metal anode is stabilized by electrolyte regulation. This approach could be extended to other low&#8208;temperature alkali&#8208;metal&#8211;chalcogen battery systems (Li&#8211;S, Li&#8211;Se, Na&#8211;S, Na&#8211;Se, etc.).








Abstract
High mass loading and high areal capacity are key metrics for commercial batteries, which are usually limited by the large charge&#8208;transfer impedance in thick electrodes. This can be kinetically deteriorated under low temperatures, and the realization of high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity batteries in cold climates remains challenging. Herein, a low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity rechargeable potassium&#8211;tellurium (K&#8211;Te) battery is successfully fabricated by knocking down the kinetic barriers in the cathode and pairing it with stable anode. Specifically, the in situ electrochemical self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous Cu1.4Te in a thick electrode is realized simply by coating micro&#8208;sized Te on the Cu collector, significantly improving its ionic conductivity. Meanwhile, the optimized electrolyte enables fast ion transportation and a stable K&#8208;metal anode at a large current density and areal capacity. Consequently, this K&#8211;Te battery achieves a high areal capacity of 1.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, which greatly exceeds those of most reported works. This work highlights the significance of electrode design and electrolyte engineering for high areal capacity at low temperatures, and represents a critical step toward practical applications of low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrostrictive Relaxors with Dispersive Endotaxial Nanoprecipitations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via the construction of novel local heterostructures of polar nanoregions and endotaxial nanoprecipitations with a nonpolar core in relaxor ferroelectric ceramics, an unprecedentedly large hysteresis&#8208;free strain is achieved under a low stimulated electric field, which is suitable for the application of ultrahigh precision actuator systems. The new strategy can open a new realm for the design of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric relaxors.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;precision manufacturing and detection have highlighted the importance of investigating electrostrictive materials with a weak stimulated extrinsic electric field and a simultaneous large hysteresis&#8208;free strain. In this study, a new type of electrostrictive relaxor ferroelectric is designed by constructing a complex inhomogeneous local structure to realize excellent electrostrictive properties. A remarkably large electrostrictive coefficient, M33 (8 &#215; 10&#8722;16 m2 V&#8722;2) is achieved. Through a combined atomic&#8208;scale scanning transmission electron microscopy and advanced in situ high&#8208;energy synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, it is observed that such superior electrostrictive properties can be ascribed to a special domain structure that consists of endotaxial nanoprecipitations embedded in a polar matrix at the phase boundary of the rhombohedral/tetragonal/cubic phases. The matrix contributes to the high strain response under the weak extrinsic electric field because of the highly flexible polarization and randomly dispersed endotaxial nanoprecipitations with a nonpolar central region, which provide a strong restoring force that reduces the strain hysteresis. The approach developed in this study is widely applicable to numerous relaxor ferroelectrics, as well as other dielectrics, for further enhancing their electrical properties, such as electrostriction and energy&#8208;storage capacity.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoparticles encapsulated with porous carbon framework are developed as an efficient electrocatalyst for nitrate (NO3&#8722;) electroreduction at ultralow concentrations. Benefiting from the enrichment effect of porous carbon framework, the yield rate of NH3 for the electrocatalyst reached 469.5&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;.








Abstract
The electroreduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) pollutants to ammonia (NH3)&#160;offers an alternative approach for both wastewater treatment and NH3 synthesis. Numerous electrocatalysts have been reported for the electroreduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3, but most of them demonstrate poor performance at ultralow NO3&#8722; concentrations. In this study, a Cu&#8208;based catalyst for electroreduction of NO3&#8722; at ultralow concentrations is developed by encapsulating Cu nanoparticles in a porous carbon framework (Cu@C). At &#8722;0.3&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), Cu@C achieves Faradaic efficiency for NH3 of 72.0% with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;, which is 3.6 times higher than that of Cu nanoparticles. Notably, at &#8722;0.9&#160;V vs RHE, the yield rate of NH3 for Cu@C is 469.5&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, which is the highest value reported for electrocatalysts with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;. An investigation of the mechanism reveals that NO3&#8722; can be concentrated owing to the enrichment effect of the porous carbon framework in Cu@C, thereby facilitating the mass transfer of NO3&#8722; for efficient electroreduction into NH3 at ultralow concentrations.

         <title>Osteoimmunity&#8208;Regulating Biomimetically Hierarchical Scaffold for Augmented Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D printed scaffold with biomimetically hierarchical porous structure is constructed for augmented bone regeneration through the enhanced immunomodulatory, angiogenic, osteogenic, and weak osteoclastogenic abilities. Such osteoimmunity&#8208;regulating scaffold upregulates M2 macrophages by released carbon monoxide and&#160;Mn2+, enhances neovascularization through secreted vascular endothelial growth factor, and effectively stimulates osteoinductive activity while inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, offering positive enlightenment for promoting large&#8208;scale bone defect repair.








Abstract
Engineering a proper immune response following biomaterial implantation is essential to bone tissue regeneration. Herein, a biomimetically hierarchical scaffold composed of deferoxamine@poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) nanoparticles (DFO@PCL NPs), manganese carbonyl (MnCO) nanosheets, gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel, and a polylactide/hydroxyapatite (HA) matrix is fabricated to augment bone repair by facilitating the balance of the immune system and bone metabolism. First, a 3D printed stiff scaffold with a well&#8208;organized gradient structure mimics the cortical and cancellous bone tissues; meanwhile, an inside infusion of a soft hydrogel further endows the scaffold with characteristics of the extracellular matrix. A Fenton&#8208;like reaction between MnCO and endogenous hydrogen peroxide generated at the implant&#8208;tissue site triggers continuous release of carbon monoxide and Mn2+, thus significantly lessening inflammatory response by upregulating the M2 phenotype of macrophages, which also secretes vascular endothelial growth factor to induce vascular formation. Through activating the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; pathway, Mn2+ and DFO@PCL NP further promote angiogenesis. Moreover, DFO inhibits osteoclast differentiation and synergistically collaborates with the osteoinductive activity of HA. Based on amounts of data in vitro and in vivo, strong immunomodulatory, intensive angiogenic, weak osteoclastogenic, and superior osteogenic abilities of such an osteoimmunity&#8208;regulating scaffold present a profound effect on improving bone regeneration, which puts forward a worthy base and positive enlightenment for large&#8208;scale bone defect repair.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Rich MXene&#8208;Immobilized Ni Single Atoms as a High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalyst for the Hydrazine Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts on Ti defect&#8208;rich Ti3C2Tx MXene are fabricated via a combined defect&#8208;trapping and &#8220;self&#8208;reduction&#8221; process. The optimal Ni SACs on Ti3C2Tx MXene at a Ni loading of 2.93 wt% exhibit superior&#160;catalytic performance for the electrochemical hydrazine oxidation reaction, which is attributed to the optimal electronic density of states that enhances the adsorption energy and lowers the reaction energy barrier.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), on account of their outstanding catalytic potential, are currently emerging&#160;as high&#8208;performance materials in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Constructing a strong interaction between the single atom and its supporting matrix plays a pivotal role. Herein, Ti3C2Tx&#8208;MXene&#8208;supported Ni SACs are reported by using a self&#8208;reduction strategy via the assistance of rich Ti vacancies on the Ti3C2Tx MXene surface, which act as the trap and anchor sites for individual Ni atoms. The constructed Ni SACs supported by the Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ni SACs/Ti3C2Tx ) show an ultralow onset potential of &#8722;0.03 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and an exceptional operational stability toward the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Density functional theory calculations suggest a strong coupling of the Ni single atoms and their&#160;surrounding C atoms, which optimizes the electronic density of states, increasing the adsorption energy and decreasing the reaction activation energy, thus boosting the electrochemical activity. The results presented here will encourage a wider pursuit of 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;supported SACs designed by a vacancy&#8208;trapping strategy.

         <title>Controllable Heterogenous Seeding&#8208;Induced Crystallization for High&#8208;Efficiency FAPbI3&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells Over 24%</title>

         <dc:description>
Heterogenous seeding&#8208;induced crystallization is introduced to assist perovskite growth. Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl(methyl)phosphonium tetrafluoroborate is introduced into the precursor to form a low&#8208;solubility complex with PbI2, which serve as seed to induce perovskite crystallization during solvent evaporation. The hetero&#8208;SiC process is a proven effective way to manipulate the nucleation process and crystal growth, visualized by several in situ measurement tools.








Abstract
The addition of small seeding particles into a supersaturated solution is one among the most effective approaches to obtain high&#8208;quality semiconductor materials via increased crystallization rates. However, limited study is conducted on this approach for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Here, a new strategy&#8212;&#8220;heterogenous seeding&#8208;induced crystallization (hetero&#8208;SiC)&#8221; to assist the growth of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite&#160;is proposed. In this work, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl(methyl)phosphonium tetrafluoroborate is directly introduced into the precursor, which forms a low&#8208;solubility complex with PbI2. The low&#8208;solubility complex can serve as the seed to induce crystallization of the perovskite during the solvent&#8208;evaporation process. Various in situ measurement&#160;tools are used to visualize the hetero&#8208;SiC process, which is shown to be an effective way of manipulating the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites. The hetero&#8208;SiC process greatly improves the film quality, reduces film defects, and suppresses nonradiative recombination. A hetero&#8208;SIC proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device exhibits outstanding performance with 24.0% power conversion efficiency (PCE), well over the control device with 22.2% PCE. Additionally, hetero&#8208;SiC perovskite solar cell (PSC) stability under light illumination is enhanced and the PSC retains 84% of its initial performance after 1400 h of light illumination.

         <title>Visualizing Dynamic Mechanical Actions with High Sensitivity and High Resolution by Near&#8208;Distance Mechanoluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;sensitivity and high&#8208;resolution visualization of dynamic mechanical action is achieved by a proposed near&#8208;distance mechanoluminescence (ML) imaging scheme and an enhanced mechano&#8208;to&#8208;photon convertor. The developed portable ML stress sensor exhibits high sensitivity with a threshold of &#8776;kPa level, high spatial resolution with a pixel size &#8776;100&#160;&#181;m, and fast response of &#8776;3.3&#160;ms.








Abstract
Proportionally converting the applied mechanical energy into photons by individual mechanoluminescent (ML) micrometer&#8208;sized particles opens a new way to develop intelligent electronic skins as it promises high&#8208;resolution stress distribution visualization and fast response. However, a big challenge for ML sensing technology is its low sensitivity in detecting stress. In this work, a novel stress distribution sensor with the detection sensitivity enhanced by two orders of magnitude is developed by combining a proposed near&#8208;distance ML imaging scheme with an improved mechano&#8208;to&#8208;photon convertor. The enhanced sensitivity is the main contributor to the realization of a maximum photon harvesting rate of &#8776;80% in the near&#8208;distance ML imaging scheme. The developed near&#8208;distance ML sensor shows a high sensitivity with a detection limit down to &#8776;kPa level, high spatial resolution of 254&#160;dpi, and fast response with an interval of 3.3&#160;ms, which allows for high&#8208;resolution and real&#8208;time visualization of complex mechanical actions such as irregular solid contacts or fluid impacts, and thus enables use in intelligent electronic skin, structural health monitoring, and human&#8211;computer interaction.

         <title>3D Hydrogel Evaporator with Vertical Radiant Vessels Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off between Thermal Localization and Salt Resistance for Solar Desalination of High&#8208;Salinity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>

A 3D hydrogel evaporator with vertical radiant vessels (VR&#8208;evaporator) is prepared to surmount the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between thermal localization and salt resistance for solar desalination of high&#8208;salinity, thereby achieving a groundbreaking overall performance.








Abstract
Delivering sufficient water to the evaporation surface/interface is one of the most widely adopted strategies to overcome salt accumulation in solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination. However, water transport and heat conduction loss are positively correlated, resulting in the trade&#8208;off between thermal localization and salt resistance. Herein, a 3D hydrogel evaporator with vertical radiant vessels is prepared to surmount the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off, thereby achieving high&#8208;rate and stable solar desalination of high&#8208;salinity. Experiments and numerical simulations reveal that the unique hierarchical structure, which consists of a large vertical vessel channel, radiant vessels, and porous vessel walls, facilitates strong self&#8208;salt&#8208;discharge and low longitudinal thermal conductivity. With the structure employed, a groundbreaking comprehensive performance, under one sun illumination, of evaporation rate as high as 3.53&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, salinity of 20&#160;wt%, and a continuous 8&#160;h evaporation is achieved, which thought to be the best reported result from a salt&#8208;free system. This work showcases the preparation method of a novel hierarchical microstructure, and also provides pivotal insights into the design of next&#8208;generation solar evaporators of high&#8208;efficiency and salt tolerance.

         <title>Periodic Nanoporous Inorganic Patterns Directly Made by Self&#8208;Ordering of Cracks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patterning nanoporous inorganic films by lithography remains a challenge for their integration into functional devices. Liquid deposition of aqueous inks can form patterns via self&#8208;ordering of cracks over several centimeters in both 2D and 3D. The method is chemically versatile and is shown to successfully pattern more than ten functional materials. Periodic arrays of cracks then serve as photonic sensors.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed inorganic nanoporous films are key components for the vast spectrum of applications ranging from dew harvesting to solar cells. Shaping them into complex architectures required for advanced functionality often needs time&#8208;consuming or expensive fabrication. In this work, crack formation is harnessed to pattern porous inorganic films in a single step and without using lithography. Aqueous inks, containing inorganic precursors and polymeric latexes enable evaporation&#8208;induced, defect&#8208;free periodic arrays of cracks with tunable dimensions over several centimeters. The ink formulation strategy is generalized to more than ten inorganic materials including simple and binary porous oxide and metallic films covering a whole spectrum of properties including insulating, photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, conductive, or electrochromic materials. Notably, this approach enables 3D self&#8208;assembly of cracks by stacking several layers of different compositions, yielding periodic assemblies of polygonal shapes and Janus&#8208;type patterns. The crack patterned periodic arrays of nanoporous TiO2 diffract light, and are used as temperature&#8208;responsive diffraction grating sensors. More broadly, this method represents a unique example of a self&#8208;assembly process leading to long&#8208;range order (over several centimeters) in a robust and controlled way.

         <title>A Reactive Superhydrophobic Platform for Living Photolithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach for single&#8208;step fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces with chemical reactivity is presented for photolithography in a living manner. The spatial and temporal controllability of the surface configuration under visible light enables the regulation of the location, density, and species of the functional molecules on the reactive surface, and formation of aqueous/oil microdroplets arrays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels, and integrated enzyme biochips.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces with regional functions have widespread applications in biotechnology, diagnostic applications, and micro&#8208;chemical synthesis and analysis. However, owing to their chemical inertness, superhydrophobic surfaces with chemical reactivity are difficult to achieve. Superhydrophobic surfaces that can be further modified with varied densities and expanded species of the functional moieties are not readily available. In this study, a single&#8208;step approach to achieve a reactive superhydrophobic surface is reported, on which chemical grafting of a library of molecules can be carried out through surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical addition or surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical polymerization. The excellent spatial and temporal controllability of these chemical processes under visible light enables us to take advantage of programmed liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;display (LCD) or Digital Light Processing (DLP) photolithography systems to effortlessly regulate the location, density, and species of the functional molecules on the reactive superhydrophobic surface. The distinctive properties of this surface will provide new insight into intelligent superhydrophobic material development and practical applications, such as aqueous/oil microdroplets array, multi&#8208;anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels and integrated microfluidic reactors with enzymes for chemical logic learning.

         <title>Cold&#8208;Starting All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries from Room Temperature by Thermally Modulated Current Collector in Sub&#8208;Minute</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally modulated current collector is reported, which can rapidly cold&#8208;start all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8211;90&#160;&#176;C) in less than 1 min, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15&#8208;fold compared to one without heating.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) show great potential as high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power energy&#8208;storage devices but their attainable energy/power density at room temperature is severely reduced because of the sluggish kinetics of lithium&#8208;ion transport. Here a thermally modulated current collector (TMCC) is reported, which can rapidly cold&#8208;start ASSBs from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8211;90&#160;&#176;C) in less than 1 min, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15&#8208;fold compared to one without heating.

&lt;p&gt;A thermally modulated current collector is reported, which can rapidly cold-start all-solid-state batteries from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8211;90&#160;&#176;C) in less than 1 min, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15-fold compared to one without heating.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) show great potential as high-energy and high-power energy-storage devices but their attainable energy/power density at room temperature is severely reduced because of the sluggish kinetics of lithium-ion transport. Here a thermally modulated current collector (TMCC) is reported, which can rapidly cold-start ASSBs from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8211;90&#160;&#176;C) in less than 1 min, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15-fold compared to one without heating. This TMCC is prepared by integrating a uniform, ultrathin (&#8776;200&#160;nm) nickel layer as a thermal modulator within an ultralight polymer-based current collector. By isolating the thermal modulator from the ion/electron pathway of ASSBs, it can provide fast, stable heat control yet does not interfere with regular battery operation. Moreover, this ultrathin (13.2&#160;&#181;m) TMCC effectively shortens the heat-transfer pathway, minimizes heat losses, and mitigates the formation of local hot spots. The simulated heating energy consumption can be as low as &#8776;3.94% of the total battery energy.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Molecule Memristor based on an Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Dynamical Structure Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule memristor with long&#8208;lasting retained memory states, high write&#8211;erase endurance, and adjustable on/off ratio is realized by a novel mechanism&#8212;dynamical structure reconfiguration in the Fries rearrangement. Precise manipulation of the potential energy surface of the reaction by external electric fields can retain and switch the corresponding desired species along the reaction coordinate to achieve a memory effect.








Abstract
A robust single&#8208;molecule memristor is prepared by covalently integrating one phenol molecule with multiple binding sites into nanogapped graphene electrodes. Multilevel resistance switching is realized by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;manipulated reconfiguration of the acyl moiety on the phenol center, that is, the Fries rearrangement. In situ measurements of the reaction trajectories with an initial single substrate and an intermediate break through the limitation of macroscopic experiments, therefore unveiling both intramolecular and intermolecular mechanistic pathways (a long&#8208;term controversy) as well as comprehensive dynamic information. Based on this advance, high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule memristors in both the solution and solid states are achieved successively, providing a new understanding of memristive systems and neural network computing.

         <title>An Initial Covalent Organic Polymer with Closed&#8208;F Edges Directly for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An initial F&#8208;decorated quasi&#8208;phthalocyanine covalent organic polymer is prepared, which delivers exceptional catalytic activity in the acidic oxygen reduction reaction and has capability to be directly applied into proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells devices, which is a stride forward among catalysts based on a pyrolysis&#8208;free conjugated&#8208;polymer network in device manner to date.








Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs) are a class of rising electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the atomically metrical control of the organic molecular components along with highly architectural robustness and thermodynamic stability even in acid or alkaline media. However, the direct application of pristine COPs as acidic ORR electrocatalysts, especially in device manner, e.g., in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), remains a big challenge. Currently, the decoration toward electronic structures of active sites is considered a vital pathway to enhancing the acidic ORR activity of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, an initial F&#8208;decorated fully closed &#960;&#8208;conjugated quasi&#8208;phthalocyanine COP (denoted as COPBTC&#8208;F) is reported. The introduction of the closed&#8208;F edges stepwise drags more electrons from FeN4 sites in COPBTC&#8208;F into the catalyst margin, which weakens the occupied numbers of bonding orbitals between COPBTC&#8208;F and OH* intermediates at the rate&#8208;determining step, exhibiting over five times intrinsic performance beyond the counterpart without F functionalities (termed as COPBTC). Significantly, the maximum power density utilizing COPBTC&#8208;F as a cathode catalyst in PEMFCs is remarkably increased by an order of magnitude compared with COPBTC, which is a stride forward among catalysts based on a pyrolysis&#8208;free conjugated&#8208;polymer network in device manner to date.

         <title>A Chiral Dual&#8208;Core Organoboron Structure Realizes Dual&#8208;Channel Enhanced Ultrapure Blue Emission and Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;core strategy, chiral organoboron structures are prepared by direct bonding of two multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) monocores, realizing superior chiroptical property and dual&#8208;channel enhanced ultrapure blue emission. Furthermore, highly efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with maximum external quantum efficiencies of 23.9% and 25.6% are achieved.








Abstract
The realization of luminescent materials with narrowband and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of great significance for the development of future optical and photonic devices. Herein, through a steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;core strategy, two pairs of chiral dual&#8208;core multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials (R/S&#8208;DOBN and R/S&#8208;DOBNT) are directly constructed by the bonding of two organoboron MR&#8208;TADF monocores (SOBN and SOBNT) with carbazole/3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and phenol derivative as donors, realizing obvious CPL and narrowband emissions. Furthermore, the dual&#8208;core effect in the prepared R/S&#8208;DOBN and R/S&#8208;DOBNT increases the transition oscillator strength two times more than that of a monocore structure, while maintaining the ultrapure blue emissions peaking at 453 and 459&#160;nm with a narrower full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 21&#160;nm through reorganization energy reduction. The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the enantiomers exhibit ultrapure blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.10) and (0.13, 0.12), high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 23.9% and 25.6%, and obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence with dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) &#8776; 10&#8722;3.

         <title>Releasable Water Charge&#8208;Trapping and Water&#8208;Resistant Photodetection using 1D Perovskitoid Hydrate Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Releasable water charge&#8208;trapping is observed from the transient absorption spectra in a quasi&#8208;1D perovskitoid single&#8208;crystal hydrate, and a dynamic model is proposed to interpret the charge trapping and release processes. Besides, water&#8208;resistant photodetection devices are fabricated based on this single crystal.








Abstract
Hydrates of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites have been discovered with MAPbI3 and are proved to be unstable in atmosphere. However, the influence of water molecules on the performance of optoelectronic devices is still not fully understood. Here, using a dication, 2&#8208;(dimethylamino) ethylamine (DMEN2+), a stable quasi&#8208;1D&#160;perovskitoid hydrate single crystal is designed and successfully synthesized, which is formulated as DMENPb2I6&#183;H2O. In this design, both corner&#8208;sharing and edge&#8208;sharing connectivity are adopted, and water molecules are connected with the crystal through hydrogen bonding. It is discovered that such water sites distributed along the inorganic chains function both as charge traps and as releasable charge stocks. Optical excitation that overcomes the potential wells formed on these water sites may release these stocked charges and facilitate enhanced transportable charge density. Meanwhile, exciton diffusion and charge transport are strongly confined in the 1D transport channels. Above mechanisms are verified both by the transient absorption spectroscopy and by the photodetection performance. This introduces a new design strategy with a trapping&#8211;stock&#8211;releasing&#8211;transport roadmap for perovskitoid materials. Excellent water resistance endows this material with more advantages in the development of a new generation of optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Hydrates of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites have been discovered with MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and are proved to be unstable in atmosphere. However, the influence of water molecules on the performance of optoelectronic devices is still not fully understood. Here, using a dication, 2-(dimethylamino) ethylamine (DMEN&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), a stable quasi-1D&#160;perovskitoid hydrate single crystal is designed and successfully synthesized, which is formulated as DMENPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. In this design, both corner-sharing and edge-sharing connectivity are adopted, and water molecules are connected with the crystal through hydrogen bonding. It is discovered that such water sites distributed along the inorganic chains function both as charge traps and as releasable charge stocks. Optical excitation that overcomes the potential wells formed on these water sites may release these stocked charges and facilitate enhanced transportable charge density. Meanwhile, exciton diffusion and charge transport are strongly confined in the 1D transport channels. Above mechanisms are verified both by the transient absorption spectroscopy and by the photodetection performance. This introduces a new design strategy with a trapping&#8211;stock&#8211;releasing&#8211;transport roadmap for perovskitoid materials. Excellent water resistance endows this material with more advantages in the development of a new generation of optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Reporting Fluorescent Salicylaldehyde&#8211;Chlorambucil Conjugate as a Type&#8208;II ICD Inducer for Cancer Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemotherapeutic type&#8208;II immunogenic cell death inducer. SA&#8208;Cbl. with fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ability is developed by simple conjugation of chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil with salicylaldehyde. The long&#8208;lasting effect of antitumor immunity of SA&#8208;Cbl is proved to be more effective than the non&#8208;endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeted drug doxorubicin via an in vivo model.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can activate the anticancer immune response and is highly attractive to improve cancer treatment efficacy. ICD is closely related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and a series of ICD inducers has recently been reported based on ER&#8208;targeted photodynamic/photothermal agents or metal complexes. However, these ER&#8208;targeted ICD inducers suffer from complicated synthesis and heavy&#8208;metal cytotoxicity. Inspired by the promising clinical potential of small organic molecules, herein, an ER&#8208;targeted fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ICD inducer, SA&#8208;Cbl, is developed by simple conjugation of the chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (Cbl) with salicylaldehyde (SA). SA&#8208;Cbl can selectively accumulate in the ER to induce rapid ROS generation and an unfolded protein response process, which leads to a fast release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and efficient dendritic cells maturation. Meanwhile, the ER&#8208;targeted accumulation and ER&#8208;stress&#8208;inducing process can be in situ monitored based on the turn&#8208;on fluorescence of SA&#8208;Cbl, which is highly pH&#8208; and polarity&#8208;sensitive and can selectively interact with ER proteins. Compared with the traditional chemotherapy drug doxorubicin, the superior anticancer immunity effect of SA&#8208;Cbl is verified via an in vivo tumor model. This study thus provides a new strategy for developing fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ICD inducers by decoration of chemotherapeutic drugs with pH and polarity&#8208;sensitive organic fluorophores.

         <title>Coordination Symmetry Breaking of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Robust and Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking Cusingle&#8208;atom catalyst enables a good balance between catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability in nitrate electroreduction to ammonia. The catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than 2000 h, while an average ammonia production rate of 27.84 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an industrial level current density of 366 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved.








Abstract
Nitrate electrocatalytic reduction (NO3RR) for ammonia production is a promising strategy to close the N&#8208;cycle from nitration contamination, as well as an alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process with less energy consumption and carbon dioxide release. However, current long&#8208;term stability of NO3RR catalysts is usually tens of hours, far from the requirements for industrialization. Here, symmetry&#8208;broken Cusingle&#8208;atom catalysts are designed, and the catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than 2000 h, while an average ammonia production rate of 27.84&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an industrial level current density of 366&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved, obtaining a good balance between catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability. Coordination symmetry breaking is achieved by embedding one Cu atom in graphene nanosheets with two N and two O atoms in the cis&#8208;configuration, effectively lowering the coordination symmetry, rendering the active site more polar, and accumulating more NO3&#8722; near the electrocatalyst surface. Additionally, the cis&#8208;coordination splits the Cu 3d orbitals, which generates an orbital&#8208;symmetry&#8208;matched &#960;&#8208;complex of the key intermediate *ONH and reduces the energy barrier, compared with the &#963;&#8208;complex generated with other catalysts. These results reveal the critical role of coordination symmetry in single&#8208;atom catalysts, prompting the design of more coordination&#8208;symmetry&#8208;broken electrocatalysts toward possible industrialization.

         <title>A Van Der Waals Reconfigurable Multi&#8208;Valued Logic Device and Circuit Based on Tunable Negative&#8208;Differential&#8208;Resistance Phenomenon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reconfigurable, multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance device with an electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced tunability of multiple threshold voltages is proposed. Following the successful verification of the tunability of multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance phenomenon, the reconfigurability in terms of the function of multi&#8208;valued logic circuits, from ternary inverter to latch circuit, is demonstrated.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;valued logic (MVL) technology that utilizes more than two logic states has recently been reconsidered because of the demand for greater power saving in current binary logic systems. Extensive efforts have been invested in developing MVL devices with multiple threshold voltages by adopting negative differential transconductance and resistance. In this study, a reconfigurable, multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance (m&#8208;NDR) device with an electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced tunability of multiple threshold voltages is reported, which comprises a BP/ReS2 heterojunction and a ReS2/h&#8208;BN/metal capacitor. Tunability for the m&#8208;NDR phenomenon is achieved via the resistance modulation of the ReS2 layer by electrical pulses applied to the capacitor region. Reconfigurability is verified in terms of the function of an MVL circuit composed of a reconfigurable m&#8208;NDR device and a load transistor, wherein staggered&#8208;type and broken&#8208;type double peak&#8208;NDR device operations are adopted for ternary inverter and latch circuits, respectively.

         <title>Kirigami&#8208;Inspired Pressure Sensors for Wearable Dynamic Cardiovascular Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kirigami&#8208;inspired pressure sensor is developed for wearable dynamic cardiovascular monitoring. Utilizing the vertical kirigami&#8208;inspired structure and a simple fabrication process, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable bioelectronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring human pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement toward personalized cardiovascular monitoring in the era of the Internet of things.








Abstract
Continuously and accurately monitoring pulse&#8208;wave signals is critical to prevent and diagnose cardiovascular diseases. However, existing wearable pulse sensors are vulnerable to motion artifacts due to the lack of proper adhesion and conformal interface with human skin during body movement. Here, a highly sensitive and conformal pressure sensor inspired by the kirigami structure is developed to measure the human pulse wave on different body artery sites under various prestressing pressure conditions and even with body movement. COMSOL multiphysical field coupling simulation and experimental testing are used to verify the unique advantages of the kirigami structure. The device shows a superior sensitivity (35.2&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1) and remarkable stability (&gt;84&#160;000 cycles). Toward practical applications, a wireless cardiovascular monitoring system is developed for wirelessly transmitting the pulse signals to a mobile phone in real&#8208;time, which successfully distinguished the pulse waveforms from different participants. The pulse waveforms measured by the kirigami inspired pressure sensor are as accurate as those provided by the commercial medical device. Given the compelling features, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable electronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement toward personalized healthcare in the era of the Internet of Things.

         <title>Controllable Inverse Photoconductance in Semiconducting Nanowire Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interesting phenomenon in that Te nanowires (NWs) behave with&#160;a&#160;negative photoresponse to positive photoresponse under enlarged optical intensities from the UV to VIS&#8211;IR region is reported. The inverse photoconductance can be attributed to the competition between the photoconductive effect and oxygen desorption effect. Moreover, the influence of the size of Te NWs and their layers is also discussed.








Abstract
As a typical p&#8208;type semiconductor, tellurium (Te) has been widely studied for the construction of photodetectors. However, only the positive photoconductance of Te&#8208;based photodetectors based on the photoconductive effect has been observed in the reported literature. Herein, an unusual but interesting phenomenon, in&#160;that tellurium nanowires (NWs) behave with&#160;negative photoresponse to positive photoresponse under enlarged optical intensities from the UV to VIS&#8211;IR region is reported. According to the experiments and simulations, adsorbed oxygen on the surface of Te NWs plays a significant role in the abnormal photoresponse. The inverse photoconductance can be attributed to the competition between the photoconductive effect and the oxygen desorption effect. Moreover, the influence of the size and layers of Te NWs is also discussed. This inverse photoconductance phenomenon is further explored by introducing the Te&#8211;Au heterojunction system. Hot&#8208;electron injection at the Te&#8211;Au heterojunction interface induces a more obvious tendency to behave with a negative photoresponse. These findings will be beneficial for potential applications of Te&#8208;NW&#8208;based photodetectors.

         <title>Top&#8208;Layer Engineering Reshapes Charge Transfer at Polar Oxide Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polar discontinuity at the interface between ferromagnetic insulating double&#8208;perovskite La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) and SrTiO3 triggers the formation of Mn3+ at both LNMO interfaces. Such electron doping is detrimental to Ni/Mn ordering and Curie temperature of films thinner than 10 uc. Engineering the charge transfer with a LaNiO3 overlayer results in optimized ferromagnetic properties, only restricted by dimensionality effects.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer phenomena at heterointerfaces are a promising pathway to engineer functionalities absent in bulk materials but can also lead to degraded properties in ultrathin films. Mitigating such undesired effects with an interlayer reshapes the interface architecture, restricting its operability. Therefore, developing less&#8208;invasive methods to control charge transfer will be beneficial. Here, an appropriate top&#8208;interface design allows for remote manipulation of the charge configuration of the buried interface and concurrent restoration of the ferromagnetic trait of the whole film. Double&#8208;perovskite insulating ferromagnetic La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) thin films grown on perovskite oxide substrates are investigated as a model system. An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;assisted electronic reconstruction takes place initially at the LNMO polar interfaces. As a result, the magnetic properties of 2&#8211;5 unit cell LNMO films are affected beyond dimensionality effects. The introduction of a top electron&#8208;acceptor layer redistributes the electron excess and restores the ferromagnetic properties of the ultrathin LNMO films. Such a strategy can be extended to other interfaces and provides an advanced approach to fine&#8208;tune the electronic features of complex multilayered heterostructures.

         <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties of Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Micro&#8211;Nano Fibers via Thermal Drawing and Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8211;nano Bi2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectric fibers with an interfacial engineering effect are fabricated by thermal drawing. The 4 &#181;m&#8208;diameter fibers achieve a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value (ZT &#8776; 1.4) at 300 K and show a reversible bending radius smaller than 50 &#181;m, approaching the theoretical limit of elastic strain. This fabrication strategy works for large&#8208;scale inorganic thermoelectric materials and benefits the development of fiber&#8208;based thermoelectric devices.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance thermoelectric (TE) materials with great flexibility and stability are urgently needed to efficiently convert heat energy into electrical power. Recently, intrinsically crystalline, mechanically stable, and flexible inorganic TE fibers that show TE properties comparable to their bulk counterparts have been&#160;of interest to researchers. Despite remarkable progress in moving TE fibers toward room&#8208;temperature TE conversion, the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value (ZT) and bending stability still need enhancement. Herein, interfacial&#8208;engineering&#8208;enhanced TE properties of micro&#8211;nano polycrystalline TE fibers fabricated by thermally drawing Bi2Te3&#8208;based bulks in a glass&#8208;fiber template are reported. The interfacial engineering effect comes from generating stress&#8208;induced oriented nanocrystals to increase electrical conductivity and producing strain&#8208;distorted interfaces to decrease thermal conductivity. The 4 &#181;m&#8208;diameter fibers achieve a 40% higher ZT (&#8776;1.4 at 300&#160;K) than their bulk counterparts and show a reversible bending radius of 50&#160;&#181;m, approaching the theoretical elastic limit. This fabrication strategy works for a wide range of inorganic TE materials and benefits the development of fiber&#8208;based micro&#8208;TE devices.

         <title>Integrated Urinalysis Devices Based on Interface&#8208;Engineered Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Biosensors Incorporated With Electronic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;specificity electronic device based on an interface&#8208;engineered field&#8208;effect transistor biosensor is engineered for non&#8208;invasive urinalysis. The urinalysis device achieves the reliable identification of five bladder&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated proteins in urine samples. Integrated with a machine&#8208;learning algorithm, the device realizes a 95.0% bladder cancer diagnosis accuracy and can classify cancer stages with a 90.0% accuracy.








Abstract
Urinalysis is attractive in non&#8208;invasive early diagnosis of bladder cancer compared with clinical gold standard cystoscopy. However, the trace bladder tumor biomarkers in urine and the particularly complex urine environment pose significant challenges for urinalysis. Here, a clinically adoptable urinalysis device that integrates molecular&#8208;specificity indium gallium zinc oxide field&#8208;effect transistor (IGZO FET) biosensor arrays, a device control panel, and an internet terminal for directly analyzing five bladder&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated proteins in clinical urine samples, is reported for bladder cancer diagnosis and classification. The IGZO FET biosensors with engineered sensing interfaces provide high sensitivity and selectivity for identification of trace proteins in the complex urine environment. Integrating with a machine&#8208;learning algorithm, this device can identify bladder cancer with an accuracy of 95.0% in a cohort of 197 patients and 75 non&#8208;bladder&#160;cancer individuals, distinguishing cancer stages with an overall accuracy of 90.0% and assessing bladder cancer recurrence after surgical treatment. The non&#8208;invasive urinalysis device defines a robust technology for remote healthcare and personalized medicine.

         <title>Multimode Electron Tomography Sheds Light on Synthesis, Structure, and Properties of Complex Metal&#8208;Based Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced 3D characterization techniques for complex metal&#8208;based nanomaterials by multimode electron tomography are reviewed. Advancements in data acquisition and processing are discussed, in addition to case studies of complex nanomaterials where morphology, elemental distribution, and oxidation states must be understood in 3D to gain crucial insights and drive future design and synthesis of complex nanosystems.








Abstract
Electron tomography has become a cornerstone technique for the visualization of nanoparticle morphology in three dimensions. However, to obtain in&#8208;depth information about a nanoparticle beyond surface faceting and morphology, different electron microscopy signals must be combined. The most notable examples of these combined signals include annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF&#8208;STEM) with different collection angles and the combination of ADF&#8208;STEM with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray or electron energy loss spectroscopies. Here, the experimental and computational development of various multimode tomography techniques in connection to the fundamental materials science challenges that multimode tomography has been instrumental to overcoming are summarized. Although the techniques can be applied to a wide variety of compositions, the study is restricted to metal and metal oxide nanoparticles for the sake of simplicity. Current challenges and future directions of multimode tomography are additionally discussed.

&lt;p&gt;Advanced 3D characterization techniques for complex metal-based nanomaterials by multimode electron tomography are reviewed. Advancements in data acquisition and processing are discussed, in addition to case studies of complex nanomaterials where morphology, elemental distribution, and oxidation states must be understood in 3D to gain crucial insights and drive future design and synthesis of complex nanosystems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electron tomography has become a cornerstone technique for the visualization of nanoparticle morphology in three dimensions. However, to obtain in-depth information about a nanoparticle beyond surface faceting and morphology, different electron microscopy signals must be combined. The most notable examples of these combined signals include annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with different collection angles and the combination of ADF-STEM with energy-dispersive X-ray or electron energy loss spectroscopies. Here, the experimental and computational development of various multimode tomography techniques in connection to the fundamental materials science challenges that multimode tomography has been instrumental to overcoming are summarized. Although the techniques can be applied to a wide variety of compositions, the study is restricted to metal and metal oxide nanoparticles for the sake of simplicity. Current challenges and future directions of multimode tomography are additionally discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The recent advances, strategies, insights, and challenges of data&#8208;driven&#8208;based innovations and applications in material science are discussed. Essential subdisciplines, including framework, machine&#8208;learning algorithms, available chemical databases, commonly used key descriptors, and innovations and applications based on their synergy, are reviewed.








Abstract
Owing to the rapid developments to improve the accuracy and efficiency of both experimental and computational investigative methodologies, the massive amounts of data generated have led the field of materials science into the fourth paradigm of data&#8208;driven scientific research. This transition requires the development of authoritative and up&#8208;to&#8208;date frameworks for data&#8208;driven approaches for material innovation. A critical discussion on the current advances in the data&#8208;driven discovery of materials with a focus on frameworks, machine&#8208;learning algorithms, material&#8208;specific databases, descriptors, and targeted applications in the field of inorganic materials is presented. Frameworks for rationalizing data&#8208;driven material innovation are described, and a critical review of essential subdisciplines is presented, including: i) advanced data&#8208;intensive strategies and machine&#8208;learning algorithms; ii) material databases and related tools and platforms for data generation and management; iii) commonly used molecular descriptors used in data&#8208;driven processes. Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth discussion on the broad applications of material innovation, such as energy conversion and storage, environmental decontamination, flexible electronics, optoelectronics, superconductors, metallic glasses, and magnetic materials, is provided. Finally, how these subdisciplines (with insights into the synergy of materials science, computational tools, and mathematics) support data&#8208;driven paradigms is outlined, and the opportunities and challenges in data&#8208;driven material innovation are highlighted.

         <title>Mass Transfer Printing of Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Films and Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust transfer&#8208;printing method is developed using an ultrathin chemical bonding interfacial layer. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit similar performance as optimized spin&#8208;coated LEDs, and the transfer&#8208;printed nanostructure reaches a high resolution up to 1270 ppi. A white perovskite LED structure is finally demonstrated with laterally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes made by the multiple transfer&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Most methods of depositing perovskite films cannot meet the diverse requirements of real applications such as depositing films on various types of substrates, making patterns with different bandgaps for full&#8208;color display. Here, a robust mass transfer method of perovskite films and nanostructures is reported, meeting those requirements, by using an ultrathin branched polyethylenimine as interfacial chemical bonding layers. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite films exhibit comparable morphology, composition, optoelectronic properties, and device performances with the counterparts made by optimized spin&#8208;coating methods. The perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) using the transfer&#8208;printed films show decent external quantum efficiencies of 10.5% and 6.7% for red (680&#160;nm) and sky&#8208;blue (493&#160;nm) emissions, which are similar to the devices made by spin&#8208;coating. This robust transfer printing method also enables the the preparation of perovskite micropatterns with a high resolution up to 1270 pixels per inch. Horizontally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes are further obtained through multiple printing processes for white PeLEDs. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy for making perovskite films or micropatterns on various substrates for real applications in full&#8208;color display, white LEDs, lasing, etc.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Photoelectric Detection and Imaging Enhanced by the Pyro&#8208;Phototronic Effect Based on a Photoinduced Dynamic Schottky Effect in 4H&#8208;SiC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered 4H&#8208;SiC ultraviolet photodetector is realized using a strong photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect, and the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect is first revealed in N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC, which is beneficial to further enhance the photodetection performance. Moreover, via delicate position designs of electrodes, the 4H&#8208;SiC chip reveals efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities.








Abstract
Silicon carbide (SiC), one of the third&#8208;generation semiconductor materials with excellent electrical and optoelectronic properties, is ideal for high light&#8208;sensing performance. Here, a self&#8208;powered SiC ultraviolet (UV) photodetector (PD) is constructed with wider applicability and higher commercialization potential. The great performance of the PD is realized by a remarkable photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect derived from the symbiotic modulation of Schottky and Ohmic contact. Using the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect that exists in the N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC single crystal PDs, a fast pyroelectric response time of 0.27 s is achieved, which is almost ten times shorter than that obtained from the steady&#8208;state signal under UV illumination. The maximal transient photoresponsivity reaches 9.12 nA mW&#8722;1, which is &#8776;20% higher than the conventional photoelectric signal. Moreover, different regions of the 4H&#8208;SiC centimeter&#8208;scale chip output distinct signals under UV illumination, demonstrating efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities of this device. This work not only reveals the fundamental optoelectronic physics lying in this vital third&#8208;generation semiconductor, but also sheds light on its potential photosensing applications for large&#8208;scale commercialization.

         <title>Anode Catalysts in Anion&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Electrolysis without Supporting Electrolyte: Conductivity, Dynamics, and Ionomer Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reach the required scale for green hydrogen, it must be produced with efficient, low&#8208;capital&#8208;expense electrolyzers using non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group catalysts. In this work, oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts in pure&#8208;water anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer devices are studied. Processes causing device failure are illustrated, nano&#8208;Co3O4 is shown to be a viable catalyst, and design rules for engineering catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability are proposed.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) in principle operate without soluble electrolyte using earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and cell materials and thus lower the cost of green H2. Current systems lack competitive performance and the durability needed for commercialization. One critical issue is a poor understanding of catalyst&#8208;specific degradation processes in the electrolyzer. While non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (non&#8208;PGM) oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts show excellent performance and durability in strongly alkaline electrolyte, this has not transferred directly to pure&#8208;water AEMWEs. Here, AEMWEs with five non&#8208;PGM anode catalysts are built and the catalysts&#8217; structural stability and interactions with the alkaline ionomer are characterized during electrolyzer operation and post&#8208;mortem. The results show catalyst electrical conductivity is one key to obtaining high&#8208;performing systems and that many non&#8208;PGM catalysts restructure during operation. Dynamic Fe sites correlate with enhanced degradation rates, as does the addition of soluble Fe impurities. In contrast, electronically conductive Co3O4 nanoparticles (without Fe in the crystal structure) yield AEMWEs from simple, standard preparation methods, with performance and stability comparable to IrO2. These results reveal the fundamental dynamic catalytic processes resulting in AEMWE device failure under relevant conditions, demonstrate a viable non&#8208;PGM catalyst for AEMWE operation, and illustrate underlying design rules for engineering anode catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability.

         <title>Volatile Organic Compound Sensing Array and Optoelectronic Filter System using Ion&#8208;Pairing Dyes with a Wide Visible Spectrum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief methodology to synthesize sensing materials (e.g., ion&#8208;paring dyes) with hydrophobicity, ease of color tunability, and a wide visible spectrum is suggested. This can simplify the sensing array, thereby producing a color map distinguishing functional groups as well as carbon chain lengths. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes will be extended to the electronic system promising the safety and health of the user.








Abstract
An ideal dye&#8208;based sensing array has essential design requirements, including facile preparation methodology, tolerance to water vapor, a broad range of color&#8208;responsive changes, and a simple readout system. Here, a brief synthetic route is developed for ion&#8208;pairing dyes exhibiting unusual chromatic changes across the entire visible spectrum. It requires only mixing and precipitation under mild conditions. The dyes are applied to a sensing array containing 12 sensing elements with different initial states. Owing to the numerous color variations of the dyes, the color map generated by the array is highly simple yet sufficiently accurate to distinguish among the different functional groups (such as amines, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) as well as carbon chain lengths. Principle component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be well classified according to the color changes of the sensing array. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes are embedded into&#160;3D&#160;stacked nanofibers via electrospinning, and function as effective harmful&#8208;gas (e.g., formaldehyde) sensors with sub&#8208;ppm theoretical detection limits (0.15&#160;ppm). Finally, the 3D stacked nanofibers can be employed in an optoelectronic filter system that automatically checks for formaldehyde in the surroundings and also confirms the effective removal of the detected formaldehyde by the gas filter cartridge.

         <title>Photoactivatable Silencing Extracellular Vesicle (PASEV) Sensitizes Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle is developed, which not only serves as a nanocarrier for packaging, tumor accumulation, and intracellular release of small interfering RNA against p21&#8208;activated kinase 4 to boost intratumoral&#160;immune infiltration, but also is able to initiate antitumor immunity through immunogenic phototherapy. The combined immunotherapy between boosted immune infiltration and immune activation elicits superior antitumor outcome.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has delivered impressive outcomes in combating tumor malignancies. However, insufficient immune infiltration and poor immunogenicity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) greatly compromise patient response rates. Here, a photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle (PASEV) is developed for sensitized cancer immunotherapy. p21&#8208;Activated kinase 4 (PAK4) is a newly identified tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;intrinsic &#8220;guard&#8221; associated with immune exclusion. Small interfering RNA against PAK4 (siPAK4) is designed and assembled with a photoactivatable reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer to form the nanocomplex core, which is further camouflaged by extracellular vesicles from M1 macrophages. The PASEV not only serves as a vehicle for packaging, tumor accumulation, and ROS&#8208;responsive release of siPAK4 for potent PAK4 silencing, but also primes the TME through immunogenic phototherapy, thereby simultaneously boosting intratumoral infiltration and immune activation. The combined immunotherapy elicits robust anticancer immunity, thus showing great promise for fighting cancers. This work opens a new avenue to simultaneously boost intratumoral infiltration and immune activation for sensitized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectric Resonant Tunneling Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors under external voltage in perovskite oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 quantum&#8208;well structures are reported. The NDR ratio can be modified by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the polarization states of the ferroelectric barrier, and a large OFF/ON resistance ratio up to 23 000 is obtained.








Abstract
Resonant tunneling is a quantum&#8208;mechanical effect in which electron transport is controlled by the discrete energy levels within a quantum&#8208;well (QW) structure. A ferroelectric resonant tunneling diode (RTD) exploits the switchable electric polarization state of the QW barrier to tune the device resistance. Here, the discovery of robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric&#8208;modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors in all&#8208;perovskite&#8208;oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 QW structures is reported. The resonant current amplitude and voltage are tunable by the switchable polarization of the BaTiO3 ferroelectric with the NDR ratio modulated by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude and an OFF/ON resistance ratio exceeding a factor of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;104. The observed NDR effect is explained an energy bandgap between Ru&#8208;t2g and Ru&#8208;eg orbitals driven by electron&#8211;electron correlations, as follows from density functional theory calculations. This study paves the way for ferroelectric&#8208;based quantum&#8208;tunneling devices in future oxide electronics.

         <title>Excimer Formation in the Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals 2D Semiconductor Bi2O2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excimer formation is unambiguously demonstrated in non&#8208;van der Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se via transient absorption spectroscopy. The excimer in Bi2O2Se nanosheets is diffusive and its formation can be described as excitons relax to an excimer geometry driven by the ultrafast photoscreening of the intrinsic built&#8208;in dipolar electric field.








Abstract
The layered semiconductor Bi2O2Se is a promising new&#8208;type 2D material that holds layered structure via electrostatic forces instead of van der Waals (vdW) attractions. Aside from the huge success in device performance, the non&#8208;vdW nature in Bi2O2Se with a built&#8208;in interlayer electric field has also provided an appealing platform for investigating unique photoexcited carrier dynamics. Here, experimental evidence for the observation of excimers in multilayer Bi2O2Se nanosheets via transient absorption spectroscopy is presented. It is found that the excimer formation is the primary decay pathway of photoexcited excitons and three&#8208;stage excimer dynamics with corresponding time scales are established. Excitation&#8208;fluence&#8208;dependent excimer dynamics further suggest that the excimer is diffusive and its formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work indicates the outstanding promise of unique excitonic processes in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device designs.

         <title>Instantaneous High&#8208;Resolution Visual Imaging of Latent Fingerprints in Water Using Color&#8208;Tunable AIE Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The instantaneous visualization of latent fingerprints (LFPs) is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water under UV light or ambient sunlight. Remarkably, LFPs can be visualized within seconds including details at the Level 3, shedding light on the potential security protection and criminal investigation in various scenarios.








Abstract
Instant visualization of latent fingerprints is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water, under UV light or ambient sunlight. By simply soaking, or spraying with an aqueous solution of the probe, bright yellow fluorescence images with high contrast and resolution are readily developed on various surfaces including tinfoil, glass, paper, steel, leather, and ceramic tile.

&lt;p&gt;The instantaneous visualization of latent fingerprints (LFPs) is developed by using a series of water-soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation-induced emission probes in pure water under UV light or ambient sunlight. Remarkably, LFPs can be visualized within seconds including details at the Level 3, shedding light on the potential security protection and criminal investigation in various scenarios.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instant visualization of latent fingerprints is developed by using a series of water-soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation-induced emission probes in pure water, under UV light or ambient sunlight. By simply soaking, or spraying with an aqueous solution of the probe, bright yellow fluorescence images with high contrast and resolution are readily developed on various surfaces including tinfoil, glass, paper, steel, leather, and ceramic tile. Remarkably, latent fingerprints can be visualized within seconds including details of whorl and sweat pores. The color of emission can be tuned from blue to orange by modifying the pincer ligands, allowing direct imaging under sunlight. These inexpensive, water-resistant, and color-tunable probes provide a practical approach for latent fingerprints recording and analysis, security protection, as well as criminal investigation in different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Magnetoactive and Electro&#8211;Ionic Soft Actuator Derived from a Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuator is presented by an engineering of unprecedented nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF). It can nurture the complex motion for relevant robotic interaction. The magneto&#8211;electro&#8208;ionic soft actuator obtained from the newly developed Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived active material is successfully utilized to demonstrate hovering motion of a hummingbird robot under magnetic and electrical stimuli.








Abstract
There is growing demand for multiresponsive soft actuators for the realization of natural, safe, and complex motions in robotic interactions. In particular, soft actuators simultaneously stimulated by electrical and magnetic fields are always under development owing to their simple controllability and reliability during operation. Herein, magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuators (MESAs) derived from novel nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C), are reported. Nanoscale Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C has excellent electrochemical and magnetic properties that allow it to be used as a multifunctional material under both magnetoactive and electro&#8208;ionic actuations. The dual&#8208;responsive MESA exhibits a bending displacement of 30&#160;mm and an ultrafast rising time of 1.5 s under a very low input voltage of 1&#160;V and also exerts a bending deflection of 12.5&#160;mm at 50 mT under a high excitation frequency of 5&#160;Hz. By utilizing a dual&#8208;responsive MESA, the hovering motion of a hummingbird robot is demonstrated under magnetic and electrical stimuli.

         <title>Semicrystalline Conjugated Polymers with Well&#8208;Defined Active Sites for Nitrogen Fixation in a Seawater Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface is well constructed by introducing a suitable semicrystalline structure in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers to significantly boost the nitrogen reduction reaction with a high Faradaic efficiency of 60.5% and a maximum NH3 yield rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte.








Abstract
Faradaic efficiency for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is often limited by low N2 solubility in the electrolyte, while a large number of intimate contacts between the electrolyte and solid catalyst can also inevitably sacrifice many active sites for the NRR. Here, it is reported that a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface formed in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers (CPs) is beneficial to boosting the NRR process and at the same time suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Of particular interest, it is found that a semicrystalline CP catalyst, SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT, exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of up to 60.5% with a maximum NH3 production rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte. Molecular dynamics and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations reveal the origin of the observed high NRR performance arising from the presence of desirable crystal regions to resist the penetration of H2O molecules, leading to the formation of a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface inside the catalyst for a favorable direct&#8208;contact between the catalyst and N2 molecules. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput computations, based on density functional theory, reveal the actual real active site for N2 adsorption and reduction in SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT. This work provides a new framework for optimizing NRR performance of metal&#8208;free catalysts by controlling their crystallinities.

         <title>Endocytosis&#8208;Independent and Cancer&#8208;Selective Cytosolic Protein Delivery via Reversible Tagging with LAT1 substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pro&#8208;protein approach is developed based on reversible tagging with l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) substrate, which enables carrier&#8208;free, cancer&#8208;selective, and endocytosis&#8208;independent cytosolic delivery via LAT1&#8208;mediated direct transport. It demonstrates high generality and robust efficiency for varieties of functional proteins, including enzymes, toxins, antibodies, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein. This facile and versatile platform holds transformative potentials in protein pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Protein drugs targeting intracellular machineries have shown profound therapeutic potentials, but their clinical utilities are greatly hampered by the lack of efficient cytosolic delivery techniques. Existing strategies mainly rely on nanocarriers or conjugated cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), which often have drawbacks such as materials complexity/toxicity, lack of cell specificity, and endolysosomal entrapment. Herein, a unique carrier&#8208;free approach is reported for mediating cancer&#8208;selective and endocytosis&#8208;free cytosolic protein delivery. Proteins are sequentially modified with 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 4&#8208;(4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzyl carbonate as the H2O2&#8208;responsive domain and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine as the substrate of l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). Thus, the pro&#8208;protein can be directly transported into tumor cells by overexpressed LAT1 on cell membranes, bypassing endocytosis and endolysosomal entrapment. In the cytosol, overproduced H2O2 restores the protein structure and activity. Using this technique, versatile proteins are delivered into tumor cells with robust efficiency, including toxins, enzymes, CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, and antibodies. Furthermore, intravenously injected pro&#8208;protein of saporin shows potent anticancer efficacy in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, without provoking systemic toxicity. Such a facile and versatile pro&#8208;protein platform may benefit the development of protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Multiscale Functional Metal Architectures by Antibody&#8208;Guided Metallization of Specific Protein Assemblies in Ex Vivo Multicellular Organisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of metallic structures mimicking the specific protein assemblies in multicellular organisms, such as human cells and animal tissue, is demonstrated via antibody&#8211;antigen interactions and electroless deposition. This work enables the use of diverse protein structures that are arranged in unique 3D geometries optimized for certain functions as scaffolds for biotemplating.








Abstract
Biological systems consist of hierarchical protein structures, each of which has unique 3D&#160;geometries optimized for specific functions. In the past decades, the growth of inorganic materials on specific proteins has attracted considerable attention. However, the use of specific proteins as templates has only been demonstrated in relatively simple organisms, such as viruses, limiting the range of structures that can be used as scaffolds. This study proposes a method for synthesizing metallic structures that resemble the 3D assemblies of specific proteins in mammalian cells and animal tissues. Using 1.4 nm nanogold&#8208;conjugated antibodies, specific proteins within cells and ex vivo tissues are labeled, and then the nanogold acts as nucleation sites for growth of metal particles. As proof of concept, various metal particles are grown using microtubules in cells as templates. The metal&#8208;containing cells are applied as catalysts and show catalytic stability in liquid&#8208;phase reactions due to the rigid support provided by the microtubules. Finally, this method is used to produce metal structures that replicate the specific protein assemblies of neurons in the mouse brain or the extracellular matrices in the mouse kidney and heart. This new biotemplating approach can facilitate the conversion of specific protein structures into metallic forms in ex vivo multicellular organisms.

However, the use of specific proteins as templates has only been demonstrated in relatively simple organisms, such as viruses, limiting the range of structures that can be used as scaffolds. This study proposes a method for synthesizing metallic structures that resemble the 3D assemblies of specific proteins in mammalian cells and animal tissues. Using 1.4 nm nanogold-conjugated antibodies, specific proteins within cells and ex vivo tissues are labeled, and then the nanogold acts as nucleation sites for growth of metal particles. As proof of concept, various metal particles are grown using microtubules in cells as templates. The metal-containing cells are applied as catalysts and show catalytic stability in liquid-phase reactions due to the rigid support provided by the microtubules. Finally, this method is used to produce metal structures that replicate the specific protein assemblies of neurons in the mouse brain or the extracellular matrices in the mouse kidney and heart. This new biotemplating approach can facilitate the conversion of specific protein structures into metallic forms in ex vivo multicellular organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of 2D Molybdenum Phosphide via Surface&#8208;Confined Atomic Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology and tunable crystallinity can be prepared from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface&#8208;confined atomic substitution. In contrast to the well&#8208;documented edge&#8208;dominated electrocatalytic performance of the MoS2 precusor, the entire basal plane of MoP demonstrates satisfying electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance owing to its coordination&#8208;unsaturated surface atoms with abundant dangling bonds.








Abstract
The emerging nonlayered 2D materials (NL2DMs) are sparking immense interest due to their fascinating physicochemical properties and enhanced performance in many applications. NL2DMs are particularly favored in catalytic applications owing to the extremely large surface area and low&#8208;coordinated surface atoms. However, the synthesis of NL2DMs is complex because their crystals are held together by strong isotropic covalent bonds. Here, nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology is synthesized from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface&#8208;confined atomic substitution. During the synthesis, the molybdenum dichalcogenide nanosheet&#160;functions as the host matrix where each layer of Mo maintains their hexagonal arrangement and forms isotropic covalent bonds with P that substitutes S, resulting in the conversion from layered van der Waals material to a covalently bonded NL2DM. The MoP nanosheets converted from few&#8208;layer MoS2 are single crystalline, while those converted from monolayers are amorphous. The converted MoP demonstrates metallic charge transport and desirable performance in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). More importantly, in contrast to MoS2, which shows edge&#8208;dominated HER performance, the edge and basal plane of MoP deliver similar HER performance, which is correlated with theoretical calculations. This work provides a new synthetic strategy for high&#8208;quality nonlayered materials with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology for future exploration.

         <title>The Energy Level Conundrum of Organic Semiconductors in Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photovoltaic gap measured by ultraviolet and low&#8208;energy photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS/LE&#8208;IPES) gives the best correlation to device properties, enabling the prediction of maximum Voc. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)&#8208;derived redox potentials are less meaningful for predicting the energetic landscape at the &#8220;donor&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;acceptor&#8221; interface.








Abstract
The frontier molecular energy levels of organic semiconductors are decisive for their fundamental function and efficiency in optoelectronics. However, the precise determination of these energy levels and their variation when using different techniques makes it hard to compare and establish design rules. In this work, the energy levels of 33 organic semiconductors via cyclic voltammetry (CV), density functional theory, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and low&#8208;energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy are determined. Solar cells are fabricated to obtain key device parameters and relate them to the significant differences in the energy levels and offsets obtained from different methods. In contrast to CV, the photovoltaic gap measured using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) correlates well with the experimental device VOC. It is demonstrated that high&#8208;performing systems such as PM6:Y6 and WF3F:Y6, which are previously reported to have negligible ionization energy (IE) offsets (&#916;IE), possess sizable &#916;IE of &#8776;0.5&#160;eV, determined by PES. Using various D&#8211;A blends, it is demonstrated that &#916;IE plays a key role in charge generation. In contrast to earlier reports, it is shown that a vanishing &#916;IE is detrimental to device performance. Overall, these findings establish a solid base for reliably evaluating material energetics and interpreting property&#8211;performance relationships in organic solar cells.

         <title>Emergent Magnetic Fan Structures in Manganite Homojunction Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese oxide homojunctions with gradually modulated doping level host surprisingly complex, long&#8208;range ordered magnetic superstructures whose spin alignment is tunable by low magnetic fields. Homojunctions can thus serve as a powerful design element of all&#8208;oxide spintronic devices.








Abstract
Devices with tunable magnetic noncollinearity are important components of superconducting electronics and spintronics, but they typically require epitaxial integration of several complex materials. The spin&#8208;polarized neutron reflectometry measurements on La1&#8722;xSrxMnO3 homojunction arrays with modulated Sr concentration reported herein have led to the discovery of magnetic fan structures with highly noncollinear alignment of Mn spins and an emergent periodicity twice as large as the array's unit cell. The neutron data show that these magnetic superstructures can be fully long&#8208;range ordered, despite the gradual modulation of the doping level created by charge transfer and chemical intermixing. The degree of noncollinearity can be effectively adjusted by low magnetic fields. Notwithstanding their chemical and structural simplicity, oxide homojunctions thus show considerable promise as a platform for tunable complex magnetism and as a powerful design element of spintronic&#160;devices.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline Perovskite p&#8211;n Junction Nanowire Arrays for Ultrasensitive Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of ultrasensitive photodetectors is demonstrated with single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays. The high crystallinity of the nanowire arrays enables efficient carrier transport and the formation of the built&#8208;in electric field in the p&#8211;n junction facilitates effective carrier separation. The photodetectors show excellent sensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with outstanding responsivities.








Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors play significant roles in modern optoelectronic integrated circuits. Constructing p&#8211;n junctions has been proven to be a particularly powerful approach to realizing sensitive photodetection due to their efficient carrier separation. Recently, p&#8211;n&#8208;junction photodetectors based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, which combine favorable optoelectronic performance with facile processability, hold great potential in practical applications. So far, these devices have generally been made of polycrystalline films, which exhibit poor carrier&#8208;transport efficiency, impeding the further improvement of their photoresponsivities. Here, a type of ultrasensitive photodetector based on single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays is demonstrated. The single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays not only possess high crystallinity that enables efficient carrier transport but also form a built&#8208;in electric field facilitating effective carrier separation. As a result, the devices show excellent photosensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with an outstanding responsivity of 2.65&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 532&#160;nm. These results will provide new insights into the design and construction of high&#8208;performance photodetectors for practical optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Exposing Single Ni Atoms in Hollow S/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni single atoms embedded S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) are fabricated through pyrolysis of rationally designed CdS&#8208;NiSx@PAN composite fibers. Benefiting from the abundant exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The development of efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for clean energy and fuel conversion. Herein, the facile preparation of Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) as efficient catalysts for OER through pyrolysis of designed CdS&#8208;NiSx/polyacrylonitrile composite fibers is reported. Specifically, CdS provides the sulfur source for the doping of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;derived carbon matrix and simultaneously creates the hollow macroporous structure, while NiSx is first reduced to nanoparticles and finally evolves into single Ni atoms through the atom migration&#8208;trapping strategy. Benefiting from the abundantly exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalysts deliver outstanding activity and stability for OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 285&#160;mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 50.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.

         <title>Experimental Realization of Atomic Monolayer Si9C15</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Si9C15 monolayer is fabricated on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates via the reaction between Si and graphene under high temperatures. The as&#8208;grown Si9C15 layer is micrometer&#8208;scale, high quality, and single crystalline with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9 eV. Combined measurements and density functional calculations confirm the buckled honeycomb structure. The novel 2D material also shows good air stability.








Abstract
Monolayer SixCy constitutes an important family of&#160;2D&#160;materials that is predicted to feature a honeycomb structure and appreciable bandgaps. However, due to its binary chemical nature and the lack of bulk polymorphs with a layered structure, the fabrication of such materials has so far been challenging. Here, the synthesis of atomic monolayer Si9C15 on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates is reported. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to infer that the 2D lattice of Si9C15 is a buckled honeycomb structure. Monolayer Si9C15 shows semiconducting behavior with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9&#160;eV. Remarkably, the Si9C15 lattice remains intact after exposure to ambient conditions, indicating good air stability. The present work expands the 2D&#8208;materials library and provides a promising platform for future studies in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.

         <title>SrTiO3/CuNi&#8208;Heterostructure&#8208;Based Thermopile for Sensitive Human Radiation Detection and Noncontact Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
SrTiO3/CuNi heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile, characterized by the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, exhibits high sensitivity to human radiation. Further integration of human radiation into a noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction system is experimentally demonstrated, and the real&#8208;time recognition of hand gestures and touchless input of Arabic numbers and English letters are implemented.








Abstract
Noncontact interactive technology provides an intelligent solution to mitigate public health risks from cross&#8208;infection in the era of COVID&#8208;19. The utilization of human radiation as a stimulus source is conducive to the implementation of low&#8208;power, robust noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction. However, the low radiation intensity emitted by humans puts forward a high demand for photodetection performance. Here, a SrTiO3&#8722;x/CuNi&#8208;heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile is constructed, which features the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, to realize the self&#8208;powered detection of human radiation. The response level of this thermopile to human radiation is orders of magnitude higher than those of low&#8208;dimensional&#8208;materials&#8208;based photothermoelectric detectors and even commercial thermopiles. Furthermore, a touchless input device based on the thermopile array is developed, which can recognize hand gestures, numbers, and letters in real&#8208;time. This work offers a reliable strategy to integrate the spontaneous human radiation into noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction systems.

         <title>Percolated Plasmonic Superlattices of Nanospheres with 1 nm&#8208;Level Gap as High&#8208;Index Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroligand gold nanoparticles are stable in an oil phase but can be switched to stable Janus particles at the interface, which forms a 2D superlattice over square centimeters with nanometer&#8208;precision particle&#8208;to&#8208;particle gap. The percolated 2D superstructure exhibits the highest&#8208;ever refractive index (&#8776;7.8) on varying the size and interparticle gap of the NPs, which is explained by a new theoretical model based on &#8220;plasmonic percolation.&#8221;








Abstract
Nanophotonics relies on precise control of refractive index (RI) which can be designed with metamaterials. Plasmonic superstructures of nanoparticles (NPs) can suggest a versatile way of tuning RI. However, the plasmonic effects in the superstructures demand 1 nm&#8208;level exquisite control over the interparticle gap, which is challenging in a sub&#8208;wavelength NPs. Thus far, a large&#8208;area demonstration has been mostly discouraged. Here, heteroligand AuNPs are prepared, which are stable in oil but become Janus particles at the oil&#8211;water interface, called &#8220;adaptive Janus particles.&#8221; NPs are bound at the interface and assembled into 2D arrays over square centimeters as toluene evaporates, which distinctively exhibits the RI tunability. In visible and NIR light, the 2D superstructures exhibit the highest&#8208;ever RI (&#8776;7.8) with varying the size and interparticle gap of NPs, which is successfully explained by a plasmonic percolation model. Furthermore, fully solution&#8208;processable 2D plasmonic superstructures are proved to be advantageous in flexible photonic devices such as distributed Bragg reflectors.

         <title>Robust Piezoelectricity with Spontaneous Polarization in Monolayer Tellurene and Multilayer Tellurium Film at Room Temperature for Reliable Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust piezoelectricity with spontaneous polarization is detected in tellurene at room temperature due to the strong anisotropic property and dipoles induced by unique charity helical chain structure and strong intramolecular interactions. A charming memory window and high on switching current are realized in tellurene&#8208;based memory, providing a new platform to construct robust memory cells for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Robust neuromorphic computing in the Big Data era calls for long&#8208;term stable crossbar&#8208;array memory cells; however, the elemental segregation in the switch unit and memory unit that inevitably occurs upon cycling breaks the compositional and structural stability, making the whole memory cell a failure. Searching for a novel material without segregation that can be used for both switch and memory units is the major concern to fabricate robust and reliable nonvolatile cross&#8208;array memory cells.

     alt="Robust Piezoelectricity with Spontaneous Polarization in Monolayer Tellurene and Multilayer Tellurium Film at Room Temperature for Reliable Memory"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robust piezoelectricity with spontaneous polarization is detected in tellurene at room temperature due to the strong anisotropic property and dipoles induced by unique charity helical chain structure and strong intramolecular interactions. A charming memory window and high on switching current are realized in tellurene-based memory, providing a new platform to construct robust memory cells for neuromorphic computing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robust neuromorphic computing in the Big Data era calls for long-term stable crossbar-array memory cells; however, the elemental segregation in the switch unit and memory unit that inevitably occurs upon cycling breaks the compositional and structural stability, making the whole memory cell a failure. Searching for a novel material without segregation that can be used for both switch and memory units is the major concern to fabricate robust and reliable nonvolatile cross-array memory cells. Tellurium (Te) is found recently to be the only peculiar material without segregation for switching, but the memory function has not been demonstrated yet. Herein, apparent piezoelectricity is experimentally confirmed with spontaneous polarization behaviors in elementary 2D Te, even in monolayer tellurene (0.4&#160;nm), due to the highly oriented polarization of the molecular structure and the non-centrosymmetric lattice structure. A large memory window of 7000, a low working voltage of 2&#160;V, and high on switching current up to 36.6 &#181;A&#8201;&#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are achieved in the as-fabricated Te-based memory device, revealing the great promise of Te for both switching and memory units in one cell without segregation. The piezoelectric Te with spontaneous polarization provides a platform to build robust, reliable, and high-density logic-in-memory chips in neuromorphic computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Ultratough Topological Tissue Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving tough adhesion in wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. It is shown that combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix can achieve ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000 J m&#8722;2) without covalent bond formation. These properties open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving strong and tough adhesion in permeable wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. However, adhesion generated through covalent bond formation directly with the functional groups of tissues (i.e., &#63743;COOH and &#63743;NH2&#160;groups in collagen), or using non&#8208;covalent interactions can both be limited by weak, unstable, or slow adhesion. Here, it is shown that by combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix one can achieve unprecedented ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) in 5&#8211;10&#160;min without covalent bond formation. The strong non&#8208;covalent adhesion is shown to be stable under physiologically relevant conditions and strongly influenced by chitosan molecular weight, molecular weight of polymers in the matrix, and pH. The adhesion mechanism relies primarily on the topological entanglement between the chitosan chains and the permeable adherends. To further expand the applicability of the adhesives, adhesion time can be decreased by dehydrating the hydrogel matrix to facilitate rapid chitosan interpenetration and entanglement (&gt;1000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;in &#8804;1&#160;min). The unprecedented adhesive properties presented in this study open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives and numerous bioapplications.

         <title>Convection Driven Ultrarapid Protein Detection via Nanobody&#8208;Functionalized Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) at the sample incubation step accelerates the operation of an organic&#8208;electrochemical&#8208;transistor&#8208;based protein sensor with a limit of detection at the attomolar range. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits a sample&#8208;to&#8208;result time of 2 min, with better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation.








Abstract
Conventional biosensors rely on the diffusion&#8208;dominated transport of the target analyte to the sensor surface. Consequently, they require an incubation step that may take several hours to allow for the capture of analyte molecules by sensor biorecognition sites. This incubation step is a primary cause of long sample&#8208;to&#8208;result times. Here, alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) is integrated in an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)&#8208;based sensor to accelerate the device operation. ACET is applied to the gate electrode functionalized with nanobody&#8211;SpyCatcher fusion proteins. Using the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein in human saliva as an example target, it is shown that ACET enables protein recognition within only 2 min of sample exposure, supporting its use in clinical practice. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation. The performance of ACET integrated sensors is compared with two types of organic semiconductors in the channel and grounds for device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations are investigated. The results provide guidelines for the channel material choice in OECT&#8208;based biochemical sensors, and demonstrate that ACET integration substantially decreases the detection speed while increasing the sensitivity and selectivity of transistor&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Light&#8208;Soaking in MAPbI3: The Effect of H2O</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced photodamage and consequent self&#8208;healing inside MAPbI3 single crystals are investigated. Two photobrightening and one photodarkening process are identified,&#160;which&#160;are connected to trap&#8208;filling, methylamine&#8208;chemistry, and the lead&#8208;halide sublattice. H2O is&#160;found&#160;to&#160;strongly influence the overall photodamage and kinetics of the self&#8208;healing process, showing an important connection between self&#8208;healing and the presence of H2O. 








Abstract
The future of halide perovskites (HaPs) is beclouded by limited understanding of their long&#8208;term stability. While HaPs can be altered by radiation that induces multiple processes, they can also return to their original state by &#8220;self&#8208;healing.&#8221; Here two&#8208;photon (2P) absorption is used to effect light&#8208;induced modifications within MAPbI3 single crystals. Then the changes in the photodamaged region are followed by measuring the photoluminescence, from 2P absorption with 2.5&#160;orders of magnitude lower intensity than that used for photodamaging the MAPbI3. After photodamage, two brightening and one darkening process are found, all of which recover but on different timescales. The first two are attributed to trap&#8208;filling (the fastest) and to proton&#8208;amine&#8208;related chemistry (the slowest), while photodamage is attributed to the lead&#8208;iodide sublattice. Surprisingly, while after 2P&#8208;irradiation of crystals that are stored in dry, inert ambient, photobrightening (or &#8220;light&#8208;soaking&#8221;) occurs, mostly photodarkening is seen after photodamage in humid ambient, showing an important connection between the self&#8208;healing of a HaP and the presence of H2O, for long&#8208;term steady&#8208;state illumination, practically no difference remains between samples kept in dry or humid environments. This result suggests that photobrightening requires a chemical&#8208;reservoir that is sensitive to the presence of H2O, or possibly other proton&#8208;related, particularly amine, chemistry.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Conduction Channels in Memristive Devices Observed by X&#8208;ray Multimodal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
While neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations, the accuracy needs improvement by reducing the randomness of memristive behavior. The controlled formation of conduction channels is shown here, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. The results suggest an effective route for controlling the otherwise random electroforming process.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations than conventional digital computers for artificial intelligence (AI). However, its current accuracy is generally less than the dominant software&#8208;based AI. The key to improving accuracy is to reduce the intrinsic randomness of memristive devices, emulating synapses in the brain for neuromorphic computing. Here using a planar device as a model system, the controlled formation of conduction channels is achieved with high oxygen vacancy concentrations through the design of sharp protrusions in the electrode gap, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. Classical molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the controlled formation of conduction channels arises from confinement of the electric field, yielding a reproducible spatial distribution of oxygen vacancies across switching cycles. This work demonstrates an effective route to control the otherwise random electroforming process by electrode design, facilitating the development of more accurate memristive devices for neuromorphic computing.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations than conventional digital computers for artificial intelligence (AI). However, its current accuracy is generally less than the dominant software-based AI. The key to improving accuracy is to reduce the intrinsic randomness of memristive devices, emulating synapses in the brain for neuromorphic computing. Here using a planar device as a model system, the controlled formation of conduction channels is achieved with high oxygen vacancy concentrations through the design of sharp protrusions in the electrode gap, as observed by X-ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. Classical molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the controlled formation of conduction channels arises from confinement of the electric field, yielding a reproducible spatial distribution of oxygen vacancies across switching cycles. This work demonstrates an effective route to control the otherwise random electroforming process by electrode design, facilitating the development of more accurate memristive devices for neuromorphic computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafine Silver Nanoparticle Encapsulated Porous Molecular Traps for Discriminative Photoelectrochemical Detection of Mustard Gas Simulants by Synergistic Size&#8208;Exclusion and Site&#8208;Specific Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process affords nanocomposite materials comprising sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) encapsulated in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic framework materials, the AgNPs@HOFs exhibit significantly enhanced photocurrent. A portable photoelectrochemical (PEC) device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 detects chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants with both nanomolar sensitivity and excellent selectivity.








Abstract
The rapid, discriminative, and portable detection of highly toxic chemical warfare agents is extremely important for response to public security emergencies but remains a challenge. One plausible solution involves the integration of porous molecular traps onto a photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor. Here, a fast and facile protocol is developed to fabricate sub&#8208;1&#160;nm AgNPs encapsulated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanocomposite materials through an in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process. Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) materials, these AgNPs@HOFs show significantly enhanced photocurrent. Most importantly, the portable PEC device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 can selectively recognize 13 different mustard gas simulants, including 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), based on synergistic size&#8208;exclusion and specific recognition. The extremely low detection limit for CEES (15.8&#160;nmol L&#8722;1), reusability (at least 30 cycles), and long&#8208;term working stability (at least 30 d) of the portable PEC device warrant its use as a chemical warfare agents (CWAs) sensor in practical field settings. More broadly, this work indicates that integrating porous molecular traps onto PEC sensors offers a promising strategy to further develop portable devices for CWAs detection with both ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity.

         <title>A New Polymer Donor Enables Binary All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells with 18% Efficiency and Excellent Mechanical Robustness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational molecular design, a polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed. Optimal power conversion efficiencies of 18.0% and 16.5% are achieved in rigid and flexible all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells, respectively. This work demonstrates that PQM&#8208;Cl is a promising polymer donor and the design of new polymer donors is essential for further improving the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.








Abstract
The development of polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors has boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells to 17%. However, the polymer donors suitable for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells are still lacking, restricting the further improvement of their PCEs. Herein, a new polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed and its photovoltaic performance is explored. The negative electrostatic potential and low average local ionization energy distribution of the PQM&#8208;Cl surface enable efficient charge generation and transfer process. When blending with a well&#8208;used polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;IT, the PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based devices deliver an impressive PCE of 18.0% with a superior fill factor of 80.7%, both of which are the highest values for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells. The relevant measurements demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based films possess excellent mechanical and flexible properties. As such, PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based flexible photovoltaic cells are fabricated and an excellent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability is displayed. These results demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl is a potential candidate for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells and provide insights into the design of polymer donors for high&#8208;efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

Organic Semiconductors
In article number 2202575, Anirudh Sharma, Derya Baran, and co&#8208;workers unravel the inconsistencies of the determination of the absolute energy levels in organic semiconductors and their implication, particularly in the field of organic solar cells. In the cover image, the charges generated by the excitation of the materials by light are represented by the energy balls with feet and hands: electrons are represented in green and holes in red. The charges are jumping down a staircase, representing the energy levels of different organic semiconductor materials.

Bismuth Oxyselenide
Novel photoinduced quasiparticles, excimers, in the non&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se are unambiguously by Jianbo Hu and co&#8208;workers in article number 2204227, identified through analyzing the emerging dynamic features by transient absorption spectra. Excimers in the Bi2O2Se nanosheets are diffusive and their formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work advances the fundamental understanding of carrier dynamics in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device design.

         <title>Toward Practical High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Pouch Cells: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells are cpomprehensively reviewed regarding the key design parameters, the current performances, and recent advances on failure analysis and promotion strategies on cathode, electrolyte, and anode.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries promise great potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Evaluation and analysis on practical Li&#8211;S pouch cells are essential for achieving actual high energy density under working conditions and affording developing directions for practical applications. This review aims to afford a comprehensive overview of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S pouch cells regarding 7&#160;years of development and to point out further research directions. Key design parameters to achieve actual high energy density are addressed first, to define the research boundaries distinguished from coin&#8208;cell&#8208;level evaluation. Systematic analysis of the published literature and cutting&#8208;edge performances is then conducted to demonstrate the achieved progress and the gap toward practical applications. Following that, failure analysis as well as promotion strategies at the pouch cell level are, respectively, discussed to reveal the unique working and failure mechanism that shall be accordingly addressed. Finally, perspectives toward high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S pouch cells are presented regarding the challenges and opportunities of this field.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Nanomedicine for the Treatment of Ischemic Heart Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current developments, achievements, challenges, and future directions of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging nanomedicine for the treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD), as well as their risk factors, are reviewed. The properties, generation, and physiological roles of ROS in the process of IHD development and progression are discussed.








Abstract
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play key roles in the progression of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, which are independent risk factors that lead to atherosclerosis and the development of IHD. Engineered biomaterial&#8208;based nanomedicines are under extensive investigation and exploration, serving as smart and multifunctional nanocarriers for synergistic therapeutic effect. Capitalizing on cell/molecule&#8208;targeting drug delivery, nanomedicines present enhanced specificity and safety with favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Herein, the roles of ROS in both IHD and its risk factors are discussed, highlighting cardiovascular medications that have antioxidant properties, and summarizing the advantages, properties, and recent achievements of nanomedicines that have ROS scavenging capacity for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion, and myocardial infarction. Finally, the current challenges of nanomedicines for ROS&#8208;scavenging treatment of IHD and possible future directions are discussed from a clinical perspective.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Exfoliation of Nonlayered Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Crystals into Nanoplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research progress on the use of liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation beyond layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals is summarized. Questions remain unanswered on how these 3D strongly bonded nonlayered crystals exfoliate into nanoplatelets, and on the insight of the exfoliation mechanism. The answer to the questions helps in revealing the future direction of this newly grown sub&#8208;family of 2D&#8208;class of materials.








Abstract
For nearly 15 years, researchers have been using liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) to produce 2D nanosheets from layered crystals. This has yielded multiple 2D materials in a solution&#8208;processable form whose utility has been demonstrated in multiple applications. It was&#160;believed that the exfoliation of such materials is enabled by the very large bonding anisotropy of layered materials where the strength of intralayer chemical bonds is very much larger than that of interlayer van der Waals bonds. However, over the last five years, a number of papers have raised questions about our&#160;understanding of exfoliation by describing the LPE of nonlayered materials. These results are extremely surprising because, as no van der Waals gap is present to provide an easily cleaved direction, the exfoliation of such compounds requires the breaking of only chemical bonds. Here the progress in this unexpected new research area is examined. The structure and properties of nanoplatelets produced by LPE of nonlayered materials are reviewed. A number of unexplained trends are found, not least the preponderance of isotropic materials that have been exfoliated to give high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanoplatelets. Finally, the applications potential of this new class of 2D materials are considered.
