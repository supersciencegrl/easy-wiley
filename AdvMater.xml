         <title>Neuromorphic Silicon&#8208;Based Capacitive&#8208;Tunneling Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Si based capacitive tunneling junctions (SCTJs) and corresponding moving trajectory monitoring and recognition systems for multi&#8208;functional neuromorphic computing networks are developed. Such SCTJs exhibit high&#8208;speed, low&#8208;energy consumption, an exceptionally low driving voltage, controllable reversibility, reproducibility, stability, and bilingual artificial synaptic plasticity. It has important guiding significance for intelligent surveillance, driverless vehicles, robot navigation, and other future intelligent scenarios.








Abstract
The growing demand for artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies has led to a desperate need for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing systems capable of processing large datasets. Here, silicon capacitive tunneling junctions (SCTJs) that leverage the synergistic effects of capacitive coupling and quantum tunneling in Si&#8208;compatible devices are presented. These devices demonstrate high&#8208;speed switching, low energy consumption, and the ability to emulate neurobiological synaptic behaviors. By using pulse&#8208;programmed signal as &#8220;stimuli,&#8221; the SCTJs modulate charge accumulation and dissipation at the Al2O3/n&#8208;Si interface, simultaneously facilitating rapid electrons/holes transfer through the direct tunneling effect, resulting in high&#8208;performance bidirectional and bilingual multimodal postsynaptic behavior of SCTJ, with ultrafast response times of 10&#160;ns and energy consumption as low as 1 fJ. Additionally, the SCTJs are integrated into a system capable of monitoring and recognizing the movement trajectories of objects. These findings offer valuable insights into interface gating mechanisms in capacitive tunneling, which has great significance in constructing the next&#8208;generation multifunctional silicon&#8208;based neuromorphic computing network.

         <title>Taming Interfacial Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions With D&#8208;Orbital Delocalized Electron Catalysis Expediates Low&#8208;Temperature Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion&#8208;dipole interactions within Li(solvents)x+ groups for fast interfacial Li+ desolvation/diffusion and dendrite&#8208;free deposition are reduced by taming various d&#8208;orbital electron&#8208;delocalized catalyzers under the low&#8208;temperature surroundings. Consequently, the cells with weak ion&#8208;dipole interaction delivers long&#8208;term cycling life with high environmental robustness from 25 to &#8722;50&#176;C, and the practical full cell stabilizes excellent capacity retention of &#8776;100% under 0&#176;C.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature lithium metal batteries (LT&#8208;LMBs) are increasingly desired for higher energy density and longer lifespan. However, due to organic electrolyte solidification, LT&#8208;LMBs are impeded by huge barriers resulting from the hindrance of larger solvation shells with strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions, leading to depressive Li kinetics and severe dendrite formation. Herein, interfacial catalysis by constructing electron delocalization d&#8208;orbital metal oxides toward the ion&#8208;dipole interactions is pioneered to accelerate the larger Li(solvents)x+ dissociation under the low&#8208;temperature environment. Specifically, various kinds of d&#8208;orbital metal oxides (M = Ti, V, Fe, Co) with oxygen defect modulation are systematically screened and investigated for breaking the ion&#8208;dipole interactions, and the prototyped titanium oxide with adjustable electron delocalization behave the best, as confirmed by electrochemical and theoretical experiments. Consequently, optimized Li electrodes withstand environmental robustness from 25 to &#8722;50&#176;C, and stabilize long&#8208;term cycling up to 1800 h and high Coulombic efficiency without any short&#8208;circuit under &#8722;20&#176;C. The as&#8208;fabricated Li&#8211;S full cell enables a high&#8208;capacity retention of 88% at 0.2 C over 200 cycles, and the high&#8208;loading Li&#8208;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell (&#8776;20 mg cm&#8722;2) demonstrates excellent capacity retention &#8776;100% under 0&#176;C, providing a new guideline for adopting a catalytic strategy for achieving advanced LT&#8208;LMBs.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by In Situ Solidified Polyphosphoester&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;ion regulated polyphosphoester&#8208;based electrolyte (PPUM&#8208;PE) achieves dendrite&#8208;free uniform lithium(Li) deposition, constructing a protected anode with robust bilayer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Assembled LiFePO4 batteries deliver 1000 cycles at 1C alongside significantly enhanced safety.








Abstract
The practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is hindered by the imbalanced periodic oscillatory distribution of cations/anions in liquid electrolytes (LEs) and thus the formed mechanically vulnerable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which collectively exacerbate lithium (Li) dendrite formation and degrade electrochemical stability. To overcome these issues, a polyphosphoester electrolyte (PPUM&#8208;PE) is designed through a dual&#8208;ion regulation strategy. The &#8210;NH&#8210; moieties in PPUM polymer effectively anchor anions, while its P&#9552;O/C&#9552;O functional groups reconstruct Li+ solvation architecture, collectively enabling an exceptional Li+ transference number (0.82) and improved reductive stability of the solvation sheath. A bilayer SEI layer formed on Li anodes&#8212;composed of an outer lithium&#8208;containing alkyl phosphate polymer and an inner LiF&#8208;enriched inorganic phase&#8212;exhibits high Young's modulus, effectively suppressing Li dendrite propagation and continuous electrolyte decomposition. Impressively, the as&#8208;assembled LMBs employing LiFePO4 cathodes retain 91.28% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1C. The electrolyte also demonstrates good compatibility with high&#8208;voltage cathodes (LiCoO2, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) and substantially improves battery thermal safety. This dual&#8208;ion synergistic regulation provides a scalable pathway toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Controlled Planar Guided Crystallization of Low&#8208;Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of spatially&#8208;controlled planar guided crystallization is a novel method for programming the growth of optically homogeneous low&#8208;loss Sb2S3 phase&#8208;change material (PCM), leveraging the directional crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM&#8208;based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non&#8208;volatile optical phase&#8208;shifter and a programmable metasurface with reconfigurable bound state in the continuum.








Abstract
Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) for non&#8208;volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, the concept of spatially&#8208;controlled planar guided crystallization is proposed, a novel method for programming the growth of optically homogeneous low&#8208;loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM&#8208;based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non&#8208;volatile optical phase&#8208;shifter exploiting a silicon nitride&#8208;based Mach&#8211;Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure optically uniform crystalline properties across devices is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non&#8208;volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated&#160;circuits.

         <title>CMOS&#8208;Compatible LiNbO3 Domain&#8208;Wall Entropy Engine for Ultrafast True Random Number Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel True Random Number Generator (TRNG) exploiting unpredictable conductive domain walls in single&#8208;crystal LiNbO3&#8208;on&#8208;insulator (LNOI) as a physical high&#8208;entropy source is demonstrated. The device achieves high&#8208;amplitude stochastic currents arising from the random nucleation and reconfiguration of conductive domain walls, enabling ultrafast output and flexible device scaling at comparable operating voltages.








Abstract
Random ferroelectric domain nucleation and growth lead to the generation of numerous unpredictable microscopic states that collectively form a natural high&#8208;entropy system. Conventional electrical methods can directly measure reversible domain switching currents, offering a viable platform for true random number generation (TRNG). However, TRNG based on random ferroelectric switching events is limited by the noise amplitudes in electrical signals. In this study, TRNG is realized via the stochastic formation of conductive domain walls in single&#8208;crystal LiNbO3 thin films bonded to SiO2/Si wafers. This approach achieves a noise amplitude and cycling endurance &gt;500&#160;nA and &gt;1010, respectively. The interfacial&#8208;layer&#8208;based device exhibits self&#8208;reinitialized stochastic sub&#8208;10&#8208;ns domain switching operations, enabling ultrafast generation of bit outputs and flexible device scaling. The generated random bitstreams, validated via National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)tests, exhibit robust resistance against machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based predictive attacks. This pioneering study establishes ferroelectric conductive domain walls as groundbreaking platforms for CMOS&#8208;compatible entropy source extraction, effectively addressing the long&#8208;standing challenges in amplifying entropy signals with operational robustness.

         <title>Colossal Cryogenic Electro&#8208;Optic Response Through Metastability in Strained BaTiO3 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the thermodynamic theory of optical properties, a colossal cryogenic electro&#8208;optic response in BaTiO3 thin films is designed and demonstrated by stabilizing a low symmetry metastable monoclinic phase via epitaxial strain tuning with an electro&#8208;optic response reaching &#8776;2516 pm&#160;V&#8722;1 at 5 K. This approach represents a new paradigm for engineering large property enhancements in materials applied toward cryogenic photonics.








Abstract
The search for thin film electro&#8208;optic materials that can retain superior performance under cryogenic conditions has become critical for quantum computing. Barium titanate thin films show large linear electro&#8208;optic coefficients in the tetragonal phase at room temperature, which is severely degraded down to &#8776;200&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 in the rhombohedral phase at cryogenic temperatures. There is immense interest in manipulating these phase transformations and retaining superior electro&#8208;optic properties down to liquid helium temperature. Utilizing the thermodynamic theory of optical properties, a large low&#8208;temperature electro&#8208;optic response is designed by engineering the energetic competition between different ferroelectric phases, leading to a low&#8208;symmetry monoclinic phase with a massive electro&#8208;optic response. The existence of this phase is demonstrated in a strain&#8208;tuned BaTiO3 thin film that exhibits a linear electro&#8208;optic coefficient of 2516 &#177; 100&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 at 5&#160;K, which is an order of magnitude higher than the best reported performance thus far. Importantly, the electro&#8208;optic coefficient increases by 100 &#215; during cooling, unlike the conventional films, where it degrades. Further, at the lowest temperature, significant higher order electro&#8208;optic responses also emerge. These results represent a new framework for designing materials with property enhancements by stabilizing highly tunable metastable phases with strain.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Arch Bridge&#8208;Inspired Stress Modulation at Buried Interface for Stable High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A arch&#8208;like FBI&#8208;PyAI molecule (4&#8208;(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)butan&#8208;1&#8208;ammonium iodide) is designed and synthesized, which forms an ordered interlayer that relieves buried interfacial stress and mismatch, thereby enhancing structural integrity of perovskite films and the stability of devices.








Abstract
Thermal instability remains a key barrier to the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), largely due to severe thermomechanical mismatch at the buried interface between the perovskite and transport layers. This mismatch induces interfacial strain, triggering deep&#8208;level defects, ion migration, and phase segregation that severely impair device stability. Here, a thermomechanical stress engineering strategy is introduced via rational molecular interface design. Specifically, a novel molecule, 4&#8208;(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)butan&#8208;1&#8208;ammonium iodide (FBI&#8208;PyAI) is synthesized, that anchors at the TiO2/perovskite interface likely in a unique &#8220;molecular bridge&#8221; configuration. This soft interface yields an extremely low modulus and significantly reduces the interfacial stress energy from 0.554 to 0.178 eV, thereby suppressing defect formation and minimizing phase segregation. Meanwhile, the functional groups in FBI&#8208;PyAI passivate defects and induce vertically oriented perovskite crystallization, forming compact films with fewer voids and improved structural uniformity. As a result, the modified devices achieve exceptional thermal stability, which maintains 88% of initial efficiency after 50 thermal cycles (&#8722;15 to 65&#160;&#176;C). Moreover, the modified PSC delivers a competitive efficiency of 25.01% and outstanding photostability (95% retention after 800&#160;h illumination under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 protocol). This work offers mechanistic insight into interfacial stress modulation and underscores its importance for thermally stable PSCs.

         <title>Tailoring Topological Network of Conductive Hydrogel for Electrochemically Mediated Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a regional assembly crosslinking (RAC) hydrogel fabricated via electric&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced phase separation. The process generates a unique polypyrrole:polystyrene sulfonate junction matrix that inherently translates topological randomness into unpredictable, unclonable electrochemical responses. RAC hydrogels demonstrate electrochemical encryption that shows exceptional resistance to machine learning attacks, establishing a novel paradigm for secure hydrogel&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
The sustainable development of an informatized and intelligent society relies on information security. Physical unclonable cryptographic primitives effectively secure information through random physical structures. However, the limited size of challenge&#8211;response pairs renders them vulnerable to machine learning attacks. This study proposes a regional assembly crosslinking (RAC) strategy to impart hydrogels with macroscopic, unclonable electrochemical behaviors derived from topological polymeric networks. An electric&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced phase separation approach is employed to create ion&#8211;electron transduction junctions based on polypyrrole:polystyrene sulfonate (PPy:PSS), forming a transduction junction matrix within the RAC hydrogel. The distinct transduction times of individual junctions enable pulsed electrical signals to convert the unique polymeric network topology into unpredictable and unclonable electrochemical responses. The RAC hydrogel&#8208;based encryption device generates over 1019 challenge&#8211;response pairs, significantly surpassing the standard requirement of 1010 for a strong physical unclonable cryptographic primitive. Additionally, the inherent nonlinear electrochemical characteristics of the ion&#8211;electron junction matrix significantly enhance the resistance of RAC hydrogels against machine learning attacks, including linear regression, multi&#8208;layer perceptrons, and Transformers. This study demonstrates that the electrochemical behavior of polymer networks in conductive hydrogels can emulate 3D electronic component matrices, establishing a novel paradigm for hydrogel phase engineering in information technology applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Layered Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Ultrahigh Electricity Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance stacked triboelectric nanogenerator is designed by the self&#8208;layered method, achieving efficient fabrication, high durability, and high output, which is a huge breakthrough for traditional designs. A device with 100 layers achieves a record&#8208;high volume charge density of 49.39 &#177; 1.73 mC&#160;m&#8722;3, enabling sustainable high&#8208;power applications in smart agricultural monitoring.








Abstract
Capturing low&#8208;density ambient mechanical energy to power devices is a sustainable development pathway. In which, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with a stacked design has garnered wide attention for its remarkable enhancement in output. However, the traditional layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method generally results in complex fabrication and low output density. Herein, a novel self&#8208;layered method is proposed for efficiently constructing high output stacked TENG based on sliding mode.

&lt;p&gt;A high-performance stacked triboelectric nanogenerator is designed by the self-layered method, achieving efficient fabrication, high durability, and high output, which is a huge breakthrough for traditional designs. A device with 100 layers achieves a record-high volume charge density of 49.39 &#177; 1.73 mC&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, enabling sustainable high-power applications in smart agricultural monitoring.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capturing low-density ambient mechanical energy to power devices is a sustainable development pathway. In which, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with a stacked design has garnered wide attention for its remarkable enhancement in output. However, the traditional layer-by-layer method generally results in complex fabrication and low output density. Herein, a novel self-layered method is proposed for efficiently constructing high output stacked TENG based on sliding mode. With the stacked thin steel sheets serving as the stator, an insertable rotor consisting of long fibers in the radial direction can be easily inserted into the stator during the rotating process. This achieves a self-layered effect, greatly simplifying the fabrication and improving the output. Finally, a highly integrated TENG comprising 200 units is fabricated within a height of 16.05 cm, and the volume charge density reaches 49.39 &#177; 1.73 mC&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 4 times of the previous record. The high power enables 10 commercial LEDs in 90 W power or 46 wireless agricultural sensors to work continuously. Besides, the TENG of 40 units can continuously power 8 wireless agricultural sensors at 6 m&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; wind speed. Overall, this work overcomes the limitations of traditional designs, and provides a novel approach toward large-scale energy applications in sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Molecular Engineering of Crosslinked Polymer Dielectrics for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinked polymers with decoupled non&#8208;conjugated backbones and polar moieties are designed through a modular molecular engineering to simultaneously optimize molecular polarity, topological crosslinking, and free volume in alicyclic polymers. The fully crosslinked P0&#8208;B300 delivers a record&#8208;high discharge energy density of 4.65 J cm&#8722;3 and superb insulation performance (breakdown strength greater than 700 MV m&#8722;1) at 250&#160;&#176;C, outperforming conventional dielectrics.








Abstract
Polymer dielectric capacitors are critical for high&#8208;temperature energy storage, yet current materials face a trade&#8208;off between thermal stability and capacitive performance due to conduction loss or insufficient polarization. Here, a modular molecular engineering to simultaneously optimize molecular polarity, topological crosslinking, and free volume in alicyclic polymers is designed. By incorporating thermally crosslinkable benzocyclobutene (BCB) and sulfone&#8208;methyl (&#9472;SO2CH3) groups into norbornene&#8208;based monomers via ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), crosslinked networks with decoupled non&#8208;conjugated backbones and polar moieties are constructed. The polymers exhibit a wide optical bandgap (Eg &gt; 3.7&#160;eV), high thermal stability (Tg &gt; 350&#160;&#176;C), and suppressed dissipation (Df &#8776; 0.0006). Optimized P50&#8208;B250 delivers an exceptional discharged energy density (Ud) of 8.00 J cm&#8722;3 at 150&#160;&#176;C (&#8805;90% efficiency), while fully crosslinked P0&#8208;B300 retained Ud of 7.34 J cm&#8722;3 at 200&#160;&#176;C and 4.65 J cm&#8722;3 at 250&#160;&#176;C, outperforming conventional dielectrics. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that crosslinking increases free volume fraction by &#8776;40%, inhibiting interchain charge transfer complexes (CTCs). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that sulfonyl&#8208;enhanced polarization and crosslinking collectively restrict charge migration. This work establishes a general framework for designing polymer dielectrics by integrating structural modularity and topological control, offering pathways for next&#8208;generation energy storage applications under extreme conditions.

         <title>Dual Targeting of m7G tRNA Modification and Histone Acetylation using Carrier&#8208;Free Nano&#8208;Epidrugs to Evoke Osteosarcoma Chemosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aberrant overexpression of METTL1, a key m7G modulator, and HDAC1, are found to be associated with poor chemotherapeutic response in osteosarcoma. To target these epigenetic vulnerabilities, innovative carrier&#8208;free nano&#8208;epidrugs incorporating first&#8208;line doxorubicin with siMETTL1, FDA&#8208;approved HDAC inhibitor, and DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD are developed, synergistically regulating m7G&#8208;modified tRNA&#8208;mediated translation of DNA repair proteins, and HDAC&#8208;mediated histone deacetylation, amplifying DNA damage, thereby evoking osteosarcoma chemosensitization.








Abstract
Osteosarcoma has witnessed stagnant clinical outcomes over the past four decades, owing to the inevitable reduction in chemosensitivity during treatment. Although epigenetics offers promising strategies to augment chemosensitivity, its role in osteosarcoma remains elusive. Here, by analyzing clinical cohorts, it is found that the aberrant overexpression of methyltransferase 1 (METTL1), a key N7&#8208;methylguanosine (m7G) modulator, and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), associated with poor chemotherapeutic response in osteosarcoma. To target these epigenetic vulnerabilities, innovative carrier&#8208;free nano&#8208;epidrugs (siMBD&#8208;R NPs) are developed, incorporating first&#8208;line doxorubicin (DOX) with siRNA against METTL1 (siMETTL1), FDA&#8208;approved HDAC inhibitor belinostat (BEL), and DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD. With ultrahigh active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) loading content (&#8776;92.7 wt.%), tumor&#8208;specific targeting capability, and unique pH&#8208;responsive release characteristics, the siMBD&#8208;R NPs indicate remarkable tumor accumulation (15.2&#8208;fold enhancement) compared to free siMETTL1. Importantly, through dual&#8208;epigenetic regulation, the nano&#8208;epidrugs markedly amplify DOX&#8208;triggered DNA damage. Specifically, siMETTL1 selectively disrupts m7G&#8208;modified tRNA&#8208;mediated translation of DNA repair proteins, and BEL&#8208;induced HDAC inhibition remodels chromatin into a more accessible state, promoting DNA damage accumulation. In vivo studies demonstrate that siMBD&#8208;R NPs can significantly potentiate chemosensitivity, achieving an 81.5% relative increase in tumor inhibition, and can activate an immune response. This work highlights the potential benefits of leveraging dual&#8208;targeted epigenetic intervention to evoke osteosarcoma chemosensitization.

         <title>Unveiling the Electrolyte and Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Sodium Ion Batteries: Mechanisms, Progress, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advances in sodium&#8208;ion battery electrolytes (including organic, aqueous, gel, ionic liquid, and solid&#8208;state types) and their influence on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). It discusses SEI formation, aging, and optimization, as well as cases where no SEI forms, providing insights into the critical relationship between electrolyte chemistry and interfacial stability.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are regarded as a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the low cost and abundant availability of sodium. Electrolyte, as the medium for ion transport, plays a crucial role in determining the electrochemical performance. Currently, SIBs employ mainly organic electrolytes, aqueous electrolytes, ionic liquids, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes. These electrolytes have made significant progress according to the needs of various application scenarios. Notably, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed by decomposition of electrolytes on the electrode surface has a decisive influence on the performance of SIBs, and its composition and formation mechanism are closely related to the chemical nature of the electrolyte. Therefore, a deep understanding of the structure and interfacial chemistry of the SEI is essential for developing high&#8208;performance SIBs, preferably through the simple and effective modulation of electrolyte composition. However, the fragmented and insufficient mechanistic summary on this connection results in poor guidance on future research, especially for the co&#8208;design of electrolyte and solid electrolyte interphase. This review summarizes and compares the research progress of various electrolyte systems, discusses the formation and aging mechanisms of SEI, and presents the perspectives on the integrated design of electrolyte and SEI.

         <title>Phosphine Interlayer Chemical Hardness Engineering via Crystallization Regulation for Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites and All&#8208;Perovskite Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial modification with tris(2&#8208;pyridyl)phosphine at the Me&#8208;4PACz/perovskite interface simultaneously fills SAM defects, passivates undercoordinated Pb&#178;&#8314;, and guides perovskite crystallization. This enables a 20.46%&#8208;efficient wide&#8208;bandgap (1.77 eV) cell and a two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell achieving a 29.71% efficiency with high operational stability, retaining 91.96% initial PCE after 850 h.








Abstract
In wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, light&#8208;induced phase segregation of the perovskite film and non&#8208;radiative recombination at the self&#8208;assembled monolayers/perovskite interface severely compromise device efficiency and stability. Herein, an interfacial engineering strategy utilizing controllable Lewis base small molecules is proposed to ameliorate the Me&#8208;4PACz/perovskite interface, enabling effective interfacial defect suppression and high&#8208;quality perovskite crystallization.

&lt;p&gt;Interfacial modification with tris(2-pyridyl)phosphine at the Me-4PACz/perovskite interface simultaneously fills SAM defects, passivates undercoordinated Pb&#178;&#8314;, and guides perovskite crystallization. This enables a 20.46%-efficient wide-bandgap (1.77 eV) cell and a two-terminal all-perovskite tandem solar cell achieving a 29.71% efficiency with high operational stability, retaining 91.96% initial PCE after 850 h.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells, light-induced phase segregation of the perovskite film and non-radiative recombination at the self-assembled monolayers/perovskite interface severely compromise device efficiency and stability. Herein, an interfacial engineering strategy utilizing controllable Lewis base small molecules is proposed to ameliorate the Me-4PACz/perovskite interface, enabling effective interfacial defect suppression and high-quality perovskite crystallization. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the optimized tris(2-pyridyl)phosphine (TPP) molecule can simultaneously fill defects in Me-4PACz self-assembly, passivate undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; at the perovskite bottom surface, and anchor [PbX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8308;&#8722; to provide nucleation sites for inducing bottom-up homogeneous crystallization. Consequently, the TPP-treated single-junction cell (1.77 eV) achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.46% with a high V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.34 eV, representing one of the highest reported efficiencies for this bandgap. The corresponding two-terminal all-perovskite tandem solar cells achieved a PCE of 29.71% (certified as 29.13%), with a V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.16 V and fill factor of 83.81%, meanwhile maintaining exceptional operational stability by retaining 91.96% of initial PCE after 850 h of maximum power point tracking under solar illumination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Mediated Low&#8208;Frequency Phonon Suppression in Lead&#8208;free Manganese Halides for High&#8208;efficiency Green Light&#8208;emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the transient photophysical mechanisms in manganese&#8208;based metal halides and designs A&#8208;site cations PPh4NBr and PPh4N2Br. The dimethylamino group suppresses low&#8208;frequency phonons, thereby minimizing non&#8208;radiative decay. The (PPh4N)2MnBr4 device achieves a 12.0% EQE, the highest reported among solution&#8208;processed, lead&#8208;free green&#8208;light devices, and enables the preparation of large&#8208;area electroluminescent devices (4 &#215; 4 cm2) in ambient conditions.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have emerged as promising materials in optoelectronics, yet concerns over lead toxicity drive the search for lead&#8208;free alternatives with efficient electroluminescence, especially in green&#8208;emitting applications. Here, the photophysical functions of A&#8208;site cations in manganese bromides are revealed, and design dimethylamino&#8208;functionalized A&#8208;site cations to modulate both phonon dynamics, film morphology, and energy level alignment, enabling unprecedented efficiency in solution&#8208;processed green&#8208;emitting lead&#8208;free metal halide devices. Appropriately attaching of dimethylamino groups to benzene rings not only builds p&#8211;&#960; conjugation that increases the rigidity of PPh4+ A&#8208;site cations, but also weakens hazardous van der Waals interaction, which suppresses A&#8208;site related nonradiative recombination. Importantly, methyl groups in dimethylamino groups enhance the flexibility of the A&#8208;site cation, which suppresses the formation of grain boundaries. Moreover, dimethylamino groups regulate the energy levels of PPh4+, reducing charge injection barriers. Notably, electroluminescent devices are achieved with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 12.0% and large&#8208;area emission of 4 &#215; 4 cm2, underscoring their potential for next&#8208;generation display technologies.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Synthesis of V2O5 Single Crystals for Ultrahigh Doping of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, by synthesizing centimetre&#8208;sized V2O5 bulk single crystal and inch&#8208;sized V2O5 single crystalline films as 2D dopants, it successfully achieves uniform and efficient hole doping of graphene and TMDs, while preserving high carrier mobility. This approach offers a reliable method for constructing high&#8208;quality 2D heterostructures, enabling scalable integration of 2D materials into high&#8208;speed electronic and photonic devices.








Abstract
The controllable growth of wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline 2D materials is foundational for future electronic and photonic applications. Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer integration enables the fabrication of 2D heterostructure with multiple functionalities, such as doping of 2D materials, which enhances the conductivity and tunes work function to improve electrical contacts. The synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline 2D dopants enables subsequent integration with other 2D materials, which can avoid lattice defects and interface scattering centers typically associated with heteroatom doping or amorphous dopant. However, the synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline 2D dopants remains unexplored. Here, this study reports an effective approach to synthesize centimetre&#8208;sized V2O5 bulk single&#8208;crystal and inch&#8208;sized V2O5 single&#8208;crystalline films, which can efficiently dope graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Interfacing graphene with single&#8208;crystalline V2O5 enables hole doping of graphene, achieving a carrier density of &#8776;1013 cm&#8722;2 and carrier mobility of &#8776;4400 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The preservation of carrier mobility of graphene is enabled by a defect&#8208;free interface and large energies of surface optical phonon modes of V2O5. Combined with reliable wafer&#8208;scale synthesis and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking techniques for fabricating 2D materials/V2O5 heterostructure, the results provide a scalable method for uniform, stable and efficient doping, facilitating the integration of 2D heterostructure into high&#8208;speed logic circuits and photonics for optical communications.

         <title>The Efficient and Stable Triboelectric Nanogenerator Materials Based on Electrostatic Attraction Between Biomass and Metal Oxides for UAV Flight Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study is the first to report the preparation of biomass&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators by using the electrostatic attraction between positively charged CQAS and negatively charged oxygen&#8208;rich regions in metal oxides. Improve triboelectric electrical performance and environmental stability, and achieve unmanned aerial vehicle control.








Abstract
Biomass&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have attracted attention in the fields of biomedical and wearable electronics. This study formed three stable frictional electric films, namely chitosan quaternary ammonium salt(CQAS)/Sc2O3, CQAS/MnO2, and CQAS/ZnO, through electrostatic attraction between positively charged CQAS and electron&#8208;rich oxygen atoms in metal oxides. Molecular dynamics simulations show negative interfacial binding energy, indicating structural stability. Density functional theory confirms the accumulation of electrons near oxygen atoms, especially in ZnO, where the average oxygen electron is &#8722;0.89, forming a strong negative potential. The electric hysteresis loop of CQAS/ZnO exhibits the best closure, and its potential shift response is stable. The leakage current of CQAS/ZnO is the lowest, at 37.2 &#181;A, indicating that ZnO easily forms a more stable structure with CQAS through electrostatic attraction. CQAS/ZnO exhibits the best triboelectric electrical performance, with an open circuit voltage of 1260&#160;V and a transferred charge density of 11.50 nC&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work proposes a theoretical model that supports the pairing of metal oxides and polymers, improving the triboelectric electrical performance and increasing the device quality factor of the TENGs from 0.26 for pure CQAS to 1.0, an increase of 3.85 times. Efficient energy conversion and human&#8208;machine interaction are achieved.

         <title>Choline Ionic Liquid for Long&#8208;Term Stable Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Choline&#8208;based ionic liquid integrated organic electrochemical transistors (Chol&#8208;OECTs) for improvement of performance and prolonged lifetime is demonstrated. Introduction of the ionic liquid into PEDOT:PSS and gelatin creates choline acetate ionic liquid&#8208;infused PEDOT:PSS (CLiPS) and choline acetate&#8208;gelatin (CAGel) electrolyte. These materials are utilized for 3D array of Chol&#8208;OECTs and biosensors of biological signals for longer than 3 months.








Abstract
A choline&#8208;based ionic liquid is introduced into organic electrochemical transistors(OECTs) to achieve enhanced performance and long&#8208;term stability, and these OECTs can be used for sensing biological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electromyograms (EMGs) for up to 3 months. Spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical characterization focused on the ionic interactions between the choline&#8208;based ionic liquid and PEDOT:PSS, particularly the impact on device operation. Their strong ionic interactions result in enhanced OECT electrical performance, including 80&#160;ns of response time, faster than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices. Furthermore, 3D arrays and ultrathin OECTs attached to skin with consistent performance are demonstrated for substantial applicability and potential in research for mapping biological signals of cells or tissues, and integration with wireless systems, enabling remote medical services.

     alt="Choline Ionic Liquid for Long-Term Stable Organic Electrochemical Transistors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choline-based ionic liquid integrated organic electrochemical transistors (Chol-OECTs) for improvement of performance and prolonged lifetime is demonstrated. Introduction of the ionic liquid into PEDOT:PSS and gelatin creates choline acetate ionic liquid-infused PEDOT:PSS (CLiPS) and choline acetate-gelatin (CAGel) electrolyte. These materials are utilized for 3D array of Chol-OECTs and biosensors of biological signals for longer than 3 months.

&lt;/p&gt;

Flame&#8208;Crafted Luminescent Pigments
This artwork illustrates the synthesis of ultra&#8208;bright copper tetrasilicate (CTS) nanosheets via flame&#8208;spray pyrolysis, resulting in novel blue&#8208;colored pigments. Emitting in the NIR&#8208;II window with quantum yields up to 34%, these wavelength&#8208;tunable pigments enable high&#8208;speed, super&#8208;resolution bioimaging, visualizing brain microcirculation and tracking immune cells in vivo.

Smart Glass
In article number 2503367, Kwang&#8208;Un Jeong and co&#8208;workers developed electrochromic smart glasses with controllable color and polarization by employing &#960;&#8208;extended viologen&#8208;based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (&#960;V&#8208;LCLCs). Through simple self&#8208;assembly and polymerization processes, they constructed uniaxially oriented hierarchical nanostructures exhibiting three stable redox states and polarization&#8208;dependent transmittance, demonstrating potential applications in privacy protection and information security technologies.

Aerodynamic Surface Dimpling
Static aerodynamic surfaces cannot adapt to dynamic wind profiles, limiting performance under variable operating conditions. In article number 2505817, Katia Bertoldi and co&#8208;workers introduce a stretch&#8208;induced dimpling textile metamaterial that tunes aerodynamic properties even when body&#8208;conformed. Wind&#8208;tunnel tests and simulations show drag modulation up to 20%. Active stretching enables optimal performance across variable speeds, opening transformative applications in wearables, aerospace, maritime, and civil engineering.

Long&#8208;Term Pain Management
In the Research Article DOI: (10.1002/adma.202503872), Daniel S. Kohane, Christopher B. Weldon, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the development (in vitro and in vivo) of an aptamer/liposome (Lipo&#8208;Apt) drug delivery system that incorporates both affinity&#8208;controlled and diffusion&#8208;controlled drug release mechanisms into a single vehicle, thus prolonging the duration of effect without resultant toxicity. In vivo, a single injection of tetrodotoxin at the sciatic nerve in rats provided prolonged local anesthesia lasting for about one week.

Halogen Ion&#8208;Mediated Strategy for Producing MXenes
In article number 2504586, Li Song and co&#8208;workers reveal the mechanism of halogen ion etching of MAX phases. Subsequently, NH4F rapid etching strategy and organic intercalant&#8208;assisted NH4X heterostructure construction strategy are discovered. These approaches are successfully extended to various MAX phases and heterostructure synthesis, producing Mo2CTx@MoS2 composites with amorphous MoS2 surface layers. The heterostructured MXenes exhibit modulated energy storage mechanisms.

Enzymatic Metabolism Driven by Photonastic Movement in a Bioinspired Starfish Prototissue
In the article number 2502830, Pierangelo Gobbo and co&#8208;workers report the bottom&#8208;up chemical construction of the first starfish&#8208;like prototissue capable of photonastic movement and photo&#8208;mechano&#8208;chemical transduction. Such higher&#8208;order behaviors emerged from the interaction and collective coordinated responses that were enabled by the spatial integration of specialised protocell units within the prototissue. Applications include modular micro&#8208;bioreactors and soft actuators for biohybrid robotics.

Abstract
Tandem solar cells, which integrate multiple junctions, present a promising pathway to surpass the efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction silicon (Si) solar cells. This article explores why Si is the optimal choice for the bottom cell in tandem configurations and examines various configurations and interconnection techniques that have been reported. It then reviews a range of photovoltaic (PV) technologies for the top cell, including well&#8208;established III&#8211;V compounds and emerging materials like perovskites and chalcogenides PV materials, which are currently used or have potential for use in constructing Si&#8208;based tandem cells. Additionally, the paper highlights the ongoing challenges faced by these top cells in Si&#8208;based tandem technology. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of different PV technological advancements and to identify strategic directions for future research that could lead to the development of highly efficient Si&#8208;based tandem PV systems.

By tailoring atomic&#8208;level active sites, SAMs effectively alleviate key issues such as volume expansion, dendrite growth, and capacity degradation. Their unique properties offer promising strategies for enhancing electrochemical performance, stability, and energy density in next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom materials (SAMs) are a fascinating class of nanomaterials with exceptional catalytic properties, offering immense potential for energy storage and conversion. This work explores their advantages, challenges, and underlying mechanisms, providing valuable insights for rational design. By precisely controlling active sites, SAMs enable efficient charge and energy transfer, ultimately enhancing system performance. In applications such as metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, metal anodes, Li&#8211;S batteries, Na&#8211;S batteries, and metal&#8211;air batteries, SAMs effectively address key challenges, including volume change, dendrite formation, and capacity fading. Their unique electronic and structural properties also make them highly efficient electrocatalysts, demonstrating remarkable activity and selectivity in lithium polysulfide, oxygen reduction, and carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of SAMs in the energy storage field are discussed. With ongoing research and development, SAMs are poised to revolutionize the field, serving as foundational elements in the transition to sustainable and clean energy.

Abstract
Harvesting the low&#8208;grade heat energy from the environment and the human body remains an underutilized energy. Ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) gels have garnered significant attention in the fields of energy harvesting and sensing due to their exceptional stretchability, adaptability, ease of large&#8208;scale fabrication, and excellent thermoelectric performance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent progress of i&#8208;TE gels in application of temperature sensing and low&#8208;grade heat energy harvesting. The narration begins with the introduction of the synthetic and natural polymer for i&#8208;TE gels. Then, various methods are discussed to enhance the mechanical performance (stretchability, self&#8208;healing, and mechanical durability) to satisfy the flexible device based on i&#8208;TE gels. Noticeably, this work emphatically summarizes the improvement methods of thermopower for i&#8208;TE gels, including the preparation of n&#8208;type i&#8208;TE gels and the bidirectional modulation of their thermopower. Finally, this work explores the diverse applications of i&#8208;TE gels, including low&#8208;grade heat harvesting, sensing, human&#8208;machine interfaces, and biomedical applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvesting the low-grade heat energy from the environment and the human body remains an underutilized energy. Ionic thermoelectric (i-TE) gels have garnered significant attention in the fields of energy harvesting and sensing due to their exceptional stretchability, adaptability, ease of large-scale fabrication, and excellent thermoelectric performance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent progress of i-TE gels in application of temperature sensing and low-grade heat energy harvesting. The narration begins with the introduction of the synthetic and natural polymer for i-TE gels. Then, various methods are discussed to enhance the mechanical performance (stretchability, self-healing, and mechanical durability) to satisfy the flexible device based on i-TE gels. Noticeably, this work emphatically summarizes the improvement methods of thermopower for i-TE gels, including the preparation of n-type i-TE gels and the bidirectional modulation of their thermopower. Finally, this work explores the diverse applications of i-TE gels, including low-grade heat harvesting, sensing, human-machine interfaces, and biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Causal Relationships for the Electrolyte and Interphase Designs During Lithium Metal Plating/Stripping Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main barriers to the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) should originate from the imperfect solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anode (LMA). This review comprehensively analyses and focuses on the causal relationship between the electrolyte and SEI design during the lithium plating/stripping process, and its content will provide inspiration for its practical application of high&#8208;energy LMBs and boost the enduring enthusiasm in this field.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy lithium (Li) metal battery (LMB) is widely recognized as the game&#8208;changer for the currently commercialized lithium&#8208;ion batteries, because of their high energy density when paired with many cathodes such as layered oxide cathode (500&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1), sulfur cathode (600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1), and oxygen cathode (700&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1). In addition to the energy&#8208;related application, the electrochemical Li metal plating/stripping process is also the core for Li&#8208;mediated ammonia synthesis, Li plasmon&#8208;based low&#8208;powered dynamic color display, and so on. However, the insufficient understanding of the electrochemical process of the Li metal plating/stripping process is still restraining the development of these research directions. Herein, key advances for the key properties of solid electrolyte interphase, electrolyte engineering, and the artificial solid electrode interphase of lithium metal anode are reviewed. Based on these contents, several key points for the practical application of LMBs, including electrolyte design, energy density, and safety, are outlooked.

         <title>Crystal Orientation Engineering for Energy Storage and Conversion Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in crystal orientation engineering for energy materials. It discusses orientation&#8208;dependent properties, characterization methods, preparation strategies, and their applications in energy conversion and storage systems. It provides insights into how orientation control enables performance breakthroughs in energy&#8208;related applications and may guide future developments in this emerging field.








Abstract
Nanoscale material design&#160;is crucial to the development of efficient renewable energy and storage technologies. While conventional research paradigms have emphasized material morphology, crystal polymorphs, and defect engineering, recent years have witnessed an emerging research interest in crystal orientation engineering since it can exploit anisotropic material properties to significantly enhance&#160; emerging energy storage and conversion applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of engineering the crystal orientation of materials to improve various energy conversion and storage technologies is provided. First, we discuss the effect of crystal orientation on material properties, including electrical conductivity, dielectric constant, surface energy, surface electronic structure, atom/molecule adsorption ability, and ionic conductivity. Then, the techniques to characterize the crystal orientation, including X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and optical microscopy, are reviewed. After that, effective&#160;strategies to engineer crystal orientation using both bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches are summarized. The advances in crystal orientation engineering in energy conversion (electrocatalysis, solar cells, and nanogenerators) and storage (metal anodes, non&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrode materials, and solid electrolytes) applications are subsequently discussed. Finally, future perspectives on the potential of crystal orientation engineering and its impact on emerging energy transition technologies are summarized.

         <title>Solvation Chemistry of Nonaqueous Electrolytes for Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of the interactions between ions and solvent molecules, namely active cations, anion receptors, weakly coordinated anions, and solvation structure, is offered to establish a fundamental understanding of solvation chemistry in Mg electrolytes. The established connection provides valuable guidance for designing next&#8208;generation Mg electrolytes.








Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and abundant resource availability. However, the development of ideal electrolytes that enable reversible Mg plating/stripping and ensure electrode compatibility remains a significant bottleneck. Over the past decades, considerable efforts have been devoted to addressing this challenge, highlighting the need for a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of the complex nature of Mg electrolytes. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the advances in nonaqueous Mg electrolytes, with an emphasis on solvation chemistry that governs ion transport, redox kinetics, and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation. A systematic analysis of the interactions between ions and solvent molecules, namely active cations, anion receptors, weakly coordinated anions, and solvation structure, is offered to establish a fundamental understanding of structure&#8208;function relationships in Mg electrolytes. Furthermore, the key challenges and emerging research trends in Mg electrolytes are summarized. This work underscores the critical role of mastering solvation chemistry in optimizing RMB performance and provides principled guidance for rational, bottom&#8208;up Mg electrolyte design.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the current status of solvent&#8208;free fabrication methods of metal halide perovskites, such as thermal evaporation, magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e&#8208;beam and atomic layer deposition, solid phase growth, and laser printing. It outlines the current state of knowledge and discusses key challenges and future research directions.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have ascended as a remarkable class of materials in recent years, demonstrating exceptional promise for application in various electronic and optoelectronic devices. The vast majority of research on these materials focuses on their processing from solution, which is relatively easily executed in laboratory settings, but its scalability for industrial mass production remains a significant hurdle. Furthermore, its reliance on highly toxic solvents imposes limitations with respect to large&#8208;area fabrication and have a negative environmental impact. This review comprehensively explores the current status of solvent&#8208;free fabrication methods for metal halide perovskites, outlines the current challenges and opportunities, and provides a critical assessment of the technological readiness and future research directions. The development of robust and scalable solvent&#8208;free fabrication methodologies is essential to realizing the full potential of metal halide perovskites. We hope that this review will serve as a catalyst, inspiring and guiding researchers to explore new strategies for the solvent&#8208;free deposition of these remarkable materials, thereby expediting their integration into technological applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal halide perovskites have ascended as a remarkable class of materials in recent years, demonstrating exceptional promise for application in various electronic and optoelectronic devices. The vast majority of research on these materials focuses on their processing from solution, which is relatively easily executed in laboratory settings, but its scalability for industrial mass production remains a significant hurdle. Furthermore, its reliance on highly toxic solvents imposes limitations with respect to large-area fabrication and have a negative environmental impact. This review comprehensively explores the current status of solvent-free fabrication methods for metal halide perovskites, outlines the current challenges and opportunities, and provides a critical assessment of the technological readiness and future research directions. The development of robust and scalable solvent-free fabrication methodologies is essential to realizing the full potential of metal halide perovskites. We hope that this review will serve as a catalyst, inspiring and guiding researchers to explore new strategies for the solvent-free deposition of these remarkable materials, thereby expediting their integration into technological applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Scaffolds for Enhanced Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the development and use of cell membrane&#8208;coated scaffolds in tissue engineering. Bioinspired phospholipid and glycocalyx coatings enhance anti&#8208;fouling, anti&#8208;thrombogenic, and selective molecular recognition properties. Native cell membrane coatings further support cell&#8208;specific interactions, immune modulation, and reduced bacterial adhesion. Recent advances in skin, bone, neural, and vascular regeneration highlight their broad therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Cell membranes are emerging as valuable models for regulating scaffold&#8208;cell interactions in tissue engineering. Their unique structure and function provide an ideal template for creating biomimetic surfaces that support cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. This has led to the development of cell membrane&#8208;coated scaffolds (CMCSs), a new class of biomaterials designed to mimic native cellular interfaces and improve therapeutic outcomes. This review begins with an overview of cell&#8211;extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, highlighting their key roles in tissue remodeling and healing. It then introduces ECM&#8208;inspired coatings before focusing on CMCSs. A detailed analysis of scaffolds coated with specific membrane components or entire cell membranes is presented, with applications in skin and wound healing, bone regeneration, neural repair, and vascular grafts. Techniques for membrane extraction, surface functionalization, and preservation of membrane integrity and orientation are analyzed. CMCSs demonstrate advantages over traditional scaffolds, including improved homotypic cell attraction, immune modulation, and resistance to non&#8208;specific protein and bacterial adhesion. However, several challenges persist, such as standardizing membrane isolation methods, optimizing coating density, and evaluating the stability and reproducibility of coatings, especially when using hybrid membranes from multiple cell types. Overcoming these barriers could significantly advance scaffold technologies for regenerative medicine.

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Hydrogels Emerging from Dynamic and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanoresponsive behaviors in hydrogels often arise from dynamic or non&#8208;covalent interactions between polymer chains. This review highlights self&#8208;healing, shear&#8208;thinning, shear&#8208;thickening, and strain&#8208;stiffening hydrogels formed through dynamic crosslinking motifs, discussing their underlying mechanisms and emergent applications across biomedical and engineering contexts.








Abstract
Mechanoresponsive hydrogels undergo changes in their physical and chemical properties in response to mechanical stimuli such as strain, force, or shear stress. These responses are often mediated by dynamic or non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions. Unlike covalent bonds, which confer desirable mechanical strength but result in static networks, dynamic crosslinking motifs introduce reversibility that enables mechanically actuatable behaviors such as self&#8208;healing, shear&#8208;thinning or &#8208;thickening, and strain&#8208;stiffening. This review highlights these four distinct mechanoresponsive behaviors in dynamic hydrogels, examining their underlying mechanisms, characterization methods, and emerging applications, with a focus on the critical role of dynamic interactions in enabling their mechanoresponsive properties.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production via Small Molecules Electrooxidation&#8208;Assisted Hybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamically favorable small molecules electrooxidation&#8208;assisted hybrid electrochemical systems provide an appealing solution for achieving energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. This review summarizes recent advances in such hybrid systems, including pollutant degradation, waste plastic upgrading, bipolar hydrogen production, and electricity output. In addition, the remaining challenges and future prospects for hybrid energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production systems are discussed.








Abstract
To alleviate overdependence on traditional fossil resources, green hydrogen (H2) production from an electrochemical water splitting (EWS) system powered by renewable energy resources (i.e., tidal, wind, and solar energy) has garnered considerable attention for its environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, the H2 production efficiency of the EWS system is restricted by the sluggish four&#8208;electron transfer process of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which inhibits its further large&#8208;scale applications. Herein, recent advances in the hybrid EWS systems that substitutes OER with the thermodynamically favorable small molecules electrooxidation reaction (SMEOR) to integrate with the hydrogen evolution reaction are reviewed. First, the catalytic mechanisms of electrocatalysts toward SMEOR, reactor configurations, and evaluation parameters are briefly summarized. Next, the advantages and characteristics of the hybrid systems of SMEOR integrated with hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen reduction reaction are highlighted and discussed in detail, including pollutant degradation, waste plastic upgrading, production of value&#8208;added chemicals, bipolar H2 production, and electricity output. Subsequently, the optimization strategies for rationally engineering the catalysts of SMEOR are proposed. Last, the current obstacles and future expectations of the hybrid EWS systems are outlined. This review aims to stimulate the further evolution of green H2 production.

         <title>Materials Engineering for Light&#8208;Activated Gas Sensors: Insights, Advances, and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>

Light activation of gas sensors is a promising strategy for enabling power&#8208;efficient operation in next&#8208;generation smart devices, where a rational design of sensing layers can enhance light energy utilization. This review discusses design strategies for light&#8208;activated gas sensors, including doping&#8208;induced band structure tuning, plasmonic nanoparticle incorporation, and heterojunction engineering, along with key factors in light&#8208;activated gas sensing.








Abstract
Light activation stands out as one of the most&#160;promising&#160;strategies for improving the energy efficiency of chemiresistive gas sensors, a crucial step toward their commercialization and integration with smart devices. Current designs of light&#8208;activated gas sensors have primarily focused on catalyst decoration and doping in various photoreactive substrates (e.g., semiconducting metal oxides, conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks, or transition metal dichalcogenides). These approaches aim to induce surface activation to varying extents rather than optimizing the material itself for efficient light&#8208;energy utilization. Consequently, advancing light&#8208;activated gas sensor technology requires a dual focus on enhancing gas response characteristics and maximizing the utilization of incident light energy. To this end, this review provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the photochemical mechanisms governing light&#8208;activated gas sensing, highlights key factors for performance optimization, and discusses the recent advancement in design strategies such as band structure tuning through doping, plasmonic nanoparticle incorporation, and heterojunction engineering. This review concludes with insights on future research directions in material development, signal processing, and device integration, offering a comprehensive perspective on the practical advancements of light&#8208;activated gas sensing technology.

         <title>Biohybrid Microrobot Enteric&#8208;Coated Microcapsule for Oral Treatment of Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative oral drug delivery system using piezoelectric BaTiO&#8323; nanoparticles on Enterobacter aerogenes microrobots encapsulated in enteric microcapsules. These microrobots can penetrate the intestinal mucus barrier and target the colorectal tumor microenvironment, inducing tumor cell death through ultrasound&#8208;activated reactions while simultaneously promoting an immune response against tumors.








Abstract
The oral treatment of colorectal cancer is highly desirable due to its noninvasiveness and potential for localized drug action, yet it remains challenged by gastrointestinal barriers and limited intratumoral penetration. This study presents the first oral biohybrid microrobot system that integrates ultrasound&#8208;activated piezoelectric catalysis with bacterial therapy, achieving synergistic tumor targeting, reactive oxygen species generation, and immune activation. By leveraging Enterobacter aerogenes (EA) and BaTiO3 nanoparticles, this strategy induces immunogenic tumor cell death and metabolic remodeling. It utilizes BaTiO3 incorporated into EA (EA@BTO) microrobots, which are encapsulated in enteric microcapsules. These microcapsules, encapsulated in enteric microcapsules via photocurable 3D printing, protect during digestion, target tumors, penetrate mucus, and release gases. They thrive in anaerobic, acidic environments, enabling precise, responsive delivery within the intestinal tract.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents an innovative oral drug delivery system using piezoelectric BaTiO&#8323; nanoparticles on Enterobacter aerogenes microrobots encapsulated in enteric microcapsules. These microrobots can penetrate the intestinal mucus barrier and target the colorectal tumor microenvironment, inducing tumor cell death through ultrasound-activated reactions while simultaneously promoting an immune response against tumors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oral treatment of colorectal cancer is highly desirable due to its noninvasiveness and potential for localized drug action, yet it remains challenged by gastrointestinal barriers and limited intratumoral penetration. This study presents the first oral biohybrid microrobot system that integrates ultrasound-activated piezoelectric catalysis with bacterial therapy, achieving synergistic tumor targeting, reactive oxygen species generation, and immune activation. By leveraging Enterobacter aerogenes (EA) and BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles, this strategy induces immunogenic tumor cell death and metabolic remodeling. It utilizes BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; incorporated into EA (EA@BTO) microrobots, which are encapsulated in enteric microcapsules. These microcapsules, encapsulated in enteric microcapsules via photocurable 3D printing, protect during digestion, target tumors, penetrate mucus, and release gases. They thrive in anaerobic, acidic environments, enabling precise, responsive delivery within the intestinal tract. Once the microrobots reach the tumor, the BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles catalyze reduction and oxidation reactions upon ultrasound irradiation, leading to the induction of immunogenic tumor cell death. Notably, the consumption of lactic acid by BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and EA alleviates the immunosuppressive microenvironment within the tumor. This promotes the maturation of dendritic cells and the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 phenotype, thereby reducing the proportion of regulatory T cells and enhancing the population of effector T cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Filamented Light (FLight) Bioprinting of Mini&#8208;Muscles with Self&#8208;Renewal Potential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the FLight biofabrication for engineering in vitro muscle constructs by photocrosslinking pristine collagen and fibrinogen using ruthenium. The resulting mini&#8208;muscles retain in vivo&#8208;like tissue organization and a Pax7&#8314; cell pool. Notably, these mini&#8208;muscles are self&#8208;renewable upon injury, and their regenerative capacity can be further enhanced by small molecules such as Repsox.









Abstract
The plasticity and regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle arise from quiescent stem cells activated upon overload, injury, or disease state. Developing in vitro muscle models to study these properties can advance muscle disease modeling and pre&#8208;clinical evaluation. Here, Filamented Light (FLight) bioprinting is leveraged as a high&#8208;throughput approach for producing mini&#8208;muscle tissues. Using paired box protein 7 (Pax7)&#8208;nGFP primary myoblasts, mini&#8208;muscles are bioprinted from pristine collagen&#8208;fibrinogen (ColFib). The FLight hydrogel consist of aligned microstructures which guide the formation of aligned myotubes. Mini&#8208;muscles demonstrates in vivo&#8208;like tissue organization, including multinucleated myotubes and a Pax7+ cell pool embedded in newly deposited laminin. Both spontaneous and electrically stimulated contractions are observed. ColFib matrix is promising for maintenance of the Pax7+ cell pool. Damage from cardiotoxin&#8208;induced injury of the mini&#8208;muscles led to a massive proliferation of Pax7+ cells and restoration of the contractile properties of myotubes. Notably, small molecules such as Repsox can enhance regeneration. FLight printed mini&#8208;muscles have potential for applications in muscle biology, exercise/atrophy, disease models, and drug screening.

         <title>Giant Flexoelectric&#8208;Like Response via Macroscopic Symmetry Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to enhance flexoelectricity by designing the macroscopic symmetry of the material parameters and device structure is proposed. The centrosymmetric piezoelectric bimorph cantilever exhibits a flexoelectric coefficient of 1.47 &#215; 106 nC&#160;m&#8722;1, and the mirror&#8208;symmetric one with spaced&#8208;interdigitated electrodes achieves a record&#8208;high value of 2.53 &#215; 106 nC&#160;m&#8722;1. This strategy can guide the design of high&#8208;performance flexoelectric devices.








Abstract
Flexoelectricity is enabled by symmetry in all materials. However, flexoelectric material application is limited by the normally low charge density produced in bulk materials. In this study, a universal strategy involving a macroscopic symmetry design is proposed to enhance the flexoelectricity. Through theoretical derivation, flexoelectricity can be improved by designing the macroscopic symmetry of the material parameter distribution (including the piezoelectric coefficients) and device structure. As a demonstration, typical piezoelectric bimorph cantilevers (PBCs; Ag/PZT&#8208;5H/Ag/PZT&#8208;5H/Ag) are constructed with the two PZT&#8208;5H layers arranged in &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; polarization (mirror symmetry) and &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; polarization (centrosymmetry), to design the macroscopic symmetry and thus to tune the flexoelectricity. The theoretical predictions and experimental results show that the tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail PBC achieves a flexoelectric coefficient (1.47 &#215; 106 nC m&#8722;1), 20 times higher than that of the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail PBC (7 &#215; 104 nC m&#8722;1) and conventional piezoelectric cantilevers (Ag/PZT&#8208;5H/Ag). Furthermore, by introducing spaced&#8208;interdigitated electrodes, the macroscopic symmetry of the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail PBC can be transformed from mirror to centrosymmetry, yielding a giant flexoelectric coefficient of 2.53 &#215; 106 nC m&#8722;1. This strategy offers a dimension beyond traditional approaches for understanding and enhancing flexoelectricity, paving the way for its practical application.

Piezoelectric injectable anti&#8208;adhesive hydrogel promotes Achilles tendon healing, forming a barrier to prevent adhesion and inflammation, and accelerates repair via piezoelectricity, offering a new clinical treatment strategy.








Abstract
Achilles tendon rupture has become a common sports injury nowadays, but tendon repair is still is a challenge in the clinical practice. Tendon adhesion, which results from exogenous healing, is a crucial problem impairing tendon repair. Meanwhile, insufficient endogenous healing from the tendon stem cells, makes tendon repair even more difficult. Here, a piezoelectric injectable anti&#8208;adhesive hydrogel (PE&#8208;IAH) is reported, which can simutaneously promote endogenous healing while inhibiting exogenous healing in the tendon repair process. The in vivo study reveals that the PE&#8208;IAH can form a physical barrier in situ at the tendon injury site, which reduces the inflammatory response and effectively prevents the tendon from adhering to surrounding tissue. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric short fibers incorporated in the hydrogel can evidently promotes the proliferation and differentiation of tendon stem cells due to piezoelectric effect under ultrasound excitation. Altogethter, the PE&#8208;IAH successfully accelerates the endogenous healing of tendon in addition to the anti&#8208;adhesion purpose, resulting in remarkably elevated tendon functions (Achilles Functional Index: &#8722;15.6 of PE&#8208;IAH versus &#8722;30.6 of injectable anti&#8208;adhesive hydrogel (IAH), Day 14). This study provides a new strategy for advanced healing and functional recovery of Achilles tendon, which is promising to become a potential clinical treatment option.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Dislocated WO3 Photocathode Toward Efficient Photo&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the photoexcitation properties of Li2O2, a strategy for constructing a Z&#8208;type heterojunction at the photocathode@Li2O2 interface is proposed for photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. This Z&#8208;type heterojunction acts as a charge modulation channel for carrier dynamics within Li2O2 through photocathode modifications. By utilizing edge dislocation &#8208;WO3 as the photocathode, both high capacity and low overpotential are achieved.








Abstract
The operation of rechargeable Li&#8208;O2 batteries critically depends on the highly reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2 at the cathode. However, the intrinsic insulating nature of Li2O2 fundamentally restricts reaction kinetics, posing a core challenge to practical applications. Here, it is demonstrate that the insulating properties of Li2O2 can be effectively improved by photoexcitation, attributed to the generation of photo&#8208;induced charge carriers. It is inspired to develop photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries featuring Z&#8208;type photocathode@Li2O2 heterojunction, which serves as a charge modulation channel to regulate carrier dynamics through photocathode modifications. By employing edge&#8208;dislocated WO3 as the photocathode, sustained growth of Li2O2 films is observed with a thickness &gt;18&#160;&#181;m, which is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than typically reported values. Benefiting from the enhanced exciton dissociation of Li2O2 and improved oxidative capability of photocathode, the battery delivers an ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 31&#160;800&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and a light&#8208;induced temperature of &#8776;60&#160;&#176;C. In addition, a low polarization overpotential of 0.04&#160;V is achieved with high reversibility over 1&#160;000 h. The grasp of photoexcited Li2O2 within Li&#8208;O2 batteries can drive solutions beyond state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;air batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the photoexcitation properties of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a strategy for constructing a Z-type heterojunction at the photocathode@Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface is proposed for photo-assisted Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. This Z-type heterojunction acts as a charge modulation channel for carrier dynamics within Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through photocathode modifications. By utilizing edge dislocation -WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the photocathode, both high capacity and low overpotential are achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation of rechargeable Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries critically depends on the highly reversible formation and decomposition of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the cathode. However, the intrinsic insulating nature of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fundamentally restricts reaction kinetics, posing a core challenge to practical applications. Here, it is demonstrate that the insulating properties of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be effectively improved by photoexcitation, attributed to the generation of photo-induced charge carriers. It is inspired to develop photo-assisted Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries featuring Z-type photocathode@Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction, which serves as a charge modulation channel to regulate carrier dynamics through photocathode modifications. By employing edge-dislocated WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the photocathode, sustained growth of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; films is observed with a thickness &amp;gt;18&#160;&#181;m, which is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than typically reported values. Benefiting from the enhanced exciton dissociation of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and improved oxidative capability of photocathode, the battery delivers an ultra-high discharge capacity of 31&#160;800&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a light-induced temperature of &#8776;60&#160;&#176;C. In addition, a low polarization overpotential of 0.04&#160;V is achieved with high reversibility over 1&#160;000 h. The grasp of photoexcited Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; within Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries can drive solutions beyond state-of-the-art metal-air batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferroelectric Polarization Electric Field Induced High Performance Graphene/LiNbO3 Dynamic Diode Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vertical graphene/LiNbO3 dynamic diode generator (DDG) demonstrated an ultra&#8208;high voltage output exceeding 41&#160;V, attributed to the coupling enhancement between the ferroelectric polarization electric field on the LiNbO&#8323; surface and the built&#8208;in electric field at the graphene/LiNbO3 interface, thus opening up a novel avenue for the efficient harvesting of environmental mechanical energy.








Abstract
Substantial endeavors have been dedicated to continuously harvesting mechanical energy from the environment, where dynamic semiconductor diode generators (DDGs) have recently been drawing significant attention as the miniature, portable in situ energy device. However, despite their unique advantages of direct&#8208;current output and high current density, the output voltage of DDG is usually less than 1 V, which needs to be further improved to satisfy the demands of practical applications. Therefore, this study proposes a vertical graphene/LiNbO3 DDG that is conducive to an ultra&#8208;high voltage output. The coupling enhancement effect arising from the synergy between the ferroelectric polarization electric field on the LiNbO3 surface and the built&#8208;in electric field at the graphene/LiNbO3 interface has been identified as a key factor in achieving an impressively high open&#8208;circuit voltage output of 41.3 V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 1.53 &#181;A. The vertical graphene/LiNbO3 DDG can effectively power an LED without the requirement of an external energy storage and conversion circuit. Moreover, it demonstrates outstanding stability, showing no evident performance attenuation after continuous operation exceeding 3 h. The graphene/LiNbO3 DDG has enhanced the feasibility of real&#8208;time energy supply for electronic components and paved the way for the efficient harvesting of mechanical energy from the environment.

         <title>A Photonastic Prototissue Capable of Photo&#8208;Mechano&#8208;Chemical Transduction</title>

Mimicking energy transduction in prototissue assemblies remains a challenge of bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. In this work, prototissues integrating protocells with photothermal gold nanoparticle proto&#8208;organelles and a thermoresponsive polymeric proto&#8208;cortex are developed. These prototissues exhibited light&#8208;controlled reversible contractions, programmable motions, and dynamic control of enzymatic metabolism by restricting substrate access, pioneering a route toward bioinspired materials with emergent energy transduction behaviors.








Abstract
Despite recent significant advances in the controlled assembly of protocell units into complex 3D architectures, the development of prototissues capable of mimicking the sophisticated energy transduction processes fundamental to living tissues remains a critical unmet challenge in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. Here a synthetic approach is described to start addressing this challenge and report the bottom&#8208;up chemical construction of a photonastic prototissue endowed with photo&#8208;mechano&#8208;chemical transduction capabilities. For this, novel protocells enclosing photothermal transducing proto&#8208;organelles based on gold nanoparticles and a thermoresponsive polymeric proto&#8208;cortex are developed. These advanced protocell units are assembled into prototissues capable of light&#8208;induced reversible contractions and complex motions, which can be exploited to reversibly switch off a coordinated internalized enzyme metabolism by blocking the access of small substrate molecules. Overall, the work provides a synthetic pathway to constructing prototissues with sophisticated energy transduction mechanisms, enabling the rational design of emergent behaviors in synthetic materials and addressing critical challenges in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology and bioinspired materials engineering.

         <title>Coexisting Multiple Charge Orders and Magnetism in the Kagome Superconductor LaRu3Si2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coexistence of two distinct charge orders and emergent magnetism is uncovered in the correlated Kagome superconductor LaRu3Si2. A low&#8208;temperature (1/6,0,0) charge order below 80 K induces magnetoresistance, and field&#8208;driven magnetic response. An additional lower&#8208;temperature scale marks time&#8208;reversal symmetry breaking and Hall sign reversal, highlighting LaRu3Si2's unique interplay of charge order with pronounced electronic responses, magnetism, and superconductivity. The calculations underscore the relevance of electronic correlations in this system.








Abstract
The Kagome lattice has emerged as a promising platform for hosting unconventional chiral charge orders at high temperatures. In the context of the correlated Kagome superconductor LaRu3Si2, a room&#8208;temperature charge&#8208;ordered state with a propagation vector of (14$\frac{1}{4}$,&#160;0,&#160;0) is previously reported. However, understanding the interplay between this charge order and superconductivity, particularly with respect to time&#8208;reversal&#8208;symmetry breaking, remains elusive. In this study, we employ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetotransport measurements, muon&#8208;spin rotation experiments, and first&#8208;principles calculations to investigate charge order and its electronic and magnetic responses in LaRu3Si2 across a wide temperature range, down to the superconducting state. These findings reveal the appearance of a charge order with a propagation vector of (16$\frac{1}{6}$,&#160;0,&#160;0) below Tco, 2 &#8771; 80 K, which coexists with the previously identified room temperature primary charge order (14$\frac{1}{4}$,&#160;0,&#160;0). The primary charge&#8208;ordered state exhibits zero magnetoresistance. In contrast, the appearance of the secondary charge order at Tco, 2 is accompanied by a notable magnetoresistance response and a pronounced temperature&#8208;dependent Hall effect, which experiences a sign reversal, switching from positive to negative below T* &#8771; 35 K. Intriguingly, a significant enhancement is observed in the internal field width sensed by the muon ensemble below T* &#8771; 35 K. Moreover, the muon spin relaxation rate exhibits a substantial increase upon the application of an external magnetic field below Tco, 2 &#8771; 80 K. These results highlight the coexistence of two distinct types of charge order and magnetism in LaRu3Si2 within the correlated Kagome lattice, along with superconductivity. This study sheds light on the intricate electronic and magnetic phenomena occurring in Kagome superconductors, providing valuable insights into their unique properties and potential&#160;applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flame&#8208;spray&#8208;pyrolysis method is presented to synthesize ultra&#8208;bright CTS nanosheets with tunable NIR&#8208;II emission. Achieving quantum yields up to 34%, these materials support high&#8208;speed imaging and enable super&#8208;resolution in vivo applications such as transcranial microcirculation mapping and macrophage tracking.









Abstract
Expanding fluorescence bioimaging into the second near&#8208;infrared spectrum (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) unlocks advanced possibilities for diagnostics and therapeutics, offering superior tissue penetration and resolution. 2D copper tetrasilicate (CTS) pigments (MCuSi4O10, M = Ca, Sr, Ba) are known for their brightness and stability, yet synthetic challenges have curbed their integration into bioimaging. Here, flame&#8208;spray&#8208;pyrolysis (FSP) is introduced as a versatile and scalable synthesis approach to produce ultra&#8208;bright, metastable CTS nanosheets (NS) by annealing multi&#8208;element metal oxide nanoparticles into 2D crystals through calcination or laser irradiation. Group&#8208;II ion incorporation shifts emission into the NIR&#8208;II range, with Ba0.33Sr0.33Ca0.33CuSi4O10 peaking at 1007&#160;nm, while minor Mg&#8208;doping induces a hypsochromic shift and extends fluorescence lifetimes. The engineered CTS achieves quantum yields of up to 34%, supporting NS high&#8208;frame&#8208;rate imaging (&gt; 200 fps). These unique properties enable CTS&#8208;NS to serve as powerful contrast agents for super&#8208;resolution NIR bioimaging, demonstrated in vivo through transcranial microcirculation mapping and macrophage tracking in mice using diffuse optical localization imaging (DOLI). This pioneering synthesis strategy unlocks wavelength&#8208;tunable NS for advanced NIR&#8208;II bioimaging applications.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Viologen&#8208;Based Lyotropic Chromonic Liquid Crystal Reactive Mesogen: Uniaxial Orientation and Photopolymerization for Transmittance and Color Controllable Electrochromic Smart Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly synthesized &#960;&#8208;extended viologen&#8208;based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (&#960;V&#8208;LCLC) reactive mesogen (RM) is used for the fabrication of polarization&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable optical device. The &#960;V&#8208;LCLC EC optical device has the potential for advancing optical applications.








Abstract
To advance the development of an electrochromic (EC) smart glass, a &#960;&#8208;extended viologen&#8208;based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (&#960;V&#8208;LCLC) reactive mesogen (RM) is newly designed and successfully synthesized in this study. By extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length of viologen, the &#960;V&#8208;LCLC RM forms a stable LCLC phase at room temperature and retains its chemical integrity during the EC reactions, exhibiting reversible transitions across three redox states: dication (D), cation&#8208;radical (C), and neutral (N). A uniaxially oriented nanostructure is constructed on the macroscopic scale through shear&#8208;coating and molecular self&#8208;assembly. Subsequent photopolymerization of the uniaxially oriented &#960;V&#8208;LCLC film significantly enhances its mechanical and chemical stability while enabling polarization&#8208;dependent transmittance and distinct color transitions. This newly developed &#960;V&#8208;LCLC RM facilitates the fabrication of energy&#8208;efficient EC optical devices with tunable transmittance and multicolor modulation, and it is operable at a low voltage of 2.5 V.

         <title>Enhanced Control of Liposomal Drug Release by Drug&#8211;Aptamer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an aptamer&#8208;enhanced liposomal drug release platform is developed that controls the release of various drugs through a mechanism involving both specific drug affinity and impedance of diffusion. As in vivo proof of principle, this platform provides prolonged local anesthesia for up to 6.6 d following a single dose of tetrodotoxin (TTX) injected at the sciatic nerve in rats.








Abstract
Conventional diffusion&#8208;controlled drug delivery systems (DDS) can have undesirable initial burst release, leading to potential systemic toxicity, and the rate of basal release can deplete content, shortening the duration of effect. Here, it is hypothesized that conventional drug delivery systems&#8212;using liposomes as an example&#8212;can be enhanced by incorporation of an aptamer that binds specifically to the encapsulated drug. Affinity of the aptamer to the drug within liposomes (Lipo&#8208;Apt) would slow release. It is demonstrated that this approach works with a range of relatively small and hydrophilic molecules, including tetrodotoxin (TTX), serotonin (Ser), and kanamycin (Kan). The in vivo utility of this system in providing prolonged local anesthesia with TTX injected at the sciatic nerve in rats is further demonstrated. A single injection of TTX&#8208;loaded Lipo&#8208;Apt results in 6.6 d of nerve blockade, a fourfold improvement over the duration achieved by liposomes without aptamers, and 26&#8208;fold over the aptamer&#8211;drug complex. In part, the improved efficacy of Lipo&#8208;Apt is also due to slower release reducing systemic toxicity, which allows delivery of larger drug doses. These studies demonstrate that Lipo&#8208;Apt is a promising approach to enhancing control of release of drugs by DDS, reducing toxicity and enhancing duration of effect.

         <title>A k Descriptor to Design of Current Collectors for Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study mathematically derives three key parameters, dielectric coefficient, interfacial concentration change, and ion mobility, critical to current collector design, and introduces a quantitative descriptor, k, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating current collector efficiency. Guided by these theoretical insights, this study experimentally develops a free&#8208;standing current collector that exhibits optimal plating/stripping performance and extended cycle life of 24&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The anode&#8208;free strategy enables exceptionally high energy density in rechargeable metal batteries, but the lack of theoretical frameworks impedes current collector design. Here, this study mathematically derives three critical parameters: dielectric coefficient (&#603;), ion mobility (&#181;_C), and the change of concentration (&#948;C_C), and introduces a quantitative descriptor, k, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating current collector efficiency. Experimentally, a carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;based current collector is fabricated with minimized &#603;, enhanced &#948;C_C (nano/micro&#8208;Sb particles), and &#181;_C (sodium carboxymethylcellulose, CMC&#8208;Na). The optimized design achieves remarkable cycling stability&#8208;over 24 months at 0.25 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and 12 months even at a high areal capacity of 20 mAh cm&#8722;2. The lowest k value aligns with half&#8208;cell tests, validating this theory. This work establishes a quantitative framework for designing high&#8208;efficiency anode&#8208;free sodium battery current collectors.

         <title>Direct Photopatterning of Green Solvent&#8208;Processed 2D Nanomaterials for Wafer&#8208;Scale Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocross&#8208;linking strategy is proposed for the patterning and integration of scalable vertical van der Waals heterostructures such as field&#8208;effect transistors, logic gates, and memory devices composed of 2D nanomaterials by UV light&#8208;sensitive cross&#8208;linker in isopropyl alcohol. To optimize the alcohol&#8208;based dispersion system, Hansen solubility parameter analysis is performed to identify a solvent capable of simultaneously stabilizing both the 2D nanomaterials and the cross&#8208;linker.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed 2D nanomaterials have emerged as key building blocks for the large&#8208;scale assembly of functional electronic devices. Solution processing enables the formation of electronically active percolated networks by leveraging van der Waals (vdW) interactions between individual 2D nanosheets.

&lt;p&gt;A photocross-linking strategy is proposed for the patterning and integration of scalable vertical van der Waals heterostructures such as field-effect transistors, logic gates, and memory devices composed of 2D nanomaterials by UV light-sensitive cross-linker in isopropyl alcohol. To optimize the alcohol-based dispersion system, Hansen solubility parameter analysis is performed to identify a solvent capable of simultaneously stabilizing both the 2D nanomaterials and the cross-linker.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Achieving Efficient Phosphorescent Carbon Nanodots in Aqueous Solution by Suppressing Triplet Electron Leakage</title>

Machine learning reveals that increasing matrix thickness reduces triplet exciton leakage, establishing a data&#8208;guided design paradigm for water&#8208;soluble phosphorescent CNDs with ultrahigh efficiency. 








Abstract
Matrix&#8208;assisted synthesis has emerged as a prevalent strategy for the fabrication of solid&#8208;state phosphorescent carbon nanodots (CNDs), yet achieving efficient liquid&#8208;phase CND systems remains challenging due to complex underlying mechanisms. The knowledge gap poses a substantial barrier to translating phosphorescent CND systems between solid&#8208;state and liquid&#8208;phase configurations. Herein, the critical role of triplet electron leakage is elucidated in reducing the phosphorescent performance of CNDs and demonstrates how machine learning (ML) can be applied to suppress this leakage, achieving efficient phosphorescent CNDs in aqueous solution. By integrating experimental datasets from hundreds of systematically designed syntheses, an interpretable ML model capable of predicting and tuning phosphorescence lifetimes in CND systems is developed. The quantitative relationships between features and lifetimes using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis are established, revealing an inverse correlation between matrix thickness and the probability of triplet electron leakage. Guided by the developed ML model, efficient phosphorescent CNDs are achieved in aqueous solution with an emission duration lifetime of exceeding10&#160;s and a phosphorescent quantum yield of over 10%. This study establishes a conceptual and methodological framework for engineering high&#8208;performance phosphorescent nanomaterials in liquid&#8208;phase systems.

         <title>Enhancing N&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance via Blending Alkyl and Oligoglycol Functionalized Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blending hydrophobic and hydrophilic n&#8208;type conjugated polymers in precise ratios enhances charge carrier mobility and dramatically improves organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) performance. This strategy demonstrates how molecular interactions and phase compatibility within polymer blends can be engineered to tune microstructure and transport properties, providing a versatile design approach for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OECT materials.








Abstract
Compared to their p&#8208;type counterparts, n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) generally exhibit inferior stability, slower ion injection kinetics, and reduced sensitivity when used as the active layer in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). Enhancing the performance of n&#8208;type OMIECs is crucial for advancing next&#8208;generation technologies that rely on mixed conduction, including bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and energy storage. Here, how blending two n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with oligoglycol and alkyl side chains impacts OECT performance is investigated. Specifically, NDI(biOE2)&#8208;T2, which has branched oligoglycol side chains, and N2200, which has branched alkyl side chains, are examined. Blending these polymers in a 90:10 NDI(biOE2)&#8208;T2:N2200 ratio results in a twofold increase in the electronic mobility volumetric capacitance product (&#181;C*) compared to pure NDI(biOE2)&#8208;T2. However, at higher N2200 concentrations, the &#181;C* product declines sharply. The enhancement in &#181;C* arises from an increase in electronic mobility (&#181;), likely due to reduced polymer swelling upon N2200 addition. Nanoscale infrared imaging with photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM) is used to visualize the spatial distribution of the two polymers and observe that higher N2200 content leads to phase separation, contributing to the drop in &#181;C*. Overall, this study highlights polymer blending as a promising strategy for improving the performance of n&#8208;type OMIECs.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Borohydride Doping in Electrochemical Stability of Argyrodite Li6PS5Cl Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals how LiBH4 doping in argyrodite&#8208;type Li6PS5Cl solid&#8208;state electrolyte improves electrochemical stability by forming a tri&#8208;layer SEI based predominately on Li3P/LiBH4/Li2S that promotes ion transport and blocks electrons. In situ XPS and TOF&#8208;SIMS show thinner SEI, enhanced Li electrodeposition, and better interfacial wetting compared to baseline LPSCl, highlighting the role of B&#8208;rich layers in interface engineering.









Abstract
This work elucidates the mechanism by which lithium borohydride (LiBH4) doping into argyrodite&#8208;type Li6PS5Cl (LBH&#8208;LPSCl) solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) enhances electrochemical stability. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance is achieved with 5 wt% borohydride. Symmetric cells achieve critical current density (CCD) of 7.3 mA cm&#8722;2, versus 2.6 mA cm&#8722;2 for baseline&#8208;LPSCl. All solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) employing lithium metal and NMC811 cathode are stable over 400 cycles at 0.5C, with capacity retention of 83%. An anode&#8208;free ASSB (AF&#8208;ASSB) is stable over 600 cycles, with capacity loss of 0.04% per cycle. 5LBH&#8208;LPSCl allows for enhanced low temperature operation, down to &#8722;14&#160;&#176;C. Yet the difference in electrolytes&#8217; bulk microstructures and hardnesses are minimal, while ionic conductivity is incrementally improved (&#8776;50%). Theoretical modeling indicates limited effect of substitution on thermodynamic stability of PS43&#8722; units, which decompose when contacting Li. Instead, enhanced electrochemical stability is site&#8208;specific kinetic effect: In situ electrodeposition experiments using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) reveal tri&#8208;layer SEI based predominately on Li3P/LiBH4/Li2S that blocks electrons while facilitating ion transport. This SEI manifests reduced interface resistance and accelerated nucleation and growth of metallic Li. With baseline&#8208;LPSCl the SEI based on Li3P/Li2S is substantially thicker, generating localized stresses that promote interfacial cracking while cycling.

         <title>Quantitatively Predicting Angle&#8208;Resolved Polarized Raman Intensity of Anisotropic Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops comprehensive methodologies to predict angle&#8208;resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) intensity profiles of anisotropic layered materials (ALMs), spanning from atomically&#8208;thin layers to bulk limit. By considering birefringence, linear dichroism and multilayer interference, the complex refractive indexes and intrinsic Raman tensors are determined, offering a robust framework for ARPR analysis of ALM flakes across various dielectric structures.








Abstract

A fast&#8208;charging graphite anode (C@MEG) with rapid surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk lithium transport and low interfacial resistance is demonstrated for Ah&#8208;level lithium&#8208;ion pouch batteries, offering high energy density, high power density, short charging time and long cycle life. This work provides valuable insights for the fast&#8208;charging applications of graphite&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The exponential growth of electric vehicle industry necessitates to rapidly develop fast&#8208;charging technology for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the mainstream graphite anode encounters significant challenges in fast&#8208;charging scenarios, including capacity decay and shortened lifespan caused by the sluggish lithiation kinetics and unstable solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, the kilogram&#8208;level scalable production of ultrafast&#8208;charging anode (C@MEG) consisting of micro&#8208;expanded graphite coated by an ultrathin disordered carbon layer (5&#160;nm) is reported, which simultaneously compensates for the conventional limitation of internal lithium diffusion kinetics and reconfigures the external electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. This uniqueness endows rapid surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk lithium transport, with minimized electrode polarization, enhanced pseudocapacitive behavior, and reduced interface impedance. At an ultrafast&#8208;charging rate of 10 C, this Li||C@MEG cell exhibits an ultrahigh capacity of 157 mAh g&#8722;1, superior to pristine graphite (71 mAh g&#8722;1) and previously reported graphite anodes. Moreover, this assembled 1 Ah&#8208;level C@MEG||LiCoO2 pouch battery delivers remarkable fast&#8208;charging cyclability, showcasing 92% capacity retention after 1000 cycles under 3 A, together with high power density around 1500&#160;W kg&#8722;1 under 10 A, corresponding to a short charging time of only 4.2 min, demonstrative of applicability. This work presents a practical scalable fast&#8208;charging anode toward high&#8208;energy, high&#8208;power and long&#8208;life batteries.

         <title>Terminations Determine Energy&#8208;Level Alignment of Perovskite Buried Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of the widely&#8208;reported &#8220;substrate&#8208;effect&#8221; in perovskite field is disclosed as the varying combinations of perovskite terminations at the buried interface. The substrate influences the electronic structure of the perovskite through inducing electron&#8208;transfer within different perovskite slabs near the interface. These findings highlight the potential of termination engineering to enhance the performance of perovskite devices.








Abstract
The &#8220;substrate&#8208;effect&#8221;, where the semiconduction type of perovskite changes according to that of the substrate is a widely&#8208;reported, but so far not fully understood phenomenon in the field of perovskite. The main challenge lies in the difficulty of probing and comprehending the electronic properties of perovskite buried interfaces. Here, through broadly investigating 20 buried interfaces formed between different perovskites and organic hole or electron transport materials (HTMs or ETMs), it is revealed that the substrate&#8208;effect originates from the distinct energy&#8208;level alignments at HTM or ETM substrates. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that this difference stems from varying proportions of two perovskite terminations, which are determined by the interaction between substrates and perovskite crystals. With such mechanism, the semiconduction type of perovskite by controlling the proportion of surface terminations is successfully tuned. These findings provide new insights into optimizing device performance through termination engineering.

         <title>Anchoring Unimolecular Metal Chloride as a Sterically Active Site for Conformal Zinc Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octahedrally coordinated MnCl2N4 structure anchored on hard carbon tailors the electronic environment of single atoms to lower zinc nucleation barriers. Chloride&#8208;assisted Zn adsorption with Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and residual Zn enables reduced overpotential. The resulting Zn&#8211;carbon composite anode delivers enhanced cycling stability and electrochemical performance in full cells.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, the practical application of zinc metal anodes is hindered by the challenge of uncontrollable zinc&#8208;dendrite growth. Herein, axial&#8208;coordinated manganese single atoms, anchored by N, Cl co&#8208;coordinating on self&#8208;standing carbon nanofibers, are designed to guide uniform Zn deposition. The MnCl2N4 octahedral sites act as effective nucleation centers, significantly reducing the Zn adsorption energy of the carbon matrix, achieving a nucleation overpotential of 17&#160;mV. The strong interaction between Zn and MnCl2N4 sites stabilizes the initially adsorbed Zn2+ through John&#8208;Teller distortions, which in turn promotes subsequent zinc adsorption. In symmetric cells, the Mn&#8208;modified carbon nanofiber electrodes exhibit excellent cycling stability with a lifespan of 200 h under a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a full cell coupling a MnO2 cathode with a Mn&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber anode delivers outstanding cycling performance over 1400 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. This work highlights the potential of axially coordinated single&#8208;atom metals in regulating zinc deposition, offering a pathway toward durable and high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

         <title>GHz&#8208;Speed Wavefront Shaping Metasurface Modulators Enabled by Resonant Electro&#8208;Optic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;optically tunable metasurfaces using a silicon&#8208;on&#8208;lithium niobate platform are presented, achieving both GHz amplitude modulation and transmissive wavefront shaping. Voltage biasing the lithium niobate tunes its refractive index, modulating the high quality factor resonance of the Si nanobar. Using this resonant nanoantenna platform, a beamsplitting metasurface device is developed, whose diffraction efficiency can be modulated with a bandwidth of 1.03 GHz. This platform provides a foundation for compact, high&#8208;bandwidth free&#8208;space communications and sensing devices.








Abstract
Electrically tunable metasurfaces that control the amplitude and phase of light through biasing of nanoscale antennas present a route to compact modulator devices. However, most platforms face limitations in bandwidth, optical efficiency, and tuning response. Electro&#8208;optically tunable metasurfaces achieving both GHz amplitude modulation and transmissive wavefront shaping in the telecom range are presented. The resonant electro&#8208;optic nanoantenna design consists of a silicon nanobar atop thin&#8208;film lithium niobate, with gold electrodes. The nanobar is a periodically perturbed optical waveguide that supports high quality factor (Q &gt; 1000) guided mode resonances excited with free&#8208;space light. Voltage biasing the lithium niobate tunes its refractive index, modulating the resonance of the nanobar through evanescent mode overlap. Absolute transmittance modulation of 7.1% with &#177;5 V applied voltage is demonstrated, and the modulation dependence on the resonance quality factor is shown. Additionally, the modulation bandwidth of these devices exceeds 800 MHz, and the electrode limitations on this bandwidth are studied.

     alt="GHz-Speed Wavefront Shaping Metasurface Modulators Enabled by Resonant Electro-Optic Nanoantennas"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electro-optically tunable metasurfaces using a silicon-on-lithium niobate platform are presented, achieving both GHz amplitude modulation and transmissive wavefront shaping. Voltage biasing the lithium niobate tunes its refractive index, modulating the high quality factor resonance of the Si nanobar. Using this resonant nanoantenna platform, a beamsplitting metasurface device is developed, whose diffraction efficiency can be modulated with a bandwidth of 1.03 GHz. This platform provides a foundation for compact, high-bandwidth free-space communications and sensing devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrically tunable metasurfaces that control the amplitude and phase of light through biasing of nanoscale antennas present a route to compact modulator devices. However, most platforms face limitations in bandwidth, optical efficiency, and tuning response. Electro-optically tunable metasurfaces achieving both GHz amplitude modulation and transmissive wavefront shaping in the telecom range are presented. The resonant electro-optic nanoantenna design consists of a silicon nanobar atop thin-film lithium niobate, with gold electrodes. The nanobar is a periodically perturbed optical waveguide that supports high quality factor (Q &amp;gt; 1000) guided mode resonances excited with free-space light. Voltage biasing the lithium niobate tunes its refractive index, modulating the resonance of the nanobar through evanescent mode overlap. Absolute transmittance modulation of 7.1% with &#177;5 V applied voltage is demonstrated, and the modulation dependence on the resonance quality factor is shown. Additionally, the modulation bandwidth of these devices exceeds 800 MHz, and the electrode limitations on this bandwidth are studied. Finally, how this resonant antenna platform can enable wavefront shaping metasurfaces is shown. A beamsplitting metasurface device is demonstrated, whose diffraction efficiency can be modulated with a bandwidth of 1.03 GHz. The high-speed modulation and wavefront control capabilities of this platform provide a foundation for compact, high-bandwidth free-space communications and sensing&#160;devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Broadband Polarization&#8208;Sensitive O&#8208;Doped ZrTe3 Photodetector Induced by UV Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;broadband polarization photodetector based on UV&#8208;laser&#8208;treated ZrTe3 is constructed with back&#8208;to&#8208;back Schottky barriers. It operates from 355 nm to 1.43 mm without antenna integration, delivering a responsivity of 0.31 A W&#8722;1 and fast rise/fall times of 729ns/14.9 &#956;s$\umu{\rm s}$. The device exhibits long&#8208;term air stability, enabling room&#8208;temperature multidimensional detection across an ultra&#8208;wide spectral range.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation photodetectors demand multidimensional information perception, high responsivity, and low noise equivalent power across an ultra&#8208;wide spectral range. Polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on anisotropic low&#8208;dimensional materials offer a promising solution, yet inherent material properties impose severe performance trade&#8208;offs. Here, this challenge is addressed by developing an ultra&#8208;broadband polarization photodetector with back&#8208;to&#8208;back Schottky barriers, fabricated via UV laser treatment of semi&#8208;metallic ZrTe3. The results demonstrate that the ZrTe3 polarization photodetector achieves ultra&#8208;wide spectral polarized light response from UV to terahertz (355 nm&#8211;1.43 mm) with antenna&#8208;free integration at room temperature. Notably, it exhibits a high responsivity of 0.31 A W&#8722;1 with rise/fall times of 729 ns/14.9 &#181;s at 532 nm. One&#8208;year&#8208;long photoresponse tests in air demonstrate stability for ultra&#8208;broadband ZrTe3 polarization detector (UBPD). This work highlights the transformative potential of ZrTe3 for future wide&#8208;spectrum polarization&#8208;sensitive&#160;applications.

         <title>Graphdiyne Production in a Flash: High&#8208;Yield Direct Synthesis by Electron Beam Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work creatively introduces an electron beam irradiation strategy that enables the deprotection&#8208;free synthesis of GDY directly from HEB&#8208;TMS under ambient conditions, achieving almost 100% yields within seconds&#8212;the shortest time reported to date, to the best of the&#160;knowledge. This ultrafast and efficient method significantly improves over traditional approaches, which often require hours or days of thermal treatment.








Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY), an emerging 2D carbon allotrope, holds immense potential for diverse applications but is severely constrained by relatively complex and time&#8208;intensive synthesis methods. Here, a novel electron beam irradiation strategy is reported that enables the ultrafast and scalable synthesis of GDY directly from its protected monomer, hexakis[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]benzene (HEB&#8208;TMS), under ambient conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report of the direct use of electron beam irradiation in carbon materials synthesis, achieving the shortest synthesis time for GDY from HEB&#8208;TMS reported to date. This unprecedented efficiency arises from the rapid in situ formation of copper acetylide intermediates, followed by electron&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage to generate alkynyl radicals that undergo efficient homo&#8208;coupling into GDY. Moreover, this flash approach enables the in situ formation of uniformly dispersed Cu2O nanoparticles on GDY, resulting in a composite with exceptional efficiency and stability for the electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia. By providing a green, scalable, and efficient synthetic route, this work not only marks a leap toward GDY production but also establishes a versatile platform for designing GDY&#8208;based catalysts, paving the way for broader applications and industrial&#8208;scale production.

         <title>Magnetically &#8220;Programming&#8221; Cobalt&#8208;Doped Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for Localized Induction Heating: Triggering a Collective Effect of Magnetic Moment Alignment on Demand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates enhanced induction heating in cobalt&#8208;doped iron oxide nanoparticles via specific pre&#8208;magnetization, induced by the pre&#8208;alignment of magnetic moments. By correlating Co content with magnetic properties, the research highlights how magnetic pre&#8208;programming enables localized, on&#8208;demand debonding in composites. These findings offer future applications in industrial recycling, emphasizing the potential of a switchable magnetic memory in advanced systems.








Abstract
Induction heating, a contactless and efficient method for generating heat via alternating magnetic fields (AMFs), has evolved from simple thermal applications to precise process control in fields like catalysis, self&#8208;healing, and debonding. Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) play a key role as heat mediators, with heating properties adjustable via composition, size, and interactions. However, spatially precise heat control remains challenging. Current strategies rely on external AMF adjustments or material modifications, but lack an inherent mechanism to predefine which particles or regions will be activated for induction heating, limiting applicability in structured materials or complex environments. Here, it is shown that pre&#8208;magnetizing cobalt&#8208;doped iron oxide NPs with a static magnetic field irreversibly enhances their heating rates by up to a factor of 40. This process permanently alters their magnetic properties, enabling selective heating independent of AMF modulation. The extent of activation scales with cobalt content, introducing a material&#8208;intrinsic thermal switch. Furthermore, assembling these NPs into supraparticles facilitates integration into functional materials. By enabling spatially resolved and selective heat generation, this strategy advances the control of induction heating at the material level. It opens new possibilities for on&#8208;demand, pre&#8208;programmable, spatially resolved thermal activation in composite materials, smart adhesives, and targeted energy delivery in complex systems.

         <title>Innate Immunity&#8208;Guided Macrophage&#8208;Homing Nanoplatform for Oral Tumor Immunotherapy and Real&#8208;Time Deep&#8208;Tissue Imaging in Pre&#8208;Clinical Models</title>

         <dc:description>
An oral, innate immunity&#8208;guided tumor&#8208;homing nanoplatform leverages the migratory behavior of macrophages to target pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. It integrates a &#946;Glus&#8208;R848 prodrug for immunotherapy and Ag2Te quantum dots for NIR&#8208;II imaging. At the tumor site, &#946;Glus&#8208;R848 reprograms macrophages to enhance immune responses, reduce fibrosis, and improve treatment efficacy, while Ag2Te enables real&#8208;time deep&#8208;tissue imaging of tumor progression and metastasis.








Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis and a high propensity for liver metastasis. This study presents an innate immunity&#8208;guided, macrophage (M&#934;)&#8208;homing nanoplatform that enables oral delivery of theranostic agents to PDAC lesions by harnessing the migratory behavior of endogenous M&#934; toward tumor&#8208;derived immune cues. The nanoplatform integrates a &#946;Glus&#8208;R848 prodrug&#8212;constructed by conjugating &#946;&#8208;glucans (&#946;Glus) with the immunomodulator resiquimod (R848) via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive thioketal linker&#8212;and Ag2Te quantum dots (QDs) for near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) imaging, forming &#946;Glus&#8208;R848/Ag2Te nanoparticles (NPs). Upon oral administration, &#946;Glus facilitates the selective uptake of NPs by intestinal M&#934; (&#946;Glus&#8208;R848/Ag2Te NPs@M&#934;), which subsequently migrate to the tumor microenvironment (TME). There, elevated ROS levels trigger the release of R848, reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated M&#934; from an immunosuppressive M2 to an immunoactive M1 phenotype. This immune activation remodels the stroma, enhances T cell infiltration, and transforms the TME into an immunoactive state, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes. Concurrently, Ag2Te QDs enable deep&#8208;tissue NIR&#8208;II imaging for real&#8208;time visualization of PDAC progression, liver metastasis, and treatment response. Guided by innate immune signals, this M&#934;&#8208;homing theranostic platform offers a promising strategy to overcome current challenges in PDAC treatment by integrating targeted immunotherapy with noninvasive, real&#8208;time disease monitoring.

     alt="Innate Immunity-Guided Macrophage-Homing Nanoplatform for Oral Tumor Immunotherapy and Real-Time Deep-Tissue Imaging in Pre-Clinical Models"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An oral, innate immunity-guided tumor-homing nanoplatform leverages the migratory behavior of macrophages to target pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. It integrates a &#946;Glus-R848 prodrug for immunotherapy and Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te quantum dots for NIR-II imaging. At the tumor site, &#946;Glus-R848 reprograms macrophages to enhance immune responses, reduce fibrosis, and improve treatment efficacy, while Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te enables real-time deep-tissue imaging of tumor progression and metastasis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis and a high propensity for liver metastasis. This study presents an innate immunity-guided, macrophage (M&#934;)-homing nanoplatform that enables oral delivery of theranostic agents to PDAC lesions by harnessing the migratory behavior of endogenous M&#934; toward tumor-derived immune cues. The nanoplatform integrates a &#946;Glus-R848 prodrug&#8212;constructed by conjugating &#946;-glucans (&#946;Glus) with the immunomodulator resiquimod (R848) via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive thioketal linker&#8212;and Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te quantum dots (QDs) for near-infrared II (NIR-II) imaging, forming &#946;Glus-R848/Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te nanoparticles (NPs). Upon oral administration, &#946;Glus facilitates the selective uptake of NPs by intestinal M&#934; (&#946;Glus-R848/Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te NPs@M&#934;), which subsequently migrate to the tumor microenvironment (TME). There, elevated ROS levels trigger the release of R848, reprogramming tumor-associated M&#934; from an immunosuppressive M2 to an immunoactive M1 phenotype. This immune activation remodels the stroma, enhances T cell infiltration, and transforms the TME into an immunoactive state, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes. Concurrently, Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te QDs enable deep-tissue NIR-II imaging for real-time visualization of PDAC progression, liver metastasis, and treatment response. Guided by innate immune signals, this M&#934;-homing theranostic platform offers a promising strategy to overcome current challenges in PDAC treatment by integrating targeted immunotherapy with noninvasive, real-time disease monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Synergy Between In Situ Gradient Polymerization and Phase Separation Enables Practical Solid&#8208;State Ni&#8208;Rich Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A gradient&#8208;polymerized solid polymer electrolyte with petaloid phase separation is developed via in situ polymerization. It delivers high ionic conductivity (1.5 &#215; 10&#8315;3 S cm&#8315;1) and excellent cathode compatibility, enabling high&#8208;performance full cells for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy, safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional safety property. However, most of the previously reported SPEs cannot well match with high&#8208;loading and high&#8208;voltage cathodes due to their low ionic conductivity and limited anodic stability. Herein, a SPE with superior compatibility with high&#8208;loading Ni&#8208;rich cathodes is generated by in situ gradient polymerization of a deep eutectic electrolyte. Besides, a polymerization&#8208;induced petaloid phase separation structure enhances interfacial ion transport, resulting in a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1. As a result, the as&#8208;assembled high&#8208;loading (19.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) NCM811||graphite full battery exhibites a high capacity retention of 85.3% after 200 cycles and outstanding rate performance (1 C). Industrial 1.2 Ah NCM811||SiOx pouch cell demonstrates unprecefented energy density of 382&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Moreover, this SPE also exhibits significantly enhanced safety characteristics, delaying the onset temperature of heat release from 157&#160;&#176;C to 266&#160;&#176;C and thermal runaway temperature from 198&#160;&#176;C to 312&#160;&#176;C. This study provides a general and practical avenue to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <dc:description>
Platinum&#8208;free hydrogen photocatalysis is achieved using dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;sulfoxide&#8208;based conjugated polymers, self&#8208;assembled into nanoparticles via nanoprecipitation. Through side chain engineering and donor&#8211;acceptor design, these materials reach a hydrogen evolution rate of 209 mmol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;. The structure&#8211;function insights presented here establish rational design principles for efficient, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable organic photocatalysts.








Abstract
While the interest in hydrogen photocatalysis from organic semiconductors is rapidly growing, there is a necessity to achieve hydrogen production without platinum (Pt), considering its price, availability and toxicity. In this work, this is demonstrated that high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiencies can be achieved without the use of Pt. A series of low&#8208;cost conjugated polymers are designed around the dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;sulfoxide (BTSO) unit, and self&#8208;assembled as nanoparticles in water via the nanoprecipitation technique. This is highlighted that how side chain engineering, nanoparticle morphology and pH influence the hydrogen evolution rate. Optoelectronic properties are improved through a Donor&#8208;Acceptor structure, resulting in an unprecedented hydrogen evolution reaction rate of 209&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the absence of Pt. A clear correlation between high efficiencies and number of BTSO units within the polymer backbone can be established. The design rules pioneer the design of future organic materials is presented for a cost&#8208;efficient and sustainable hydrogen photocatalysis.

         <title>Topological Transformation of MXenes to Non&#8208;Van Der Waals Artificial Solids with Well&#8208;Defined Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined non&#8208;van der Waals artificial solid is produced based on the topological transformation of Cl&#8208;terminated MXenes by substitution with &#8208;S terminations and subsequent configuration with transition&#8208;metal atoms. The resultant non&#8208;van der Waals artificial solids disclose a good structural stability, high catalytic activity, and superior adsorption capability toward iodine species, delivering good rate capabilities and cyclic stability in Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides (MXenes) have become an ideal platform to produce some derivatives with tunable chemical compositions and structures, possessing unique physical and chemical properties beyond their counterparts. Here, a well&#8208;defined non&#8208;van der Waals artificial solid is developed on the basis of the topological transformation of Cl&#8208;terminated MXenes, which involves the substitution of &#8208;Cl with &#8208;S terminations to enlarge the interlayer spacing of MXenes and subsequent configuration with transition&#8208;metal (Cu, Fe, Co, Ni, and Sn) atoms. After the topological transformation, the MXene layers are chemically bonded, showing a higher thermal stability up to 550&#160;&#176;C in air than that of MXenes. The resultant artificial solids with well&#8208;defined atomic metal layers exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity to I2/I&#8722; redox reaction and a strong adsorption capability toward iodine species. As a result, Zn&#8208;I2 batteries deliver a good rate performance of 104 mAh g&#8722;1 at 32 C and a long cycling stability of up to 2000 cycles at 8 C.

         <title>Ultrastrong Negative Thermal Expansion Compositionally Complex Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative thermal expansion materials, crucial for crafting metallic composites with temperature&#8208;invariance volume, face big challenges&#8212;need to not only maintain large negative thermal expansion over wide temperature range, but also harness strength and ductility. This work reports a Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Ti compositionally complex alloy that meets these challenges, where nanoscale local chemical ordering dominates displacive transformation kinetics, giving rise to tunable macroscopic performances.








Abstract
Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials, which are crucial for fabricating strong metallic composites with temperature&#8208;invariant volumes, face significant challenges: they not only need to maintain a large thermal expansion over a wide temperature range but also need to harness strength and ductility for load&#8208;bearing applications. Unfortunately, most of these materials are brittle (compressive strength &lt; 1&#160;GPa), while the few ductile materials available have a narrow temperature range and significant thermal hysteresis. Herein, a compositionally complex Fe&#8211;Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Ti alloy is reported exhibiting an excellent combination of large NTE over a wide temperature range with narrow thermal hysteresis, high compressive strength, and modest ductility. This unusual set of properties stems from the unique microstructure of the alloy, in which the matrix phase enables a unique kinetically sluggish thermoelastic martensitic transformation with a pronounced volumetric change, while the mechanically hard secondary phases contribute to the strengthening effect. An ultrahigh strength of up to 2.64&#160;GPa could be achieved by manipulating the nanoscale local chemical ordering, accompanied by tunable thermal expansion behavior. This study opens a new design strategy for high&#8208;performance functional materials.

&lt;p&gt;Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials, which are crucial for fabricating strong metallic composites with temperature-invariant volumes, face significant challenges: they not only need to maintain a large thermal expansion over a wide temperature range but also need to harness strength and ductility for load-bearing applications. Unfortunately, most of these materials are brittle (compressive strength &amp;lt; 1&#160;GPa), while the few ductile materials available have a narrow temperature range and significant thermal hysteresis. Herein, a compositionally complex Fe&#8211;Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Ti alloy is reported exhibiting an excellent combination of large NTE over a wide temperature range with narrow thermal hysteresis, high compressive strength, and modest ductility. This unusual set of properties stems from the unique microstructure of the alloy, in which the matrix phase enables a unique kinetically sluggish thermoelastic martensitic transformation with a pronounced volumetric change, while the mechanically hard secondary phases contribute to the strengthening effect. An ultrahigh strength of up to 2.64&#160;GPa could be achieved by manipulating the nanoscale local chemical ordering, accompanied by tunable thermal expansion behavior. This study opens a new design strategy for high-performance functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amorphizing Iron Molybdate as a High&#8208;Capacity Cathode for Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Multiple Insertion Reactions in the Metastable Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amorphizing iron molybdate (a&#8208;FMO) with its transition mechanism and electrochemical performance are elaborately revealed. Unlocking both the Fe3+/Fe2+ and Mo6+/Mo4+ redox insertion reactions in metastable structure, a&#8208;FMO endows a high&#8208;capacity of 254 mAh g&#8722;1cathode (231.6 mAh g&#8722;1cathode+anode in the full&#8208;cell) at room temperature and the superior cycling resilience at low temperature (&#8722;30 &#176;C).








Abstract
The rising energy demand for electric vehicles and energy storage has revived interest in lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, present LMBs still mainly rely on conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathodes (e.g., LiFePO4 and LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2) with limited reversible capacity (&#8776;150 to &#8776;190 mAh g&#8722;1cathode), necessitating the paradigm to achieve a new host with abundant Li+ accommodation sites. Herein, it is proposed a high&#8208;capacity amorphizing iron molybdate cathode a&#8208;Fe2(MoO4)3 (a&#8208;FMO), which can reversibly unlock Fe3+/Fe2+ and Mo6+/Mo4+ redox insertion reactions in the metastable structure. Different from its parent crystal and stoichiometric oxides mixtures, a&#8208;FMO, with its inherent metastable structure, can not only augment the lithium storage capacities with fully activated redox centers, but also attenuate the lattice confinements for Li+ ion migration. Consequently, the in&#8208;situ generated a&#8208;FMO electrode exhibited a notable reversible capacity of 254 mAh g&#8722;1 with stable cycling over 500 cycles. It endowed a specific energy density of 597 Wh kg&#8722;1 and all&#8208;climate adaptability over 60 to &#8208;40 &#176;C benefited from the amorphizing nature, as well as negligible capacity degradation when cycling at &#8208;30 &#176;C. The identification of local structure evolutions and multiple&#8208;redox activations in amorphizing materials broadens the scope for designing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Deficient Chain&#8208;Like Molecular Structure Confined Hydride Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Porous hydrogen&#8208;deficient LiNBH are designed for in situ space&#8208;confining LiBH4, which enables strong attraction of negatively charged H&#948;&#8722; atoms of [BH4]&#8722; anions by Li+ of LiNBH that weakens Coulombic interaction between Li+ and [BH4]&#8722; anions and hence promotes Li ion diffusion.








Abstract
The practical application of LiBH4 in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) is hindered by low Li&#8208;ion conductivity at room temperature, poor oxidative stability, and severe dendrite growth. Herein, porous [LiNBH]n with a hydrogen&#8208;deficient chain&#8208;like molecular structure are designed for in situ space&#8208;confining LiBH4, which enables strong attraction of negatively charged H&#948;&#8722; atoms of [BH4]&#8722; anions by Li+ of [LiNBH]n chains that weakens Coulombic interaction between Li+ and [BH4]&#8722; anions and hence promotes Li ion diffusion. Additionally, the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of [LiNBH]n chains induces the local electron localization of LiBH4 that enhances oxidative stability of LiBH4. Therefore, the Li ion conductivity of LiBH4 reaches 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C, nearly 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of LiBH4, with a voltage window of 5&#160;V. Moreover, the interaction between Li metal and [LiNBH]n chains results in in situ formation of ultrathin layer composed of Li3N and LiB alloys that hinders Li dendrites growth, leading to a critical current density value of 7.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a cycling life of 100&#160;h at 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with an overpotential of 125&#160;mV. Hence, LiCoO2|LiBH4&#8208;70LiNBH|Li cell at 0.5 C deliver a high capacity of 89.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles.

         <title>Highly Reversible Zn Anode by Ion Flux Regulation and Micro&#8208;Corrosion Zone Division</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>

The limited reversibility of Zn anodes remains a key challenge impeding the practical development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Although numerous strategies&#8212;such as solvation&#8208;regulating additives and water&#8208;blocking surface coatings&#8212;are explored, they often face inherent limitations. In this work, a novel additive, ZnABL, synthesized via keto&#8208;enol isomerization, is introduced. ZnABL exhibits strong adsorption on the zinc surface and function through dual mechanisms: regulating Zn ion flux and spatially isolating micro&#8208;corrosion zones to mitigate zinc anode corrosion, finally improving the Zn anode reversibility. The method introduced in this paper offers valuable insights for the future design of high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are receiving continuous attention as candidates for the next generation batteries, but the poor reversibility of the Zn anode limits their further development. In recent years, researchers are obsessed with modifying the surface of the Zn anode and adjusting the solvation structure of Zn2+ to address these challenges. Here, we propose a novel strategy to improve the reversibility of the Zn anode by simultaneously regulating the Zn ion flux and dividing micro&#8208;corrosion zones on the Zn anode surface, thereby manipulating the deposition behavior of Zn2+ and relieving the corrosion of the Zn anode. This approach exploits the keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of &#945;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (ABL) to develop a specifically designed additive: Zn2+ coordinated &#945;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone complex (ZnABL). With this innovative additive, the Zn anodes show excellent reversibility: Zn||Zn symmetric cell achieves a long cycle life of 7780&#160;h (&#8776;11 months). Furthermore, the Zn||Zn0.25V2O5&#183;H2O near&#8208;ampere&#8208;hour pouch cell, featuring a high areal capacity of 7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2, achieved an energy density of 106.17&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and sustained more than 350 cycles. The success of ZnABL in modulating the Zn ion flux and compartmentalizing the micro&#8208;corrosion zone provides a novel option for the reversibility improvement of Zn anodes.

         <title>Nonreciprocal Spin Waves in Nanoscale Hybrid N&#233;el&#8211;Bloch&#8211;N&#233;el Domain Walls Detected by Scanning X&#8208;Ray Microscopy in Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropic Fe/Gd Multilayers</title>

         <dc:description>
Using scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy, nonreciprocal spin&#8208;wave behavior is revealed in real space in Fe/Gd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, highlighting their functionality for magnonic logic circuits operating at GHz frequencies. Topological defects disrupt phase continuity while preserving nonreciprocity, demonstrating the potential of these domain walls as programmable magnonic waveguides for directed information flow.








Abstract
Spin wave nonreciprocity is crucial for signal processing in magnonic circuits. Domain walls (DWs) have been suggested as channels for nonreciprocal spin waves (magnons) with directional&#8208;dependent properties. However, the experimental investigations are challenging due to the low&#8208;damping magnetic material with DWs demanded and the nanoscale length scales involved. In this study, scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM) is used to examine coherently&#8208;excited magnons when propagating in hybrid N&#233;el&#8208;Bloch&#8208;N&#233;el DWs in amorphous Fe/Gd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Well&#8208;ordered lattices of stripe domains and DWs are created through the integration of Cobalt nanowire arrays. Their width is measured to be &#948;DW = (60 &#177; 13) nm. Near 1 GHz magnons are detected with short wavelengths down to &#955; = (281 &#177; 44)&#160;nm which were&#160;channeled in the DWs. Consistent with micromagnetic simulations, the STXM data revealed a nonreciprocal magnon band structure inside the DWs. Bloch points are identified which disrupted the phase evolution of magnons and induced different &#955; adjacent to these topological defects. These observations provide direct evidence of nonreciprocal spin waves within hybrid N&#233;el&#8211;Bloch&#8211;N&#233;el DWs in PMA materials, serving as programmable waveguides in magnonic devices with directed information&#160;flow.

         <title>Achieving Abnormal Evaporation Behavior Using Melanin/Cellulose&#8208;Based Solar Evaporators via Salt Ion Enrichment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a bilayer aerogel with salt ion enrichment, demonstrating exceptional water management and photothermal performance. The aerogel exhibits a higher evaporation rate in high&#8208;salinity brines than in pure water, mitigating performance degradation from salt deposition and hydration effects in seawater desalination. Additionally, it exhibits excellent versatility and long lifetime, offering a viable solution for large&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation technology has emerged as a promising solution for seawater desalination, offering a potential remedy to the global water crisis. However, its widespread application is hindered by reduced performance in high&#8208;salinity brines and limited evaporator lifetimes. Inspired by natural melanins, amino acid&#8208;doped poly(norepinephrine) nanoparticles (PNE NPs) are developed as photothermal materials, encapsulated in a cellulose&#8208;based aerogel to form a 3D bilayer porous structure with salt ion enrichment effects. The interaction between the enriched ions in the aerogel weakens the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, reducing evaporation enthalpy and enhancing evaporation rates. Under one sun illumination, the evaporator achieves an evaporation rate of 4.06&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 in high&#8208;concentration saline, surpassing the rate in pure water (3.51&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1), with the rate increasing further as salt concentration rises. Notably, even the blank control group without photothermal materials shows an evaporation rate of 1.70&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, demonstrating the aerogel's strong intrinsic evaporation performance. The aerogel maintains its performance over five months of immersion in water without significant degradation. This low&#8208;cost, cellulose&#8208;based aerogel offers a promising solution to the issue of evaporation performance degradation in high&#8208;salinity brines, making large&#8208;scale solar desalination a feasible and effective option.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Spatiotemporal&#8208;Resolved Proton Management by Harnessing Merocyanine&#8208;Integrated Hydrogels as Regenerative Photoacid Matrices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merocyanine photoacids are covalently integrated into hydrophilic polymer networks to develop regenerative photoacid matrices with excellent pH&#8208;switching performance retention through multiple regeneration cycles. This gelation strategy not only overcomes inherent solubility limitations and enhances their alkaline tolerance of conventional PAGs, but also enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled, shape&#8208;dependent proton release kinetics governed by diffusion.








Abstract
Photomanipulation of the environmental pH plays a crucial role in modulating the reaction kinetics and engineering material functionalities. While conventional merocyanine photoacids offer pH modulability, their practical implementation is fundamentally constrained by aqueous dissolution and laborious regeneration. Here, a transformative strategy is reported through the covalent integration of merocyanine photoacids into hydrophilic polymer networks to construct regenerative photoacid matrices, which stably retain protons in the dark and spatiotemporally liberate them upon illumination. The photoacid matrix overcomes solubility constraints through adjustable merocyanine grafting density while simultaneously enhancing alkaline stability, thereby enabling shape&#8208;governed, diffusion&#8208;controlled proton release kinetics. The universality of this approach has been extensively verified in multiple polymer matrices with variable chemical compositions. Upon straightforward separation and acidic regeneration in the dark, the recovered matrices sustainably maintain robust photoactivated proton release capability. This not only enables programmable control over acid&#8211;base indicator discoloration but also guides hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of arylazopyrazole&#8208;based hydrogelators, yielding 3D supramolecular gel architectures with tailored complexity. Furthermore, spatially controlled directional proton liberation are established through synergistically addressing negative phototropic deformation within a low&#8208;density crosslinked photoacid matrix. This work creates a new paradigm for spatiotemporal pH manipulation in the development of autonomous materials through regenerative photoacid matrices.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Like&#8208;Phase Confined Interfacial Polymerization: A Universal Platform for the Controlled 2D Growth of COP Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphic abstract illustrates a solid&#8208;like&#8208;phase confined interfacial polymerization (SLCIP) mechanism, which modulates substrate hydration, solvent density, and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions to localize Tp monomers at the substrate surface. This SLCIP strategy stabilizes the reaction interface, enabling confined 2D polymerization of the COP membrane within a restricted zone, ensuring controlled membrane growth and enhanced separation performance.








Abstract
The scalable manufacturing of high&#8208;performance covalent organic framework/polymer (COF/COP) membranes faces persistent challenges due to interfacial instability in conventional liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial polymerization (LLIP). Here, a transformative solid&#8208;like&#8208;phase confined interfacial polymerization (SLCIP) strategy is developed that synergizes substrate hydration&#8208;induced confinement and functionalization&#8208;enabled monomer anchoring for synthesizing ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COP membranes. By orchestrating the hydration barrier and solvent density modulation at functionalized substrates, SLCIP converts the dynamic liquid&#8211;liquid interface into a stable solid&#8210;like phase confined interface. This interfacial confinement engineering enables the ambient synthesis of unique ultrathin COP membranes (&lt;40&#160;nm) via confined 2D reaction zones (1.2&#160;nm thickness via MD simulations). The resulting membranes achieve a record water permeance (161 L m&#8315;2 h&#8315;&#185; bar&#8315;&#185;, 3.7&#8208;fold enhancement over LLIP), with &gt;98.8% Congo red rejection. Systematic implementation across three solvent systems and five structurally diverse amine monomers demonstrates the universality and chemical adaptability of SLCIP. Industrial scalability is validated through pilot&#8208;scale fabrication of A4&#8208;sized membranes with &lt;5% spatial performance deviation. This work establishes an ambient&#8208;processable interfacial engineering paradigm, offering a sustainable platform for next&#8208;generation molecular separation technologies.

         <title>Unleashing the Power of Magnetic Particle Imaging: Tailored Magnetic Nanoparticles for Ultrasensitive Detection of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer</title>

A temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy is developed to optimize the magnetic diameter of magnetic nanoparticles for enhanced magnetic particle imaging. The resultant Fe310P exhibits an eight&#8208;fold increase in MPI signal intensity compared to the commercial tracer. Subsequent functionalization with engineered macrophage membranes yields Fe3104PMgy&#8208;1, enabling ultrasensitive detection of prostate tumors and bone metastases as small as 0.5&#160;mm in diameter.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a groundbreaking imaging technique hindered by suboptimal tracers, as current magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are primarily designed for magnetic resonance imaging and are not specifically tailored for the distinct physics of MPI. To address this issue, optimizing the magnetic diameter of MNPs is focused on, a pivotal parameter influenced by both physical size and magnetic disorder, yet underexplored in the development of MPI tracers. By employing a precise temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy, this study successfully modulates these parameters synergistically to create high&#8208;performance Fe310P with an optimal magnetic diameter, exhibiting an eight&#8208;fold increase in the MPI signal in vitro compared to the commercial tracer VivoTrax. Further surface functionalization with engineered macrophage membranes expressing a prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA)&#8208;targeting antibody fragment (gy&#8208;1) yields tumor&#8208;targeted Fe3104PMgy&#8208;1, which enables the detection of as few as 800 tumor cells with a single scan, without the need for repeated acquisitions. Compared to VivoTrax, Fe3104PMgy&#8208;1 achieves a 330&#8208;fold enhancement in the MPI signal in vivo, which enables the sensitive detection of prostate tumors and bone metastasis with 0.5&#160;mm in diameter. This study provides valuable insights into the development of advanced MPI tracers, paving the way for broader biomedical applications of MPI.

         <title>Unveiling the Mutual Promotion Mechanism of Adjacent Vacancy Defects Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the mutual promotion of adjacent cation and anion vacancies in perovskite, and further develops a passivation strategy to synchronously passivate perovskite defects using a new additive of 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine. The PSCs with active areas of 0.08 and 1 cm2 achieve champion PCEs of 26.28% and 24.71%, retaining 93% efficiency after 1700 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination.








Abstract
The perovskite defect evolution directly impacts the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, the mutual promotion mechanism of adjacent cation and anion vacancies in perovskite is unveiled, which means the cation/anion vacancy induces the adjacent anion/cation vacancy through decreasing the formation energy. This mutual promotion mechanism provides an explanation for the dynamic evolution of defects, and emphasizes the necessity of simultaneously passivating of adjacent defects. Accordingly, a new additive of 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine is utilized to passivate adjacent defects, considering its adjacent electron&#8208;rich N atom, which can chemically bond uncoordinated Pb, and the hydrazine group, which can anchor FA+ through hydrogen bonds. Besides, this 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine also optimizes the perovskite crystallization through accelerating nucleation and slowing crystal growth, demonstrated by the in situ photoluminescence spectra. The resulting inverted 0.08 cm2 and 1 cm2 PSCs obtain PCEs of 26.28% and 24.71%, respectively. Moreover, the Target device shows enhanced stability by maintaining 93% and 90% of the initial efficiency after operating 1700 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination and being exposed to harsh thermal cycling for 150 times, respectively.

         <title>Mechanically Robust and Ion&#8208;Conductive Polyampholyte Elastomers via Dimeric Ionic Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new class of polyampholyte ionic elastomers balancing both high mechanical strength and ionic conductivity by utilizing a novel precipitation method to create ionic dimers. The resulting elastomers exhibited strong mechanical performance and excellent ion mobility, making them ideal for applications in flexible electronics, wearable devices, and energy storage systems, particularly solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
The development of ionic materials with high ionic conductivity and mechanical strength is challenging. This study presents a novel synthetic strategy for the development of a mechanically robust and ionically conductive polyampholyte elastomer based on ionic dimers (IDs) with strong ionic bonds between imidazolium and sulfonate. Polymerization of ID monomers with a network that forms a cross&#8208;linking moiety results in a novel polyampholyte ID elastomer (IDE). The addition of lithium (Li) salts in the IDE substantially enhances the ionic conductivity up to 0.82&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 with a high Li+ transference number (tLi&#8314;) of 0.79. The mechanical properties of the IDE with Li salts are remarkable, with a tensile strength of 27.4&#160;MPa and a Young's modulus of 211&#160;MPa, outperforming previous polyampholyte elastomers. A resistive&#8208;type iontronic sensor using the IDE exhibited excellent sensitivity (gauge factor&#160;=&#160;2.92) and reliable cycle performance (&#8776;400 cycles) under repetitive stress. The IDE serves as a polymer electrolyte in a pouch&#8208;type full cell, showing stable capacity at a high current density of 1.0 C (corresponding to 4.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) under ambient conditions (25&#160;&#176;C, 0.2&#160;MPa). This synthetic strategy offers a new approach for designing ionic materials with high conductivity and mechanical strength.

         <title>Achieving Ultrafast Monovalent ZnCl+ Ion Transport in MOF&#8208;Based Zn Ion Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte through Polyanion Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous MOF&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ionic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ZGBC) is developed through the polyanion strategy. Thanks to the ultrafast transport of monovalent ZnCl+ ion, the ZGBC achieves a high ionic conductivity of 5.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and a high ionic transference number of 0.873 at room temperature.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state transport of high&#8208;valence ions is a huge challenge, such as the transport of divalent zinc ions. Herein, a polyanion strategy is proposed to decrease divalent Zn2+ to monovalent ZnCl+, realizing ultrafast ion transport in solid&#8208;state electrolyte. An amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (ZGB&#8208;MOF) is designed and constructed as the matrix for solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The ZGB&#8208;MOF matrix is obtained by the Zn2+/Ga3+ competitive coordination process, enriching O&#8208;Ga&#8208;Cl polyanion clusters, nanopores and C&#9552;O/oxygen vacancies active sites. The polyanion property of Ga3+ and physical limiting domains of nanopores promote the formation of ZnCl+. Abundant C&#9552;O and oxygen vacancies provide more transport sites, decreasing transport energy barriers for ZnCl+ (only 0.12&#160;eV). Eventually, the obtained Zinc ion solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ZGBC) achieves high ionic conductivity of 5.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and high transference number of 0.873. More importantly, the ZGBC electrolyte exhibits wide electrochemical window (up to 2.88&#160;V) and high charging voltage (2.4&#160;V), and achieves dendrite&#8208;free deposition of Zn&#8208;metal and stabilization of cathode materials. Full cells with ZGBC electrolyte and zinc hexacyanoferrate cathode exhibit excellent cycling stability, with no capacity degradation after 5000 cycles. This discovery could trigger new waves of enthusiasm for exploring new ion transport mechanisms beyond divalent Zn2+ transport.

         <dc:description>
An integrative alternating&#8208;layered piezoelectronic nano&#8208;architecture has debuted, markedly enhancing ultrasound&#8208;driven catalytic efficiency and electron&#8208;storage capacity via robust electron confinement and heterojunction&#8208;mediated charge separation. Demonstrating catalytic and piezoelectric superiority over 29 benchmark nanocatalysts, this approach elevates microregional bio&#8208;responsiveness by amplifying atomic&#8208;level piezocatalytic mechanisms. These findings not only bridge catalysis with biomedical applications but also hold substantial promises for renewable energy conversion, environmental remediation, and advanced electron&#8208;transfer technologies.








Abstract
Recombination of sono&#8208;generated charge carriers is a major barrier hindering the effectiveness of piezocatalytic oncotherapy. Herein, ultrathin oxygen vacancy&#8208;engineered self&#8208;heterojunction bismuth oxysilicate (Ov&#8208;BOS) nanosheets with alternating hetero&#8208;layered nanostructure are constructed for enhanced sono&#8208;piezocatalytic tumor therapy. Benefiting from its out&#8208;of&#8208;plane asymmetry, Ov&#8208;BOS features an exceptional electromechanical strain coefficient (d*33 = 203 pm/V), highlighting its outstanding capability as a piezoelectric heterojunction for energy conversion. Particularly, the oxygen vacancy engineering facilitates the spatial redistribution of bands across the alternating [Bi2O2] and [SiO3] layers in Ov&#8208;BOS, promoting effective charge separation and stratified charge storage, thereby further suppressing recombination of sono&#8208;generated charge carriers in a manner analogous to heterojunctions. Leveraging this strategy, Ov&#8208;BOS demonstrates efficient reactive oxygen species production and exhibits superior peroxidase and catalase&#8208;like activities compared to the conventional piezoelectric nanocatalysts. Consequently, the enhanced radical generation induced the specific cancer&#8208;cell pyroptosis via caspase&#8208;3 mediated gasdermin E&#8208;dependent pathway. Therefore, the engineered interlayer self&#8208;heterojunction provides an efficient strategy for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance piezoelectric nanocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;An integrative alternating-layered piezoelectronic nano-architecture has debuted, markedly enhancing ultrasound-driven catalytic efficiency and electron-storage capacity via robust electron confinement and heterojunction-mediated charge separation.

         <title>Fibrous Pressure Sensor with Unique Resistance Increase under Partial Compression: Coaxial Wet&#8208;Spun TiO2/Graphene/Thermoplastic Polyurethane Multi&#8208;Wall Multifunctional Fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TGTMW fibers are designed to show a sharp resistance increase under pressure, as the multi&#8208;wall structure in the transition region between compressed and uncompressed areas bends and forms microcracks. This design breaks the physical sensitivity limit of conventional fiber&#8208;shaped pressure sensors, which usually show resistance reduction under pressure and are constrained by their series structure under partial compression.








Abstract
Fiber&#8208;shaped resistive pressure&#8208;sensitive sensors are rare. Although fibers are widely used in strain sensors owing to their structural advantages, developing fiber&#8208;shaped resistive pressure sensors is challenging. This challenge arises because the fiber acts as a series circuit along its axis, requiring increased resistance in the compressed region for a significant signal. Coaxial wet&#8208;spinning is used to create a multi&#8208;walled fiber. The outer layer, made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/TiO2 slurry, ensured a smooth surface, while the inner core, containing 4% graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), is extruded at 20&#160;mL&#160;h&#8722;1. Unlike conventional resistance&#8208;increasing pressure sensors, TGTMW fiber shows rising resistance under compression due to microcracks in its multi&#8208;wall structure. Its pressure sensitivity is evaluated using various 3D&#8208;printed indenters and showcasing its excellent performance. This sensor has found promising applications in remote motion detection, press or slide differentiation through wavelet transforms applied to high&#8208;speed sensing data, and real&#8208;time signal acquisition from a multi&#8208;channel sensing array. Additionally, intuitive visualization software is developed for the sensing array application and implemented a CNN&#8208;based machine learning algorithm for data analysis. The system achieved a recognition accuracy of &#8776;99.6% for 12 different compression modes. This work is believed to propose a new mechanism and design for fiber&#8208;based pressure sensors.

         <title>Interfacial Coordination Engineering to Boost Li&#8208;Ion Conduction in Economic Zr&#8208;Based Halide Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a coordination&#8208;driven amorphization strategy is employed to construct oxide&#8208;halide composite electrolytes by integrating Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) into Zr&#8208;based oxychlorides (LZCO). The resulting composite electrolyte delivers high ionic conductivity, improved oxidative stability, and excellent cycling performance in ASSLBs, offering a cost&#8208;effective and scalable route toward high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes (HSEs) have seen rapid progress in the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), offering favorable lithium&#8208;ion transport properties, broad electrochemical stability, and strong interfacial compatibility with high&#8208;voltage oxide cathodes. However, developing HSEs that simultaneously offer high ionic conductivity and low cost remains a significant challenge. Most high&#8208;conductivity halides rely on expensive metal elements, whereas cost&#8208;effective Zr&#8208;based halides are limited by their relatively low ionic conductivity. In this study, a new composite electrolyte (LA/LZCO) is developed via an interfacial coordination reaction between Zr&#8208;based oxychlorides (LZCO) and Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP). The coordination between PO43&#8722; groups in LATP and Zr4+ in LZCO induces local structural disorder, promoting LZCO amorphization. As a result, the ionic conductivity of LA/LZCO composite electrolyte is enhanced by more than twofold compared to LZCO, reaching 2.81 mS cm&#8722;1, among one of the highest reported for Zr&#8208;based halide electrolytes. When integrated into ASSLBs with NCM83125 cathodes, the composite electrolyte enables excellent cycling stability, with 92.4% and 87.5% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5 and 2 C under 4.25&#160;V. Even at an elevated cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#160;V, 85.1% capacity is retained after 380 cycles, highlighting the promise of this composite strategy for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;life ASSLBs.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolyte with Long&#8208;Range Ordering and Compact Molecular Packing as Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Efficient and Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of triphenylamine&#8208;based p&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) is designed and synthesized, exhibiting long&#8208;range molecular ordering and compact laminar packing, which enables efficient hole transport and suppresses charge recombination. When employed as hole&#8208;transporting layer, TMPT&#8208;F:PMA delivered over 19% photovoltaic efficiency in rigid OSCs and demonstrated excellent mechanical durability in flexible devices.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting layer (HTL) materials with a non&#8208;corrosive nature and good compatibility with flexible electrodes are highly desirable for advancing efficient and flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) exhibit intriguing advantages as HTLs, such as tunable properties and excellent solution processability, but they suffer from poor charge&#8208;transporting properties, resulting in inferior performance to traditional HTLs. Herein, a series of pH&#8208;neutral CPEs are designed and synthesized that can form enhanced crystalline and highly ordered films. By tailoring trifluoromethyl substituents on the triphenylamine unit, TMPT&#8208;F exhibited exceptional long&#8208;range molecular ordering and compact laminar packing, along with a crystalline coherence length of 2.56 nm and a laminar packing distance of 1.48 nm, ultimately yielding an unprecedented conductivity of 3.3 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S&#160;m&#8722;1 for the CPE&#8208;based HTL. The substantially enhanced charge&#8208;transporting property of the PMA&#8208;doped TMPT&#8208;F:PMA greatly suppressed the charge recombination in OSCs. The OSC modified by the TMPT&#8208;F:PMA HTL exhibited a PCE as high as 19.24%, which is superior to the PEDOT:PSS device. Moreover, TMPT&#8208;F:PMA showed excellent compatibility with flexible electrode, enabling a PCE of 16.52% for flexible OSC, and the device retained 83% of the initial PCE even after a 500&#8208;cycle bending at 5 mm radius.

         <title>Creep Localization Empowering High&#8208;Capacity Alloy Anodes for Durable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#8220;creep localization&#8221; strategy coupling a creep&#8208;susceptible In0.32Sn0.48Bi0.20 alloy anode with a titanium mesh having a high area moment of inertia is introduced. This approach effectively addresses electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation in ASSLBs under industrial conditions, enabling LiCoO2||Ti&#8208;InSnBi full&#8208;cells with exceptional energy densities exceeding 350 Wh kg&#8722;1, fast&#8208;charging capabilities up to 30.57 mA cm&#8722;2, and low stack pressures (3 MPa).








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity alloy anodes (Si, Al, and Sn) promise critical materials for developing high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, their implementation remains fundamentally constrained by severe interfacial stress, large volume changes, and high stack pressures. Here, a novel &#8220;creep localization&#8221; strategy is proposed to address these intrinsic limitations by coupling a creep&#8208;susceptible (InSn4)0.37&#183;(InBi)0.63 alloy anode with a titanium mesh possessing a high area moment of inertia. The investigations reveal a synergistic interface stabilization mechanism: InSnBi undergoes adaptive creep to maintain ionic&#8208;electronic interpenetrating networks, while the titanium framework, through its flexural rigidity, redistributes localized stress and prevents heterogeneous stress concentrations from driving InSnBi creep toward the cathode. This hierarchical stress management mechanism ensures stable cycling by accommodating substantial volume fluctuations, thereby enabling ASSLBs to realize stable cycling at high loading (23.05 mAh cm&#8722;2) and low stack pressures (3&#160;MPa), respectively. Remarkably, the as&#8208;assembled LiCoO2||InSnBi full&#8208;cell with a capacity of 5.56 mAh cm&#8722;2 maintains a retention of 81.6% over 3000 cycles at a 2C rate. This work presents a new paradigm for addressing the electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical coupling degradation of ASSLBs, representing a milestone advancement for developing high&#8208;energy ASSLBs.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficient Hot&#8208;Exciton Emission from Carbon Quantum Gear Rack</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electroluminescent LED fabricated using DB&#8208;CQG exhibits deep&#8208;blue emission with good color purity, chromaticity coordinates of (0.158, 0.048), a maximum luminance of 4560 cd m&#8722;2, and an EQE of 10.45%, which is aligned with the Rec. 2020 standard for the primary blue color.








Abstract
The quest for exemplary color purity, superior efficiency, and nontoxic deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence remains paramount for developing wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut displays. However, achieving a Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage y value below 0.05, an exceptional external quantum efficiency (EQE), and a low&#8208;efficiency droop in deep&#8208;blue emitters presents a significant challenge. Here, the study reports a deep&#8208;blue emitting carbon quantum gear rack (DB&#8208;CQG) characterized by an emission wavelength of 406 nm and a high quantum yield of 80%. DB&#8208;CQG comprises nine benzene rings and four embedded nitrogen&#8208;centered tripods and exhibits a quasi&#8208;planar configuration that leads to hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited&#8208;state characteristics. Both experimental investigations and theoretical calculations revealed the activation of the reverse intersystem crossing channel between the high&#8208;lying triplet state and lowest excited singlet state in DB&#8208;CQG via hot&#8208;exciton mechanism. DB&#8208;CQG exhibits characteristic HLCT behavior with deep&#8208;blue emission owing to the partial overlap of holes and electrons, which is facilitated by the formation of nitrogen&#8208;centered tripods in the quasi&#8208;planar configuration. The electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) fabricated using DB&#8208;CQG exhibit a deep&#8208;blue color with chromaticity coordinates of (0.158, 0.048), a maximum luminance of 4560 cd m&#8722;2, and an EQE of 10.45%, which is one of the highest reported efficiencies for solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue LEDs.

         <title>Spatial Control of Chiral Self&#8208;Assembly and Lithographic Applications in Liquid Crystal Polymer Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a strategy to spatially control supramolecular chirality by leveraging spontaneous twist self&#8208;assembly in liquid crystal materials. It is generated by periodic zigzag line defects that define alternating enantiomeric domains, stabilized by a polymer network. This approach enables precise defect engineering, tunable chirality, and functional applications in lithographic particle manipulation and reconfigurable microstructured surfaces.








Abstract
Precise spatial organization of enantiomeric domains within self&#8208;assembled materials remains a challenge despite advances in controlling supramolecular chirality. Here, it is presented a facile strategy for directing supramolecular chirality through spontaneous twist self&#8208;assembly in liquid crystal (LC) materials, generating periodic zigzag line defects that define alternating enantiomeric domains. An LC polymer network stabilizes zigzag line defects, preserving their spatial organization and mechanical integrity. Focused circular dichroism spectroscopy and computational simulations confirm the controlled enantiomeric distribution. It explores interfacial chiral interactions and shows how boundary regions between enantiomeric domains can manipulate microparticle position. Additionally, it is shown that kink density and orientation of the zigzag structure can be modulated by adjusting sample thickness, applied voltage, and electrode configurations, resulting in tunable periodicity and macroscopic direction. The findings provide a robust approach for fabricating chiral domains through soft&#8208;material&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Invoking Hybrid&#8208;Ion Correlation Electrochemistry to Enable Optimal Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach that combines phase&#8208;field simulations and thermodynamic calculations is proposed, capturing ionic correlations in electrolytes/electrodes to activate the ionic electrodeposition (left) and (de)intercalation (right) performances in a hybrid&#8208;ion battery. This offers a potent approach to exceed the energy density and cycle life benchmarks set by single&#8208;ion battery technologies.








Abstract
As a generation beyond conventional batteries based on mono&#8208;/poly&#8208;valent ions, hybrid&#8208;ion batteries (HIBs) offer more opportunities to build battery prototypes because they utilize the merits of multiple ions. However, the limited understanding of ionic correlations in these heterogeneous systems experimentally and theoretically brings a great challenge in exploring their performance limits. Here, an approach is proposed combining electrochemical phase&#8208;field simulation with thermodynamic calculation, where ionic correlation in the electrolyte and electrode is addressed using the linearized Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann equation embedded with Debye&#8208;H&#252;ckel theory and ion&#8208;occupied sub&#8208;lattice model, to invoke the ionic electrodeposition and (de)intercalation advantages. This approach is independent of specific HIB electrolytes or electrodes. A &#8220;Seesaw&#8208;Inhibition&#8221; mechanism is uncovered, operating under hybrid&#8208;ion concentration regulation to determine the electrodeposition morphology in three types of HIBs, and simultaneously predict a general ion competitive behavior during their intercalation. Following this, a prototype of Na3V2(PO4)3||1&#160;M NaTfO+1&#160;M Zn(TfO)2||Zn aqueous HIB is built, surpassing pure Zn&#8208;ion batteries by 32% in measured energy density (128.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and exhibiting low capacity decay (0.10% per cycle over 300 cycles). The scalability of the approach for regulating hybrid&#8208;ion electrochemistry demonstrates its practical viability for designing HIBs.

         <title>Trace Dual&#8208;Crosslinkable Additives Enable Direct Microlithography for Enhanced Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution patterning is crucial for advancing organic electronics, enabling miniaturization and high&#8208;density integration. A dual crosslinking strategy is developed using a polyrotaxane supramolecular crosslinker (PR) in polybenzodifurandione (PBFDO). At trace loading levels (&lt;0.1 wt%), PR enhances patterning precision (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m) and electrical performance, yielding a 42% &#181;C* increase and improved device stability, offering scalable solutions for organic electronics.








Abstract
Similar to silicon&#8208;based electronics, the implementation of micro/nano&#8208;patterning to facilitate complex device architectures and high&#8208;density integration is crucial to the development of organic electronics. Among various patterning techniques, direct microlithography (DML) is highly applicable and extensively adopted in organic electronics, such as organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). However, conventional DML often requires high crosslinker concentrations, leading to compromised electrical performance. To address this challenge, a novel strategy is developed that combines supramolecular and covalent interactions by incorporating a polyrotaxane supramolecular crosslinker (PR) into poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO). The PR forms a hydrogen bonding network with PBFDO and undergoes UV&#8208;triggered covalent crosslinking among its molecules, providing solvent resistance even at trace loading levels (&lt;0.1 wt%). This approach enables precise patterning of PBFDO with feature sizes below 1&#160;&#181;m while preserving high electrical performance. Notably, PR also serves as a performance enhancer, promoting molecular ordering and ionic conduction within PBFDO. OECTs fabricated with PR&#8208;crosslinked PBFDO exhibit about one&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in ON/OFF ratio, a 42% increase in &#181;C* (reaching 2460&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), and elevated operational stability compared to pristine ones. This multifunctional crosslinker offers a scalable solution for high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;density organic electronics and opens new avenues for supramolecular chemistry applications in this field.

         <title>Standalone Integrated Magnonic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A standalone (not requiring external bias magnetic field) and tunable magnonic device is reported with all&#8208;electric input and output, fully integrated on silicon (total footprint of 100 &#215; 150&#160;&#181;m) and 3&#8211;8&#160;GHz frequency band. This is achieved by monolithic integration of a CoFeB conduit with RF antennas and an assembly of NiFe and SmCo micromagnets providing a tunable bias field.








Abstract
In the race toward &#8220;beyond 6G&#8221; telecommunication platforms, magnonics emerges as a promising solution. To date, however, the requirement for bulky external sources of the magnetic bias field necessary for spin wave propagation has constituted a significant bottleneck, impeding the integration of magnonic devices into RF systems. Here, the first demonstration is presented of a standalone and tunable magnonic device featuring all&#8208;electric input and output, fully integrated on a silicon substrate, with a compact footprint of 100 &#215; 150 &#181;m2. The device consists of a CoFeB waveguide equipped with two radio frequency antennas, flanked by a symmetric configuration of magnetic flux concentrators and SmCo permanent micromagnets. By varying the distance D between the flux concentrators and the permanent magnets from 0 to 12&#160;&#181;m, the transverse bias field can be tuned from 20.5 to 11 mT, respectively. This variation directly modulates the dispersion relation of Damon&#8208;Eshbach spin wave modes in the CoFeB waveguide. In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept devices, the spin wave frequency band ranges from 3 to 8&#160;GHz, with precise tuning of the phase shift up to 120&#160;deg at 6&#160;GHz. The operational frequency band can be easily pushed to higher frequencies through micromagnet engineering.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Dielectric&#8208;Layer&#8208;Based Iontronic Pressure Sensor Coupling Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Wide&#8208;Range Detection for Temperature/Pressure Dual&#8208;Mode Sensing</title>

A dual&#8208;dielectric&#8208;layer iontronic pressure sensor (DLIPS) is developed using silkworm cocoon ion gel and PU foam, enabling stepwise EDL formation and enhanced ion migration. This versatile strategy synergizes high/low&#8208;permittivity layers with porous architecture, adaptable to diverse material systems, achieving ultrahigh sensitivity and wide&#8208;range sensing. Coupled with machine learning, DLIPS realizes temperature/pressure dual&#8208;mode sensing and silent speech recognition.








Abstract
Iontronic pressure sensors are widely used in human motion monitoring and human&#8211;machine interactions owing to their high sensitivity, wide measurement range, and excellent resolution. However, conventional dielectric layer designs often involve complex fabrication processes, high costs, and limited performances. This paper proposes a novel sensor structure, the dual&#8208;dielectric&#8208;layer iontronic pressure sensor (DLIPS), which integrates high&#8208; and low&#8208;permittivity layers. Validated using silkworm cocoon ion gel and open&#8208;cell polyurethane foam as dielectrics, the DLIPS exhibited ultrahigh sensitivity (72548.7 kPa&#8722;1), a wide working pressure range (0.001&#8211;420 kPa), an exceptionally low detection limit (0.832 Pa), and remarkable durability exceeding 5000 cycles. By leveraging the distinct responses of the capacitance and resistance to pressure and temperature, the sensor can simultaneously measure both parameters. A deep learning regression model is integrated to decouple the mixed temperature and pressure signals, enabling accurate identification. Owing to its ultrahigh sensitivity and capability to detect minute pressure fluctuations, the DLIPS exhibited strong potential for skin&#8208;mounted silent speech recognition systems, achieving a recognition accuracy of up to 98.5%. Furthermore, the DLIPS provides a cost&#8208;effective and scalable approach for fabricating ultrahigh&#8208;sensitivity pressure sensors, underscoring its versatility in wearable technology applications.

         <title>Halogen Ion&#8208;Mediated Hydrothermal Synthesis of Diverse MXenes with Tailored Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen ion&#8208;mediated strategy is proposed for the controllable preparation of diverse MXenes and their heterostructures with well&#8208;defined interfacial architectures. NH4F etchant enables potential high&#8208;throughput synthesis of Mo2CTx, while NH4X &#8208;intercalant (X = Cl, Br, I) combinations facilitate large&#8208;scale production of hetero&#8208;Mo2CTx. This moderate hydrothermal strategy achieves precise structural control on a variety of MXenes and hetero&#8208;MXenes.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional physicochemical properties. Despite extensive studies, efficient methods for the production of MXenes with precise structural control still remain a challenge, thus hindering their potential in many specific applications. Herein, a halogen ion&#8208;mediated hydrothermal approach is proposed for the controllable preparation of diverse MXenes and their heterostructures with well&#8208;defined interfacial architectures, demonstrating its potential as a high&#8208;throughput synthesis strategy. As proof of concept, Mo2C can be synthesized on a gram scale by employing NH&#8324;F in the hydrothermal etching process of Mo2Ga2C. Subsequently, this approach is applied to various MXenes, including Ti3C2, V2C, and Nb4C3. Moreover, NH4X (X = Cl, Br, I) etchants combined with small&#8208;molecule intercalants enabled the targeted synthesis of MXene&#8208;based heterostructures, such as Mo2CTx@MoS2 featuring &#8776;15&#160;nm amorphous MoS2 surface layers. Notable, the Mo2CTx(Br) heterostructure exhibited outstanding electrochemical stability, delivering a capacity of 465.5 mAh g&#8315;&#185; after 300 cycles at 1 A g&#8315;&#185;, and achieving high coulombic efficiency of 99.8% during lithium&#8208;ion battery cycling. This work establishes a versatile and scalable platform for the synthesis of MXene&#8208;based materials, thus paving the way for accelerating their potential in various fields.

         <title>Constructing Continuously&#8208;Distributed and Crystalline&#8208;NaF&#8208;Rich SEI on Hard Carbon Anode Through Binder Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

An innovative, continuously crystalline NaF&#8208;rich SEI is engineered on hard carbon anodes through cost&#8208;effective binder manipulation. The anion&#8208;coordination preferred LA133's functional groups synergistically promoting anion decomposition kinetics to form crystalline NaF, and homogenous LA133 coverage guides continuous NaF growth. The optimized hard carbon anodes deliver excellent storage performances regarding initial Columbic efficiency, rate capability, cycling stability, and wide temperature adaptability.








Abstract
Constructing the continuously&#8208;distributed and crystalline&#8208;NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI) is expected to greatly promote the sodium storage performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes. However, such an impressive concept remains extremely intractable to achieve and lacks an efficiently cost&#8208;less strategy. Herein, the application of the commercially available LA133 binder is pioneered to engineer such a CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI. Through comparative analysis of representative binders with distinct functional groups, reveals the critical role of binder chemistry on SEI regulation. Specifically, the LA133 binder demonstrates a dual&#8208;regulation mechanism for CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI formation. The anion&#8208;coordination preferred &#9472;CN bonds induce an anion&#8208;enriched interfacial solvation structure, and the &#9472;CONH/&#9472;CN groups catalytically cleave P&#9472;F bond dissociation in PF6&#8722;, synergistically promoting anion decomposition kinetics to form crystalline NaF. Furthermore, robust hydrogen bonds between multiple polar groups in LA133 and HC surface create the spatially anion&#8208;confined microenvironments to guide orderly anion decomposition and facilitate continuous NaF growth into a mechanically integrated SEI. The optimized CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI endows HC anodes with exceptional sodium storage performance: an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (95.9%), remarkable reversible capacity (356.6 mAh g&#8722;1), and stable cycling under extreme conditions (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C). This work provides fundamental insights into binder&#8208;SEI correlations, establishing a novel paradigm for interfacial optimization in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Synchronous Phase Transformation for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DMI is selected to partially replace DMSO. A homogeneous DMI&#8208;PbX2 adducted intermediate phase can be stably formed at spin&#8208;coating stage, and the synchronous phase transformation from the intermediate phase to the perovskite phase occurs at the annealing stage. Thus, a low&#8208;defect and homogeneous halide&#8208;phase WBG perovskite film is obtained. As a result, the DMI&#8208;treated wide bandgap PSCs exhibits an improved PCE and stability.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halogen wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite materials are employed in tandem solar cells (TSCs) due to their continuous tunability of bandgap. However, inhomogeneous halogen phases are often observed in bromine&#8208;rich perovskite films, which restricts the performance of WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and TSCs. Here, homogeneous halogen&#8208;phase perovskite is proposed to form film by a synchronous halogen&#8208;phase transformation strategy. 1,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinone (DMI) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution, due to its stronger binding energy with lead halide (PbX2). The homogeneous DMI&#8208;PbX2 adducted intermediate phase is stable in precursor solution and at spin&#8208;coating stage. And it then synchronously transforms into a homogeneous halide&#8208;phase perovskite film at the annealing stage. Benefited from efficient carrier extraction and suppressed carrier recombination, the resulting 1.76 eV&#8208;bandgap PSC achieves a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.42% (certified 21.18%) among devices with a bandgap wider than 1.74 eV. Based on the high transmittance of semitransparent&#8208;WBG PSC, a 4&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSC achieves a PCE of 29.66%.

         <title>Programmable Surface Dimpling of Textile Metamaterials for Aerodynamic Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Static aerodynamic surfaces are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to dynamic velocity profiles or environmental changes, restricting their performance. Here, a stretched&#8208;induced auxetic dimpling textile that tunes surface roughness while tightly fitted is presented.

Abstract
Static aerodynamic surfaces are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to dynamic velocity profiles or environmental changes, restricting their performance under variable operating conditions. This challenge is particularly pronounced in high&#8208;speed competitive sports, such as cycling and downhill skiing, where the properties of a static textile surface are mismatched with highly dynamic wind&#8208;speed profiles. Here, an textile metamaterial is introduced that is capable of variable aerodynamic profiles through a stretch&#8208;induced dimpling mechanism, even when tightly conformed to a body or object. Wind&#8208;tunnel experiments are used to characterize the variable aerodynamic performance of the dimpling mechanism, while Finite Element (FE) simulations efficiently characterize the design space to identify optimal textile metamaterial architectures. By controlling dimple size, the aerodynamic performance of the textile can be tailored for specific wind&#8208;speed ranges, resulting in an ability to modulate drag force at target wind&#8208;speeds by up to 20%. Furthermore, the potential for active control of a textiles' aerodynamic properties is demonstrated, in which controlled stretching allows the textile to sustain optimal performance across a dynamic wind&#8208;speed profile. These findings establish a new approach to aerodynamic metamaterials, with surface dimpling and thus variable fluid&#8208;dynamic properties offering transformative applications for wearables, as well as broader opportunities for aerospace, maritime, and civil engineering&#160;systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency All&#8208;Antimony Chalcogenide Tandem Solar Cells via Thermal&#8208;Evaporated CdS Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing thermal evaporation to prepare high&#8208;quality CdS electron transport layers, this study achieves 7.46% PCE in a semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 device and 10.51% PCE in a 4T Sb2S3/Sb2Se3 tandem cell, surpassing the 10% efficiency limit for all antimony&#8208;based solar cells for the first time.








Abstract
Sb2S3, with an ideal bandgap of 1.7 eV, is a promising top&#8208;cell absorber for tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, CdS electron transport layers (ETLs) prepared via chemical bath deposition suffer from poor crystallinity and high roughness, inducing interfacial defects, parasitic absorption, and severe carrier recombination, which hinder device performance. To address these challenges, this study employs thermal evaporation (TE) to fabricate CdS ETLs for semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 solar cells. The TE&#8208;CdS films exhibit superior crystallinity, reduced roughness, and enhanced chemical purity. Sb2S3 films deposited on TE&#8208;CdS show preferential (hk1) orientation, improved crystallinity, optimized band alignment, and suppressed interfacial defects, facilitating efficient charge transport and light management. By incorporating a MoO3/ITO/Ag electrode, the semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.46%, the highest reported efficiency for semi&#8208;transparent Sb2S3 solar cells. Furthermore, a four&#8208;terminal (4T) TSC, formed by mechanically stacking Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 cells, attains the champion PCE of 10.51% for all&#8208;antimony chalcogenide&#8208;based TSCs. This study provides critical insights into ETL engineering for high&#8208;performance semi&#8208;transparent Sb&#8208;based solar cells and their tandem integration.

         <title>Giant Circularly Polarized Luminescence Driven by Excited&#8208;State Hybridization Between Molecular Emitters and Chiral Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamental chiroptical response amplification mechanism is revealed to massively enhance molecular helicene chiral emitters. The luminescent dissymmetry factor of the helicene emitter is amplified by 133 times through excited&#8208;state hybridization with a polymeric chiral environment. The amplification mechanism does not rely on a specific energy transfer process, therefore offering new paths for the design of chiral emissive systems.








Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) light is extensively used in various fields such as asymmetrical synthesis, sensing, and advanced displays. Consequently, significant efforts have been made to develop chiral materials that intrinsically emit CP light with a large dissymmetry factor (g&#8208;factor). It is widely considered that the dissymmetry factor for individual organic emitters, due to the amplitude offset between their electric and magnetic transition dipole moments, is limited to &#8776;10&#8722;2, which is inadequate for practical applications. Recent efforts to enhance CP light emission have therefore focused on amplifying the dissymmetry of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), often via specific energy transfer processes. Here, a fundamental mechanism is discovered &#8211; excited&#8208;state hybridization, which amplifies CPL through excitonic coupling without relying on energy transfer processes. Through this wavefunction hybridization, both the amplitude and sign of the rotatory strength related to the molecular emitter's electronic transition are modified to align with its chiral environment, remarkably boosting the CP luminescence from an intrinsic dissymmetry factor of &#8722;10&#8722;3 up to +0.40. This breakthrough allows for more versatile design strategies for chiral emissive systems, moving beyond designs limited to energy transfer processes and paving the way for new approaches to achieve strong CP emissive materials.

         <title>Fundamental Limits on the Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling and Superconducting Tc</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving room&#8208;temperature superconductivity is a major goal in condensed matter physics. This work shows that room&#8208;temperature superconductivity, at least when mediated by phonons, is possible only in hydrogen&#8208;rich compounds known as superhydrides. A central result is the identification of a fundamental upper limit to electron&#8208;phonon interactions beyond which a stable metallic state cannot be maintained.








Abstract
Fundamental upper bounds on the electron&#8208;phonon interaction strength and superconducting transition temperature Tc in metals are established based on the intrinsic instability of the equilibrium between electrons and the crystal lattice under strong interaction. This instability explains why observed electron&#8208;phonon coupling constants are limited to &#955; &#8818; 4. The theory also accounts for the mechanism of metastable superconductivity with enhanced Tc, which emerges near the instability threshold. Based on theoretical analysis and comparison with experimental data, room&#8208;temperature phonon&#8208;mediated superconductivity is found to be feasible exclusively in hydrogen&#160;compounds.

         <title>Robust Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered Co(OH)2/Cu Heterostructures Boost Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia beyond 2 A cm&#8722;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ electrochemical reconstruction strategy is proposed to engineer robust oxygen vacancy&#8208;enriched Co(OH)2/Cu heterostructures, which boosts hydrogen supply and reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting *NO2 to *NOOH step via oxygen vacancy incorporation, thereby enabling high&#8208;current&#8208;density, scalable, and practical NH3 electrosynthesis. This work offers new insights into the rational design of electrocatalysts through in situ reconstruction&#8208;induced vacancy engineering for electrocatalytic systems.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) presents a sustainable paradigm for green NH3 synthesis and NO3&#8722; wastewater valorization. However, overcoming sluggish NO3RR kinetics under industrial&#8208;current operation persists as a critical challenge. Herein, robust oxygen vacancy&#8208;enriched heterostructures (Ov&#8208;Co(OH)2/Cu) are engineered through in situ electrochemical reconstruction. By coupling Cu&#8208;mediated NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; conversion with Ov&#8208;Co(OH)2&#8208;accelerated NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 transformation, this heterostructured system delivers an unprecedented NH3 yield rate of 167.8 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and 97.7% Faradaic efficiency at &gt;2 A cm&#8722;2, while maintaining exceptional current tolerance over 25 h. Operando spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Ov in Co(OH)2 synergistically accelerates water dissociation to ensure continuous hydrogen supply and optimizes *NOOH adsorption, reducing the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting step (*NO2 to *NOOH). To demonstrate practical viability, a membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly electrolyzer integrating NO3RR with glycerol oxidation reaction achieves highly effective co&#8208;production of NH3 and formate alongside wastewater treatment. This work offers new insights into the rational design of electrocatalysts through in situ reconstruction&#8208;induced vacancy engineering for scalable and practical NO3RR applications.

         <title>Bringing Attomolar Detection to the Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care with Nanopatterned DNA Origami Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single DNA molecules are captured within the hotspots of DNA origami NanoAntennas arranged on a chip surface. Fluorescence is amplified, enabling direct detection on a point&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8208;compatible imaging setup (visualized as bright signals against a dark background).








Abstract
Creating increasingly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective nucleic acid detection methods is critical for enhancing point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) applications. This requires highly specific capture of biomarkers and efficient transduction of capture events.&#160;However, the signal from biomarkers present at extremely low amounts often falls below the detection limit of typical fluorescence&#8208;based methods, necessitating molecular amplification. Here, we present single&#8208;molecule detection of a non&#8208;amplified,&#160;151&#8208;nucleotide sequence specific to antibiotics&#8208;resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae down to attomolar concentrations, using Trident NanoAntennas with Cleared HOtSpots (NACHOS). This NACHOS&#8208;diagnostics assay leverages a compact microscope with a large field&#8208;of&#8208;view, including microfluidic flow to enhance capturing efficiency. Fluorescence enhancement is provided by NanoAntennas, arranged using a combination of nanosphere lithography and site&#8208;specific DNA origami placement. This method can detect 200&#160;&#177; 50 out of 600 molecules in a 100&#160;&#181;L sample volume within an hour. This represents a typical number of pathogens in clinical samples commonly detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction. We achieve similar sensitivity in untreated human plasma, enhancing the practical applicability of the system. This platform can be adapted to detect shorter nucleic acid fragments that are not compatible with traditional amplification&#8208;based technologies. This provides a robust and scalable solution for sensitive nucleic acid detection in diverse clinical settings.

         <title>Reengineering Endogenous Targeting Lipid Nanoparticles (ENDO) for Systemic Delivery of mRNA to Pancreas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ENDO lipid nanoparticles containing cholecalciferol as a fifth component demonstrate mRNA delivery to the pancreas with 99% selectivity, including beta cells. This platform shows minimal toxicity and sustained protein expression for up to 3 days in a dose&#8208;dependent manner, offering a novel approach to pancreas&#8208;specific mRNA delivery and gene therapy that is suitable for repeat administration with clinical relevance.









Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) hold transformative potential for nucleic acid delivery, with applications ranging from clinical use, particularly in COVID&#8208;19 vaccines, to gene therapy and cancer immunotherapy. However, a major limitation lies in their preferential accumulation in the liver following intravenous administration, making most targets hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach. In this study, a novel platform called endogenous targeting lipid nanoparticles (ENDO), containing cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) as a fifth component is reported, that selectively delivers mRNA to the pancreas &#8211; a target previously inaccessible through intravenous administration. The top formulation, C&#8208;CholF3, demonstrates an unprecedented 99% pancreas selectivity with robust and sustained protein expression for up to 3 days in a dose&#8208;dependent manner with minimal toxicity that makes it suitable for repeat administration. This organ&#8208;specific delivery is proposed to be mediated by an endogenous targeting mechanism involving the Vitamin D receptor (VDR). C&#8208;CholF3 also enables selective pancreatic delivery of plasmid DNA and circular mRNA, underscoring its versatility and therapeutic potential. Furthermore, C&#8208;CholF3 exhibits pancreas&#8208;specific gene editing in the Ai14 transgenic mouse model, showing high expression of tdTomato in the &#946; cells. These findings highlight its potential for translational applications in protein replacement and CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated gene editing for currently incurable pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic cancer and diabetes.

         <title>Regulating Solvation Chemistries via Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Locally Concentrated Suspension Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal charged suspension electrolyte design strategy is proposed here, which tailors solvation structures and regulates deposition behaviors in Li metal batteries. Negatively charged additives, locally concentrated at the Li metal's surface under the internal electric field, alter the solvation chemistry by interacting with Li ions, resulting in fewer solvating solvent molecules and inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, as sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, are in great demand for powering modern society. Their energy density can further be significantly improved by using Li metal anodes; however, Li metal suffers from the critical challenges of unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) along with uncontrollable dendritic Li growth. Here, a universal electrolyte design principle is proposed and demonstrated by using suspension electrolytes with charged additives. The solvation structure of Li ions can be regulated, as negatively charged additives show strong electrostatic interaction with Li ions, leaving them weakly solvated in the electrolyte. Moreover, negatively charged additives carrying Li ions can be locally concentrated at the surface of the Li metal, enhancing their ability to regulate solvation and improve interfacial mobility, beneficial for the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs and compact Li deposition. Accordingly, Li||Li symmetric cell demonstrates &gt;500&#160;h stable cycling at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2, and Li||LiFePO4 cell shows 97% capacity retention after 400 cycles in 1C. The universality of this design is further demonstrated in various negatively charged suspension electrolyte systems. Such an electrolyte design rationale can shed light on the development of advanced electrolyte systems for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;duration metal battery systems.

         <title>Tailoring COFs with Water and Oxygen Pathways for Efficient Catalyst Interfaces in PEMFCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation and side&#8208;chain engineering created independent water&#8208;oxygen channels in COFs to boost mass transport. Using P&#8208;rCOF&#8208;C4 as a binder optimized these channels, greatly enhancing the Pt/C catalyst performance. This resulted in a marked increase in PEMFC peak power density, even with reduced platinum loading, highlighting the role of COFs in improving both catalyst efficiency and transport kinetics.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have gained significant attention due to their high efficiency and clean emissions. However, reducing platinum (Pt) loadings in PEMFCs remains challenging due to the high mass transport resistance near the catalyst surfaces. This study investigates phosphorylated covalent organic frameworks (P&#8208;rCOFs) as ionomers in PEMFCs, aiming to optimize the three&#8208;phase interface at the catalyst surface. Through the protonation of tertiary amine sites and precise structural engineering of side chains within the COF framework, well&#8208;defined transport channels are created to enhance water and oxygen mass transfer. The results demonstrate that P&#8208;rCOF&#8208;C4 significantly improves the catalytic performance of commercial Pt/C catalysts, with a half&#8208;wave potential 37&#160;mV higher than Nafion. Furthermore, a PEMFC incorporating P&#8208;rCOF&#8208;C4 as an ionomer binder achieves a peak power density of 2.40&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 0.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 catalyst loading, a 1.5 fold increase over Nafion. This work underscores the potential of P&#8208;rCOFs in optimizing the three&#8208;phase interface, offering a promising pathway for more efficient and cost&#8208;effective PEMFCs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Power and Robust Bi2SeO5 Films Optoelectronic Memristors for Bio&#8208;Visual Perception Computing Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a low&#8208;power, fast&#8208;response Bi&#8322;SeO&#8325; thin&#8208;film&#8208;based optoelectronic memristor with robust performance. Leveraging its dual&#8208;mode operation (photodetector/synaptic device at different wavelengths), a bio&#8208;inspired visual perception/computation system is developed, achieving &gt;160 kbit&#160;s&#8722;1 optical communication and hardware&#8208;based optical reservoir computing, offering an ultrafast, energy&#8208;efficient approach for enhanced bionic vision systems.








Abstract
Optoelectronic memristors have broad application prospects in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IOT) because they can dynamically process a large number of spatiotemporal optoelectronic signals in complex environments. However, it is still a challenge to develop optoelectronic memristors with low power consumption and fast response while maintaining the efficiency and robustness of the system. Here, a photoelectric memristor based on Bi2SeO5 thin film is proposed. This device has an ultra&#8208;fast resistance switching speed (&#8776;9.5&#160;ns) and ultra&#8208;low synaptic event power consumption (&#8776;1.36 fJ). The stable instantaneous light on/off response behavior within 4000 cycles and the very fast photoresponse speed (&#8776;28&#160;ns) also confirm the excellent applicability of the device as a photodetector. More importantly, a bionic visual perception and computing system is designed. The system not only uses devices as photodetectors to achieve wireless communication with a speed of more than 160&#160;kb s&#8722;1, but also uses the synaptic effect of devices under bias voltage to realize the optical reservoir computing (RC) network at the hardware level. The accuracy rate of digital recognition is 90.5%, which provides an ultra&#8208;fast and low&#8208;power method for developing widely used and performance enhanced bionic visual systems.

         <title>Anisotropic Excitation&#8208;Modulated Multi&#8208;Color Three&#8208;photon Excited Luminescence in Ln&#8208;MOF Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy toward realizing multi&#8208;photon excited luminescence (MPEL) modulation based on lanthanide metal&#8208;organic framework heterostructure has been developed through a novel hierarchical assembly&#8208;in situ doping method. The as&#8208;obtained heterostructure with wide MPEL color gamut and great up&#8208;conversion luminescent anisotropy is reported for the first time.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;photon excited luminescence (MPEL) modulation is of great application value for optoelectronics, especially MPEL with the characteristics of multi&#8208;color emission and optical anisotropy. However, it still suffers from the obstacles in highly&#8208;integrating and orientedly&#8208;assembly of various MPEL units. Herein, a hierarchical assembly&#8208;in situ doping strategy is proposed to establish a novel lanthanide&#8208;graded metal&#8208;organic framework based heterostructure. Well&#8208;designed ligand and Ln3+ ions are respectively selected as the MPEL energy donor and acceptor units (MEDU and MEAU). Through utilizing the effective energy transfer between them, the as&#8208;obtained triblock heterostructure displays multi&#8208;dimensional three&#8208;photon excited luminescence (3PEL) modulation, where the emission band and intensity can be switched by manipulating excited regions and excitation polarization based on a single pump source. This is attributed to the precise integration and orientation of photonic units. As a result, the heterostructure exhibits multi&#8208;color 3PEL with a record&#8208;high MPEL color gamut (&gt;30% of sRGB area) in MOFs and high degree of linear polarization values (max &#8776;88.6%). Such anisotropic 3PEL modulation shows promising potential in nonlinear optical switches, programmable logic gates, and multi&#8208;level optical barcodes. These findings open up an intriguing way to develop up&#8208;conversion luminescent materials with functions on demand toward photonic modulation.

         <title>Modulating Dynamic Deprotonation Evolution via Sacrificial Solvation Structure to Mitigate Zinc Electrochemical Corrosion and Cathodic Structure Deterioration for High&#8208;Stable Zinc&#8208;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mitigate proton&#8208;induced side reactions, a lean&#8208;water polymer electrolyte with distinctive sacrificial solvation structure is developed to suppressing zinc chemical self&#8208;discharge corrosion and electrochemical corrosion for high&#8208;stable Zinc&#8208;Vanadium batteries.








Abstract
Compared to the free water molecules induced chemical corrosion, the electrochemical corrosion arising from the structured water elicits more pronounced zinc anode degradation, result in the limited cycle lifespan, especially at low current densities. However, the interfacial degradation mechanism remains inadequately resolved. Herein, for the inhibition of proton&#8208;induced side reactions, a lean&#8208;water polymer electrolyte is developed through the chelation of carboxymethyl chitosan (CCS) with Zn2+ ions. In accordance with Fajans' rules, CCS with highly polar carboxylate and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing amino groups exhibits enhanced ionic polarizability, which forms distinctive solvation structures with reduced deprotonation energy. Such solvation structures demonstrate competitive advantages in interfacial deprotonation dynamics and minimize proton release to suppress electrochemical corrosion via sacrificial protection. Furthermore, the crosslinked framework induced by molecular crowding restricts free water mobility, thereby alleviating zinc chemical corrosion and cathodic structure deterioration. By employing advanced MRI technology, the movement trajectories of water molecules and the dynamic deprotonation evolution process are directly visualized. Therefore, the cyclically rested Zn symmetric cell impressively operates 4000&#160;h at low current density of 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the Zn||NH4VO full cell exhibits 81% capacity retention after cycling over 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, while the aqueous electrolyte only maintains 31%.

         <title>Element&#8208;Engineered Lithium Borate for High&#8208;Efficiency Prelithiation in Silicon&#8208;Based Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel prelithiation agent, lithium borate (LBO), is proposed and synthesized based on the non&#8208;metallic element boron (B), which is ultralight, inexpensive, and free of d&#8208;orbitals. LBO exhibits an excellent initial charge specific capacity of 692 mAh g&#8315;&#185;, combined with cost&#8208;effectiveness, outstanding air stability, and strong potential for industrial application.








Abstract
Enhancing the energy density&#160;of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) remains a critical challenge for advancing next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. Silicon&#8208;based anodes offer significantly higher theoretical capacitites, but their practical application is hindered by low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), leading to substantial lithium loss and rapid full cell performance degradation. Herein, a novel prelithiation agent, lithium borate (LBO), based on the ultralight, cost&#8208;effective, and d&#8208;orbital&#8208;free non&#8208;metallic element boron (B) is presented. LBO features a core&#8211;shell architecture, consisting of a crystalline Li3BO3 core encapsulated by Li2CO3 and amorphous carbon, delivering an exceptional initial charge capacity of 692 mAh g&#8722;1 and superior atmospheric stability with 70% capacity retention after 8 days of ambient exposure. When applied in SiOx||LRLO (Li&#8208;rich layered oxide) pouch cells, LBO enhances the gravimetric and volumetric energy density by 14.7% and 21.8%, respectively, while effectively suppressing the irreversible LRLO degradation caused by Li deficiency. This work introduces an element&#8208;centric design methodology for prelithiation agents, providing a promising route to propel the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.

         <title>Thermochromic Gires&#8208;Tournois Resonators with Tellurium for Battery Thermal Runaway Warning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermochromic Gires&#8208;Tournois (GT) resonator with a thin tellurium layer enables rapid, reversible, and untethered detection of battery surface temperature &lt;80 &#176;C. Exploiting tellurium's refractive index change driven by a thermally induced phase transition between solid and quasi&#8208;liquid states, the GT resonator visualizes heat propagation, providing an effective early warning system against battery thermal runaway.








Abstract
Effective temperature monitoring is crucial for preventing battery fires caused by thermal runaway, ensuring human safety, and providing timely warnings. While thermochromic materials offer intuitive, real&#8208;time temperature visualization, their slow response times remain them unsuitable for battery monitoring. A thermochromic Gires&#8208;Tournois (GT) resonator specifically designed for rapid and accurate battery temperature detection in the critical range below 80 &#176;C is introduced, where thermal runaway risks can be effectively mitigated. Central to this design is an ultrathin (10&#160;nm) thermo&#8208;responsive tellurium film, paired with a protective glass layer and an underlying metallic mirror. This thermochromic GT resonator exhibits reversible temperature detection over multiple cycles, actively responding to temperature changes through partial melting of tellurium, which alters its complex refractive index&#8212;a property discovered in the 1960s but now harnessed for this novel application. Notably, the resonator monitors both specific temperature points and overall heat transfer across the battery surface, achieving sub&#8208;second response times in an untethered manner. These findings position the thermochromic GT resonator as a promising platform for direct, intuitive, and compact temperature monitoring in energy storage systems.

         <title>Exploring Anionic Redox Chemistry of Battery Cathodes with Resonant Inelastic X&#8208;Ray Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 40, October 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering is a crucial technique for energy storage and energy sustainability due to its superior resolution and uniqueness for studying the anionic redox in cathode materials. This Perspective presents the powerful edges of RIXS as well as its promising capabilities such as imaging and in situ options that further advance the development of battery research.








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity and reversible cathodes are important for sustainable energy development. Layered oxides present promising options, achieving a high capacity while maintaining manageable production costs. Despite the redox activity of transition metal primarily contributes to the capacity, anionic redox offers additional potential, as evidenced by the subtle voltage plateau at high voltage. However, challenges remain, particularly concerning the reversibility of anionic redox, resulting in voltage fade, hysteresis, and the formation of undesired oxygen species. Resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering (RIXS) captures not only the charge transfer processes between oxygen ligands and transition metals but also the formation of molecular oxygen, elucidating the chemical transformations of oxygen during electrochemical cycles. Mapping capability allows for the generation of spectral patterns with quantitative measures that surpass those achievable by other characterization techniques. Though early reports on its advantages, a comprehensive discussion of RIXS and its perspectives on anionic redox processes in cathode materials remains absent but necessary. This perspective aims to provide a systematic overview of RIXS, emphasizing its unique contributions to cathode material research. It also serves as a valuable reference for energy researchers and RIXS practitioners, featuring the advancements and future possibilities of this powerful technique.

Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) captures not only the charge transfer processes between oxygen ligands and transition metals but also the formation of molecular oxygen, elucidating the chemical transformations of oxygen during electrochemical cycles. Mapping capability allows for the generation of spectral patterns with quantitative measures that surpass those achievable by other characterization techniques. Though early reports on its advantages, a comprehensive discussion of RIXS and its perspectives on anionic redox processes in cathode materials remains absent but necessary. This perspective aims to provide a systematic overview of RIXS, emphasizing its unique contributions to cathode material research. It also serves as a valuable reference for energy researchers and RIXS practitioners, featuring the advancements and future possibilities of this powerful technique.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Metal Halides toward Circularly Polarized Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral metal halides have emerged as promising chiral semiconductors for direct circularly polarized light detection due to their combined intrinsic chiral properties and photoelectric properties. This review spotlights key advances in chiral metal halides toward circularly polarized photodetectors, covering novel mechanisms, material design, device innovations, and emerging applications, while also discussing challenges and future directions.








Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) photodetection has become a cornerstone technology in advancing fields such as quantum communication, biomedical imaging, and secure optical encryption. Conventional CP photodetectors relying on external optical components face challenges in miniaturization and efficiency, driving the exploration of chiral&#8208;sensitive materials for direct polarization discrimination. Among these, chiral metal halides have emerged as a revolutionary platform due to their intrinsic spin&#8208;orbit coupling, structurally tailorable chirality, and solution processability, enabling unprecedented photocurrent dissymmetry factors and broad absorption wavelengths. This review comprehensively examines the fundamental principles, material innovations, and device engineering strategies underpinning chiral metal halide&#8208;based CP photodetectors. Furthermore, representative applications of chiral metal halide&#8208;based CP photodetectors exploiting their emergent properties in high&#8208;precision circular polarization imaging, dynamic information encryption and bionic neuromorphic perception are examined. Finally, persisting challenges and future research directions are outlined for chiral metal halide&#8208;based CP photodetectors.

         <title>Polymerized Melamine Catalyzes Direct I&#8722;/I2 Conversion via &#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472; Motif for HighCapacity Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a catalytic cathode of in situ electropolymerized melamine (MA) deposited onto activated carbon (AC), denoted as pMA@AC, for high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;I2 batteries is developed. Specifically, pMA tightly binds iodine species via &#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472; sites to significantly improve iodine storage ability and conversion efficiency. Moreover, extensive delocalized &#960; electron cloud within flexible PMA chains effectively accelerates charge transfer to catalyze direct I&#8722;/I2 conversion without polyiodide formation. Therefore, catalytic pMA@AC endows electrolytic Zn&#8208;I2 battery with a high capacity of 1.55 mAh cm&#8722;2 and ultra&#8208;long lifespan over 20&#160;000 cycles, achieving a 440&#160;mAh pouch cell with 183 Wh kg&#8722;1. Contributing to the pMA&#8208;iodine synergistic effect, a highly efficient I&#8722;/I2/I+ reaction is further investigated to construct a four&#8208;electron Zn&#8208;I2 battery with high capacity (410 mAh g&#8722;1) and durability over 10&#160;000 cycles, highlighting the potential of azo compounds in advanced Zn&#8208;halogen batteries.








Abstract
To fundamentally solve low iodine conversion efficiency and severe polyiodide shuttling, a high&#8208;performance catalytic organic cathode is developed by in situ polymerizing melamine (MA) on activated carbon (denoted as pMA@AC) for high&#8208;capacity Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. The pMA@AC cathode exhibits a high capacity of 1.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;long lifespan over 20&#160;000 cycles, benefiting the stable pouch cell with 440 mAh and 183 Wh kg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. In/ex situ characterizations coupled with theoretical calculations demonstrate that polymelamine (pMA) catalyzed efficient I&#8722;/I2 conversion, suppressing polyiodide formation and avoiding consequent shuttling for high Coulombic efficiency and enhanced lifespan. The high catalytic activity of pMA is attributed to the delocalized &#960; electron cloud on &#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472; sites, which connect to electron&#8208;withdrawing triazine groups, with weaker physicochemical adsorption to I&#8722;/I2 than traditional carbon&#8208;based catalysts. It thus boosts the formation/desorption of resultant I2 molecules at higher potential for enhanced cycling stability. More importantly, pMA@AC exhibits robust catalytic ability for four&#8208;electron I&#8722;/I0/I+ chemistry with 405 mAh g&#8722;1 and 10&#160;000 cycles, further strengthening the potential application of such azo compounds for advanced Zn&#8208;halogen batteries.

         <title>Reproducible Pressure&#8208;Sensitive Fluorescence Switch for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We observed a reversible low&#8208;pressure&#8208;induced quenching (RLPCQ) effect in Cs3MnBr5 nanocrystals (NCs). This phenomenon allowed the photoluminescence (PL) of patterned films to be dimmed and restored through manual pressing and release. Additionally, localized force application induced site&#8208;specific PL quenching, enabling pressure distribution visualization. Furthermore, Morse code hidden beneath a green substrate could became legible upon compression.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;responsive smart materials with rapid response capabilities are promising candidates for sensing and information security. Here, a reversibly operable photoluminescence&#160;on&#8208;off switch activated by external pressure is first achieved in metal halide Cs3MnBr5&#160;nanocrystals (NCs). The triggered pressure is as low as 0.43&#160;GPa that can be easily accessible through manual squeeze. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal&#160;that the approaching [MnBr4] tetrahedral units with off&#8208;centering distortion facilitate cross&#8208;relaxation,&#160;energy migration and trap states activation, ultimately quenching the luminescence. Meanwhile, the all&#8208;inorganic and rigid framework of Cs3MnBr5&#160;NCs contributes significantly to their stability after undergoing pressure cycles. Such reversible low&#8208;pressure&#8208;caused quenching (RLPCQ) enables the photoluminescence (PL)&#160;decay of butterfly patterns created with Cs3MnBr5&#160;NCs to undergo darkening and recovery in response to manual pressing and release. Through the introduction of softer materials, a slight force applied at a specific point can induce a localized PL to monitor the pressure gradient within the film fabricated from Cs3MnBr5&#160;NCs. Furthermore, Morse code information carried by Cs3MnBr5&#160;NCs can remain concealed beneath a green luminescent substrate under normal pressure, but will become distinctly visible when subjected to artificial pressing. The work represents a significant breakthrough to intelligent materials design for applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, pressure alarm, and information encryption.

         <title>Shear&#8208;Catalyzed Vacancy Engineering Enabling Rapid Synthesis of High&#8208;Crystallinity Magnetite via Microfluidic Ferrous Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an innovative strategy is proposed that induces atomic defects in the intermediate phase through microfluidic shear forces, thereby significantly accelerating the rapid synthesis of high&#8208;crystallinity magnetite. As a result, the synthesis time of magnetite via conventional ferrous oxidation is reduced to just 30 min, demonstrating unprecedented efficiency and exceptional performance.








Abstract
Iron oxides are widely used in environmental and energy applications, with magnetite particularly favored for its excellent crystallinity and strong magnetic properties. However, synthesizing well&#8208;crystalline magnetite typically requires long reaction times due to the slow phase transition kinetics of goethite. Herein, a shear&#8208;catalyzed strategy in microchannels is proposed for the rapid and continuous synthesis of magnetite with excellent crystallinity. The preparation process is completed in just 30&#160;min, a 292&#8208;fold enhancement over batch reactors, which achieve 68.6 wt.% magnetite after 100&#160;h. Additionally, the resulting magnetite shows a significantly higher saturation magnetization of 59.5 emu&#160;g&#8722;1, compared to 48.4 emu&#160;g&#8722;1 from conventional batch reactors. The results demonstrate that Fe vacancies can be induced on goethite by shear stress in microchannels during magnetite nucleation, which not only creates more active sites for Fe2&#8314; adsorption but also significantly lowers Fe2+ diffusion barrier, thereby facilitating the transformation from goethite to magnetite by reducing the energy barrier for Fe2&#8314; migration. Additionally, the applicability is confirmed by the successful rapid synthesis of other oxide nanomaterials (SiO2, MnO2, and ZnO), demonstrating its versatility.

     alt="Shear-Catalyzed Vacancy Engineering Enabling Rapid Synthesis of High-Crystallinity Magnetite via Microfluidic Ferrous Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, an innovative strategy is proposed that induces atomic defects in the intermediate phase through microfluidic shear forces, thereby significantly accelerating the rapid synthesis of high-crystallinity magnetite. As a result, the synthesis time of magnetite via conventional ferrous oxidation is reduced to just 30 min, demonstrating unprecedented efficiency and exceptional performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron oxides are widely used in environmental and energy applications, with magnetite particularly favored for its excellent crystallinity and strong magnetic properties. However, synthesizing well-crystalline magnetite typically requires long reaction times due to the slow phase transition kinetics of goethite. Herein, a shear-catalyzed strategy in microchannels is proposed for the rapid and continuous synthesis of magnetite with excellent crystallinity. The preparation process is completed in just 30&#160;min, a 292-fold enhancement over batch reactors, which achieve 68.6 wt.% magnetite after 100&#160;h. Additionally, the resulting magnetite shows a significantly higher saturation magnetization of 59.5 emu&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, compared to 48.4 emu&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; from conventional batch reactors. The results demonstrate that Fe vacancies can be induced on goethite by shear stress in microchannels during magnetite nucleation, which not only creates more active sites for Fe&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; adsorption but also significantly lowers Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion barrier, thereby facilitating the transformation from goethite to magnetite by reducing the energy barrier for Fe&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; migration. Additionally, the applicability is confirmed by the successful rapid synthesis of other oxide nanomaterials (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ZnO), demonstrating its versatility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Active Learning&#8208;Guided Accelerated Discovery of Ultra&#8208;Efficient High&#8208;Entropy Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active learning framework is introduced for the accelerated discovery of high&#8208;entropy chalcogenides with superior thermoelectric performance. Only 80 targeted syntheses, selected from 16206 possible combinations, led to three high&#8208;performance compositions, demonstrating the remarkable efficiency of data&#8208;driven guidance in experimental materials design.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys are emerging as highly efficient thermoelectrics, but their vast compositional spaces hinder efficient material discovery using conventional heuristics&#8208;based and advanced machine learning approaches. Here, this fundamental challenge is addressed by demonstrating an active learning framework that leverages sparse experimental data (80 out of 16206) to efficiently identify three new high&#8208;entropy chalcogenides (HECs) with remarkable thermoelectric performance (zT &gt;2). By integrating physics&#8208;informed descriptors with uncertainty&#8208;aware sampling, this model efficiently assimilates latent structure&#8211;property relationships. This allows for systematic exclusion of unfavorable chemistries, enabling even non&#8208;experts in thermoelectrics to design unexplored systems with arbitrary components. Furthermore, novel atomic arrangements and distinctive electron and phonon transport properties are uncovered, which are responsible for the superior performance in HECs, advancing the understanding of physical phenomena in disorder&#8208;rich systems.

         <title>Thermally Drawn Multifunctional All&#8208;Hydrogel Fibers for Anti&#8208;Fibrotic and Multimodal Neural Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels demonstrate material properties that mimic the mechanical and chemical environments of biological tissues. Yet, they face challenges during their integration into 3D interfaces. By identifying a class of thermoplastic hydrogels, a strategy is developed to pattern hydrogels in thermally drawn fibers. Composed of functional hydrogels, these fibers act as a platform for multimodal interfacing and antifibrotic interaction with neural tissue.








Abstract
Hydrogels have emerged as promising materials for anti&#8208;fibrotic neural interfaces due to their mechanical and chemical similarity to biological tissue. However, their use in multimodal platforms remains limited, owing to fabrication challenges in microstructuring multiple functional hydrogels into compact architectures. Here, a hydrogel thermal drawing process (HG&#8208;TDP) is presented that enables the co&#8208;fabrication of multiple thermoplastically deformable hydrogels into a single, compact, and multifunctional fiber. By optimizing key process parameters, all&#8208;hydrogel neural interfaces are developed that minimize gliosis through tissue&#8208;like mechanical compliance and enable post&#8208;implantation anti&#8208;inflammatory drug delivery via the hydrogel&#8208;based matrix. These fibers feature the compact integration of diverse hydrogel components, including a step&#8208;index optical waveguide, an electrically conductive hydrogel electrode, and a hydrogel&#8208;based microfluidic channel within a unified fiber structure. This integration enables multimodal neural interfacing, as demonstrated by high&#8208;quality neural signal recording, optogenetic stimulation, and localized chemical modulation of neural circuits. This work offers a scalable route toward compact, fully hydrogel&#8208;based neural interfaces that combine multimodal functionality with tissue&#8208;friendly, anti&#8208;fibrotic properties.

         <title>Stable and Efficient Pure&#8208;Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;functional graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are proposed to address the critical issues of compositional heterogeneity and ion migration in mixed&#8208;halide perovskites for highly efficient and consistently stable pure&#8208;red emission.








Abstract
The bromine/iodine mixed halide perovskites have been extensively employed for pure&#8208;red emission. However, the issues of compositional heterogeneity and halide ion migration result in impure emission and compromised stability and efficiency for the perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Herein, a novel approach is proposed by incorporating multi&#8208;functional graphene quantum dots (GQDs) into the perovskites to address these critical problems. The new principles of composition reconstruction, perovskite phase isolation, and halide ion immobilization are revealed to address the unique and synergistic role of GQDs in achieving homogeneous perovskite films and suppressing halide ion migration, and clarify the formation of strong coordination and hydrogen bonding interaction between GQDs and the perovskites. As a result, high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;red PeLEDs that showcase a fantastic efficiency of 27.9% with a narrow emission at 640&#160;nm and a remarkable lifetime of 110.3&#160;h with consistently stable EL spectra during tests, representing one of the best&#8208;performing pure&#8208;red PeLEDs, are demonstrated. This strategy contributes an effective approach to solve the critical concerns in mixed&#8208;halide perovskites for stable and efficient pure&#8208;red PeLEDs for the community.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Driven Atomic Precision in Advanced Oxidation for Pollution Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines advances in metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;derived single&#8208;atom catalysts for advanced oxidation processes. It highlights atomic&#8208;level strategies&#8212;unsaturated metal centers, tailored organic linkers, and hierarchical confinement&#8212;along with synthesis methods such as heteroatom doping and atomization. Integrating density functional theory, molecular dynamics, and machine learning, it also considers sustainability through life cycle and techno&#8208;economic analyses. This framework guides the design of efficient, durable, and scalable catalysts for environmental applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks provide programmable platforms for designing heterogeneous catalysts with atomic precision. By serving as precursors for single&#8208;atom catalysts, they enable maximized metal utilization and finely tuned coordination environments that are highly effective for advanced oxidation processes targeting aqueous organic pollutants. This review evaluates three central strategies that govern catalytic performance: engineering coordinatively unsaturated metal centers, tailoring organic linkers to stabilize reactive sites, and exploiting hierarchical pore confinement to regulate mass transfer. Emerging synthesis methods, including heteroatom doping and atomization, are assessed for their capacities to improve stability and pathway selectivity. From the comparative analysis of recent studies, several key findings emerge: atomic dispersion allows efficient regulation of radical and non&#8208;radical oxidation channels, electronic modulation strengthens interfacial charge transfer, and pore confinement enhances both pollutant accessibility and resistance to deactivation. Beyond material design, the integration of computational modeling, experimental validation, and sustainability assessments&#8212;such as life cycle and techno&#8208;economic analysis&#8212;provides a holistic framework for bridging fundamental mechanisms with engineering feasibility. The review concludes by outlining remaining challenges in redox stability, scalability, and environmental robustness, offering guidance for the development of efficient, durable, and sustainable catalysts for next&#8208;generation water treatment technologies.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Resolved Orbital Hall Effect in a Topological Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;space mapping of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transport is achieved using contact&#8208;free polarimetric terahertz spectroscopy. This principle is applied to the topological semimetal Td&#8208;WTe2, revealing the spatial separation of electrons into two distinct regions characterized by opposite out&#8208;of&#8208;plane OAM (&#177;Lz). This work provides a direct visualization of the orbital Hall effect, paving the way for future investigations of orbitronics.








Abstract
Orbital angular momentum (OAM), once considered a marginal property in solids, has recently gained importance in various physical phenomena. Although optical probes couple to OAM directly, comparable low&#8208;energy electrodynamic methods are still in the early stages of development. To exploit the potential of OAM for information science and technology, angular momentum&#8208;resolved transport methods must be established. Here, a principle is presented for an angular momentum&#8208;resolved method to observe orbital Hall effect (OHE) in real space. The orbital conduction in the topological semimetal Td&#8208;WTe2 is measured using contact&#8208;free polarimetric terahertz probe, showing that two distinct regions of &#177;Lz with a diffusion length of &#8776;130&#160;&#181;m due to the extremely low scattering rate of Weyl fermions form in real space.

     alt="Spatiotemporally Resolved Orbital Hall Effect in a Topological Semimetal"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-space mapping of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transport is achieved using contact-free polarimetric terahertz spectroscopy. This principle is applied to the topological semimetal &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;-WTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, revealing the spatial separation of electrons into two distinct regions characterized by opposite out-of-plane OAM (&#177;L&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;). This work provides a direct visualization of the orbital Hall effect, paving the way for future investigations of orbitronics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orbital angular momentum (OAM), once considered a marginal property in solids, has recently gained importance in various physical phenomena. Although optical probes couple to OAM directly, comparable low-energy electrodynamic methods are still in the early stages of development. To exploit the potential of OAM for information science and technology, angular momentum-resolved transport methods must be established. Here, a principle is presented for an angular momentum-resolved method to observe orbital Hall effect (OHE) in real space. The orbital conduction in the topological semimetal &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;-WTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is measured using contact-free polarimetric terahertz probe, showing that two distinct regions of &#177;L&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; with a diffusion length of &#8776;130&#160;&#181;m due to the extremely low scattering rate of Weyl fermions form in real space. The observed orbital conduction can be explained by OHE, according to theoretical calculations. By altering the polarization and intensity of the terahertz electric field input, it is also demonstrated that this orbital conduction can be engineered. Using a spatiotemporal low-energy electrodynamic probe, the work reveals direct evidence of coherent OHE in an inversion-broken topological semimetal with strong spin-orbit coupling&#8212;an experimentally elusive regime until now.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cancer Immunotherapy
In article number 2501565, Xu Chen, Yihang Pan, Tianxin Lin, and co&#8208;workers have established a platform utilizing a CRISPR system&#8208;based bacterial outer membrane vesicle (OMV) for the efficient and cost&#8208;effective targeted delivery of plasmids. The intravesical administration of these engineered OMVs, which encoding CXCL&#8208;9 and IL&#8208;12, have been shown to effectively facilitating T&#8208;cell infiltration and activation. This process enhances the anti&#8208;tumor efficacy of OMV&#8208;mediated therapies and increases sensitivity to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 treatments. Consequently, this approach presents a novel strategy to address resistance to immunotherapy in the context of bladder cancer.

         <title>Design Strategies and Advancements in Organic Spintronics: from Material Engineering and Interfacial Modification to Functional Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design strategies and advancements in organic spintronics are comprehensively discussed in this review. In the research of active layer materials, spinterface, ferromagnetic electrode preparation, and functional devices, numerous design strategies are devised to optimize their spin&#8208;related performance and propel this field toward practical applications in the near future.








Abstract
Organic spintronics, which has emerged as a burgeoning interdisciplinary subject, has recently attracted much research enthusiasm from both the scientific community and industry. As a category of materials typically composed of light elements, organic materials inherently possess weaker spin&#8210;orbit coupling and hyperfine interactions, which are considered beneficial for spin transport. Numerous organic materials have been meticulously synthesized to reveal their structure&#8210;performance relationships. The spinterface effect induced by the ferromagnetic metal/organic material interface has led to novel physical mechanisms. The development of functional devices has promoted this field toward practical applications. Herein, design strategies and advancements in this field are presented, focusing on active material design, interfacial modification, and functional devices. First, the review discusses the influence of the active layer design on spin&#8208;related properties, including the chemical structures of small molecules, polymers, their multicomponent regulation strategies, and chiral materials. Subsequently, the review enumerates reliable ferromagnetic electrode preparation methods and spinterface modification methods aimed at adjusting the spin injection and transport efficiency. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of the strategies for enhancing the performance of functional devices in this field is presented. Finally, a concise summary and prospective outlook are proposed, highlighting the necessity and potential for future advancements in organic spintronics.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Neuromorphic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crossover of additive Manufacturing (AM) and neuromorphic engineering promises a new paradigm in the fabrication of intelligent hardware&#8212;one that is sustainable, scalable, cost&#8208;efficient, and customizable. The AM&#8208;printed neuromorphic hardware (electronics and mechanical systems) is examined, and we discussed the technological integration. Upon overcoming process incompatibility and limited resolution issues of AM, 3D&#8208;printed neuromorphic systems may revolutionize intelligent electronics.








Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering aims to create brain&#8208;inspired computing systems based on synaptic electronic hardware and neural network software. It combines intelligent materials, advanced processing technology, and computation programs. Additive manufacturing (AM), despite being one of the advanced manufacturing technologies capable of multimaterial processing at the microscale, is not widely applied in neuromorphic hardware fabrication. This gap suggests not only process incompatibility and limited resolution of AM but opportunities to create novel intelligent systems. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in AM&#8208;printed neuromorphic hardware (synaptic electronics and mechanical systems) is reviewed and discussed the integration of AM techniques with neuromorphic engineering. An outlook of printed neuromorphic systems is provided with low cost and environmental impact but high customizability and design flexibility. With ongoing innovation in AM technologies and materials, AM is envisioned with high throughput and resolution for affordable, scalable, and customizable neuromorphic hardware production. The crossover of AM and neuromorphic engineering facilitates prototyping of brain&#8208;inspired computing architectures for efficient and analog computation. This approach may facilitate various applications including neuromorphic robotics, bionics, and real&#8208;time sensing.

         <dc:description>
Topological materials offer a novel platform for thermoelectric energy conversion through unique band features, including band inversion, linear Dirac bands, surface states, and Berry curvature. These quantum characteristics enable enhanced longitudinal and transverse thermoelectric effects, establishing topological thermoelectrics as a promising frontier for both fundamental research and advanced energy technologies.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) effect, which enables the direct conversion of heat into electricity or vice versa, has great importance for condensed matter physics and material science due to its great potential for sustainable energy applications. Topological materials, with their topologically nontrivial band structures and rich physical phenomena, offer exciting opportunities for achieving efficient TE energy conversion. Here, an overview of the recent theoretical is provided and experimental advances at the intersection of topology and thermoelectricity. The unique features of topological materials are examined, such as band inversion, topological surface/edge states, linear Dirac/Weyl bands, and Berry curvature, affect their TE transport properties. Additionally, the potential of band topology to enhance both longitudinal and transverse TE performance is discussed. The current challenges and prospects for further advancing topological TE materials and devices are identified, aiming to develop high&#8208;performance TE materials and devices.

         <title>Ordering Engineering among the Nanostructure Evolution Facilitates High&#8208;Performance Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordering engineering among the nanostructure evolution has emerged as a promising strategy to address the issues of lithium (Li) metal anode, which involves enhancing the structural ordering of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), managing the distribution and orientation of inorganic components within SEI, and optimizing the morphostructure and texture of Li deposition.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with extremely high energy density have emerged as highly promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, the inferior lifespan and safety hazards hinder their practical applications, which arise from the disordered nanostructure at anodic interface, such as mosaic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and nonuniform Li deposition. Ordering engineering among the nanostructure evolution has emerged as a promising strategy to address these issues, which involves enhancing the structural ordering of SEI, managing the distribution and orientation of inorganic components within SEI, and optimizing the morphostructure and texture of Li deposition. Herein, recent advances in ordering engineering which effectively promote the interface ordering are systematically summarized. The importance of constructing a multilayer SEI with oriented inorganic components and achieving strong Li texture with preferred crystal plane is highlighted. Furthermore, advanced characterization techniques employed in ordering engineering are critically reviewed. Finally, the comprehensive examination of challenges encountered in ordering engineering is presented and promising research pathways for future investigation are highlighted. This review aims to encourage discussion and research on the ordering engineering in LMBs, with the goal of enhancing cycle life and safety to accelerate their practical applications.

         <title>Designing the Next Generation of Biomaterials through Nanoengineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoengineering enables precise control over biomaterial interactions with living systems by tuning surface energy, defects, porosity, and crystallinity. This review highlights how these nanoscale design parameters drive advances in regenerative medicine, drug delivery, bioprinting, biosensing, and bioimaging, while outlining key translational challenges and future directions.








Abstract
Recent advances in biomaterials science have applied nanoengineering to develop biomaterials with superior properties and tailored functionalities. These unique attributes are achieved due to the ability of nanoengineering to provide precise control over material interactions with living systems at the molecular scale. Here, key nanotechnologies employed to develop the next generation of biomaterials are critically evaluated. A diverse range of nanomaterials, differing in base materials, shapes, sizes, or surface properties can be integrated into various fabrication processes to develop these advanced biomaterials. Further investigation is required into properties such as surface energy, defects, porosity, and crystallinity, as these critically influence the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of nanoengineered materials. Consequently, we explore diverse biomedical applications of nanoengineered biomaterials, including regenerative medicine, biomolecular delivery, additive manufacturing, immune engineering, cancer therapeutics, bioimaging, biosensing, antimicrobial devices, and tissue adhesives. Additionally, their current limitations are analyzed and emerging strategies for designing the next generation of nanoengineered biomaterials are highlighted.

         <title>Cutting&#8208;Edge Developments at the Interface of Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ISEs) and their pivotal role in solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) development. It examines various ISE categories, interface characteristics, and commercialization challenges while highlighting advanced characterization techniques and the transformative impact of machine learning in enhancing ISE performance and addressing existing technological barriers.








Abstract
Inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ISEs) are critical components of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs), and their interfacial properties play a decisive role in battery performance. This paper systematically reviews the recent advances in the interfaces of ISEs. It begins by defining and classifying ISEs&#8212;encompassing oxides, sulfides, and halides&#8212;while highlighting their fundamental characteristics, potential applications, and existing interface challenges. The discussion extends to the composition, structure, and reaction phenomena at the interfaces of SSBs, focusing on how these factors influence internal resistance, cycling stability, and safety. We detail advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques employed to investigate interfacial microstructures and chemical properties, as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance for electrical and structural analysis, while also highlighting emerging modalities for interface characterization in SSBs. Additionally, we explore the role of informatics strategies, particularly high&#8208;throughput computing and machine learning, in predicting interfacial stability, calculating ionic transport properties, and screening new materials to optimize interface engineering. Despite noteworthy progress in understanding ISE interfaces, challenges remain that hinder the commercialization of SSBs. Future research efforts should prioritize the optimization of interfacial structures and properties through multi&#8208;scale and multi&#8208;technique approaches to further accelerate SSB development.

         <title>Strategies for Continuous Responsive Motion in a Constant Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key to achieving continuous responsive motion lies in a negative feedback loop between the stimuli received by the responsive material and its own motion behavior. Therefore, this review summarizes four strategies for constructing feedback loops in responsive motion systems, including B&#8208;Z reaction strategy, self&#8208;shadowing effect strategy, gradient stimulus field strategy, and complex device&#8208;based strategy.








Abstract
Continuous responsive motion gains significant attention due to its widespread applications in autonomous braking systems, low&#8208;power generation, human&#8208;computer interaction, and other fields. Continuous responsive motion in a constant environment is particularly important because it enables self&#8208;sustained actuation in unmanned settings. In this review, four strategies are summarized for continuous responsive motion in a constant environment and elaborate on the mechanisms, including the Belousov&#8208;Zhabotinsky reaction strategy, the self&#8208;shadowing effect strategy, the gradient stimulus field strategy, and the complex device&#8208;based strategy. This study first provides a brief overview of the development history of continuous responsive motion systems in a constant environment. Then, the basic principles, advantages, disadvantages, and application scopes of the four strategies are illustrated. Afterward, the applications of these continuous responsive motion systems are summarized. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives are presented for the field of continuous responsive motion in a constant environment, offering inspiration for the development of new continuous responsive motion systems.

Abstract

Solar&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation is a green and energy&#8208;efficient water treatment technology with diverse applications in desalination, steam power generation, and agricultural irrigation. Biomass materials have gained significant attention in solar evaporator engineering due to their unique structure, low cost, and ease of adjustment. With enhanced light absorption and high thermal conductivity, biomass materials can improve evaporation efficiency substantially, thus providing opportunities in solar evaporation applications. Therefore, in this critical review, the operating principles and design concepts of solar evaporators are first briefly discussed in terms of the photothermal conversion mechanism. Subsequently, the superiority of biomass materials in solar evaporator design is described in detail from the types of biomass and their structural properties at micro/macro scales. The design principles and corresponding performance enhancement strategies for biomass&#8208;based evaporators are also highlighted, including material selection, structural design, and thermal management techniques. Meanwhile, recent advances in biomass&#8208;based evaporators for several cutting&#8208;edge applications are comprehensively discussed. This review can provide a comprehensive reference for the relevant researchers to advance the research and application of biomass&#8208;based solar evaporators and to promote their wide application in the field of green technology.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework and Nanocellulose Composites for Multifunctional Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and nanocellulose composites have significant potential for the multi&#8208;functional remediation of the environment. This review focused on the synthesis strategies (in situ growth, ex situ growth, and other approaches), typical forms (aerogel, hydrogel, beads, and membrane), and applications in the removal of common pollutants (dye, pharmaceuticals, heavy metal ions, VOCs, CO2, PM, and others) in the environment by MOFs&#8208;nanocellulose (MOFs&#8208;NC) composites. The future perspectives and current challenges of MOFs&#8208;NC composites in environmental remediation applications are also pointed out.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used in environmental remediation due to their unique properties. However, their practical applications are significantly limited by its powder crystal form. To address these limitations, MOFs can be integrated with abundant and sustainable biomass&#8208;derived nanocellulose (NC) to construct processable macroscopic architectures. Herein, this review discusses recent advances in the preparation of multi&#8208;dimensional macroscopic materials from MOFs&#8208;NC and their applications in environmental remediation, including dye adsorption and degradation, pharmaceutical removal, heavy metal ion capture, adsorption and degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO2 capture and separation, particulate matter (PM) separation, and others. A summary of two commonly used strategies for preparing MOFs&#8208;NC composites proposes a valuable insight on how processable macroscopic architectures can be effectively achieved. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of the structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationship between multi&#8208;dimensional MOFs&#8208;NC composites and highlights their versatile applications in the remediation of polluted environments. The mechanisms, challenges, and future prospects of the material in removing environmental pollutants are also present in detail. This review aims to guide researchers in designing high&#8208;performance, multi&#8208;functional, sustainable, and scalable MOFs&#8208;NC composites for future environmental remediation.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the evolution of DNA nanomachines as a transformative approach for organelle&#8208;specific cancer treatment. Their design principles, therapeutic mechanisms, and enhanced selectivity for precise drug delivery and activation of cell death pathways are examined. Key strategies for subcellular targeting, therapeutic advantages, and the integration of AI&#8208;driven research to accelerate innovation are discussed, providing a roadmap for future clinical translation in advanced cancer nanomedicine.








Abstract
Despite decades of research, cancer remains a growing global health challenge. Nanomaterials&#8208;based therapeutics have shown promise, but their clinical applications are often limited by poor selectivity and undesirable side effects. Recently, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based nanomachines have gained attention as intelligent drug carriers due to their ability to precisely target specific organelles. By leveraging rationally designed DNA nanomachines, it is possible to directly attack subcellular structures or deliver therapeutic agents to precise locations, triggering organelle&#8208;mediated cell death. This innovative approach offers several advantages, including enhanced efficacy, lower dosages, minimized off&#8208;target effects, reduced multidrug resistance, and improved therapeutic durability. This review explores the history and advancements of organelle&#8208;targeting strategies, providing new insights into targeting the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes using DNA nanomachines. The review also discusses the structures, design principles, and therapeutic mechanisms of these nanomachines, along with the integration of artificial intelligence&#8208;driven self&#8208;driving laboratories to enhance research growth, efficiency, and competitiveness. Finally, the current challenges, opportunities, and future directions in this evolving field are addressed, offering a roadmap for solving the intricate maze of organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapies.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Thermoelectric Strategies for Smart Fire Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in thermoelectric materials for smart fire prevention and early warning. Mechanism&#8208;guided strategies&#8212;such as structural design, energy filtering, ion doping, and ionic thermoelectric effects&#8212;are systematically discussed, offering insights into the development of self&#8208;powered, high&#8208;sensitivity fire warning systems and their integration into next&#8208;generation intelligent fire safety technologies.








Abstract
Fire prevention and early warning systems are essential to minimize fire risks. Thermoelectric (TE) materials that convert temperature gradients into electrical signals offer a promising pathway for designing self&#8208;powered fire&#8208;warning technologies and devices; however, their practical applications are often impeded by their low output power, inefficient charge transport, and poor interfacial compatibility. Despite several relevant reviews focusing on material types, it has remained underexplored from a mechanism&#8208;driven perspective to enhance the fire prevention performance of TE strategies to date. To fill this knowledge gap, this work aims to systematically review TE materials and design strategies, e.g., structural design, energy filtering, ion doping, ionic thermoelectric effects, and interfacial engineering. This work highlights typical applications of TE&#8208;driven fire prevention systems, such as wearable sensors, distributed forest fire monitoring networks, and intelligent building safety systems. Finally, future directions are discussed, which include multifunctional integration, durability under harsh conditions, and AI&#8208;driven fire prediction, paving the way for developing intelligent, self&#8208;powered fire safety technologies. This work underpins how mechanism&#8208;oriented material design advances next&#8208;generation fire warning systems with enhanced sensitivity, environmental adaptability, and autonomous operation, thereby expediting the creation of next&#8208;generation fire&#8208;prevention system and platform.

         <title>Hard Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: From Fundamental Research to Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hard carbon stands out with its high Na storage capacity, structural stability, and safety. This review comprehensively summarizes and discusses its structural models, Na storage mechanisms, diverse modification strategies, and full&#8208;cell integration challenges, aiming to guide the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries and inspire future research directions.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their unique performance characteristics and raw material accessibility. Among various anode materials, hard carbon (HC) stands out due to its high Na storage capacity, structural stability, and intrinsic safety. However, the structural complexity and heterogeneity of HC present ongoing challenges in understanding its structural models and Na storage mechanisms, impeding the rational design and performance optimization of HC&#8208;based anodes. This review provides a systematic overview of recent advances in HC for SIBs, beginning with an in&#8208;depth examination of representative structural models and the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships. The review critically analyzes Na storage mechanisms and bridges these insights with a diverse array of modification strategies&#8212;including precursor design, structural tailoring, and surface/interface optimization. Special emphasis is placed on improving initial Coulombic efficiency, rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Furthermore, practical challenges related to full&#8208;cell integration are discussed, such as pre&#8208;sodiation techniques and electrolyte/interface engineering&#160;to enhance the real&#8208;world applicability of HC. By integrating fundamental understanding with forward&#8208;looking design strategies, this review provides&#160;a valuable reference for the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective SIB systems, and to inspire future research directions in sodium&#8208;ion energy storage.

This review comprehensively summarizes and discusses its structural models, Na storage mechanisms, diverse modification strategies, and full-cell integration challenges, aiming to guide the development of high-performance, cost-effective sodium-ion batteries and inspire future research directions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising technology for large-scale energy storage due to their unique performance characteristics and raw material accessibility. Among various anode materials, hard carbon (HC) stands out due to its high Na storage capacity, structural stability, and intrinsic safety. However, the structural complexity and heterogeneity of HC present ongoing challenges in understanding its structural models and Na storage mechanisms, impeding the rational design and performance optimization of HC-based anodes. This review provides a systematic overview of recent advances in HC for SIBs, beginning with an in-depth examination of representative structural models and the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships. The review critically analyzes Na storage mechanisms and bridges these insights with a diverse array of modification strategies&#8212;including precursor design, structural tailoring, and surface/interface optimization. Special emphasis is placed on improving initial Coulombic efficiency, rate capability, and long-term cycling stability. Furthermore, practical challenges related to full-cell integration are discussed, such as pre-sodiation techniques and electrolyte/interface engineering&#160;to enhance the real-world applicability of HC. By integrating fundamental understanding with forward-looking design strategies, this review provides&#160;a valuable reference for the development of high-performance, cost-effective SIB systems, and to inspire future research directions in sodium-ion energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

ToC Figure Ren et&#160;al. develop 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L, a 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel vaccine integrating tumor lysates and lenvatinib to mimic lymph node functions. This vaccine recruits immune cells, inhibits angiogenesis, and prevents oral cancer recurrence, ultimately enhancing survival and preserving facial integrity post&#8208;surgery. It represents a novel, clinically translatable approach for postoperative OSCC recurrence treatment.








Abstract
The immune&#8208;suppressive microenvironment and extensive tumor angiogenesis are key contributors to the high recurrence and mortality rates of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). To address these challenges, a personalized 3D&#8208;printed anti&#8208;tumor vaccine (3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L) is developed that integrates whole tumor antigens from postoperative tissue lysates with the angiogenesis inhibitor, lenvatinib. This vaccine not only possesses inherent adjuvant properties but also mimics the functions of lymph nodes through its porous structure, facilitating the recruitment and maturation of immune cells. In vivo studies in OSCC animal models, including mice and rabbits, demonstrate that 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L effectively recruits and matures immune cells at postoperative sites, inhibits angiogenesis and tumor recurrence, and extends survival time, all while maintaining a stable morphology and an excellent biosafety. Furthermore, 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L supports facial integrity post&#8208;surgery, addressing physical challenges by preventing collapse and reducing the risk of aesthetic&#8208;related disorders. These findings suggest that 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L is a promising therapeutic technique for preventing post&#8208;surgical OSCC relapse, particularly as it offers a new strategy for immune system activation and demonstrates significant potential for clinical translation.

         <title>High Rate Capability and Cycling Stability in Multi&#8208;Domain Nanocomposite LiNi1&#8211;xTi3x/4O2 Positive Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By targeting nominally non&#8208;stoichiometric LiNi1&#8211;xTi3x/4O2 compositions, a multi&#8208;domain nanocomposite rock salt positive electrode material with exceptional cycling stability and excellent rate performance is obtained. This enhanced performance particularly under high oxidative potential protocols and cell electrode mass loadings applicable to commercial cells represents a significant advance for LiNiO2&#8208;based positive electrode materials.








Abstract
LiNiO2 positive electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries have experienced a revival of interest due to increasing technological energy demands. Herein a specific Ti4+ substitution is targeted into LiNiO2 to access new compositions by synthesizing the LiNi1&#8211;xTi3x/4O2 solid solution with the aim of retaining Ni3+. Compositions in the range 0.025 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.2 form nanocomposites of compositionally homogeneous ordered R3&#175;$\bar 3$m and disordered Fm3&#175;$\bar 3$m rock salt domains as observed via X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction, and STEM. The disordered rock salt domains stabilize the ordered structure to provide excellent structural reversibility via the formation of coherent interfaces during cycling and enable deep delithiation using a constant voltage charging step without structural degradation. The detrimental structural phase transitions associated with the poor cyclability of LiNiO2 are suppressed to yield a low strain positive electrode material with high capacity retention that offers high&#8208;rate capability even under increased cell electrode mass loadings. The composition x = 0.075 (LiNi0.925Ti0.05625O2) affords a 93% capacity retention after 100 cycles (100&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and demonstrates high reversible capacities of 125 mAh g&#8722;1 even under rates of 3200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. LiNi0.925Ti0.05625O2 exhibits exceptional performance at electrode mass loadings (13.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) comparable to those required for commercial cell applications.

         <title>A Novel Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing Architecture Revealed by Reconfigurable Synapse for Deep Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel double gate&#8208;controlled synapse transistor featuring a graphene/2D perovskite/carbon nanotubes heterostructure is developed, enabling reconfigurable synaptic memory to support Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing (TDM)&#8208;based neural networks. More surprisingly, as the scale of the neural network model gradually increases, the benefits of TDM become more pronounced.








Abstract
Deep learning's growing complexity demands advanced AI chips, increasing hardware costs. Time&#8208;division multiplexing (TDM) neural networks offer a promising solution to simplify integration. However, it is difficult for current synapse transistors to physically implement TDM networks due to inherent device limitations, hindering their practical deployment in modern systems. Here, a novel graphene/2D perovskite/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) synapse transistor featuring a sandwich structure is presented. This transistor enables the realization of TDM neural networks at the hardware level. In this structure, the 2D perovskite layer, characterized by high ion concentration, serves as a neurotransmitter, thereby enhancing synaptic transmission efficiency. Additionally, the CNTs' field&#8208;effect transistors, with their large on&#8208;off ratio, demonstrate a wider range of synaptic current changes. The device mechanism is theoretically analyzed using molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, the impact of TDM on the scale, power, and latency of neural network hardware implementation is investigated. Qualitative analysis is performed to elucidate the advantages of TDM in the hardware implementation of larger deep learning models. This study offers a new approach to reducing the integration complexity of neural networks hardware implementation, holding significant promise for the development of intelligent nanoelectronic devices in the future.

         <title>Remote&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Stimulation of Cell&#8208;Based Bioengineered Tissues for In Situ Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic fields enable the construction of 3D tissues from individual cells and their stimulation, activating signaling pathways that influence tissue function. Herein, cyclic magnetic fields induce mechanical perturbations in magnetically responsive tissue implants, promoting osteodifferentiation of human adipose&#8208;derived stem cells without biochemical supplementation, enhancing implant integration in vivo, highlighting potential for minimally invasive bone repair strategies.








Abstract
The native cell microenvironment activates signaling pathways through mechanotransduction mechanisms, influencing cells&#8217; physiological and functional outcomes. Magnetic fields are explored to manipulate these environments, and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are highlighted as nano&#8208;instructive agents capable of activating key signaling pathways, presenting exciting possibilities in tissue engineering. Still, the ability to precisely control the assembly and differentiation of stem cells within a dynamically responsive microenvironment, crucial for effective tissue regeneration, remains unexplored. This study showcases a novel method wherein MNPs facilitate the precise assembly of magnetically responsive cells into complex 3D tissue structures upon internalization and exposure to temporally defined cyclic magnetic fields. By remotely stimulating these constructs, it is demonstrated for the first time the possibility of remote&#8208;controlled modulation of stem cell fate in vivo without biochemical supplementation. Notably, this approach led to ectopic bone formation, highlighting the ability of magnetic actuation to drive osteogenesis in non&#8208;bone environments. MNP&#8208;driven mechanical stimulation of implanted tissues functions as a bioresponsive system guiding osteogenic differentiation of human adipose&#8208;derived stem cells. The in vivo model further illustrates accelerated construct integration, enhanced osteogenic differentiation, and minimal local inflammation, underscoring the potential of this less invasive, remotely controllable platform to advance regenerative strategies for bone engineering.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The native cell microenvironment activates signaling pathways through mechanotransduction mechanisms, influencing cells&#8217; physiological and functional outcomes. Magnetic fields are explored to manipulate these environments, and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are highlighted as nano-instructive agents capable of activating key signaling pathways, presenting exciting possibilities in tissue engineering. Still, the ability to precisely control the assembly and differentiation of stem cells within a dynamically responsive microenvironment, crucial for effective tissue regeneration, remains unexplored. This study showcases a novel method wherein MNPs facilitate the precise assembly of magnetically responsive cells into complex 3D tissue structures upon internalization and exposure to temporally defined cyclic magnetic fields. By remotely stimulating these constructs, it is demonstrated for the first time the possibility of remote-controlled modulation of stem cell fate in vivo without biochemical supplementation. Notably, this approach led to ectopic bone formation, highlighting the ability of magnetic actuation to drive osteogenesis in non-bone environments. MNP-driven mechanical stimulation of implanted tissues functions as a bioresponsive system guiding osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells. The in vivo model further illustrates accelerated construct integration, enhanced osteogenic differentiation, and minimal local inflammation, underscoring the potential of this less invasive, remotely controllable platform to advance regenerative strategies for bone engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tri&#8208;System Interlocking Top&#8208;Encased Structures Enabled Highly Stable Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Photodetection Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique tri&#8208;system interlocking top&#8208;encased structure is formed for tin&#8208;lead perovskites by the introduction of novel CGA additive. The fabricated tin&#8208;lead perovskite NIR photodetector shows an outstanding specific detectivity of 2 &#215; 1013 Jones at 940 nm, and the integrated 64 &#215; 64 array demonstrates clear and accurate imaging abilities.









Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead binary perovskites show a very broad spectral bandwidth from ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and outstanding optoelectronic properties for photodetection applications. However, the oxidation tendency of the divalent tin easily causes severe vacancies and defects, deteriorating the efficiency and stability of the device. In this work, without involving any costly synthesis of additives, a natural reducing agent of chlorogenic acid is proposed to establish a unique top&#8208;encased tri&#8208;system interlocking structure in tin&#8208;lead perovskites. Benefiting from the synergetic closed&#8208;loop interactions among functional groups of the additive with perovskites, tin&#8208;lead perovskite photodetectors (PDs) are demonstrated with improvements in energy&#8208;level alignment, antioxidation, and defect suppression and passivation. Finally, the self&#8208;powered perovskite NIR PDs present a high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;76%, an outstanding specific detectivity of 2 &#215; 1013 Jones at 940&#160;nm, and a large linear dynamic range of 222&#160;dB, along with good stability maintaining 96% of initial photocurrent after 127 days for the unencapsulated PDs storing under N2 atmosphere. By integrating with a 64 &#215; 64 thin&#8208;film transistor array, the tin&#8208;lead perovskite image sensor exhibits clear and accurate imaging properties, paving the way for a wide range of high&#8208;detectivity and high&#8208;resolution imaging applications.

         <title>Signal Transducer Nanoparticles Enable Siglec&#8208;10/G Blockade Immunotherapy for Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel antibody&#8208;free approach to block the &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; CD24&#8208;Siglec&#8208;10/G signaling is achieved through using the CD24 signal transducer peptide&#8208;anchored nanoparticles (STNPs). These STNPs effectively engage with macrophages, promoting enhanced phagocytosis of breast cancer cells, triggering a broad immune response, and ultimately inhibiting tumor growth.








Abstract
Current treatments for breast cancer (BC), particularly triple&#8208;negative BC, are limited in efficacy due to drug resistance and high recurrence rates. CD24, which is highly expressed in BCs and engages with its receptor Siglec&#8208;10/G (Siglec&#8208;10 in humans and Siglec&#8208;G in mice) on immune cells, represents a promising immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) target. As the engagement is mediated by a short signal transducer (ST) peptide displayed on the BC cell surface, targeting the peptide using antibodies has shown to be effective for BC treatment. Herein, an antibody&#8208;free approach is reported to achieve blockade of the CD24&#8208;Siglec&#8208;10/G signaling through the synthesis of signal transducer peptide&#8208;anchored nanoparticles (STNPs). The STNPs can effectively engage with macrophages, promoting enhanced phagocytosis of BC cells, triggering a broad immune response, and ultimately inhibiting tumor growth. The therapeutic effects can be further improved through encapsulation of RRx&#8208;001, a small molecule inhibitor of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling. Compared to the antibody approach, the synthetic nanoparticle approach offers greater efficacy with lower side effects and enables combination therapy through a simple formulation. Moreover, the approach is versatile and could be adapted for targeting other ICB signaling, advancing the next generation of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>An Intrinsically Stretchable Skin&#8208;Adhesive Actuator With Structurally Anisotropic Multiphase Microarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically stretchable skin&#8208;adhesive actuator is realized using a hybrid architecture combining anisotropic and isotropic 3D porous dielectric architectures. The seamless integration of an intrinsically stretchable skin&#8208;adhesive actuator ensures reliable haptic feedback even under extreme deformation. Featuring a bio&#8208;inspired design, it forms a conformal contact with human skin, effectively stimulating tactile receptors with high&#8208;vibration acceleration, delivering precise and high&#8208;fidelity feedback.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;attachable actuators require robust adhesion and high&#8208;fidelity feedback to conform to the skin under extreme deformation, integrating seamlessly while minimizing damping effects for diverse practical applications. Current rigid haptic interfaces and soft dielectric materials are limited to operating effectively within specific resonance frequencies, exhibiting a mechanical mismatch with human skin, which reduces their effectiveness on highly deformable body parts and decreases the accuracy of vibration feedback. Moreover, intrinsically stretchable dielectric materials face challenges caused by layer integration and significant damping from single anisotropic architectures. Here, an intrinsically stretchable skin&#8208;adhesive actuator (ISSA) with a multiphase dielectric architecture is presented that combines an isotropic spring matrix and an anisotropic elastic damper matrix, achieving stable vibration performance beyond the resonance frequency. The intrinsically stretchable electrode with its hybrid 1D/0D percolated structure ensures adaptability and reliable performance under strains exceeding 500%, whereas the frog&#8208;inspired adhesive enhances skin conformity and breathability, providing robust shear strength (&#8776;28.4&#160;kPa) under extreme deformation. Owing to a seamlessly integrated design and ultralow modulus (&lt;24&#160;kPa), the skin&#8208;adhesive actuator closely conforms to the human skin, delivering high vibrational acceleration while ensuring biocompatibility and durability for transformative applications in soft robotics, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and haptic technologies.

         <title>Enhanced Ising Superconductivity and Emergent Ferromagnetism Coexisting in Bimolecule&#8208;Intercalated Bulk TaS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers report the coexistence of Ising superconductivity and ferromagnetism in TBAC/DMF&#8208;intercalated TaS2, accompanied by a quantum Griffiths singularity. This structure results in an enhanced 2D Ising superconductivity, with the in&#8208;plane upper critical field reaching five times the Pauli limit and the superconducting temperature increasing to &#8776;2.7 K. Distinct ferromagnetic ordering persists from below the superconducting temperature up to 365 K.








Abstract
Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are mutually exclusive in most cases. Here the observation of Ising superconductivity and ferromagnetism coexisting is reported in a bimolecule (tetrabutylammonium chloride and dimethylformamide, or TBAC/DMF)&#8208;intercalated bulk TaS2, with the exotic phenomenon of quantum Griffiths singularity. It is first shown that the neighboring TaS2 layers are separated by 14.7 &#197;, indicating vertical stacking of the TBAC and DMF molecules. Such a record&#8208;large interlayer spacing renders each TaS2 layer to be of exceptionally 2D nature in an otherwise 3D structure, as manifested by substantially enhanced Ising superconductivity with in&#8208;plane upper critical field five times the Pauli limit. The corresponding superconducting transition temperature is &#8776;2.7 K, more than tripled from that of pristine bulk TaS2 (&#8776;0.8 K), and again approaches that of monolayer TaS2 (&#8776;3 K). Strikingly, distinct ferromagnetism is observed below the superconducting temperature, and the ferromagnetic order persists all the way up to 365 K. These findings characterize TBAC/DMF&#8208;TaS2 as a fertile platform for exploration of rich physical phenomena with significant technological potentials in superconducting spintronics.

         <title>Acousto&#8208;Electric Conversion by the Piezoelectric Nanogenerator of a Molecular Copper(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Piezoelectric Nanogenerator (PENG) fabricated with the discrete molecular ferroelectric Cu(II) complex Cu2(L&#8208;phe)2(bpy)2(H2O)2&#183;2H2O (1, Tc &gt; 380K) exhibits outstanding acoustoelectric conversion and 95% accurate AI/ML&#8208;driven voice recognition. It delivers high output performance (output voltage 4.94&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current 3.42&#160;&#181;A), rapid capacitor charging, and efficient pressure and motion sensing as well.








Abstract
The conversion of sound waves into electrical energy holds immense potential in various real&#8208;life applications, particularly biomedical devices, smart security sensors, and noise pollution detectors. Yet, the field is largely underexplored, due to the limited availability of materials that operate efficiently at low frequencies of sound waves. Piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), which generate electric charges through deformations caused by sound&#8208;induced pressure variations, emerge as promising candidates for acoustoelectric conversion. However, the rigidity and toxicity, of traditional piezoelectric bulk oxide&#8208;based PENGs make them unsuitable for wearable electronics and healthcare monitoring devices. As an alternative, we present an efficient, flexible PENG and acoustic nanogenerator (AcNG) based on a molecular ferroelectric [Cu2(L&#8208;phe)2(bpy)2(H2O)] (BF4)2.2H2O (1) complex with an impressive output peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltage of 4.94&#160;V and an acoustoelectric conversion of 40&#160;mV from 60&#160;Hz soundwave is disclosed. Leveraging the sensitive low&#8208;frequency detection limit of this AcNG combined with a Machine Learning (ML) approach, voices can be distinguished with a surprising accuracy of 95%. Additionally, these devices enable rapid capacitor charging (within 10&#160;s), highly sensitive pressure sensing (low as 4&#160;kPa), and detecting human physiological motion, holding promise for their applications in biometric voice recognition, enhanced national security (AI&#8208;driven voice&#8208;recognition), and biomedical diagnostics.

         <title>Dielectric Aggregation&#8208;Mediated Dual&#8208;Band Robust Optical Performance for Low&#8208;Cost Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a gravity&#8208;induced particle aggregation strategy, the distribution of merely 4 vol% packed dielectric silica in the porous skeleton is tuned to yield a decoupled spectral response spanning two orders of magnitude. This strategy allows for on&#8208;demand manufacture of other types of metamaterials and integrates robust weather resistance properties.








Abstract
Radiative cooling belongs to passively enhanced heat dissipation that reflects sunlight and emits infrared radiation. However, conflicting reflectivity and emissivity across the two bands present challenges to reach 95% performance simultaneously, while a few available photonic reports have shortcomings in terms of scalability and environmental stability. The decoupling optimization of scattering and absorption is demonstrated by modulating the aggregation state of merely 4 vol% dielectrics in the porous skeleton. It allows Mie scattering and resonant absorption to function in their respective bands, resulting in a double 95% optical performance. Such a broad spectral response enables high&#8208;throughput heat dissipation of 8&#160;&#176;C and supports subambient cooling of 5&#160;&#176;C outdoors. This one&#8208;step strategy extends to the manufacture of a range of metamaterials as required for strength, heat resistance, and degradation, combined with robust environmental stability, including resistance to fouling and peeling.

         <title>Reconfigurable Liquid Crystal&#8208;Based Physical Unclonable Function Integrating Optical and Electrical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable physical unclonable function (PUF) integrating optical and electrical responses in organic field&#8208;effect transistor is developed by using unique optical fingerprint textures and random molecular alignment of the semiconductive smectic liquid crystal. This approach enhances security by enabling hierarchical authentication, providing robust solutions for anticounterfeiting and cryptographic applications.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs)&#8212;a hardware&#8208;based security device using randomness&#8212;have evolved from basic integrated circuit designs to advanced systems using diverse materials and mechanisms. However, most PUFs are limited by single&#8208;factor challenges and fixed key generation, making them vulnerable to brute&#8208;force attacks. A reconfigurable and multidimensional liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based PUF is presented integrated into an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) to address limitations. This system combines optical and electrical PUFs through unique optical fingerprint textures and random molecular alignment of the semiconductive smectic LC material. The PUF can be reconfigured by a simple heating and cooling process, overcoming the limitations of fixed&#8208;structure PUFs. Furthermore, this approach enhances security by enabling hierarchical authentication due to the multi&#8208;response factors, providing robust solutions for anticounterfeiting and cryptographic applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Speed Raman Readout of Single Polypeptides via Plasmonic Nanopores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free method is presented for single&#8208;protein investigation using plasmonic nanopores that enable stable, cost&#8208;effective Raman detection of polypeptides in real time. An average of 6 photons is measured during a dwell time of 7 microseconds per amino acid. The linear correlations are observed between dwell time, molecular length, and signal, suggesting the feasibility of sequential Raman readout.









Abstract
The ability to identify individual protein molecules using Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, without the need for labelling, is a significant advancement in biomedical diagnostics. However, the inherently small Raman scattering cross&#8208;section of most (bio) molecules necessitates significant signal amplification for successful detection, particularly at the single&#8208;molecule level. A novel approach is introduced for fabricating plasmonic nanopores suitable for sequential Raman readout, namely the recording of Raman spectra from portions of molecules, which are progressively flowing into plasmonic hot spots. The method is based on Capillary&#8208;Assisted Particle Assembly (CAPA)of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), thus ensuring high stability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. By electrophoretically driving polypeptides through these nanopores, real&#8208;time Raman detection is achieved with a Single&#8208;Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) camera, attaining single&#8208;molecule detection at 1&#160;nm concentration with 100 microsecond resolution. Statistical analysis of translocation times, photon scattering rates, and spectral data confirms a linear correlation between dwell time, molecular length, and Raman signal intensity. On average, a photon scattering of 6 photons/amino acid and a translocation time of 7 &#181;s per amino acid is recorded. These results demonstrate the feasibility of sequential Raman readout, overcoming key limitations of SERS. This method represents a significant step toward label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution molecular identification, with future potential applications in protein identification.

The successful reconstitution of Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p flippase in small and giant polymer lipid hybrid vesicles is illustrated. The hybrid vesicles show adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate consumption and flipping of 2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;l&#8208;serine lipids from the inner to the outer leaflet. This induced transmembrane asymmetry results in constriction and division of the giant hybrid vesicles.








Abstract
The assembly of synthetic systems with the ability for protein&#8208;mediated division remains a challenge in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. Here, the reconstitution of an active Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p lipid flippase in polymer lipid hybrid vesicles (HVs) made from phospholipids and 1 or 2.5 mol% amphiphilic block copolymers, with poly(carboxyethyl acrylate) or poly(6&#8208;O&#8208;methacryloyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranose) as the hydrophilic extension and either cholesteryl methacrylate or butyl methacrylate or combinations thereof as the hydrophobic blocks is demonstrated. The reconstitution of Drs2p&#8211;Cdc50p in HVs flip 2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;l&#8208;serine (DOPS) lipids from the inner to the outer leaflet, leading to transmembrane asymmetry. Importantly, the chemical nature of the hydrophobic block in the amphiphilic block copolymers used to assemble the HVs is crucial to support changes in the spontaneous curvature of the bilayers due to translocation of DOPS lipids that results in HV constriction and division. Taken together, this effort is a step forward in imitating cell division in synthetic assemblies toward potentially bottom&#8208;up assembled self&#8208;replicating units.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Rashba Effect with Suppressed Spin Relaxation in a Polar Phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the bulk&#8208;Rashba effect with enhanced spin&#8208;relaxation time in a new polar phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 (x &#8776; 0.15&#8211;0.34). Unlike typical Rashba systems, which suffer from rapid spin relaxation, this polar phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 exhibits both high Rashba strength and long spin&#8208;relaxation time due to a polar&#8208;crystal symmetry with a unidirectional spin texture. This work expands Rashba physics to 3D systems, with potential for spintronic devices.








Abstract
The Rashba effect enables control over the spin degree of freedom, particularly in polar materials where the polar symmetry couples to Rashba&#8208;type spin splitting. The exploration of this effect, however, has been hindered by the scarcity of polar materials exhibiting the bulk&#8208;Rashba effect and rapid spin&#8208;relaxation effects dictated by the D'yakonov&#8211;Perel mechanism. Here, a polar LiNbO3&#8208;type R3c phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 with x &#8776;0.15&#8211;0.24 is stabilized via epitaxial growth, which exhibits a bulk&#8208;Rashba effect with suppressed spin relaxation as a result of its unidirectional spin texture. As compared to the previously observed non&#8208;polar Pnma phase, this polar phase exhibits higher conductivity, reduced bandgap, and enhanced dielectric and piezoelectric responses. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations and multimodal magnetotransport measurements, which reveal weak (anti)localization, anisotropic magnetoresistance, planar&#8208;Hall effect, and nonreciprocal charge transport, a bulk&#8208;Rashba effect without rapid spin relaxation is demonstrated. These findings offer insights into spin&#8208;orbit coupling physics within polar oxides and suggest potential spintronic applications.

         <title>mTORC1 Selective Nano&#8208;Inhibitor by Disrupting the Lysosomal Arginine&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208; mTORC1&#8208;CDKs Axis for Precision Bladder Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for mTORC1 specific nano&#8208;inhibitors targeting the lysosomal arginine&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208;mTORC1 pathway is presented. Using [2Fe&#8208;2S]CO6 as a paradigm, nanomedicines like ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO are developed. They degrade Arg in lysosome, inhibiting SLC38A9 and mTORC1.








Abstract
The absence of precise targeting and defined mechanisms, akin to small molecules, remains a major barrier to the clinical translation of nanomedicines. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a key regulator of cell proliferation and metabolism, is linked to abnormal activation in various diseases like cancers. While small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of mTORC1 are limited, they remain a focus. Here, a strategy is presented for mTORC1&#8208;specific nano&#8208;inhibitors targeting the lysosomal arginine (Arg)&#8208;SLC38A9&#8208;mTORC1 pathway. Using [2Fe&#8208;2S]CO6 as a universal paradigm, nanomedicines are developed (e.g., ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO) that degrade Arg in the lysosome, inhibiting SLC38A9 activation and blocking mTORC1 recruitment. ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO inhibits mTORC1 at ultra&#8208;low concentrations (1.07 ng mL&#8722;1), with three orders of magnitude greater specificity than the clinical small molecule rapamycin. SLC38A9 knockout abolishes nanomedicine efficacy. Differential responses to the inhibitors are also observed in normal and bladder cancer cells, linked to SLC38A9 expression levels, suggesting potential for precise treatment of non&#8208;muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). In vivo, ZnPc&#8208;SFeCO combined with photodynamic therapy outperformed MMC in preventing tumor recurrence and extending survival. This work establishes a promising approach for developing mTORC1&#8208;specific nano&#8208;inhibitors with well&#8208;defined targets and mechanisms, offering new insights into the development of precision nanomedicines for cancer therapy.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Luminescent Perovskite Quantum Dot/Polymer Composites: Scalable Synthesis, Continuous Processing and Functional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free &#8220;raw material selection&#8208;synthesis design&#8208;product process (RSP)&#8221; strategy is proposed to in situ synthesize perovskite QD/polymer composites, which is conductive to scaling up perovskite QDs production from laboratory research to the market. This work establishes a comprehensive synthesis&#8208;process&#8208;application framework for perovskite QDs, paving the way for industrial production.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as new&#8208;generation emitters for light conversion fields, including X&#8208;ray imaging, displays, and wearable luminescent textiles. Especially when combined with polymers, perovskite QDs not only maintain superior luminance properties and exhibit exceptional stability, but also demonstrate remarkable processability. However, there is still a lack of feasible strategies to achieve large&#8208;scale production of perovskite QD&#8208;based polymer composites. In this study, a solvent&#8208;free &#8220;raw material selection&#8208;synthesis design&#8208;product process (RSP)&#8221; strategy is proposed enable to continuously production of perovskite QD/polymer composites using a screw extruder. Rational raw material selection allows QDs to be uniformly dispersed within the polymer matrix, resulting in efficient luminescent features (e.g., the green CsPbBr3 QD/PS composites with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8776;90%). Meanwhile, polymer encapsulation obviously enhances the stability of QDs against the external environment. Importantly, the strategy is a continuous process (only raw material loading is required), which is conductive to scaling up perovskite QDs production from laboratory research to the market. Furthermore, the potential applications of as&#8208;prepared QD&#8208;based polymer composites is demonstrated in various light conversion fields, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), scintillators, displays, and luminescent textiles. This work establishes a comprehensive synthesis&#8208;process&#8208;application framework for perovskite QDs, paving the way for industrial production.

         <title>Reversible Thermochromic Organosilicon Fibers Based on TiO2@AgI Composites: Preparation, Properties, and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A medium&#8208;high temperature reversible thermochromic organosilicon fiber is prepared by a high&#8208;temperature air&#8208;induced crosslinking method, which has a large color difference (&#916;E = 25.72), excellent cyclic stability (170 times), and high sensitivity (135.4&#160;&#176;C). The fiber also combines high strength (9.89&#8211;11.33 MPa), durability (500 times), biocompatibility, and antimicrobial properties, and is suitable for use in the field of medium and high&#8208;temperature warning.








Abstract
The application of reversible thermochromic fibers (RTFs) is expanding from the smart wearable field toward industrial temperature detection and safety warning; however, most RTFs suffer from low color change temperature thresholds and poor thermal stability, which restrict their applications in medium and high&#8208;temperature places (&gt;100&#160;&#176;C). Currently, overheating of equipment is a key factor that causes safety accidents, and the development of reliable visualized temperature warning materials is of great practical significance for accident prevention. To address these issues, TiO2@AgI is blended with a ternary organosilicon oil spinning solution via a high&#8208;temperature air&#8208;induced crosslinking method to obtain a reversible thermochromic organosilicon fiber (TSiF) suitable for use in medium and high&#8208;temperature environments owing to its thermal stability. Among them, TiO&#8322;@AgI1.1@SiF&#8208;2 has the best performance, showing a significant white to bright yellow color change (color difference &#916;E = 25.72) at 135.4&#160;&#176;C. It still possesses the thermochromic performance after 170 cycles and excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 9.89&#8211;11.33&#160;MPa, no decay in 500 cycles), significant biocompatibility and antimicrobial ability, which fully meets the requirements for medium and high&#8208;temperature warning. Thus, this study provides a new idea for fabricating RTFs that can be used for medium and high&#8208;temperature warning.

         <title>Accompanying Structural Transformations in Polarity Switching of Heavily Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarity switching of heavily doped p&#8208;type conjugated polymers (CPs) toward environmentally stable electron&#8208;rich thin films is demonstrated. Multiscale analyses, incorporating spectroscopic, electrochemical, and scattering techniques, reveal structural and chemical transformations induced by excessive doping with AuCl3. Leveraging this polarity switching behavior, a flexible homojunction p&#8208;n diode is fabricated using a single CP&#8208;dopant system with a record&#8208;high rectification ratio of &#8776;105.








Abstract
Despite significant recent advancements in highly functional organic semiconductors (OSCs), the n&#8208;type OSCs reported to date lag behind their p&#8208;type counterparts in terms of long&#8208;term environmental stability. As an alternative approach to n&#8208;type materials, a few p&#8208;type polymers have been shown to undergo dramatic transitions in their charge carrier polarity to n&#8208;type through transition metal&#8208;incorporated Lewis acid doping. Although the concept of polarity switching is promising, its unclear chemical origin&#8212;particularly from a materials science perspective&#8212;limits its potential as an n&#8208;type counterpart. In this work, the chemical and structural mechanisms underlying the p&#8208;to&#8208;n polarity switching in a heavily doped conjugated polymer are elucidated. Using gold(III) chloride&#8208;doped indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDTBT) as a model system, doping&#8208;induced thin&#8208;film structural changes are investigated. Quantitative X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of doped IDTBT films provides direct evidence of oxidation state changes in Au and Cl ions and confirms the covalent chlorination of the polymer backbone, establishing a direct correlation between the chemical doping mechanism and polarity switching. Finally, leveraging this polarity switching behavior, a p&#8208;n homojunction organic diode is demonstrated with a rectification ratio of 104&#8211;105, highlighting the versatility and potential of this excessively p&#8208;doped n&#8208;type OSC system for tailoring charge transport properties.

         <title>Unveiling Competitive Coordination in Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Electrolytes through Solvent Descriptor Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically establishes co&#8208;solvents selection criteria to achieve balanced solvation behavior by exploring the impacts of &#603; and &#181; on solvation structure. Cosolvent N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMAC) with moderate &#603; (&#603; = 37.8) and high &#181; (&#181; = 3.7 D), can counterbalance the fast diffusion capabilities of water molecules, thereby reducing the formation of by&#8208;products. The LDH&#8208;2 m electrolyte enables the suppressed HER and formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
The narrow electrochemical window and unstable hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) of aqueous electrolytes hinder the potential application of high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These problems are actually related to the solvation structure of the electrolyte, which is determined by the competition among anions, water molecules, and cosolvent coordinated with Li+. Herein, this work proposes a direct solvent descriptor for conveniently designing electrolytes, which facilitates a pronounced level of Li+&#8208;TFSI&#8722; and Li+&#8208;DMAC coordination within the solvation sheath through synergistic effect of the dielectric constant and dipole moment. This strategy significantly reduces the involvement of water in the primary solvation shell and generates stable interfacial chemistry. Such an electrolyte regulated by competitive coordination leads to wide electrochemical stability window of 4.55 V and suppressed HER, thus realizing a 2.5 V LiMn2O4&#8208;Li4Ti5O12 full battery with the high discharge capacity of 138.4 mAh g&#8722;1 and average Coulombic efficiency of 99% over 1000 cycles at 3 C rate. The proposed strategy of solvation structure modification by regulating cation competitive coordination offers a promising approach for achieving stable aqueous batteries with high energy density.

         <title>Initiating Strain Field for Mitigating Lead Leakage in Perovskite Solar Cells with Built&#8208;in Encapsulating Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that chemical sealing networks and strain field regulation enhance the stability of perovskite film and inhibit Pb leakage, achieving a 96.98% suppression of Pb leakage. The small&#8208;area device (0.10 cm&#178;) and module (100 cm&#178;) exhibit the efficiencies of 26.11% and 20.41%, respectively. Unencapsulated devices retain 97.05% of their initial efficiency after 2160&#160;hours under the&#160;ambient humidity.








Abstract
Despite the remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their unsatisfactory operational stability and lead (Pb) leakage remain major obstacles to commercialization. Nevertheless, with the Pb precipitation mechanism remaining elusive, the community has long been under the impression that preventing Pb leakage mainly lies in the out&#8208;film encapsulation. Here, that in&#8208;film reinforcement is demonstrated through the synergy of built&#8208;in chemical sealing networks encapsulating and balanced compressive strain field plays a pivotal role in elevating the thermodynamic barrier for structural dissociation, thereby preventing Pb leakage from severely damaged devices exposed to external stimuli. Through in situ planar&#8208;resolved cathodoluminescence and depth&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle scattering, the spatial evolution of secondary Pb phases is further elucidated within the perovskite films. Consequently, a remarkable 96.98% inhibition rate for Pb leakage from damaged PSCs is achieved. Furthermore, the impressive PCEs of 26.11% in a cell (0.10&#160;cm2) and 20.41% in a module (100&#160;cm2) are achieved. More importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs maintain 97.05% of their initial PCE over 2160&#160;h under humidity ambient. This work highlights the conceptual insights into mitigating Pb leakage by controlling in&#8208;film structural rigidity, thus paving the way for the environmental sustainability of PSCs.

         <title>Structural Tuning Magnetism and Topology in a Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This systematic study of magnetic topological matter under hydrostatic pressure reveals strong material response to pressure, demonstrating a shrinking topological gap and enhanced magnetic order under compression. These findings establish strain engineering as an effective tuning parameter for manipulating and potentially enhancing the quantum anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
To date, the most widely&#8208;studied quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI) platform is achieved by dilute doping of magnetic ions into thin films of the alloyed tetradymite topological insulator (TI) (Bi1 &#8722; xSbx)2Te3 (BST). In these films, long&#8208;range magnetic ordering of the transition metal substituants opens an exchange gap &#916; in the topological surface states, stabilizing spin&#8208;polarized, dissipationless edge channels with a nonzero Chern number C$\mathcal {C}$. The long&#8208;range ordering of the spatially separated magnetic ions is itself mediated by electronic states in the host TI, leading to a sophisticated feedback between magnetic and electronic properties. Here, a study is presented on the electronic and magnetic response of a BST&#8208;based QAHI system to structural tuning via hydrostatic pressure. A systematic closure of the topological gap under compressive strain is identified accompanied by a simultaneous enhancement in the magnetic ordering strength. Combining these experimental results with first&#8208;principle calculations, structural deformation is identified as a strong tuning parameter to traverse a rich topological phase space and modify magnetism in the magnetically doped BST&#160;system.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Transient Unilateral Adhesive Recombinant Collagen&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Reversible Fibrosis Induction and Full&#8208;Cycle Management of Pancreatic Fistula</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;activated, injectable recombinant collagen&#8208;based hydrogel plug with targeted drug delivery is developed for full&#8208;cycle management of pancreatic fistula. Featuring enzyme resistance, transient unilateral adhesion, and reversible fibrosis induction, this hydrogel achieves 100% sealing efficiency and provides comprehensive therapeutic effects, including hemostasis, anti&#8208;inflammation, and reversible inhibition of exocrine function. This study pioneers the application of sequence&#8208;engineered recombinant collagen in pancreatic fistula treatment.








Abstract
Currently, no effective treatment for pancreatic fistula (PF) exists, which has a mortality rate &gt;40%. Existing protein&#8208;based physical barriers face the challenges of rapid degradation, lack of self&#8208;adhesiveness, and the inability to promote PF healing. To overcome this, a novel enzyme&#8208;resistant and highly bioactive hydrogel (CGO@Pg&#8208;Cu(II)) is developed using glycidyl methacrylate recombinant collagen (enzyme&#8208;cleavage&#8208;free) and oxidized pullulan as backbone molecules, which is further loaded with a penicillin G&#8208;Cu(II) infinite coordination polymer nanomedicine. This hydrogel can adapt to irregular PF wounds through injectable self&#8208;leveling and achieve transient unilateral adhesion via light&#8208;activated radical crosslinking with tissue&#8208;inherent molecules. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate its ability to provide full&#8208;cycle PF management by serving as a long&#8208;lasting physical barrier while offering antimicrobial properties, rapid hemostasis, anti&#8208;inflammatory effects, reversible fibrosis induction, and enhancing pancreatic tissue repair. The anti&#8208;PF efficacy of the CGO@Pg&#8208;Cu(II) hydrogel at day 7 is 100%, highlighting its strong potential for clinical postoperative PF prevention.

         <title>Synergistic Compound Additives for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite electrolyte with LiNO&#8323;, SAC, and OP&#8208;10 additives stabilizes lithium anodes and suppresses polysulfide shuttling in Li&#8211;S batteries. This strategy enables Li||Li symmetric cells to cycle under the challenging condition of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 over 1400 h and enhances high&#8208;loading sulfur cathode performance, offering a promising electrolyte engineering approach for advanced metal&#8208;based energy storage systems.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, with theoretical energy densities exceeding 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, are poised to revolutionize energy storage. However, their practical viability hinges on resolving two critical challenges: uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth at the anode and polysulfide shuttling at the sulfur cathode. Here, a compound additive integrating lithium nitrate (LiNO3), sodium saccharin (SAC), and octaphenyl polyoxyethylene (OP&#8208;10) is proposed to construct an electrolyte for Li&#8211;S battery. With the compound additive added, the as&#8208;prepared electrolyte is capable of evolving a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with refined morphology while suppressing polysulfide reactivity. The synergistic effects of this additive enable Li|Li symmetric cells to achieve unprecedented cycling stability (&gt;1400 h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 3 mAh cm&#8722;2) and Li&#8211;S full cells with high sulfur loading (4.12&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) to retain 2.72 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 150 cycles. This work underscores the importance of dual&#8208;electrode stabilization in electrolyte design, offering a scalable strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S batteries and related systems plagued by dendrites and shuttle effects. This study highlights the effectiveness of synergistic electrolyte engineering in suppressing lithium dendrites and polysulfide shuttling, providing new insights for the development of high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries and other energy storage systems facing similar challenges.

         <title>Synthesis and Electrochemistry of Stacking Fault&#8208;Free &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherent tendency to form intergrown stacking faults in corrugated layered &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2 hinders the understanding of its structural transition during electrochemical reaction. The synthesis of fault&#8208;free &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2 unveils in&#8208;plane sliding of corrugated MnO2 as well as excellent capacity retention in Na cells, providing a strategy to exploit Mn&#8208;based layered oxides for long&#8208;life Na&#8208;ion batteries.









Abstract
Understanding the solid&#8208;state chemistry of corrugated layered sodium manganese oxide (&#946;&#8208;NaMnO2) has been hindered by stacking faults (SFs), particularly in the presence of &#945;&#8208;type planar domains among &#946;&#8208;type corrugated MnO2 layers. Thus, their prospects as cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries have never been assessed comprehensively. The partial substitution of Cu for the Mn in &#946;&#8208;NaMnO2 yields SF&#8208;free &#946;&#8208;phase, as confirmed via atomic scale scanning transmission electron microscopy. The SF&#8208;free material enables the identification of unique phase transitions during electrochemical Na extraction/insertion, showing drastic gliding of the corrugated layers. The proposed gliding mechanism is validated both experimentally, using ex situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and theoretically, through density functional theory calculations. Minor structural changes observed in SF&#8208;containing materials indicated that gliding is extremely sensitive to SFs. Given that the SF&#8208;free &#946;&#8208;material exhibits excellent cycle stability in a Na cell, the corrugated layer is concluded to have high resilience and reversibility against repeated large anisotropic structural changes involving slab gliding, providing a new insight into the design of long&#8208;life rechargeable batteries.

Achieving effective de&#8208;icing without sacrificing photovoltaic efficiency remains challenging. A scalable, transparent photothermal film is developed with moir&#233; structures that enable efficient ice removal and restore winter solar output. Under snow&#8208;covered conditions, it achieves up to a 7.5&#8208;fold increase in daily power generation.








Abstract
Accelerated degradation and power loss of solar cells in cold climates remain major challenges to renewable energy deployment. The photothermal film offers a promising solution by converting sunlight into heat to remove ice and snow from solar panels. However, enhancing photothermal performance often entails reduced visible (VIS) light transmittance of films, thereby compromising solar cell efficiency. Tailoring optical designs to balance the optimal light absorption between the device and the film is essential for photovoltaic anti&#8208;icing/snow. Herein, we present outdoor data from grid&#8208;connected photovoltaic modules, revealing a 58% electricity loss caused by ice/snow shading effects. To address this, we developed transparent photothermal films featuring a moir&#233; light&#8208;trapping structure, achieving high VIS transmittance (&#8764;93.0%) and enhanced near&#8208;infrared absorption (&#8764;65.8%). We confirmed that the meter&#8208;scale photothermal film ensures that operational modules remain ice&#8208;free in &#8722;20 &#176;C outdoor conditions, and the ice&#8208;melting phase diagram indicates its effective anti&#8208;icing range down to &#8722;30 &#176;C under AM 1.5G, one&#8208;sun illumination. Day&#8208;night cycling tests on perovskite cells demonstrated sustained anti&#8208;icing performance, yielding a 7.5&#8208;fold increase in daily power output during winter conditions. The film's long&#8208;term stability and robust de&#8208;icing performance under weak&#8208;light scenarios demonstrate the its feasibility for extreme cold applications.

         <title>Dual Roles of Deep Eutectic Solvent in Polysulfide Redox and Catalysis for Intermediate&#8208;Temperature Potassium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

A dual&#8208;functional NiS&#8208;DES interfacial strategy enables highly reversible K2S2/K2S conversion in intermediate&#8208;temperature K&#8208;S batteries by balancing adsorption and activation of intermediates at the catalytic interface, achieving high capacity, long cycle life, and low&#8208;cost energy storage.








Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8208;S) batteries hold great promise for long&#8208;duration energy storage due to their low cost and high energy density. However, the irreversible deposition of K2S2/K2S severely hinders sulfur utilization and cycling stability. Herein, a NiS&#8211;DES interfacial regulation strategy is developed that leverages the dual functionality of a deep eutectic solvent (DES) to govern the adsorption and conversion behavior of K2S2/K2S at the catalytic interface, enabling their highly reversible transformation. Specifically, DES forms moderate electronic coupling with NiS to weaken the excessively strong adsorption of K2S and prevent catalyst deactivation. Simultaneously, strong electronic interactions between DES and K2S promote interfacial activation and conversion, thereby extending the reaction pathway and enhancing reduction depth. As a result, the intermediate&#8208;temperature K&#8208;S batteries deliver an initial capacity of 810 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a minimal capacity decay of 0.02%/cycle over 1300 cycles at 6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 sulfur loading. Even under lean catholyte (4.2 &#181;L&#160;mg[sulfur]&#8722;1) and higher sulfur loading (12&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2), they achieve 521 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 initially, retaining stability with 0.03%/cycle decay over 500 cycles. This NiS&#8208;30DES system achieves a cell&#8208;level energy density exceeding 150&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and a low levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of $140/MWh, demonstrating strong potential for scalable long&#8208;duration energy storage.

         <title>Revisiting the Impact of Anion Selection on Sulfur Redox Reaction Kinetics for High Sulfur Loading Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>

Sulfur redox reactions are systematically evaluated with nine commercial lithium salts and developed a new LiTFSI&#8208;free, PFAS&#8208;free electrolyte for Li&#8211;S batteries. LiBOB, once considered incompatible, forms a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, suppressing the shuttle effect and delivering excellent performance in high&#8208;loading Li&#8211;S cells, offering a more sustainable electrolyte strategy.








Abstract
Lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) is widely used in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery electrolytes due to its stability with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and moderate compatibility with lithium metal anodes. However, LiTFSI presents environmental concerns due to its association with per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are environmentally persistent and potentially toxic, raises sustainability concerns. This research also reveals that LiTFSI limits sulfur redox reactions (SRRs), making it less effective than other lithium salts.&#160;Additionally, some salts previously considered incompatible with Li&#8208;S systems due to their reactivity with LiPSs are demonstrated to perform effectively. For the first time, a protective, porous cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formed in situ through reactions between salt anions and LiPS is reported. The cells delivered a high specific capacity of 1230.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 C with a sulfur loading of &#8776;6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, limited lithium anode, maintaining a capacity retention of 76.2% after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. Under harsh conditions, such as high sulfur loading, lean electrolyte conditions (3 &#181;L mg&#8722;1), and in anode&#8208;free cells, the cells continued to deliver outstanding capacity. This work provides valuable guidelines for understanding and selecting lithium salts to advance electrolyte design for Li&#8211;S batteries.

Organic near&#8208;inflared phototransistors with IDTBT/Y6 heterojunction are developed as implantable controllers for alternating voltages triggering, and shows 99.4% suppression rate within 20&#160;ms on rat, enabling real&#8208;time pain relief for medical application advancing.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of chronic neuralgic pain in expanding populations has created urgent demands for robust pain relief technology. Their sporadic and unpredictable nature, however, presents significant challenge for on&#8208;demand inhibition of nerve transduction. Here, implantable near&#8208;infrared pain relief controllers are reported that leverage stretchable organic phototransistors with IDTBT/Y6 bulk&#8208;heterojunction, offering high responsiveness and reduce charge trapping to trigger detectivity of up to 9.4 &#215; 1013 Jones. By integrating the device with an oscillating circuit, the 808&#160;nm NIR irradiation with varying light intensities can trigger inhibiting voltage ranging from 1&#160;kHz to 50&#160;kHz. This allows for one&#8208;click precise manipulation of neural activity in rat sciatic nerves, achieving up to 99.4% signal suppression within just 20 milliseconds. Furthermore, the nearly real&#8208;time elimination of pain sensation is confirmed by measuring the amplitude of hind paw reflex movements of rats. These findings pave a novel way for the development of advanced pain relief systems for medical applications.

         <title>Tailored Heterogeneous Interphase Layer Promotes Low&#8208;Temperature Desolvation Toward Durable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous artificial interphase is constructed to stabilize sodium metal anodes at subzero temperatures. The tailored sodiophilic interface facilitates Na+ desolvation and regulates uniform deposition, effectively suppressing dendrite formation even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This work offers a practical strategy to enhance interfacial stability and electrochemical performance of low&#8208;temperature sodium metal batteries.









Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) represent a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technology due to their low cost and high energy density. However, SMBs face significant challenges, including interfacial instability and the growth of sodium dendrites on the metal anode, particularly at low temperatures (LTs). Poor ion desolvation at LTs further exacerbates these issues, severely compromising battery performance. To address these problems, a heterogeneous artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composed of Na3VO4 and metallic In (NVO&#8208;In@Na) is designed for LT SMBs. The sodiophilic Na3VO4 promotes sodium ion adsorption, while the Na2In phase formed during the initial plating enhances ion transport kinetics, resulting in uniform Na deposition behavior. Theory calculations indicate that the Na3VO4/Na2In interface accelerates charge transfer processes and desolvation. The engineered NVO&#8208;In@Na anode demonstrates exceptional stability: symmetric cells operate for over 2000 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2 under ambient conditions and exceed 1100 h at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2/0.1 mAh cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C. Full cells paired with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode retain 97% capacity after 1150 cycles at 0.5 C and &#8722;40 &#176;C. This work highlights the potential of rational SEI design to overcome critical limitations of SMBs, advancing high&#8208;performance energy storage under extreme conditions.

         <title>Subsurface Electron Trap Enabled Long&#8208;Cycling Oxalate&#8208;Based Li&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
This study investigates the subsurface electron confinement in Mo&#8208;based catalysts by incorporating electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms as subsurface traps. This design elevates the Mo d&#8208;band and intensifies Mo&#8211;O orbital hybridization, stabilizing lithium oxalate while suppressing the formation of lithium carbonate. Consequently, the Li&#8208;CO2 batteries exhibit unprecedented efficiencies and cycling stabilities at extreme temperatures.








Abstract
Li&#8208;CO&#8322; batteries promise ultrahigh theoretical energy densities but face efficiency limitations owing to the sluggish decomposition of stable Li2CO3. Redirecting the redox pathway toward Li2C2O4 overcomes this challenge, but its metastability leads to facile conversion to Li2CO3 during discharge. Herein, subsurface electronic confinement is engineered in Mo&#8208;based catalysts, leveraging electron&#8208;deficient boron (B) as electron traps in the subsurface atomic layers to tailor their interfacial electronic landscapes. This design elevates the Mo d&#8208;band and intensifies the hybridization between the Mo d&#8208;orbitals and O p&#8208;orbitals of oxalate. Strengthening the Mo&#8208;O interaction stabilizes Li2C2O4 against decomposition. The highly reversible and stable redox chemistry enabled by MoB results in an exceptional cycling stability and energy efficiency across a wide temperature range, with an expanded practical viability. At 70&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2, the MoB&#8208;based battery is cycled for &gt;1400&#160;h with a high energy efficiency of &gt;85%. The energy efficiency even remains at &gt;90% for &#8776;150&#160;h at a high temperature (90&#160;&#176;C). This study pioneers a material design framework for use in stabilizing metastable products within Li&#8208;CO2 batteries, advancing their applicabilities in extreme environments, such as deep&#8208;earth exploration, by revealing the role of subsurface charge redistribution in steering reaction pathways.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Based Bifunctional Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Sites Induce the Directional Generation of Radical in Catalytic Ozonation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This bifunctional catalyst synergizes Ca&#9472;O alkaline sites (boosting &#183;OH generation) and Ca&#9472;O&#9472;Si acidic centers (dominate the generation of &#183;O2&#8208;), establishing a selective radical generation pathway and achieving &gt;99.9% removal of refractory pollutants (oxalic acid, atrazine) in 30 min with 3&#8208;230&#8208;fold enhancements over conventional AOPs. This work offers a molecular&#8208;scale blueprint for directional ROS control in wastewater treatment.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate critical redox processes in contaminant degradation, precise regulation of radical speciation remains fundamentally constrained by the heterogeneity in active site configurations and coordination microenvironments. Here, a site&#8208;specific engineering strategy is demonstrated through spatially organized Ca&#9472;O basic sites and Ca&#9472;O&#9472;Si acidic centers, fabricated via Ca2+&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;linking of sodium alginate. Mechanistic studies reveal that the alkaline Ca&#9472;O domains enhance spin density of *OO intermediates to promote hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) generation, while adjacent acidic Ca&#9472;O&#9472;Si moieties simultaneously lower *O formation energy barrier and suppress *OO conversion, establishing a selective radical generation pathway. This bifunctional design achieves near&#8208;complete removal (&gt;99.9%) of recalcitrant pollutants including oxalic acid and atrazine within 30&#160;min, demonstrating 3&#8208;230&#8208;fold rate enhancement over conventional advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The engineered catalyst maintains stable efficiency over 20 cycles in actual wastewater treatment processes, providing a molecular&#8208;scale blueprint for directional ROS manipulation in water treatment.

Abstract
Migratory animals with magnetic receptors can sense the Earth's magnetic field, a phenomenon known as magnetoreception, and use it for long&#8208;distance navigation. Nevertheless, research on flexible luminescent magnetic sensors, particularly those suitable for both aerial and underwater environments, remains extremely underdeveloped. Herein, enlightened by the magnetic perception ability of migratory animals, an air and underwater dual&#8208;environment bionic luminescent magnetic sensor (HOF&#8208;14@Ni fabric) is initiatively fabricated by electroplating hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF&#8208;14) onto nickel&#8208;based conductive fabric via a coordinated electrodeposition method. In both air and underwater environments, HOF&#8208;14@Ni fabric exhibits ultrafast response speed (40 and 240 ms), ultralow detection limit (0.0227 and 0.0337 mT), ultrahigh sensitivity (1510.23 and 51.89 T&#8722;1), ultrahigh measurement accuracy (relative standard deviation &#8804; 0.52% and 0.097%), and great repeatability (900 and 540 cycles), respectively. Finite element simulation analysis of displacement and magnetic flux density changes for HOF&#8208;14@Ni fabric reveals that the magnetic response mechanism can be attributed to the magnetic&#8208;caused bending behavior resulting from magnetic attraction. Additionally, underwater magnetic wireless communication, motion perception, and air&#8208;underwater dual&#8208;environment magnetic intelligent real&#8208;time monitoring are further materialized. This work opens up a brand&#8208;new path for the application of luminescent (fluorescent) sensors in the field of dual&#8208;environment magnetic sensing.

         <title>Valence and Site Engineering Enable Efficient Broadband Near&#8208;Infrared Emission at 960 nm in Cr3+&#8208;Activated Forsterite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent material (Mg2SiO4:1.5%Cr,5%Li) with efficient (EQE = 48%) ultra&#8208;broadband (FWHM &#8776; 2413 cm&#8722;1 (226&#160;nm)) NIR emission at 960&#160;nm upon blue&#8208;light excitation. This innovation addresses the low efficiency of long&#8208;wavelength (&#955;max &gt; 900&#160;nm) NIR&#8208;emitting materials due to the radiationless de&#8208;activation and the low absorption efficiency of Cr3+ activators.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light sources hold great potential for applications in night vision illumination, bio&#8208;imaging, and non&#8208;destructive testing. However, radiationless de&#8208;activation and low absorption restrict the development of high&#8208;efficiency blue light excitable NIR phosphors, especially for emissions beyond 900&#160;nm. Herein we report a high&#8208;performance Cr3+&#8208;activated forsterite (Mg2SiO4:1.5%Cr3+, 5%Li+) phosphor exhibiting broadband NIR emission peaking at 960&#160;nm with a record external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 48%. The introduction of Li+ as a charge compensator and symmetry distorter not only suppresses Cr4+ formation but also enhances the cross section of Cr3+ d&#8208;d forbidden transitions in Mg2SiO4. More importantly, Li+ promotes excited&#8208;state energy transfer between Cr3+ emitters, yielding exceptional thermal stability and external quantum efficiency. A fabricated NIR phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) achieved a NIR radiated power of 356&#160;mW (at a driving current of 700&#160;mA) and an electro&#8208;optical conversion efficiency up to 12.9% (at 100&#160;mA). This work unlocks new possibilities for smart spectroscopy applications, from non&#8208;destructive testing to human angiography and biometric recognition.

         <title>Polarization Signal Amplification of 2D GeSe&#8208;Based Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal field&#8208;effect transistor&#8208;based amplification circuit is developed to significantly enhance the polarization ratio (PR) of 2D GeSe polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors, improving PR from 2.1 to 54.8 (over 25&#8208;fold enhancement). This amplified polarization signal directly contributes to higher recognition accuracy in defect detection systems, concurrently reducing the computational costs of convolutional neural networks (CNN)&#160;by over 60%.








Abstract
Polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors, resolving light intensity, wavelength, and polarization states, enable the characterization of probing microstructure, internal stress, and compositional heterogeneity. Polarizer&#8208;free polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D semiconductors offer potential for device miniaturization and on&#8208;chip integration, owing to their inherent linear dichroism and orientation&#8208;dependent carrier mobilities. Hundreds of in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D materials have been successfully discovered; however, the limited anisotropic photocurrent ratio (PR&lt;10) has hindered the practical application. Herein, a field&#8208;effect transistor (FET)&#8208;based amplification strategy, enhancing PR from 2.1 to 54.8 in 2D GeSe photodetectors is proposed. This significant PR enhancement arises from polarization&#8208;induced resistance variations dynamically modulating gate potentials. Coupled with a steep transistor subthreshold region, small gate fluctuations produce substantial drain current changes, amplifying output anisotropy sensitively. Evaluating four types of FET identifies SMT&#8208;Si transistors as optimal due to their high stability, sharp subthreshold, and excellent noise immunity. In addition, the amplified PR signal directly enhances image contrast and recognition accuracy. Notably, with a high&#8208;PR signal, the machine learning model achieves a recognition rate of 0.99 in only 17 training epochs, reflecting a computational cost reduction of over 60%. This work provides an effective strategy to enhance PR, benefiting from high&#8208;resolution polarization imaging and advanced optoelectronic sensing.

         <title>Photocatalytic Aqueous Reforming of Methyl Formate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3d&#8208;metal Cu&#8208;based atomically dispersed photocatalyst, supported on modified g&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324;, facilitates the photocatalytic selective hydrogen (7.5 mmol gcat&#8722;1 of hydrogen; nothing else than H2 and CO2) generation from methyl formate.

Abstract
Green hydrogen is critical to establish a sustainable energy future as it offers a clean, renewable, and a versatile alternative for decarbonizing industries, transportation, and power generation. However, the limitations of current methods significantly restrict the scope and hinder many of the envisioned applications. This study aims to report on the first example of a 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based (Cu) heterogeneous photocatalytic system to produce green hydrogen via dehydrogenation of methyl formate (MF), a reaction previously known to require 4d/5d transition metals. Employing a Cu&#8208;based atomically dispersed heterogeneous photocatalyst supported on aryl&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted graphitic carbon nitride (d&#8208;gC3N4), the protocol offers numerous key advantages, including the recyclability of the photocatalyst for &gt;10 cycles without significant activity loss, sustained hydrogen production (&gt;15 days!) with high hydrogen yield (19.8 mmol gcat&#8722;1) and negligible CO emission, following an operationally simple, sustainable, and efficient catalytic pathway. Furthermore, the photocatalyst is characterized (using HAADF&#8208;STEM, SS&#8208;NMR, XAS, EPR, and XPS), all of which clearly demonstrated the presence of single atomic Cu&#8208;site. Additionally, comprehensive mechanistic investigations together with DFT calculations allow for a thorough mechanistic rationale for this reaction. It is strongly believed that this atomically dispersed heterogeneous photocatalytic approach will open new avenues for establishing liquid organic hydrogen career (LOHC) technologies.

         <title>Switching off Competing Hydrogen Formation in CO2 Electroreduction via Substrate Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that graphitized carbon nanotubes enhance the selectivity of Ni phthalocyanine catalysts for CO2 reduction by preserving the Ni&#8208;N4 coordination structure. In situ spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory confirm that defect engineering suppresses hydrogen evolution. The findings highlight a cost&#8208;effective strategy for scalable, selective CO production using immobilized molecular catalysts.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are widely used as supports for immobilizing molecular electrocatalysts, such as for CO2 reduction (CO2R), with &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions often assumed to govern the catalyst immobilization. However, the nature of catalyst/CNTs interactions remains insufficiently understood. Here, nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) is investigated, a benchmark CO2R catalyst, supported on CNTs. NiPc preferentially anchors at defect&#8208;sites on CNTs rather than adsorbing uniformly via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking is found, an observation validated by theoretical simulations. Notably, CNTs with the fewest defects, despite exhibiting non&#8208;uniform NiPc distribution, deliver the highest CO2R activity and CO selectivity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that high defect densities induce D4h symmetry distortion of the NiPc macrocycle under cathodic bias, compromising catalyst integrity and CO2R performance. Guided by these insights, CNT defect density is optimized via thermal graphitization, yielding a NiPc/CNT composite with unprecedented selectivity (CO:H2 &gt; 16&#160;100:1) and a turnover frequency of 1072&#160;s&#8315;1 at &#8722;0.60&#160;V versus RHE, switching off the competing hydrogen formation. Integrated into a 100&#160;cm2 zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer, the optimized catalyst sustains 50&#160;A current with &gt;95% CO selectivity at &#8776;3.5&#160;V, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ag&#8208;based systems. This work establishes CNT defect&#8208;engineering as an effective strategy for advancing molecular catalysts for CO2R electrolysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Enhancing Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Antioxidant Liquid Crystalline Polyarylate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;temperature enhancing triboelectric nanogenerator (HTE&#8208;TENG) based on antioxidant liquid crystalline polyarylate (LCP), the highly rigid main chain of which endows TENG with excellent heat resistance. The resultant HTE&#8208;TENG provides a sustainable route for reliable energy devices and electronics to save lives in potential applications, such as rescue work, personal protection, and extreme environments.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a prospective energy harvesting technology, especially polymer&#8208;based TENG has achieved remarkable achievements. However, most polymer&#8208;based triboelectric layers suffer serious structural degradation and rapid decrease of charge density at high temperatures, which severely lowers the power supply capacity of TENG and definitely limits their applications in extreme environments. Herein, the antioxidants are introduced into liquid crystalline polyarylate (LCP) to fabricate thermally stable TENG and enhance its thermal oxidation resistance. The peak voltage of the resultant TENG is boosted to 73.6 V at 200&#160;&#176;C, which is 144.1% higher than the value at 25&#160;&#176;C, indicating the remarkably high&#8208;temperature enhancing effect on electrical output performance. Meanwhile, the high&#8208;temperature enhancing TENG (HTE&#8208;TENG) exhibited a peak output electrical power density of 1071.3 mW&#183;m&#8722;2 under a 109 &#937; load. This work provides a sustainable route for reliable energy devices and electronics to serve in potential applications, such as rescue work, personal protection, and extreme environments.

         <title>Realizing Multicolor, 3D&#8208;Printable Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence PLA Materials via Regulating the &#960;&#8208;System of Aryl&#8208;Annulated Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the &#960;&#8208; system of aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles, full&#8208;color (440 &#8211; 628 nm) is achieved, ultralong lifetimes (251 &#8211; 3841 ms), and bright (&#934;pmax = 19%) RTP emission in PLA matrix, representing the best performance among reported PLA&#8208;based RTP materials. Leveraging the unique thermoplasticity of polymers, versatile RTP filaments are fabricated through extrusion processing and create intricate RTP objects via FDM printing or 3D printing pens.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;based degradable organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (URTP) polymers should become a mainstream research topic in the future. Meanwhile, shaping URTP polymers into 3D&#8208;printable materials is of great significance for applications in optical and optoelectronic fields. Nevertheless, the fabrication of full&#8208;color, ultralong, bright, and 3D printable bio&#8208;based RTP polymer materials using a single&#8208;dopant component still faces significant challenges. Here, by regulating the &#960;&#8208;system of aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles, the triplet energy levels are successfully regulated which enabled wavelength&#8208;tunable RTP emissions spanning from blue to red afterglow (440 &#8211; 628 nm) in PLA matrix. Non&#8208;radiative decay of dopant triplet excitons are effectively suppressed by the rigid environment of polymer matrix and dopant&#8208;polymer interactions. This enables the prepared PLA&#8208;based RTP materials exhibited ultralong lifetimes of 3.84 s and the naked&#8208;eye&#8208;visible afterglow duration up to 48 s. Recyclable and reprocessable RTP objects are fabricated via 3D printing and are successfully applied in the fields of artworks, monitoring and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This successfully expands the application of polymer&#8208;based RTP materials in 3D fields, and will promote the commercialization of RTP materials and the development of environmentally friendly ultralong RTP materials.

         <title>Contact Transfer Epitaxy of Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bringing a halide perovskite thin film (donor) into contact with a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of oriented perovskite nanocrystals (acceptor) at elevated temperature leads to epitaxial transfer of halide perovskite from the donor to the acceptor substrate. The acceptor substrate controls the crystal orientation and grain size, while the donor substrate controls the composition.








Abstract
Halide perovskite materials are very exciting because of their excellent optoelectronic properties and simple deposition with both solution and vapor&#8208;phase methods. Until now, solution deposition has received more attention, but there are growing indications that residual solvent may limit performance and in particular long&#8208;term stability. Evaporation is a promising alternative, but is more complicated to implement; it requires vacuum, multiple sources at different temperatures, is difficult to switch between different materials due to cross&#8208;contamination and typically leads to films with very small grain size. Here a novel contact transfer method is presented for fabricating single crystalline perovskites that maintains the simplicity and flexibility of solution deposition while avoiding the use of solvent. This contact transfer epitaxy method uses an acceptor substrate consisting of self&#8208;assembled perovskite nanocubes to control crystal orientation and a donor substrate of the desired perovskite film to determine the ultimate composition. By heating the two substrates under close contact in atmospheric conditions, the perovskite film is transferred from the donor to the acceptor substrate, showing cubic phase (100) orientation even with hexagonal donor films. It is shown that contact transfer epitaxy is compatible with a variety of compositions and does not require specialized evaporators or vacuum conditions.

         <title>Development of a Vaginal Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel for Combating Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a vaginal specific ECM hydrogel (vECM) is developed, optimized for intravaginal topical administration, and evaluated for mitigatation of vaginal atrophy associated with menopause. When applied in a rat model of menopause, vECM improves vaginal epithelial thickness and stem cell phenotype, and despite topical application, vECM also exerts a regenerative effect on the deeper smooth muscle layer.








Abstract
Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is initiated by the hypoestrogenic state consequent to cessation of ovarian function and involves changes in all vaginal layers. These alterations include decreased epithelial proliferation and differentiation, impaired extracellular matrix (ECM) maintenance, pro&#8208;inflammatory immune milieu, and smooth muscle atrophy. Patient satisfaction with existing treatments for GSM is low, due in part to their lack of therapeutic effect throughout all vaginal layers and reliance on hormonal treatments. Decellularized ECM therapeutics are known to facilitate soft tissue repair in a variety of applications. Thus, a porcine vaginal tissue&#8208;derived decellularized ECM (vECM) hydrogel suitable for noninvasive topical intravaginal administration is developed specifically for vaginal repair. When applied in a rat model of surgical menopause, vECM significantly improves vaginal epithelial thickness and epithelial stem cell phenotype. Despite topical intravaginal application, vECM is also observed in the lamina propria and fibromuscularis, exerting a regenerative effect on the vaginal smooth muscle layer. Furthermore, vECM modulates macrophage density and promotes pro&#8208;regenerative M2&#8208;like phenotype within the vaginal tissue. Overall, the work herein demonstrates a new nonhormonal biomaterial treatment that counteracts pathological vaginal alterations &#8211; a hallmark of GSM &#8211; in an established preclinical model of menopause.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Microwave&#8208;Assisted Volumetric Heating Engineered Defect&#8208;Free Ceria/Zirconia Bilayer Electrolytes for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a transformative approach for fabricating highly dense and thin ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes for solid oxide electrochemical cells using microwave&#8208;assisted volumetric sintering at unprecedentedly low temperatures and short processing times, achieving excellent performance and durability.








Abstract
Solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) hold significant promise as a sustainable energy conversion technology due to their high efficiency and minimal environmental impact.

Furthermore, advanced digital twin analysis revealed the critical correlation between microstructural features and electrochemical performance, providing new insights into SOC optimization.

However, their development faces critical challenges, particularly in achieving dense ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes necessary to fully leverage state-of-the-art cobaltite-based oxygen electrodes. In this study, a microwave-assisted volumetric sintering process is successfully employed as a transformative alternative to the conventional, time-intensive sintering approach, enabling the fabrication of highly dense ceria/zirconia bilayer electrolytes. This innovative method reduced processing time by over 30-fold compared to convection sintering and achieved a record-low sintering temperature of 1200&#160;&#176;C. SOCs fabricated with these volumetric heating-engineered bilayer electrolytes demonstrated outstanding electrochemical performance, delivering a maximum power density of 2.43&#160;W&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 700&#160;&#176;C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 3.16&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 750&#160;&#176;C in electrolysis mode, alongside excellent long-term durability.

         <title>Engineering CRISPR System&#8208;Based Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicle Potentiates T Cell Immunity for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a multifunctional CRISPR&#8208;dCas9&#8208;based OMV platform termed OMV&#8208;C9I12, which facilitates the coexpression of CXCL9 and IL&#8208;12 within tumor cells. This platform enhances T cell recruitment and activation, synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 immunotherapy, and amplifies antitumor T cell immunity. This demonstrates significant therapeutic efficacy in a broad range of tumors and offers a promising strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but only benefits a subset of patients because of insufficient infiltration and inactivation of effector T cells. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) can activate immunity and deliver therapeutic agents for immunotherapy. However, efficiently targeting and packaging therapeutic molecules into OMVs remains challenging. Here, the engineered E. coli BL21&#8208;derived OMVs enable the packaging of multiple genes, resulting in a 7&#8208;fold increase in DNA enrichment efficiency and gene silencing in vitro. Moreover, the engineered OMVs carrying genes encoding CXCL9 and IL12 (OMV&#8208;C9I12) reprogram tumor cells to secrete these factors, significantly enhancing T&#8208;cell chemotaxis and activation. More importantly, this system markedly inhibits tumors, extends survival, and synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 therapy in murine MB49 and B16F10 tumor models. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) further reveals significant upregulation of T&#8208;cell chemotaxis and activation&#8208;related pathways following OMV&#8208;C9I12 treatment. Finally, OMV&#8208;C9I12 potentiates T cell&#8208;mediated immunotherapy and suppresses the growth of bladder and breast cancer tumors in humanized mouse models. These findings highlight the potential of this engineered OMV platform for cancer gene therapy and provide novel strategies to overcome resistance to immunotherapy.

         <title>de novo Fabrication of Dense Collagen Matrices with Patterned Hierarchical Structures for Corneal Stromal Tissue Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, it is reported that top&#8208;down inputs can be coupled with contextual cues control to guide the bottom&#8208;up assembly of collagen to form dense matrices with spatially&#8208;defined mesoscale structures: i) mild electrical inputs electro&#8208;assemble collagen molecules into a dense metastable state composed of partially assembled molten fibrils; ii) permissive contextual cues (especially controlled humidity) enable these molten fibrils to undergo further hierarchical assembly, to form a stable thickened fibril state; and iii) spatially&#8208;controlled optical inputs can induce riboflavin&#8208;based photocrosslinking to locally trap the structure of metastable molten fibril state and yield a stable state with thin fibrils. This approach can de novo fabricate biomimetic patterned collagens (e.g., cornea&#8208;sclera structure). It is envisioned that this work provides a generic approach for controlling collagen's multiscale assembly for a broad range of biomedical applications.








Abstract
Collagen is a versatile biological building block that is guided by extracellular cues to self&#8208;assemble into diverse hierarchical structures that perform various tissue functions. Here, the use of top&#8208;down inputs and controlled contextual cues is reported for the de novo fabrication of patterned dense collagen matrices with spatially varying tailored mesoscale structures. Initially, imposed electrical inputs are used to guide collagen triple helix molecules to partially assemble into a dense metastable molten fibril state that can be induced by permissive contextual cues (especially humidity) to undergo further assembly. Spatially&#8208;controlled optical inputs that induce riboflavin&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinking can locally&#8208;trap partially assembled states (e.g., molten fibrils). To illustrate the potential of collagen patterning, a functional corneal stromal substitute is specifically fabricated that mimics the microstructures of collagen in cornea&#8208;sclera and demonstrates that it can restore histological structure and function in a corneal defect rabbit model. This generic approach for the de novo fabrication of mesoscale&#8208;structured collagen is envisioned to have broad applications in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Light&#8208;Fueled In&#8208;Operando Shape Reconfiguration, Fixation, and Recovery of Magnetically Actuated Microtextured Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent adaptable network with dynamic disulfide bonds (DS&#8208;CAN) can rearrange its molecular topology through heating or UV irradiation. When combined with ferromagnetic particles, its photoresponsiveness at room temperature enables contactless, spatiotemporal regulation of dynamic bond exchanges during magnetomechanical actuation. This approach enables 3D microfabrication with selective, chemical&#8208;free, reversible shape reconfiguration and fixation in dry conditions without physical contact.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) enable reprocessability via dynamic bond exchange above their topology freezing transition temperature (Tv) despite chemical crosslinks. However, conventional CANs often exhibit insufficient viscosity reduction upon heating, necessitating extensive application of&#160;heat and pressure through direct contact for processing. In this study, a disulfide&#8208;bonded CAN is introduced to facilitate UV&#8208;assisted processing at room temperature, in addition to conventional thermal processing above Tv. At room temperature, UV irradiation accelerates stress relaxation, mirroring the effect of high&#8208;temperature activation (&gt; Tv = 86&#160;&#176;C) without UV. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation also reveals the underlying mechanism of UV&#8208; and heat&#8208;induced dynamic bond exchange. By incorporating magnetic NdFeB particles, magnetomechanical actuation of CAN/NdFeB microarrays is achieved. Unlike conventional approaches which rely on binders to maintain actuated shapes after removal of magnetic field, this system enables in&#8208;operando UV&#8208;fueled shape reconfiguration and fixation through dynamic bond exchange at room temperature, with reversible recovery of the original architectures on&#8208;demand. Furthermore, photoresponsivity allows for contactless spatiotemporal control over dynamic bond exchanges and resultant microarchitectures via a masking technique. This strategy offers facile, patternable 3D microfabrication and binder&#8208;free homologous shape&#8208;fixation in dry conditions without external pressure.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Center Exploration in Atomically Thin MoSxTe2&#8208;x Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides an unsupervised machine learning (ML) framework based on Zernike features and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)&#8208;assisted clustering in a closed&#8208;loop experiment procedure for automatically identifying active electrocatalytic centers from atomic&#8208;resolution micrographs, displaying how artificial intelligence and human experts seamlessly cooperate to rapidly establish structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships for high&#8208;performance catalyst design.








Abstract
Modulating the local configurations is widely considered an efficient strategy to promote the catalytic performance of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Although transmission electron microscopy prevails as a central tool to visualize catalysts at atomic resolution, there still lacks a rapid and accurate approach to finding the active centers in the micrographs containing abundant structural information. Herein, a defective MoSxTe2&#8208;x alloy catalyst is created through low&#8208;temperature sulfurization of 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 (S&#8208;MoTe2), whose atomic structure is automatically explored using an unsupervised machine learning (ML) framework based on the Zernike feature and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)&#8208;assisted clustering, enabling the discovery of a novel defect configuration referred antisite Te adatom (Teads&#8208;Mo). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a synergistic enhancement in both the hydrogen adsorption capability and electronic conductivity of these antisite defects, which is experimentally verified by the half&#8208;reduced overpotential and Tafel slope of S&#8208;MoTe2 alloy compared to its counterparts without Teads&#8208;Mo.

&lt;p&gt;This work provides an unsupervised machine learning (ML) framework based on Zernike features and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)-assisted clustering in a closed-loop experiment procedure for automatically identifying active electrocatalytic centers from atomic-resolution micrographs, displaying how artificial intelligence and human experts seamlessly cooperate to rapidly establish structure-property-performance relationships for high-performance catalyst design.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modulating the local configurations is widely considered an efficient strategy to promote the catalytic performance of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Although transmission electron microscopy prevails as a central tool to visualize catalysts at atomic resolution, there still lacks a rapid and accurate approach to finding the active centers in the micrographs containing abundant structural information. Herein, a defective MoS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt; alloy catalyst is created through low-temperature sulfurization of 1T&#8242;-MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (S-MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), whose atomic structure is automatically explored using an unsupervised machine learning (ML) framework based on the Zernike feature and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)-assisted clustering, enabling the discovery of a novel defect configuration referred antisite Te adatom (Te&lt;sub&gt;ads-Mo&lt;/sub&gt;). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a synergistic enhancement in both the hydrogen adsorption capability and electronic conductivity of these antisite defects, which is experimentally verified by the half-reduced overpotential and Tafel slope of S-MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; alloy compared to its counterparts without Te&lt;sub&gt;ads-Mo&lt;/sub&gt;. This work provides an intelligent approach to facilitate active center exploration in micrographs and achieves a closed-loop verification for the ML-assisted defect discovery via theoretical calculations and electrochemical experiments, displaying how ML and researchers seamlessly cooperate in a scientific workflow for advanced catalyst development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sonodynamic and Bioorthogonal Sonocatalytic Thrombotic Therapy Based on AIE Cationic Tetranuclear Ir(III) Complex Nanoplatform Guided by NIR&#8208;Chemiluminescence Imaging</title>

AIE&#8208;active tetranuclear Ir(III) complex Ir&#8208;4 as a sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst is formulated into a nanoplatform with an H2S donor. Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs achieves combined endogenous NIR chemiluminescence imaging, sonodynamic therapy and release of H2S in situ by a bioorthogonal sonocatalytic reaction in vivo, achieving safe thrombolysis and anti&#8208;inflammatory therapy.








Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive thrombolytic strategies include photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The development of PTT and PDT is impeded by the limited tissue penetration depth of the light source. SDT is a promising method due to the deeper tissue penetration and site&#8208;specific features of ultrasound; however, the scarcity of efficient sonosensitizers has constrained its clinical use. Herein, ultrasound&#8208;triggered nanoparticles (NPs), named Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs, achieve a sonodynamic thrombolytic, bioorthogonal sonocatalytic reaction, with chemiluminescence (CL) imaging in the thrombus. An Ir(III) complex, named Ir&#8208;4, which has aggregation induced emission (AIE), combined with a hydrogen sulfide donor, named H2S&#8208;N3, provide the nanoplatform which is modified with the peptide c(RGDfC) to target the thrombus. This supramolecular assembly successfully integrates: i) thrombosis detection based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminescence imaging, ii) sonodynamic thrombus therapy and iii) release of hydrogen sulfide for anti&#8208;inflammatory action. Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs emit long&#8208;lasting NIR CL triggered by endogenous ONOO&#8722; and achieve 12&#160;mm deep tissue penetration. Blood clots are effectively removed and blood flow is almost fully restored in mouse carotid thrombus and rat femoral vein models. The work demonstrates a new integrated strategy for diagnosing and treating life&#8208;threatening diseases caused by thrombusotic disorders.

         <title>Granular Hydrogels as Brittle Yield Stress Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the Kamani&#8208;Donley&#8208;Rogers yield stress fluid model can describe granular hydrogel deformation. The model robustly captures transient rheology and self&#8208;healing behavior for granular gels of varying composition using only six parameters. This framework provides new insight regarding the effect of material parameters on granular yielding and informs advanced applications such as extrusion&#8208;based granular (hydrogel) printing and material ageing/remodeling.








Abstract
While granular hydrogels are increasingly used in biomedical applications, methods to capture their rheological behavior generally consider shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing properties or produce ensemble metrics (e.g., dynamic moduli) while neglecting transient yielding and unyielding processes. Combining oscillatory shear testing with Brittility (Bt) via the Kamani&#8208;Donley&#8208;Rogers (KDR) model, this work shows that granular hydrogels behave as brittle yield stress fluids. This work quantifies steady and transient rheology as a function of microgel properties and granular composition for polyethylene glycol and gelatin microgels. The KDR model with Bt captures granular hydrogel behavior for a wide range of design parameters, reducing the complex rheology to a determination of model parameters. In granular mixtures, this work observes monotonic dependencies of the elastic modulus, structural viscosity, and brittility upon granular composition, while the yield stress is lower for mixtures. Microgel size distribution and polymer fraction are the most influential parameters in monolithic granular hydrogels, while microgel size and packing density are less impactful. The model robustly captures self&#8208;healing behavior and reveals that granular hydrogel relaxation accelerates with an increased small&#8208;amplitude strain rate. This quantitative framework is an important step toward rational design of granular hydrogels for applications ranging from injection and in situ stabilization to 3D bioprinting.

         <title>Activatable Enzymatic Nanoplatform Incorporated into Microneedle Patch for Relieving Tumor Hypoxia Augmented Photodynamic Therapy</title>

Activatable enzymatic nanoplatform incorporated into microneedle patch is developed for relieving tumor hypoxia augmented photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
The clinical advancement of photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces entrenched impediments, particularly the suboptimal solubility of hydrophobic photosensitizers (PSs) and tumor&#8208;associated hypoxia. Herein, a universally applicable, carrier&#8208;free nanotherapeutic platform is devised in which catalase (CAT) functions dually as a biocatalytic oxygenator and a biocompatible scaffold for PSs encapsulation. Through self&#8208;assembly with diverse hydrophobic PSs&#8212;including 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hexyloxyethyl)&#8208;2&#8208;divinyl&#8208;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (HPPH), chlorin e6 (Ce6), and zinc (II)&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc)&#8212;CAT forms uniform and stable PS@CAT nanoparticles (NPs), obviating the necessity for supplementary nanocarriers. These nanostructures are embedded within microneedle (MN) patches, facilitating minimally invasive, spatially targeted transdermal administration. The PSs bind to the hydrophobic pocket of CAT within NPs, temporarily suppressing its bioactivity, which is restored upon NPs disassembly in the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME). This pH&#8208;responsive &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; mechanism orchestrates the synchronized release of PSs and reactivation of CAT, which catalyzes endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) to generate oxygen (O2), alleviating hypoxia and augmenting O2 availability for PDT. In vivo validation in a 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma model corroborated this approach's therapeutic superiority and biocompatibility. Collectively, the findings delineate a minimalist, multifunctional strategy to simultaneously enhance the bioavailability of PSs and overcome hypoxia in PDT for more efficacious oncologic therapy.

         <title>A Dendritic Cell&#8208;Nanogel Conjugate for Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Node&#8208;Specific PD&#8208;L1 Blockade</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based strategy for the targeted delivery of ICB antibodies to tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). The platform is fabricated by conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody nanogels with tumor antigen&#8208;pulsed DCs. Subcutaneous administration of the platform enables TDLN&#8208;tropic migration and antibody release under reductive conditions. The platform mobilizes T cell immunity while blocking PD&#8208;L1 on DCs and myeloid cells within TDLNs, augmenting systemic antitumor immunity to suppress tumor growth. This study presents a novel strategy for TDLN&#8208;targeted PD&#8208;L1 blockade, unveiling new translational opportunities of combining DC&#8208;based vaccination with ICB therapy.








Abstract
Targeted blockade of immune checkpoints within tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) represents a promising strategy to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, the limited delivery of checkpoint inhibitors to TDLNs and inadequate T cell priming persist as major challenges. In this study, an innovative dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based strategy is developed for the targeted delivery of ICB antibodies to TDLNs. The platform is fabricated by conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody nanogels with DCs, which are further enhanced by pre&#8208;treating DCs with tumor antigens. Subcutaneous administration enabled DCs to execute their intrinsic TDLN&#8208;tropic migration, thus facilitating antibody delivery and release under reductive conditions. The antigen&#8208;loaded DCs mobilized T cell immunity, while the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibodies block PD&#8208;L1 on dendritic cells and myeloid cells within TDLNs, thereby augmenting systemic antitumor immunity. This approach significantly suppresses breast cancer growth, leading to 83.3% of treated mice being tumor&#8208;free. This study presents a novel strategy for TDLN&#8208;targeted PD&#8208;L1 blockade by harnessing the intrinsic TDLN tropism of DCs, unveiling new translational opportunities of combining DC&#8208;based vaccination with ICB therapy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted blockade of immune checkpoints within tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) represents a promising strategy to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, the limited delivery of checkpoint inhibitors to TDLNs and inadequate T cell priming persist as major challenges. In this study, an innovative dendritic cell (DC)-based strategy is developed for the targeted delivery of ICB antibodies to TDLNs. The platform is fabricated by conjugating anti-PD-L1 antibody nanogels with DCs, which are further enhanced by pre-treating DCs with tumor antigens. Subcutaneous administration enabled DCs to execute their intrinsic TDLN-tropic migration, thus facilitating antibody delivery and release under reductive conditions. The antigen-loaded DCs mobilized T cell immunity, while the anti-PD-L1 antibodies block PD-L1 on dendritic cells and myeloid cells within TDLNs, thereby augmenting systemic antitumor immunity. This approach significantly suppresses breast cancer growth, leading to 83.3% of treated mice being tumor-free. This study presents a novel strategy for TDLN-targeted PD-L1 blockade by harnessing the intrinsic TDLN tropism of DCs, unveiling new translational opportunities of combining DC-based vaccination with ICB therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Size&#8208;Change Nanovaccine for Enhancing Lymph Node Deep Penetration and Eliciting Robust Antitumor Immune Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic size&#8208;change nanovaccines (DashVax) overcome the lymphatic delivery paradox through programmed size transition. Constructed from dynamic covalent bonds, these 102 nm assemblies time&#8208;dependently disassemble into 5 nm subunits within LNs, leveraging large&#8208;particle drainage efficiency while enabling small&#8208;particle penetration through anatomical barriers. This dynamic size&#8208;change strategy achieves 7.3&#215; enhanced paracortical delivery, potentiating cytotoxic T cell responses and suppressing tumor growth in B16&#8208;OVA and MC38 tumor models.








Abstract
Breakthrough advances in nanotechnology have substantially enhanced lymph node (LN) targeting efficiency and immune cell uptake of nanovaccines, establishing novel avenues for tumor immunotherapy. Nevertheless, current nanovaccines predominantly accumulate in subcapsular sinuses (SCS) or superficial cortical regions post&#8208;lymphatic transport, failing to traverse anatomical barriers to reach the T cell&#8208;enriched paracortex&#8212;a critical delivery bottleneck that severely limits full activation of cellular immunity. Furthermore, the absence of tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli in LN microenvironments invalidates conventional environment&#8208;responsive delivery strategies. Herein, &#8220;dynamically size&#8208;change nanovaccine&#8221; (DashVax), a time&#8208;controlled self&#8208;disassembling nanovaccine is presented that achieves dynamic size transition from 102 to 5 nm via physiologically regulated imine bond hydrolysis. This design capitalizes on the lymphatic drainage superiority of large particles and tissue&#8208;penetrating capacity of small units, achieving a breakthrough 7.3&#8208;fold enhancement in paracortical antigen delivery compared to non&#8208;size&#8208;change nanovaccines (NoncVax). DashVax demonstrates&#160;robust antigen&#8208;specific immune responses and tumor growth suppression in both B16&#8208;OVA and MC38 tumor models. This exogenous stimulus&#8208;free temporal delivery strategy not only redefines nanovaccine design principles but also elucidates fundamental correlations between intranodal delivery kinetics and immune activation efficacy.

         <title>A Tri&#8208;Mode Photothermal, Phase&#8208;Change, and Radiative&#8208;Cooling Film for All&#8208;Day Thermoelectric Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCMs) with Ti2O3/TiO2 composite shells are designed for LSPR modulation. MPCMs have full&#8208;spectrum absorption, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and thermal storage capacity. Based on MPCMs, a multifunctional tri&#8208;mode photothermal, phase&#8208;change, and radiative&#8208;cooling film is developed for efficient solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric (STE) energy conversion. The MPCMs and composite films provide a promising strategy for solar energy utilization and advanced STE conversion applications.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric conversion shows great promise, especially in off&#8208;grid aerospace and navigation. However, low output density and intermittency of solar energy limit its application. Herein, a microencapsulated phase change material (MPCMs) is designed with a n&#8208;Tetracosane core and TiO2/Ti2O3 composite shell to address the above issue. The MPCM exhibits a latent heat of 144.5 J&#160;g&#8722;1, a photothermal conversion efficiency of 93.7% and 100% energy storage capacity. The thermoelectric system resulting from coupling the multifunctional film composed of polydimethylsiloxane and MPCMs with the thermoelectric module is capable of successfully achieving adaptive 24&#160;h uninterrupted power generation on account of its functions of photothermal conversion, energy storage, and radiative cooling. The output power density of the TES ranged from 6.1 to 21.1&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 at light intensities of 1000&#8211;5000&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2. The material design innovatively endows a single material with the functions of photothermal conversion, phase change energy storage, and radiative cooling, making it can adaptively harvest energy from both the sun and cold space. This multifunctional material offers new insights into the repeatable storage and high&#8208;quality utilization of solar energy, holding significant scientific implications for the development of all&#8208;day solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric power generation technology.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Elastomer with High Luminescent and Mechanical Performances Enabled by Multiple Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent elastomer is prepared by incorporating ureide phosphorescent chromophore into hard segments of polyurethane. Due to the multiple hydrogen bonding and microphase separation, the elastomer exhibits robust luminescent and mechanical properties. It is expected to find applications in flexible electronics and information storage.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent elastomer is promising for flexible electronics. However, preparation of such elastomer with high luminescent and mechanical performances remains a challenge. In this study, a room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) elastomer is prepared by incorporating ureides as luminophores into hard segments of polyurethane forming multiple hydrogen bonds. Upon ultraviolet activation, the RTP elastomer shows a recorded absolute quantum yield of 72.1% and a phosphorescence lifetime of 1079&#160;ms. It also has high mechanical properties with reprocessability. Its tensile strength and elongation at break as high as 58.3&#160;MPa and 1160%, respectively, and its toughness reaches 299.9&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. Particularly, it withstands extreme strain of 1100% or 100 cycles of elongation recovery without any change in luminescent properties. The microphase separation structure with multiple hydrogen bonded hard segment phase is thought to be responsible for its high performances. Given its robust phosphorescence efficiency alongside exceptional toughness, this RTP elastomer holds promise for innovative applications in flexible electronics, information encryption, and data storage.

         <title>A Gas Nanobomb to Promote Drug Penetration and Amplify TACE Therapy for Orthotopic Liver Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional embolic agent is successfully synthesized with the introduction of magnesium hydride (MgH2) nanoparticles into lipiodol (Lip) &amp;tirapazamine (TPZ) dispersion for efficient supply H2, OH&#8722;, and Mg2+. The L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension demonstrates effective elimination of primary tumors, and inhibition of tumor metastasis and recurrence when combined with the immune checkpoint inhibitors. Transarterial embolization by L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension completely eradicates orthotopic rat liver tumors.








Abstract
The worsening hypoxia, acidity, immunosuppression, and low drug penetration created by arterial embolization significantly limit the therapeutic efficiency of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy. To overcome these problems, nanoscale magnesium hydride (MgH2) gas bombs are synthesized and then are co&#8208;dispersed with tirapazamine (TPZ) into lipiodol (Lip) to obtain an L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension, in which the MgH2 nanobombs efficiently modulate the worsened tumor microenvironment (TME), reversed immunosuppression, promoted drug penetration, and amplified TACE therapy. After being injected into mouse tumors, MgH2 nanobombs react with water to effectively generate OH&#8722; to neutralize the acidic TME and reverse immunosuppression; hydrogen (H2) gas bubbles enhance TPZ penetration and achieve hydrogen&#8208;based chemotherapy; and Mg2+ synergistically regulates T&#8208;cell function, resulting in significant inhibition for tumor growth. Moreover, the immunological effects of H2 and Mg2+&#8208;induced antitumor immune responses further inhibit tumor growth and metastasis after combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. As demonstrated in the orthotopic rat liver cancer model, transarterial embolization of the L&#8208;MgH2&amp;TPZ suspension offers greatly enhanced therapeutic outcomes, and all of tumors are eradicated after 3 weeks of treatment, further confirming that the introduction of the MgH2 nanobombs significantly modulates the acidic/immunosuppressive TME and promotes the penetration of TPZ to improve the efficacy of TACE therapy.

After being injected into mouse tumors, MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanobombs react with water to effectively generate OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to neutralize the acidic TME and reverse immunosuppression; hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas bubbles enhance TPZ penetration and achieve hydrogen-based chemotherapy; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; synergistically regulates T-cell function, resulting in significant inhibition for tumor growth. Moreover, the immunological effects of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced antitumor immune responses further inhibit tumor growth and metastasis after combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. As demonstrated in the orthotopic rat liver cancer model, transarterial embolization of the L-MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;amp;TPZ suspension offers greatly enhanced therapeutic outcomes, and all of tumors are eradicated after 3 weeks of treatment, further confirming that the introduction of the MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanobombs significantly modulates the acidic/immunosuppressive TME and promotes the penetration of TPZ to improve the efficacy of TACE therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Recycling Ruthenium Incorporated CuFe2O4 Electrocatalyst for Efficient Neutral Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ electrogenerated adsorbed Fe2+ (Fe2+ad) species effectively capture OH&#8722; ions, creating a localized alkaline microenvironment at the RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 surface. This promotes a self&#8208;sustaining cycle between Fe2+ad release and &#945;&#8208;FeOOH reconstruction, endowing the electrocatalyst with both high NH3 selectivity and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
The high performance of Fe&#8208;based electrocatalyst for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction to ammonia (eNO3&#8722;RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3) is currently constrained by low NH3 selectivity and insufficient stability under high current density. Hence, the incorporation of ruthenium single&#8208;atom into the CuFe2O4 (RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4) with self&#8208;recycling property is developed. The Cu and Ru sites synergistically promote the water dissociation and facilitate the redeposition of in situ adsorbed Fe2+ (Fe2+ad) as &#945;&#8208;FeOOH by self&#8208;reinforcing local alkalinity at the RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 surface, thereby achieving high activity and robust stability for eNO3&#8722;RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 process. The optimized RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 delivers excellent performance with a 97.9% NH3 Faradaic efficiency and 99.8% NH3 selectivity at &#8722;0.59&#160;V versus RHE in neutral electrolyte. Remarkably, in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system, it achieves a large current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.5&#160;V with robust stability, accompanied by &gt;95% NH3 selectivity, a nitrate removal rate of 4.17&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2, and an NH3 production rate of 3.97&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that Ru site in the RuSA&#8208;CuFe2O4 significantly enhances NO3&#8722; adsorption and lowers the energy barrier for the potential determining step (*HNO2 &#8594; *NO). This work offers valuable insights into designing autonomous local alkalinity microenvironments with self&#8208;recycling properties on cost&#8208;effective Cu/Fe oxides.

         <title>Resonator&#8208;Free Metamaterials Based on Ferromagnetic Dielectrics for Mandatory Microwave Loss and Compact Stealth Cloaks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferromagnetic dielectric metamaterials are constructed by arranging ferromagnetic dielectric units composed of CIPs and PU. The incident wave is transformed into a surface wave crawling along the metamaterial by adjusting the phase gradient and unit size. In addition, due to the microwave attenuation effect of the ferromagnetic dielectric, the surface wave is lost secondarily.








Abstract
The utilization of resonant&#8208;unit&#8208;based metamaterials in beam control and compact stealth applications is inherently limited by the strong correlation between unit in&#8208;plane dimensions and reflection characteristics. Therefore, this study proposes a resonator&#8208;free metamaterial based on ferromagnetic dielectric that decouples the amplitude and phase by regulating interface interference, thereby achieving phase modulation independent of the in&#8208;plane dimensions of the FD units. With the introduction of a constant phase gradient and tuning of unit dimensions, reflected waves can be deflected or even converted into surface waves that propagate along the metamaterial interface. This enables a novel electromagnetic loss mechanism wherein the reflected energy undergoes mandatory attenuation by horizontally propagating within the lossy ferromagnetic dielectric. Simulations and experiments are conducted to prove this phenomenon, yielding an improvement of 36.64% in the average power loss density, a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;52&#160;dB. Further, the efficacy of ferromagnetic dielectric units is validated for compact stealth cloaks, and a conformal curved stealth strategy that requires only unit dimension tuning to achieve scattering&#8208;field camouflage for arbitrarily shaped targets is proposed. Given its resonator&#8208;independent operation, the proposed metamaterial exhibits miniaturization advantages of cross&#8208;scale downsizing (in&#8208;plane dimension &lt; &#955;/12)&#8212;a critical advancement for compact electromagnetic defense systems.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Chelating and ROS&#8208;Scavenging Polymers with Thioketal and Thioether Bonds Delivering Ferroptosis Inhibitor Lip&#8208;1 Provide a Triple Therapeutic Strategy for Retina Ganglion Cells in Acute Glaucoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs polymer P1 and polymer P2 as drug carriers to encapsulate Lip&#8208;1 into NPsLip&#8208;1. This system provides triple protection: (1) ROS scavenging via thioether/thioketal bond cleavage, (2) iron ion chelation through exposed NOTA groups, and (3) GPX4 activity restoration by Lip&#8208;1. This synergistic strategy rescues RGCs, restores visual function in vivo, and demonstrates excellent ocular safety.








Abstract
Glaucoma is an irreversible blinding eye disease characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death with emerging evidence highlighting ferroptosis as a crucial mechanism. Herein, two iron&#8208;chelating and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging polymers with thioketal and thioester bonds delivering Lip&#8208;1 are designed and self&#8208;assembled into NPsLip&#8208;1, which pose a triple threat to RGC of Acute Glaucoma via ROS scavenging, iron ion chelation, and potent ferroptosis inhibition. Upon immediate cellular uptake of NPsLip1 by RGCs, the elevated intracellular ROS triggers the cleavage of thioether bonds and the oxidation of thioester bonds, resulting in ROS consumption and simultaneous release of Lip&#8208;1 and exposure of polymer chains with pendant 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triacetic acid (NOTA) groups. On the one hand, the NOTA groups can chelate with iron ions, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis in RGCs. On the other hand, the released Lip&#8208;1 can inhibit ferroptosis by upregulating glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Together, NPsLip&#8208;1 with a triple threat markedly reduced ferroptosis and oxidative stress, significantly enhancing the survival of R28 cells. Further, NPsLip&#8208;1 effectively inhibits the RGC ferroptosis and preserves the visual function. Overall, the findings indicated NPsLip&#8208;1 provides substantial protection for RGCs via suppressing oxidative stress and ferroptosis, representing a promising therapeutic avenue for glaucoma.

         <title>A GaN Schottky Barrier Diode&#8208;Based Terahertz Metasurface for High&#8208;Precision Phase Control and High&#8208;Speed Beam Scanning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable terahertz metasurface based on gallium nitride Schottky barrier diodes is demonstrated. By tuning antenna resonance via junction capacitance, the metasurface achieves high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;precision, and fast&#8208;response continuous phase modulation over a wide range. Dual&#8208;mode (analog/digital) operation enables &#177;45&#176; beam scanning with flat gain, providing a scalable platform for next&#8208;generation THz communication and sensing.








Abstract
Effective wavefront control in the terahertz (THz) regime is essential for achieving high&#8208;directionality beamforming, spatial multiplexing, and real&#8208;time wireless communication. However, low&#8208;loss, precise, and rapid THz phase modulation remains fundamentally constrained by material limitations and inherent device&#8208;level trade&#8208;offs. A programmable THz metasurface (GaNMS) is presented, employing a gallium nitride Schottky barrier diode with a high&#8208;mobility 2D electron gas, specifically designed to overcome these limitations by leveraging its low insertion loss, fast response, and continuously tunable junction capacitance. A 32 &#215; 25&#8208;element array is designed and fabricated. Each unit cell functions as a direct THz phase shifter, dynamically tuning the junction capacitance to enable continuous phase modulation from 0&#176; to 210&#176; at 0.32 THz, with a 1.8&#176; average phase error, modulation speed exceeding 200&#160;MHz, and &#8776;5&#160;dB average insertion loss. To mitigate array&#8208;level nonuniformities, a differential evolution&#8208;based optimization algorithm is introduced, enabling robust &#177;45&#176; beam scanning in both analog and digital modes, with main lobe gains of 18.5 and 16 dBi, respectively. An integrated GaNMS&#8208;based sensing and communication system is also demonstrated, validating its potential in next&#8208;generation THz applications. The proposed GaNMS bridges device&#8208;level phase tunability and system&#8208;level functionality, enabling practical THz technologies.

         <title>Scalable Production of 24&#8208;Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow Plastics Through Molecular Doping Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
24&#8208;H&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) plastics are fabricated at a large scale through a molecular doping strategy compatible with industrial engineering processes. The resulting doped plastics demonstrated green afterglow persisting for 24 h under ambient conditions, setting a new benchmark for polymeric materials. Remarkably, these materials can be activated by natural sunlight, highlighting their practical utility for engineering applications.








Abstract
The development of polymeric afterglow materials has garnered significant interest due to their promising applications in sensing technologies, smart devices, and optoelectronic systems. However, conventional engineering plastics typically exhibit limited afterglow properties owing to rapid nonradiative decay processes under ambient conditions. This study presents a breakthrough in the fabrication of plastics with 24&#8208;h&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) properties through a molecular doping strategy compatible with industrial engineering processes. By utilizing aromatic plastics as electron acceptor and the matrix, spirofluorene derivatives are incorporated as electron donors and chromophore dopants via a melt blending technique, a widely established method in polymer manufacturing. The resulting doped plastics demonstrated green afterglow persisting for 24 h under ambient conditions. At 4&#160;&#176;C, the HLA lasted for up to 100 h after ceasing photoexcitation, setting a new benchmark for polymeric materials. Remarkably, these materials could be activated by natural sunlight and maintain a visible green afterglow for 5 h in ambient air. Mechanism studies revealed that the HLA phenomenon is associated with the formation of donor/acceptor exciplexes upon photoexcitation. Additionally, the HLA plastics exhibited exceptional mechanical flexibility and optical transparency, making them highly suitable for advanced applications in flexible displays and next&#8208;generation wearable technologies.

         <title>Spin&#8208;polarized Acidic Water Electrolysis with Antenna&#8208;Reactor Plasmonic Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral plasmonic antenna&#8211;reactor electrocatalyst, integrating Au nanoflowers as the antenna and iridium single atoms as the reactor, achieves spin&#8208;polarized and light&#8208;driven water electrolysis in acidic media. The catalyst exhibits high activity and durability, enabled by hot&#8208;carrier transfer and the CISS effect, as supported by operando spectroscopy and DFT simulations.









Abstract

Water electrolysis, driven by renewable electricity, offers a sustainable path for hydrogen production. However, efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts are needed to overcome the high overpotentials of both the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. To address this, a novel catalyst system is developed integrating plasmonic nanoreactors with chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. In this system, chiral Au nanoparticles act as antennae, while single&#8208;atom iridium serves as the catalytic reactor, achieving a 3.5 fold increase in reaction kinetics (at 1.57&#160;V vs RHE) compared to commercial IrO2 catalysts and enhancing durability by over 4.8 times relative to conventional Pt/C || IrO2 systems. Density functional theory and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that plasmon&#8208;driven spin alignment polarizes the Ir atom, significantly enhancing stability (&gt;480 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) under acidic conditions. This work represents a major advance in spin polarization for plasmonic electrocatalysis, offering a new route to sustainable energy solutions.

         <title>Highly Responsive Self&#8208;Healing and Degradable Piezoelectric Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a self&#8208;healing and stretchable material is used to develop a damage resistant energy harvester capable of powering electric bulbs, and a sensing system to intelligently classify biomechanical activities is represented.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials that are simultaneously healable, stretchable, and degradable have remained an unmet challenge, limiting advancements in wearable and implantable electronics, where devices face multidimensional mechanical deformation, causing a risk of damage. To address this critical gap, a biocompatible piezoelectric material is developed for ultrahigh piezoelectric effects with DL&#8208;alanine amino acid crystals, which is stretchable, healable, and degradable. The in situ grown DL&#8208;alanine piezoelectric crystals within an ionically cross&#8208;linked gelatin hydrogel matrix strengthen the piezoelectric properties with an ultrahigh voltage coefficient of 1.6 Vm&#160;N&#8722;1. The combination of the piezo&#8208;ionic property and crystal alignment results in a record&#8208;breaking energy harvesting figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value at 57.6 pm2&#160;N&#8722;1 to deliver outstanding mili&#8208;watt level power outputs in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept devices which can power up even several electric light bulbs. An elastically stretchable, damage resistant strain sensor is further optimized for real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring and biomechanical motion tracking. By integrating machine learning algorithms, the sensing system intelligently classifies biomechanical activities with high accuracy, enabling advanced applications in healthcare, rehabilitation, and sports monitoring.

         <title>Immobilizing Lead and Healing Surface Defects via Perfluorinated Tertiary Amine Molecules Enables High&#8208;Performance Sustainable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfluorination strategy using perfluorotriethylamine (PFTEA) enables simultaneous surface defect passivation and lead immobilization in inverted perovskite solar cells. This approach yields a certified efficiency of 26.65% and excellent long&#8208;term operational stability, offering a promising route toward high&#8208;performance and environmentally sustainable perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
The intrinsic instability and nonradiative recombination induced by surface defects hinder the further development of p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Simultaneously, the commercial application of inverted PSCs is limited by environmental unfriendliness resulting from lead leakage. Herein, a universal perfluorination strategy is reported to immobilize lead and passivate surface defects of perovskite films in inverted PSCs. It is demonstrated that perfluorinated perfluorotriethylamine (PFTEA) can form PFTEA&#183;PbI2 complex with PbI2 via a strong coordination bond, which is favorable for suppressing lead leakage and promoting defect passivation. Due to much reduced surface nonradiative recombination, the PFTEA&#8208;modulated inverted PSCs deliver a fascinating certified stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.65%, a record efficiency value reported for PSCs using the vacuum flash evaporation technique. Moreover, the PFTEA&#8208;modulated devices maintain 92% of their initial PCE after 1000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking. This work provides a simple and effective avenue to advance the sustainable development of inverted photovoltaic technology through a perfluorination strategy.

Due to much reduced surface nonradiative recombination, the PFTEA-modulated inverted PSCs deliver a fascinating certified stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.65%, a record efficiency value reported for PSCs using the vacuum flash evaporation technique. Moreover, the PFTEA-modulated devices maintain 92% of their initial PCE after 1000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking. This work provides a simple and effective avenue to advance the sustainable development of inverted photovoltaic technology through a perfluorination strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Turning Waste into Treasure: Pretreatment Strategy for Promoting Secondary Grain Growth by Reusing Excess Lead Iodide in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pretreatment strategy of spin&#8208;coated quantum dots during the perovskite annealing process can use PbI2 as a raw material to promote the secondary growth of perovskite. Compared with the post&#8208;treatment strategy of passivating the perovskite surface after annealing, this approach is more innovative and effective at suppressing the influence of excessive PbI2 on the PCE and stability of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, yet several pivotal factors persistently impede their widespread commercial adoption. Among these, the behavior of excess lead iodide (PbI2) during perovskite synthesis is particularly concerning. Excess PbI2 that promotes perovskite growth will accumulate at grain boundaries during annealing, which restricts the device performance and hinders its long&#8208;term applicability. In this work, an innovative pretreatment strategy is developed by depositing the Cs3ErCl6 quantum dots (QDs) on the perovskite film during annealing, which is different from the traditional post&#8208;treatment strategy by depositing QDs after annealing. It is evident that PbI2 can react with Cs3ErCl6 QDs, enabling its secondary utilization and promoting the secondary growth of perovskite in the vicinity of grain boundaries to inhibit the formation of excess PbI2. The pretreated perovskite layer has a better&#160;fit grain, resulting in higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and better stability of the device. The (FAPbI3) 0.95(MAPbBr3) 0.05 perovskite solar cell treated using the pretreatment method demonstrates a champion PCE of 26.01%. This work offers new perspectives for inhibiting excessive PbI2 growth and thus holds great promise for advancing the commercial viability of perovskite solar cells and contributing to the future landscape of renewable energy.

         <title>Nanoporous Hydrogels with Tunable Pore Size for Efficient Hydrovoltaic Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous hydrogels with tunable pore sizes ranging from 78 to 161&#160;nm are developed using a hydrogen&#8208;bonding crosslinking strategy. The structural integrity of the hydrogel nanochannels under hydrated conditions is confirmed via cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. This work establishes a direct correlation between reduced pore size and enhanced streaming potential, providing new insights into the design of efficient hydrovoltaic materials.








Abstract
Hydrovoltaic electricity generators represent an emerging technology for converting low&#8208;grade water&#8208;based energy into electricity, and hydrogels are favored for their water absorption and ion&#8208;responsive properties. However, the controllable fabrication and precise micromorphological characterization of nanoporous hydrogels remain challenging, hindering the understanding of ion transport within confined water channels. In this work, a nanoporous hydrogel with tunable pore sizes is presented, developed through a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding crosslinking strategy using &#947;&#8208;polyglutamic acid and hydroxylated carbon nanotubes. The pore size can be systematically tuned from 78 to 161&#160;nm, and cryo&#8208;electron microscopy confirms the presence of hydrated nanochannels. The results highlight the critical role of streaming potential in electricity generation, with the device achieving a threefold increase in voltage by reducing the pore size. The optimized device delivers an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.05&#160;V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 100&#160;&#181;A with a 0.1&#160;m NaCl droplet. Moreover,a practical application is demonstrated through a sweat&#8208;monitoring patch that visually responds to ion concentration changes. This work advances the design of high&#8208;efficiency hydrovoltaic systems by establishing a clear link between tunable nanoscale architecture and device performance, paving the way for scalable energy harvesting and sensing technologies.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Matched Iridium on Vanadium Nitride as Efficient Hydrogen Electrocatalyst</title>

A lattice&#8208;matched molten co&#8208;growth strategy for constructing a controllable Ir structure with preferential active facet exposure on VN support, realizing highly efficient HOR/HER catalysis.








Abstract
Iridium (Ir), with optimal hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl bonding energy (OHBE), is considered a promising platform for achieving bi&#8208;directional hydrogen catalysis. However, traditional Ir&#8208;based catalysts with multiple crystalline facets exhibit a gap between the apparent activity and theoretical value, especially for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Here, a molten co&#8208;growth process of Ir and vanadium nitride (Ir&#8208;VN) is reported, realizing precise exposure of lattice&#8208;matched Ir (111) on VN with optimal HBE and OHBE, for highly active hydrogen catalysis. The Ir&#8208;VN catalyst demonstrates exceptional HOR activity with exchange currents 1.8&#8211;4.8 times higher than those of noble metal benchmark catalysts, as well as improved durability and CO tolerance. The unique lattice&#8208;matching effect promotes the directional electron transfer and induces shortened Ir&#9472;Ir bonds via the strongly coupled interface, therefore resulting in enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation and anti&#8208;CO capability. The Ir&#8208;VN catalyst also demonstrates great HER activity and operational durability in a wide pH range, requiring only 21, 12, and 82&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline, acidic, and neutral conditions, respectively. This work not only deepens the understanding of hydrogen electrocatalysis mechanisms but also inspires the rational design and controllable synthesis of catalysts with active crystal facets for various applications.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough Poly(Urea&#8208;Urethane) Plastics With Superior Impact Resistance for Cryogenic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 39, October 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;tough and impact&#8208;resistant poly(urea&#8208;urethane) plastics are fabricated by cross&#8208;linking soft polymer chains with multiple types of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen&#8208;bond aggregates with diverse binding energies and relaxation timescales. At &#8722;50 &#176;C, the plastic exhibits mechanical performance comparable to ultra&#8208;tough engineering plastics at ambient temperatures. The dynamic dissociation of hydrogen bonds endows PUU plastics with excellent low&#8208;temperature impact resistance.








Abstract
Traditional impact&#8208;resistant plastics become brittle at low temperatures due to restricted polymer chain mobility, rendering them unsuitable for cryogenic applications. Developing ultra&#8208;tough plastics with superior impact resistance under extreme low&#8208;temperature conditions remains a significant challenge. Here, this study reports the fabrication of ultra&#8208;tough, impact&#8208;resistant poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (PUU) plastics by cross&#8208;linking soft poly(tetramethylene ether glycol) (PTMEG) chains through multiple types of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen&#8208;bond aggregates with varying binding energies. The PUU plastic features a bicontinuous phase&#8208;separated nanostructure, where hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;cross&#8208;linked, rigid yet deformable domains are interpenetrated with soft PTMEG chains. At &#8722;50 &#176;C, the plastic exhibits mechanical properties comparable to those of ultra&#8208;tough, high&#8208;strength plastics at ambient temperature, with yield strength of 81.1&#160;MPa, breaking strength of 133.0&#160;MPa, Young's modulus of 1.5&#160;GPa, and breaking strain of 220.9%. A 0.3&#8208;mm&#8208;thick sample achieves a maximum impact force of 667.8 N and an impact energy of 3.8 J at &#8722;50 &#176;C, while maintaining exceptional mechanical robustness and flexibility even at &#8722;196 &#176;C. The low&#8208;temperature toughness and impact resistance of the PUU plastics surpass those of existing impact&#8208;resistant plastics. This study demonstrates that hydrogen bonds with a broad spectrum of binding energies serve as ideal cross&#8208;links for fabricating ultra&#8208;tough, impact&#8208;resistant plastics suitable for cryogenic applications.

Reticular porous functional materials, such as MOFs and COFs, toward selective and efficient radioactive waste&#8208;treatment.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing energy demand, driven by rapid industrialization and global urbanization, has escalated the development of sustainable nuclear power generation. Nuclear fission and fuel production generate several radioactive byproducts including 79Se, 85Kr, 90Sr, 99Tc, 127Xe, 129/131I, 137Cs, 235U, which pose great threat upon environmental infiltration. The sustainable development of nuclear energy relies on the easy and adequate accessibility of nuclear&#8208;fuels, like uranium, alongside safe and efficient management of the nuclear fuel cycles. To this end, reticular materials such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile sorbent platforms for efficient treatment of various radionuclides owing to their structural tunability and target specificity. Given that momentous advances have been made in radionuclide treatment by reticular materials in the past few decades, it is important to systematically review and summarize the recent advancements in this field. In this review, a brief overview of the different classes of radioactive&#8208;wastes, and the principles of radioactive waste treatment is first presented. The prerequisites in materials designing are then discussed, followed by the recent progress in MOFs&#8208; and COFs&#8208;materials toward radioactive&#8208;waste&#8208;treatment. Finally, future perspectives on the unresolved scientific and technical challenges are proposed, aiming to fast&#8208;track the translation of these materials toward real&#8208;world implementation.

         <title>Smart Curtains for Spontaneous Solar Modulation via Natural Light&#8208;Triggered Deformable Shading and Chromogenic Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a comprehensive approach is proposed for the development of deformable and optically modulated smart curtains, integrating stimulus&#8208;responsive chromogenic nanomaterials with photothermal actuators. By responding to external signals, the smart curtains can effectively regulate solar radiation by dynamically altering their shape while simultaneously modifying their optical properties, which solves the problem of persistent sunlight absorption caused by the installation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state smart windows.








Abstract
Smart windows, fabricated from stimulus&#8208;responsive chromogenic materials, can modulate the transparency of a window toward sunlight to control room temperature. The widespread implementation of this technology can improve indoor comfort and effectively reduce energy consumption. However, due to their initial optical properties, chromogenic materials in solid&#8208;state smart windows continue to absorb sunlight, causing overcooling and temperature instability. Here, stimulus&#8208;responsive chromogenic nanowires (NWs) and photothermal actuators are combined to create flexible, macro&#8208;deformed smart curtains. The difference in thermal expansion coefficient between bacterial cellulose and polyethylene in actuators allows the smart curtains to keep curled at low light intensities (off&#8208;state) and unroll under intense light (on&#8208;state). The solar modulation efficiency is further enhanced by the synergy of chromogenic (thermochromic or photochromic) NWs. When rolled up, the smart curtains allow ample sunlight to pass through ordinary windows (92.0% of solar radiation) for heating. They can achieve temperature reductions exceeding 6.0&#160;&#176;C, attributed to the regulation of solar radiation, with 62.3% for thermochromic smart curtains and 79.1% for photochromic smart curtains. Besides, the smart curtains can be mounted directly on the building frame without replacing existing windows. These results illustrate the feasibility of smart curtains and represent a conspicuous step toward sustainable building technologies.

         <title>Regenerative Hydrovoltaic Power Generator with Remarkable Duration and Fast Power Generation Achieved by Deep Eutectic Biomass Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomass&#8208;derived processing strategy forms the Deep Eutectic Biomass Complex that realizes fast power generation and long&#8208;term duration as a hydrovoltaic power generator.








Abstract
Hydrovoltaic power generators (HPGs) are pivotal for addressing the global energy crisis. However, most prevalent HPGs suffer from a conflict: either generating transient electricity or sustaining long&#8208;term output reliant on a continuous water supply, which would rapidly decay without water input, especially under low humidity. This severely restricts their environmental adaptability and durability, while the recyclability of HPGs is also highly concerned for reducing electronic waste. Herein, this work pioneers a biomass&#8208;derived processing strategy that forms a &#8220;Deep Eutectic Biomass Complex&#8221; (DEBC) via direct combining biomass macromolecules with choline chloride. The strategy constructed a stable yet sensitive hydrogen&#8208;bonded network that endows DEBC simultaneously realizing fast power generation and long&#8208;term duration as HPG. DEBC exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity to external humidity changes (&#8710;R/R&#8320;&#8776;265&#160;000%) and can spontaneously induce Grotthuss proton hopping under moisture flow, leading to rapid voltage generation (113.8 &#177; 11.5&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1). It also demonstrates exceptional durability that maintains an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc&#8805; 400 &#160;mV) at 30%RH for over 10500 s without water input, and sustains Voc in an open environment for 25 days during winter. This work proposes a feasible access for designing renewable HPG with superior durability and environmental adaptability, tackling the operational limitations and sustainability concerns.

         <title>Quadruple Helix Inversions of Liquid Crystals Orchestrated by Direct Chirality Transmission of an Intrinsically Chiral Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Machine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular motor with four&#8208;state dynamic chirality is integrated into liquid crystals, enabling quadruple sequential helix inversions and high helical twisting power. Due to high motor efficiency, the supramolecular helicity can be controlled by near&#8208;infrared light via upconversion nanoparticles, resulting in a robust, multistate, photoresponsive soft matter. This concept provides new opportunities for programmable photonic smart materials.








Abstract
Endowing liquid crystal (LC) soft matter with stimuli&#8208;responsiveness is pivotal for programmable and dynamic photonics in the next generation of optical materials. However, suitable molecular candidates with intrinsic dynamic chirality that can twist LC helices using external stimuli in a multistate, distinct manner are still very rare. In this study, an elaborately designed intrinsically chiral molecular machine is presented with four&#8208;state dynamic chirality and mesogenic units. This design enables direct chirality transmission, leading to sequential quadruple helix inversions of the LC architecture via unidirectional rotary motion, achieving a high helical twisting power in all states. The inversion of the supramolecular helicity by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is demonstrated by NIR light&#8208;triggered isomerization of the molecular motor structure through an efficient radiative energy transfer pathway from upconversion nanoparticles in the LC film. Hence, these results demonstrate a unique photoresponsive LC system with high robustness, NIR light triggering, and multistate helix tunability with a fascinating potential for constructing smart optical devices.

         <title>Low&#8208;Voltage Driven Co&#8208;Production of Ammonia, Formate, and Hydrogen From Nitrite Reduction Coupled Formaldehyde Oxidation System on Ultra&#8208;Stable AuCuRh Nanowires under Illumination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich AuCuRh nanowires with excellent self&#8208;stability enable the simultaneous nitrite electroreduction and formaldehyde electrooxidation, facilitating the co&#8208;production of ammonia, formate, and hydrogen at low operating potentials.








Abstract
The nitrite electroreduction reaction (NO2RR) offers a green and sustainable pathway for environmental wastewater treatment and ammonia (NH3) generation. Herein, defect&#8208;rich trimetallic AuCuRh nanowires (AuCuRh NWs) with a large number of grain boundaries, twin boundaries, and atomic steps are successfully synthesized by galvanic replacement reaction. Due to its self&#8208;stability and high activity, AuCuRh NWs can efficiently drive the stable NO2RR at 0&#160;V potential (Faradaic efficiency: 98.32%, NH3 yield rate: 20.49&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1). Moreover, AuCuRh NWs also reveal excellent electrocatalytic activity for the formaldehyde electrooxidation reaction (FOR), which can reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at only 0.35&#160;V potential. The NO2RR||FOR electrolysis system assembled with AuCuRh NWs requires only the electrolysis voltage of 0.38&#160;V to achieve the co&#8208;production of NH3, formate, and hydrogen and ultra&#8208;stable continuous electrolysis for 300&#160;hours. The NO2RR||FOR electrolysis system can be further decreased to only 0.29&#160;V under illumination due to plasmon&#8208;enhanced activity. This study provides an energy&#8208;efficient coupling strategy for the stable co&#8208;production of value&#8208;added chemicals.

Herein, defect-rich trimetallic AuCuRh nanowires (AuCuRh NWs) with a large number of grain boundaries, twin boundaries, and atomic steps are successfully synthesized by galvanic replacement reaction. Due to its self-stability and high activity, AuCuRh NWs can efficiently drive the stable NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR at 0&#160;V potential (Faradaic efficiency: 98.32%, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate: 20.49&#160;mg h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, AuCuRh NWs also reveal excellent electrocatalytic activity for the formaldehyde electrooxidation reaction (FOR), which can reach 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at only 0.35&#160;V potential. The NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR||FOR electrolysis system assembled with AuCuRh NWs requires only the electrolysis voltage of 0.38&#160;V to achieve the co-production of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, formate, and hydrogen and ultra-stable continuous electrolysis for 300&#160;hours. The NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR||FOR electrolysis system can be further decreased to only 0.29&#160;V under illumination due to plasmon-enhanced activity. This study provides an energy-efficient coupling strategy for the stable co-production of value-added chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ionomer&#8208;Free Gapless Catalyst&#8208;Bridging Membrane Electrode Assembly for High&#8208;Performance Pure Water&#8208;Fed Anion Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The GCB&#8208;AEMWE exhibits lower contact resistance, faster mass transfer kinetics, and stronger interfacial binding, thereby shows a high energy conversion efficiency of 85.7% at 1 A cm&#8722;2 and a voltage degradation rate of 65 &#181;V h&#8722;1 at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 after 1&#8201;000 h, being the lowest reported to date for pure water&#8208;fed AEMWEs.








Abstract
Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are promising for hydrogen production due to low cost and high product purity. However, the performance of AEMWEs fed by pure water is unsatisfactory because of high ohmic resistance and sluggish reaction kinetics in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Here, an efficient ionomer&#8208;free gapless catalyst&#8208;bridging MEA (GCB&#8208;MEA) is developed for high&#8208;performance AEMWEs by confined directional deposition of the catalyst layer. The ionomer&#8208;free catalyst layer bridges the anion exchange membrane and the gas diffusion layer, creating robust interfaces at its both sides. Compared to conventional MEAs, the GCB&#8208;MEA exhibits more active sites, lower contact resistance, faster mass transfer kinetics, and stronger interfacial binding. The GCB&#8208;MEA&#8208;based AEMWE shows an energy conversion efficiency of 85.7% at 1 A cm&#8722;2 and a voltage degradation rate of 65 &#181;V h&#8722;1 at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 after 1&#8201;000 h, being the lowest reported to date for pure water&#8208;fed AEMWEs. Moreover, the electrolyzer exhibits stable responses under the fluctuating solar energy supply conditions. This work provides an efficient strategy to prepare MEAs for high&#8208;performance hydrogen production, especially under pure water condition.

         <title>Beyond Enzyme Mimics: Engineering Photo&#8208;Responsive Nanozymes for Therapeutic Innovation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of photo&#8208;responsive nanozymes, including structure&#8208;activity relationship, catalytic mechanism, and biomedical applications.








Abstract
Nanozymes, which mimic the catalytic functions of natural enzymes, have attracted increasing attention because of their high stability, low cost, and scalable synthesis. However, their clinical potential is often constrained by their limited catalytic efficiency and poor substrate specificity. Recent developments in photo&#8208;responsive nanozymes offer a promising solution by integrating photocatalytic and photo&#8208;synergistic mechanisms to enhance activity and spatiotemporal control. These systems utilize photo&#8208;induced charge separation, reactive oxygen species generation, and auxiliary photothermal or photodynamic effects to improve catalytic outcomes. By utilizing these photo&#8208;responsive mechanisms, various nanozyme systems comprising plasmonic metals, metal oxides, semiconductors, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks exhibit enhanced catalytic functions and outstanding therapeutic performance in cancer treatment, infection control, immune modulation, and tissue repair. This review summarizes recent advances in the design and application of photo&#8208;responsive nanozymes and highlights the remaining challenges for clinical translation, and thus positioning them as a next&#8208;generation strategy for precision biocatalysis and disease intervention.

         <title>Deterministic Printing of Single Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method has been developed for the additive manufacturing of single photon&#8208;emitting quantum dots and their deterministic positioning and heterointegration with photonic systems: single particle extraction electrodynamics (SPEED) printing. Using dielectrophoretics, polarizability contrast, and surface energetics, SPEED introduces a new, scalable, and sustainable platform for integrating complex photonic circuits and single photon&#8208;emitting quantum light sources with nanoscale precision.








Abstract
The unique optical properties of quantum dots (QDs), size&#8208;tunable emission, and high quantum yield make them ideal candidates for applications in secure quantum communication, quantum computing, targeted single&#8208;cell and molecular tagging, and sensing. Scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies for single QDs have, however, remained largely out of reach due to inherent material incompatibilities with conventional semiconductor manufacturing processes. To advance scalable photonic quantum device architectures, it is therefore crucial to adopt placement and heterointegration strategies that can address these challenges. Here, an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model is presented, single particle extraction electrodynamics (SPEED) printing, that exploits a novel regime of nanoscale dielectrophoretics to print and deterministically position single colloidal QDs. Using QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this additive, a near&#8208;zero&#8208;waste nanomanufacturing process, overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic imprecision that limited previous colloidal deposition strategies, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub&#8208;zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity&#8208;QD integration and single&#8208;photon emission from single printed QDs. By enabling deterministic placement of single quantum dots, this method provides a powerful, scalable, and sustainable platform for integrating complex photonic circuits and quantum light sources with nanoscale precision.

         <title>Ionizable Coenzyme&#8208;Engineered Lipid/Fiber Microplexes Boost Ribosomal Translation to Improve mRNA Therapy for Degenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an injectable ionizable coenzyme Q10 (iCoQ10)&#8208;engineered lipid/fiber microplexes&#160;formulation is developed for mRNA therapy targeting degenerative diseases. iCoQ10 can substitute for conventional ionizable lipids to achieve stable mRNA loading. More importantly, after endocytosis, it rapidly re&#8208;functionalizes the inner mitochondrial membrane, inhibits the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and suppresses eIF2&#945; phosphorylation to enhance ribosomal translation during mRNA delivery. This platform provides a novel strategy for mRNA therapy in degenerative diseases.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction&#8208;mediated ribosomal translation suppression is a hallmark of aging and a major driver of degenerative diseases, limiting mRNA therapy efficacy. Here, ionizable coenzyme Q10 (iCoQ10)&#8208;engineered lipid/fiber microplexes (iCLNP@SF) are developed that restore the mitochondrial&#8208;ribosomal axis to enhance mRNA translation. iCoQ10 replaces conventional ionizable lipids to form prodrugged lipid nanoparticles (iCLNP), stabilized by injectable polydopamine&#8209;modified short fibers for in situ administration. In vitro efficacy assessments showed that iCLNP@SF synergistically enhanced mitochondrial metabolism and mRNA translation in senescent cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that iCLNP stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential, suppressed cGAS&#8208;STING activation, and reduced eIF2&#945; phosphorylation, thereby enhancing translation. In vivo, iCLNP@SF delivery of Gas6 mRNA increased hair follicle density by &#8776;50% in an androgenetic alopecia mouse model, while Runx2 mRNA delivery raised new bone formation (BV/TV) to &#8776;40% in defect models, both markedly outperforming conventional LNPs. Together, these findings highlight a strategy that improves mRNA therapy for degenerative diseases.

         <title>Zeolite&#8208;Anchored Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Enhanced Hydrogenation and Dehydrogenation Reaction Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports the research progress of zeolite&#8208;anchored SACs in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions, and provides theoretical guidance for designing of zeolite&#8208;based catalysts at the atomic scale.








Abstract
Zeolite&#8208;anchored metal catalysts have shown promising applications in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Thermal Expansion Matching as a Key Criterion for Developing High&#8208;Performance Mn&#8208;based Mullite Cathodes in SOFCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to conventional perovskite cathodes, the mullite&#8208;type material has a closely matched thermal expansion coefficient with yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia (a deviation of 2.36% for SmMn2O5&#8208;Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 composite cathode), which enhances the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface bonding, prevents interfacial mismatch at high temperatures, and thereby contributes to the long&#8208;term stable operation of the solid oxide fuel cells.








Abstract
Thermal expansion matching is crucial for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode design to prevent interfacial delamination or cracking. This work adopts thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) matching as the primary design principle to enable both structural stability and high catalytic activity. A Mn&#8208;based mullite&#8208;type cathode, SmMn2O5 (SMO), is developed, and composite electrodes with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) are fabricated. To reveal the structure&#8211;property relationships, TEC and electrochemical performance measurements are combined with in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) analysis. SMO exhibited a low TEC (8.12 &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1) due to anisotropic lattice expansion and phonon scattering confirmed by XRD and Raman. The SMO&#8211;GDC composite displayed extremely well&#8208;matched TECs with yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia, with only 2.36% deviation across the operating range. Electrochemically, the composite cathode achieved 580.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 with polarization resistance of 0.193 &#937; cm2 and maintained stable operation for 300 h. DFT further revealed that GDC addition facilitated interfacial charge transfer and shortened Mn&#8211;Mn dimers, explaining the enhanced catalytic activity. This cathode material selection strategy, prioritizing TEC matching as the primary principle, provides a new insight into SOFC cathode development.

         <title>Immuno&#8208;Packed T&#8208;Cell&#8208;Fusogenic Liposome Empowers Adoptive T Cell Therapy for Solid Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An immuno&#8208;packed T&#8208;cell&#8208;fusogenic liposome (IMPACTFUL) platform is developed to engineer T cells to overcome solid tumor challenges. Using membrane fusion, it simultaneously confers three abilities in one step: enhanced tumor infiltration, immune tolerance evasion, and tumor microenvironment modulation. This approach offers a promising T cell engineering strategy, potentially broadening adoptive T cell therapy's scope against solid tumors.









Abstract
Adoptive T cell therapy has achieved remarkable success in certain blood cancers, but&#160;its efficacy against solid tumors remains limited by multiple immunological challenges including inadequate tumor infiltration, tumor cell's immune tolerance, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a one&#8208;step cell engineering strategy is reported to enhance T cell therapy for solid tumors using an immuno&#8208;packed T&#8208;cell&#8208;fusogenic liposome (IMPACTFUL). Through membrane fusion, IMPACTFUL simultaneously decorates therapeutic T cells with DPPA peptides on their surface and delivers interleukin&#8208;12 mRNA&#8208;loaded magnetic nanoparticle cores (MNP/IL&#8208;12) into the cytoplasm. MNP/IL&#8208;12 internalization grants T cells with effective tumor targeting under external magnet and TME reversion through IL&#8208;12 expression. DPPA peptide presentation enables T cells to overcome tumor cells&#8217; immune tolerance through PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade. In a murine solid tumor model, IMPACTFUL&#8208;engineered T cells infiltrate tumors more effectively, resist exhaustion, and induce a more pro&#8208;inflammatory TME, leading to significantly suppressed tumor growth compared to unmodified T cells. Together, IMPACTFUL can empower adoptive T cell therapy by endowing T cells with multiple complementary functions in a single step. This approach offers a versatile platform to improve the therapeutic outcomes of T cell therapies against solid tumors and can accelerate their translation to clinical settings.

         <title>3D Spatiotemporal Electrophysiology of Cardiac Organoids Using Shell Microelectrode Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D spatiotemporal activation and conduction velocity mapping of whole cardiac organoids of various sizes is demonstrated using a novel organoid&#8208;encapsulating shell microelectrode array (MEA). The device's programmable shape transformation enables noninvasive, conformal, and stable contact with suspended organoids, facilitating long&#8208;term electrophysiological monitoring with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. The shell MEA is optically transparent and fabricated entirely on&#8208;chip using standard photolithographic techniques, enabling simultaneous optical imaging and scalable high&#8208;throughput manufacturing.








Abstract
Cardiac organoids have emerged as powerful platforms for modeling human heart development and disease. However, traditional 2D microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are limited to planar recordings and fail to capture the 3D propagation of electrical signals. Here, programmable, shape&#8208;adaptive, organoid&#8208;encapsulating shell MEAs are presented as a technology that enables comprehensive 3D electrophysiological mapping. These on&#8208;chip&#8208;fabricated devices feature customizable geometries and electrode layouts tailored to an organoid's unique morphology. Shell MEAs generate high&#8208;resolution 3D isochrone and conduction velocity maps, unveiling long&#8208;term spatiotemporal field potential dynamics in spontaneously beating organoids. Furthermore, they integrate multiple modalities, such as&#160;calcium imaging&#160;to corroborate electrophysiological findings and pharmacological screening to assess organoid responses to isoproterenol, E&#8208;4031, and serotonin. This platform represents a significant advance in bioelectronic interfaces, enabling high&#8208;content 3D spatiotemporal functional analysis for cardiac disease modeling and pharmacological testing.

         <title>Ultrastable Calcium Metal Anodes Enabled by a Strongly Coordinated Electrolyte Derived Bilayer Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring reliable electrolytes and constructing favorable SEI structure are pivotal for advancing calcium metal batteries. A strongly solvated and alkaxyborate anion mediated electrolyte demonstrates ultra&#8208;stable Ca metal anodes for over 1450&#160;h. This electrolyte derives an organic (outer)&#8208;inorganic (inner) bi&#8208;layered SEI that facilitates Ca ion migration for Ca metal plating/stripping reactions.








Abstract
Calcium (Ca) metal battery is a promising alternative to current lithium battery chemistry due to the high crustal abundance of Ca element and potentially dendrite&#8208;free cycling of high&#8208;capacity Ca metal anodes. However, reversible Ca metal stripping and plating have been hindered by the lack of effective electrolytes and the formation of obstructive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. Here a strongly coordinated electrolyte system by incorporating LiB(hfip)4 into Ca[B(hfip)4]2/glyme solutions is introduced. The highly coordinated glyme molecules and B(hfip)4&#8722; anions are ready to decompose into organic rich compounds and CaH2, CaB2O4 nanocrystals in the SEI layers on Ca metal surface. Transmission electron microscopy observations reveal that these ionically conductive inorganic particles are embedded beneath the organic&#8208;rich outer layer, thus forming a bilayer SEI configuration. This unique structure facilitates efficient Ca&#8208;ion transfer while preventing further electrolyte decomposition. Effectiveness of this electrolyte is evidenced by the ultrastable Ca//Ca symmetrical cells (over 1450&#160;h with low potentials of &lt;0.5&#160;V vs. Ca/Ca2+ at a high current density of 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and the high&#8208;energy Ca//polyaniline full cells (energy densities of above 200&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 over 200 cycles), which set new benchmarks in the field of room&#8208;temperature Ca metal batteries.

         <title>From Ambiguity to Application: Deciphering Non&#8208;Radical Pathways in Heterogeneous Persulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review deciphers the complexity of non&#8208;radical pathways in persulfate&#8208;based heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes. By integrating singlet oxygen, high&#8208;valent metal&#8211;oxo species, electron transfer and polymerization mechanisms, it establishes a unified framework linking catalyst design, pollutant properties and operation parameters, providing a unified framework to tune pathway selectivity and guide application&#8208;oriented water treatment.








Abstract
Non&#8208;radical pathways have emerged as a critical research frontier in persulfate&#8208;based heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (PS&#8208;HAOPs), offering superior selectivity and thereby resistance to background interference compared to conventional radical&#8208;based routes. However, the practical implementation remains hindered by mechanistic ambiguities, stemming from the coexistence of multiple reactive species and difficulty in direct verification. Current studies remain fragmented, lacking a unified framework to connect catalyst properties, operational parameters, and dominant oxidation mechanisms. This review examines the formation mechanism, identification methodologies, and reactivity patterns of non&#8208;radical species, such as singlet oxygen, high&#8208;valent metal oxide species, and electron transfer pathways. Particular emphasis is placed on rational catalyst design strategies, including spin&#8208;state tuning, coordination environment manipulation, and structural engineering, which directly modulate the steric and electronic structures of active sites and thereby influence the dominant oxidation pathway and overall catalytic efficiency. By integrating insights into temporal evolution, multi&#8208;pathway coupling, and polymerization behavior, a comprehensive model that links catalyst properties, operational conditions, and pollutant characteristics to pathway selectivity is formulated. This review provides mechanistic clarity and design principles to guide the future development of controllable, efficient, and application&#8208;oriented non&#8208;radical PS&#8208;HAOPs systems.

         <title>Modulating Adsorption Configurations of Hybrid Self&#8208;assembled Molecules Enables High&#8208;performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

The 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;sulfanylbenzoic acid (BSCA) incorporation induces a reorientation of [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Ph&#8208;4PACz)&#160;molecules on substrate from a lying&#8208;down to a standing&#8208;up geometry. The co&#8208;adsorption strategy not only resulted in a more homogeneous Ph&#8208;4PACz coverage with optimized energy alignment, but also improved the uniformity of the buried surface of perovskite films with inhibited interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, a high efficiency&#160;of 26.72% (certified 26.75%) is realized for the BSCA&#8208;based device.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) as hole&#8208;selective layers have achieved tremendous success in perovskite solar cells. However, the effective modulation of the adsorption configuration of hybrid SAMs on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates remains a challenge, which essentially influences the SAM's orientation and homogeneity. Herein, the adsorption configuration of [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Ph&#8208;4PACz) on the ITO surface is modulated with co&#8208;assembled molecules 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalic acid (BCA) or 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;sulfanylbenzoic acid (BSCA). Specifically, planar BCA molecules anchored via bi&#8208;carboxylic groups stabilize Ph&#8208;4PACz in a tilted configuration, forming an angle of approximately 54.03&#176; relative to the ITO surface, whereas tilted BSCA molecules anchored via mono&#8208;carboxylic groups induce Ph&#8208;4PACz to adopt an almost perpendicular orientation relative to the ITO surface. Upon BSCA introduction, the Ph&#8208;4PACz film becomes more uniform with better energy level alignment, which further results in the enhanced homogeneity of the buried surface of perovskite films with enhanced charge transport and reduced interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination losses. Consequently, the resultant BSCA&#8208;based devices achieve a high efficiency of 26.72% (certified 26.75%) for devices with the active area of 0.0717 cm2 and 25.21% for 1 cm2, respectively, maintaining over 90% of their initial efficiencies after 1,500 h operational tracking under illumination or 1000 h at 85 &#176;C heating.

         <title>Novel Sodium Rare Earth Silicate Solid Electrolyte with Grain Boundary Electronic Insulation for Ultra&#8208;Durable Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a facile grain boundary modification strategy is conducted by introducing a second phase of Na1.5Y2.5F9 into the grain boundaries of the Na5YSi4O12 solid electrolyte. Thus, ultra&#8208;durable solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries are achieved.








Abstract
Sodium rare earth silicate is regarded as a novel and promising solid electrolyte (SE) for solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries (SSSMBs) because the merits of high ionic conductivity, low sintering temperature, and excellent chemical stability. However, impurity phases and voids induced by sintering always cause weak ion conduction and large electron conduction at grain boundaries, resulting in the growth of Na dendrites. Herein, a facile grain boundary modification strategy is conducted by introducing a second phase of Na1.5Y2.5F9 into the grain boundaries of Na5YSi4O12. The Na1.5Y2.5F9 phase can not only effectively impede the migration of electrons and reduce the bulk resistance and grain boundary resistance, but also improve the densification and mechanical strength of SE. Consequently, the Na/Na symmetric cell delivers a large critical current density of 0.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 9000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.05 mAh cm&#8722;2 without dendrite formation. Moreover, the assembled full cell achieves excellent cycling stability at 1 C for 750 cycles with a capacity retention of 70.2% and enhanced rate capability of 113.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 C. This work lays a foundation to develop high&#8208;performance sodium rare earth silicate&#8208;based SE for ultra&#8208;durable SSSMBs.

         <title>High&#8208;CRI White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors with Ultrathin Emissive Layers for Full&#8208;Color Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;CRI white OLETs are realized by incorporating ultrathin yellow and red phosphorescent emitters into a blue TADF layer, achieving a CRI of 92&#8212;the highest among UEML devices. Leveraging this performance, a 12&#160;&#215;&#160;20 array serves as a planar backlight, delivering vivid full&#8208;color images with clear spatial definition and a wide color gamut covering 117% of the NTSC standard.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) have attracted increasing interest as promising multifunctional three&#8208;terminal optoelectronic devices for next&#8208;generation active&#8208;matrix flat&#8208;panel displays. The development of high color rendering index (CRI) white OLETs is essential for full&#8208;color display applications demanding excellent color fidelity. However, it remains challenging with the conventional approach of doping multiple guest emitters into a host matrix, requiring precise control needed over doping concentrations. Herein, a strategy is presented to fabricate high&#8208;CRI white OLETs using ultrathin emissive layers (UEMLs). This approach enables simple fabrication and efficient exciton management through 2D energy transfer across adjacent layers. The integrated OLET architecture uniquely combines electrical switching with high&#8208;quality white light emission. The resulting devices incorporating thickness&#8208;optimized yellow and red UEMLs exhibit uniform area emission with a low turn&#8208;on voltage below 6&#160;V and a CRI exceeding 90. These are amongst the best performance values reported to date for ultrathin non&#8208;doped electroluminescent devices. Furthermore, a 12&#160;&#215;&#160;20 OLET pixel array is fabricated and employed as a planar backlight, enabling a color gamut coverage of 117% of the national television standards committee (NTSC) standard and vivid full&#8208;color image display. This work provides a promising pathway for scalable, high&#8208;quality full&#8208;color OLET displays.

         <dc:description>
Atomically thin 2D metals exhibit unique structural, electronic, and physicochemical features distinct from conventional bulk or nanostructure counterparts. This review categorises their crystalline configurations, elaborates topotactic, top&#8208;down, and bottom&#8208;up synthetic strategies, and explores structure&#8208;property correlations through doping, heterostructures, and phase/strain engineering. These insights highlight emerging functionalities in catalysis, electronics, quantum transport, and biointerfaces enabled by &#229;ngstr&#246;m&#8208;scale design.








Abstract
Atomically thin 2D metals, also termed metallenes, constitute a distinctive class of 2D materials in which metallic bonding is preserved at the &#229;ngstr&#246;m scale. Quantum confinement imparts ultrahigh carrier mobility, tunable plasmonic resonances, and exposed surfaces composed of low&#8208;coordination active sites. Although &#8220;2D metals&#8221; have historically encompassed various metallic nanostructures, recent breakthroughs have enabled the isolation of structurally well&#8208;defined metallenes with ambient stability and quantum&#8208;confined properties not observed in their bulk counterparts. This review provides a comprehensive overview of metallene research, focusing on their synthetic chemistry, low&#8208;dimensional metrics, and structure&#8208;function relationships. This unified framework provides cross&#8208;disciplinary insights for rational design in catalysis, plasmonics, electronics, and biomedical applications. Rigorous criteria are first established to distinguish true monolayer metals from quasi&#8208;2D nanosheets, emphasizing bonding anisotropy, lattice continuity, and spectroscopic fingerprints. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication strategies are then benchmarked for scalability and technology readiness. Next, the engineering toolbox, including doping, hierarchical hetero&#8208;structuring, and defect/phase/strain modulation, is surveyed, which tailors these intrinsic traits and translates them into record performances across diverse applications. Finally, outstanding challenges, including thermodynamic metastability, limited synthetic precision, unclear dynamic structure&#8208;function relationships, and device integration, and delineate research directions aimed at accelerating the rational design and practical implementation of metallenes are outlined.

         <title>Ductile Inorganic Ferromagnetic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current plastic inorganic semiconductors remain scarce, with functionalities limited to electrical and thermal properties. Herein, the first ductile inorganic ferromagnetic semiconductor CrSiTe3 with exceptional room&#8208;temperature plasticity (12% tensile strain) and robust ferromagnetism below 34&#160;K is reported. Theoretical calculations reveal that interlayer slip enables deformability while preserving magnetic order. This study significantly expands the functionality of plastic inorganic semiconductors. 








Abstract
Ductile/Plastic inorganic semiconductors have garnered significant attention for their potential in flexible electronics, yet their current diversity remains limited, with functionalities largely confined to thermal and/or electrical properties. Here, the first intrinsically ductile/plastic inorganic ferromagnetic semiconductor, bulk CrSiTe3 van der Waals (vdW) crystals, which combine excellent deformability with ferromagnetism, is reported. Mechanical characterization reveals excellent plasticity at room temperature, with CrSiTe3 crystals sustaining up to 12% tensile strain, surpassing many existing plastic bulk vdW semiconductors. Below the Curie temperature of 34&#160;K, the material retains ferromagnetic ordering, with plasticity exerting negligible effects on Curie temperature or saturation magnetization. First&#8208;principles calculations attribute the exceptional deformability to low interlayer slip energy barriers and high cleavage energy within Te&#8208;terminated vdW layers, enabling interlayer gliding without fracture. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that interlayer slip minimally perturbs magnetic interactions, preserving ferromagnetism. This work bridges the gap between mechanical plasticity, semiconductivity, and ferromagnetism in a single material, extending the functionality of plastic inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>Graphene&#8211;Vanadium Oxide Heterojunction Boosting Electron&#8211;Ion Coupling for Ultrahigh Energy Density Carbon Fiber Structural Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers the design of ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density carbon fiber structural supercapacitors using H2V3O8/rGO electrode coating. Density functional theory calculations and kinetic analyses reveales the underlying mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations highly relevant to practical applications are carried out, including mechanical tensile tests, as well as electrochemical behavior under compressive loading (0&#8211;120&#160;kPa) and even structural damage conditions. 








Abstract
The rapid advancement of drone logistics and electric aviation has created a growing demand for carbon fiber structural supercapacitors (CF&#8211;SSCs) that combine energy storage with lightweight and structural functionality. However, achieving high energy density remains challenging due to the chemical inertness of carbon fiber. In this work, it is demonstrated that H2V3O8/rGO is a promising and high&#8208;performance electrode coating for carbon fiber structural supercapacitors that possess both ultrahigh energy density and load&#8208;bearing functionality. Herein, a simple and efficient one&#8208;step high&#8208;temperature mixing hydrothermal method is developed to synthesize H2V3O8/rGO. Density functional theory calculations reveal that strong interfacial synergy between rGO and H2V3O8 promotes electron transport and Li+ diffusion, boosting efficient electron&#8211;ion coupling. The device exhibits high capacitance (964&#160;mF&#160;g&#8722;1) and exceptional energy density (502.1&#160;mWh&#160;kg&#8722;1), exceeding previously reported values. Remarkably, it maintains 88% capacitance retention after 5&#8201;000 cycles at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 under a compressive load of 120&#160;kPa, exceeding the 83% retention without load, demonstrating excellent electrochemical load&#8208;bearing stability. In addition, the device shows robust mechanical properties (127.2&#160;MPa tensile strength, 6.95&#160;GPa tensile modulus) and high safety, offering strong potential for practical application. This study proposes a promising strategy for designing CF&#8211;SSCs with high energy density.

         <title>High Iontronic Performance in Organic Electrochemical Transistors Enabled by Intramolecular Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The limited transconductance of OECTs has hindered their development in bioelectronics. To address this issue, a molecular design strategy is developed involving finely tuning the intramolecular noncovalent interactions within the active layer. Consequently, transconductance increases with increasing the interaction strength, with a record&#8208;high geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance of 415&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 being achieved.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) show great potential in bioelectronics due to their iontronic coupling, low driving voltages (&lt;1&#8201;V), and biocompatibility. Nevertheless, their low iontronic performance, particularly in terms of transconductance (gm), limits their ability to acquire high&#8208;precision biosignals. To address this issue, a series of poly(bithiophene)s (opg2T&#8208;O, opg2T&#8208;S, and opg2T&#8208;Se) bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;position glycol side chains are synthesized. Upon varying furan, thiophene, and selenophene comonomers, the intramolecular noncovalent interactions are systematically tuned. Comprehensive theoretical analyses reveal that opg2T&#8208;Se demonstrates stronger intramolecular Se&#183;&#183;&#183;O noncovalent interactions than the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions in opg2T&#8208;S and opg2T&#8208;O, affording a more planar and rigid molecular configuration in opg2T&#8208;Se. Meanwhile, opg2T&#8208;Se exhibits closer &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and lamellar&#8208;packing and prefers an edge&#8208;on orientation. Consequently, a record&#8208;high geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,n) of 415&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, along with remarkable hole mobility (&#181; = 2.99&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) and volumetric capacitance (C* = 423.3&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3) are achieved in opg2T&#8208;Se based OECTs. Importantly, the opg2T&#8208;Se&#8208;based devices exhibits much higher signal fidelity in in&#8208;vitro human electrocardiogram (ECG) than the other two devices. This study highlights the importance of intramolecular noncovalent interaction in the channel layer materials for achieving high&#8208;performance OECTs.

A self&#8208;powered MVTS enables 360&#176; wind sensing via vortex&#8208;induced vibration, magnetic tuning, and triboelectric transduction. Dual&#8208;channel frequency decoding and a Regression Transformer achieve &lt;5% wind speed and &lt;1&#176; direction errors. Material and charge stability are enhanced via interface optimization and electrostatic compensation. The system shows robust performance under &#8722;28&#160;&#176;C and sandstorm conditions, offering an integrated solution for intelligent wind monitoring in harsh environments.








Abstract
Reliable and real&#8208;time wind field sensing is critical for environmental monitoring and distributed meteorological forecasting. However, conventional solutions often suffer from structural complexity and poor adaptability to harsh environments. In this work, a magneto&#8208;vortex triboelectric sensing system (MVTS) is developed by coupling a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with a vortex&#8208;induced vibration (VIV) structure and magnetically reinforced elastic elements. The system converts wind&#8208;induced oscillations into electrical signals and supports full 360&#176; wind direction decoding through a dual&#8208;channel frequency difference mechanism. Material&#8208;level optimization using FEP, nylon, and rabbit&#8208;fur electrostatic compensation enhances environmental resilience and long&#8208;term signal stability. A deep learning model, Regression Transformer (ReT), is constructed to extract temporal and frequency domain features from multichannel TENG signals, enabling high&#8208;accurate prediction of wind speed and direction. Controlled indoor experiments confirm a maximum wind speed error of 0.69&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1, with prediction errors consistently below 5% and a wind direction error within 1&#176;. Additional validations under &#8722;28&#160;&#176;C low&#8208;temperature conditions and wind&#8208;sand environments demonstrate the system's robust operation and strong environmental adaptability. This work provides a resilient, intelligent, and fully integrated solution for autonomous wind field monitoring in data&#8208;scarce, infrastructure&#8208;limited, and extreme outdoor scenarios.

         <title>PiP&#8208;Plex: A Particle&#8208;in&#8208;Particle System for Multiplexed Quantification of Proteins Secreted by Single Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detecting proteins secreted by a single cell while retaining its viability remains challenging. A particles&#8208;in&#8208;particle (PiPs) system made by co&#8208;encapsulating barcoded microparticles (BMPs) with a single cell inside an alginate hydrogel particle is introduced. Multiple proteins secreted by single cells (PiP&#8208;plex) are quantified via sandwich immunoassays on the BMPs by fluorescence confocal microscopy, while keeping cells alive and retrievable.








Abstract
Cell signaling is modulated by the secretion of various proteins, which can be used to infer a cell's phenotype. However, these proteins cannot be readily detected in multiplex by commonly used methods at the single&#8208;cell level. Here we present PiP&#8208;plex a particles&#8208;in&#8208;particle (PiPs) system for multiplex protein secretion analysis by confocal microscopy. PiP&#8208;plex&#8208;comprises (i) fluorescence intensity barcoded microparticles (BMPs) co&#8208;entrapped with (ii) a single cell inside an alginate hydrogel particle. We found that PiPs maintained &gt;90% cellular viability and allowed live cells retrieval. A seven&#8208;plex fluorescent barcoding and concomitant sandwich immunoassay in PiPs was developed with limits of detection ranging from 0.8 pg mL&#8722;1 to 2&#160;ng mL&#8722;1 depending on the protein. PiP&#8208;plex assays were benchmarked with bulk immunoassays and found to rival or outperform them. Proteins secreted by single THP&#8208;1 cells upon exposure to lipopolysaccharide were measured by PiP&#8208;plex and varying cell responses detected, including a significant increase in MIP&#8208;1&#945;, TNF&#8208;&#945;, and IL&#8208;17A; MIP&#8208;1&#945; and IL&#8208;17A were the most frequently secreted cytokines, while other cytokines were typically co&#8208;secreted. Using PiP&#8208;plex, we analyzed &#8776;750 THP&#8208;1 cells, showcasing its potential for characterizing cells and cell&#8208;based therapeutics for e.g. cancer immunotherapies.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Dependent Excitonic States in Twisted Bilayer WSe2/Fe5GeTe2 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel spin&#8208;dependent hybrid exciton T* is identified in both 3R and 2H&#8208;BL WSe2/FGT heterostructures. It originates from the coupling between the injected spin&#8208;polarized electrons from FGT and the neutral excitons in BL WSe2 under the spin&#8208;cross&#8208;polarized band mechanism. Furthermore, the T* exciton coupling strength variation stems from distinct twisted BL WSe2 stacking symmetries.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have generated diverse unusual electrical and optical phenomena and can provide a powerful platform for designing nanodevices with tunable interlayer interaction. Striving to explore novel excitons with spin response in these semiconductor systems is highly desirable, as they highlight the possibility to access complex electronic band structure and magneto&#8208;exciton effect, thereby facilitating efficient spin&#8208;based information storage via exciton degrees of freedom. Here, fabrication of bilayer WSe2/Fe5GeTe2 (FGT) heterostructures with different stacking phases is reported, and a new hybridized excitonic state T* is defined in both 3R and 2H bilayer WSe2, which exhibits strong correlations dependent on the FGT spin order. This spin&#8208;dependent hybridized exciton is demonstrated to originate from the coupling between injected spin&#8208;polarized electrons and neutral excitons, because of the spin&#8208;cross&#8208;polarized band that obstructs the normal electron&#8211;hole annihilation process. Besides, the difference in the coupling strength of the T* exciton attributed to the distinct stacking symmetries in twisted bilayer WSe2 is further unveiled. These findings open an accessible avenue for designing tailored excitonic states in twisted bilayers, thus offering prospects for the future applications of stacking&#8208;engineered opto&#8208;spintronics at the integration level.

         <title>Bioinspired Swelling&#8208;Deswelling Strategy Unlocks Synergistic Molecular Solar Thermal&#8208;Fabric Systems for Personal Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Atriplex centralasiatica's salt secretion, a swelling&#8208;deswelling strategy for hollow aerogel fibers (HAFs) is developed to create synergistically promoted MOST&#8208;fabric systems (SPMFS), resolving interfacial incompatibility between MOST molecules and fabrics. SPMFS exhibits enhanced mechanical robustness, photothermal performance, and good durability under cyclic stretching, rubbing, and washing, paving the way for next&#8208;generation wearable personal thermal management (PTM) systems.








Abstract
Molecular solar thermal (MOST) fabrics represent a transformative approach to personal thermal management (PTM) through their capability to control the storage and release of solar energy. Nevertheless, the critical challenge of interfacial incompatibility between MOST molecules and fabrics persists, resulting in compromised robustness and suboptimal energy conversion efficiency. Here, inspired by the salt absorption&#8208;secretion mechanism of Atriplex centralasiatica, an innovative swelling&#8208;deswelling strategy tailored for hollow aerogel fibers (HAFs) is developed, creating a synergistically promoted MOST&#8208;fabric system (SPMFS) with concurrent enhancements in mechanical robustness and photothermal performance. During the swelling&#8208;deswelling process, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) chains undergo reorganization into a densified network, while the simultaneous secretion of azobenzene (Azo) forms dense, uniform monocrystalline layers. The resultant SPMFS exhibits notable mechanical improvements, with a 48% increase in breaking strain and 129% enhancement in tensile strength. Equally striking are its photothermal capabilities, achieving an enhanced photo&#8208;charging and photo&#8208;discharging (&gt;94% photoconversion) alongside a uniformly distributed high energy density of 7.5 kJ m&#8722;2. Moreover, the SPMFS enables programmable rapid thermal management, showcases impressive durability under long&#8208;term washing, cyclic stretching, and rubbing, and realizes controllable photothermal physiotherapy. This bioinspired strategy lays the groundwork for next&#8208;generation wearable PTM systems and establishes a framework for future PTM device design

         <title>Dual&#8208;Zone Chloride Engineering to Enable Ultra&#8208;Stable Two&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the polyiodide desorption effect induced by high&#8208;concentration ZnCl2 electrolytes within organic iodine hosts is elucidated. By coupling hydrophobic chloride salt&#8208;reconstructed cathodes with high&#8208;voltage chloride&#8208;deficient electrolytes, this effect is effectively eliminated while solving the limited reversibility of two&#8208;electron iodine conversion process, thereby realizing ultra&#8208;stable high&#8208;energy zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (up to 35,000 cycles).








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs) with organic iodine hosts that harness the I&#8722;/I+ conversion offer a promising route to high&#8208;energy storage but remain limited by rapid capacity decay. Conventional approaches employing high&#8208;concentration ZnCl2 electrolytes effectively activate I&#8722;/I+ conversion in carbon hosts but prove incompatible with organic systems. Here, its excess free Cl&#8722; is identified to displace polyiodide from organic iodine hosts, thereby triggering an irreversible I&#8722;/I+ process. To address this, a dual&#8208;zone chloride engineering strategy is introduced that spatially separates chloride environments into complementary domains. At the cathode, a non&#8208;dissociative hydrophobic salt (trioctylmethylammonium chloride) establishes a confined Cl&#8722;&#8208;rich, water&#8208;deficient environment, suppressing polyiodide desorption and preventing hydrolytic I&#8314; decomposition. In the electrolyte, a chloride&#8208;liberating salt (0.2 m ZnCl2) dissolved in a glycerol&#8208;water solvent replenishes free Cl&#8722; to fully activate I0/I&#8314; conversion while enhancing high&#8208;voltage tolerance. This cooperative design delivers an organic&#8208;based two&#8208;electron ZIB with 87.0% capacity retention over 11,000 cycles, and validates its universality in a carbon&#8208;based ZIB retaining 87.2% capacity after 35,000 cycles. By uniting cathodic confinement with electrolyte liberation, dual&#8208;zone chloride engineering establishes a generalizable framework for stabilizing two&#8208;electron iodine redox chemistry, paving the way toward durable, high&#8208;energy aqueous ZIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Here, the polyiodide desorption effect induced by high-concentration ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes within organic iodine hosts is elucidated. By coupling hydrophobic chloride salt-reconstructed cathodes with high-voltage chloride-deficient electrolytes, this effect is effectively eliminated while solving the limited reversibility of two-electron iodine conversion process, thereby realizing ultra-stable high-energy zinc-iodine batteries (up to 35,000 cycles).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc-iodine batteries (ZIBs) with organic iodine hosts that harness the I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conversion offer a promising route to high-energy storage but remain limited by rapid capacity decay. Conventional approaches employing high-concentration ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes effectively activate I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conversion in carbon hosts but prove incompatible with organic systems. Here, its excess free Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is identified to displace polyiodide from organic iodine hosts, thereby triggering an irreversible I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; process. To address this, a dual-zone chloride engineering strategy is introduced that spatially separates chloride environments into complementary domains. At the cathode, a non-dissociative hydrophobic salt (trioctylmethylammonium chloride) establishes a confined Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-rich, water-deficient environment, suppressing polyiodide desorption and preventing hydrolytic I&#8314; decomposition. In the electrolyte, a chloride-liberating salt (0.2 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) dissolved in a glycerol-water solvent replenishes free Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to fully activate I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/I&#8314; conversion while enhancing high-voltage tolerance. This cooperative design delivers an organic-based two-electron ZIB with 87.0% capacity retention over 11,000 cycles, and validates its universality in a carbon-based ZIB retaining 87.2% capacity after 35,000 cycles.

         <title>Synergistic Microstructure and Composition Engineering via Na2S Enables High&#8208;Performance Porous PbTe Thermoelectrics with Ultrahigh Device Power Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na2S&#8208;driven microstructure and composition co&#8208;design enables the simultaneous formation of hierarchical porosity and effective Na incorporation in PbTe&#8208;based thermoelectrics, promoting enhanced phonon scattering and optimized carrier transport properties. This integrated approach yields a record&#8208;high power density of 2.2&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#916;T&#160;=&#160;375&#160;K in thermoelectric modules, establishing a scalable route toward efficient and cost&#8208;effective mid&#8208;temperature energy conversion.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) materials, capable of directly converting heat into electricity, offer a promising route for sustainable energy recovery. However, practical deployment is limited by the difficulty in simultaneously optimizing electrical and thermal transport properties. In this study, a synergistic microstructure&#8208;composition co&#8208;design strategy for enhancing the performance of PbTe&#8208;based TEs via Na2S&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;state synthesis is presented. The thermal decomposition of Na2S not only introduces hierarchical porosity but also facilitates initial Na doping, enabling the concurrent optimization of phonon scattering, carrier concentration, and band convergence. The optimized composition, Pb0.97Na0.03Te&#8208;1.0%Na2S, exhibits refined grains, dispersed Na2Te nanoprecipitates, and a high density of dislocations, leading to ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.50&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at 750&#160;K) while preserving excellent electrical transport. A peak TE figure of merit zT&#8776;2.2 at 823&#160;K and a high average zT &#8776;1.9 across 623&#8211;823&#160;K are achieved. To validate the device&#8208;level applicability, single&#8208;leg TE modules are fabricated, achieving a high conversion efficiency of 13.4% at &#916;T&#160;= 395&#160;K, which is among the best reported for a PbTe&#8208;based system. Furthermore, a unicouple module integrated with n&#8208;type skutterudite reaches a record power density of 2.2&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#916;T&#160;=&#160;375&#160;K. This study highlights a scalable pathway for advancing mid&#8208;temperature TE materials and devices through structural and compositional engineering.

         <title>Personal Moisture Management by Advanced Textiles and Intelligent Wearables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in personal moisture management (PMM) through advanced textiles and intelligent wearables, evolving from traditional methods like wicking and evaporation to cutting&#8208;edge innovations such as directional water transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive textiles, and AI&#8208;driven wearables. It also highlights PMM&#8208;enabled applications in health monitoring, energy harvesting, and thermoregulation, while addressing challenges in durability, scalability, and adaptability with intelligent, sustainable solutions.








Abstract
As global climate change intensifies, personal moisture management (PMM) is increasingly crucial for regulating body temperature and near&#8208;skin humidity, sustaining comfort, health, and productivity. Advances in textile materials and wearable technologies are moving PMM beyond traditional wicking&#8208;drying and waterproof&#8208;breathable designs toward directional sweat transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive control, and integration with personal thermal management (PTM). Advanced textiles and intelligent wearables enable more efficient, adaptive PMM; meanwhile, effective PMM enhances sensing performance and long&#8208;term comfort of wearable systems, and supports sweat&#8208;based health monitoring and energy harvesting, forming closed&#8208;loop, intelligent comfort&#8208;health&#8208;performance ecosystems. This review critically discusses PMM mechanisms and designs from capillary wicking and evaporation/diffusion to directional water transport and responsive moisture regulation, alongside manufacturing strategies spanning advanced fibers, nanoengineering, bioinspired architectures, smart polymers, and wearable electronics. PMM&#8208;enabled implementations in health monitoring and energy harvesting are introduced, and elucidate coupled moisture&#8208;heat transport to guide the co&#8208;optimization of PMM and PTM. Finally, key challenges are outlined, including sweat accumulation, reduced durability and washability, limited manufacturing scalability, and insufficient cross&#8209;scenario adaptability, and offer potential solutions, particularly AI&#8209;enabled pathways for intelligent, sustainable, next&#8209;generation PMM textiles and wearables.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explains how advanced numerical simulation techniques can be utilized to analyze the light&#8208;heat&#8208;water interactions in solar evaporation systems. It objectively explores the underlying mechanisms and energy transfer processes behind clean water production. The study points out possible sources of errors and limitations in large&#8208;scale applications and provides a perspective on the future of low&#8208;carbon water&#8208;energy technologies.








Abstract
Multifunctional solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) systems have emerged as a critical technology for clean water production. Advances in evaporator design and component optimization have significantly enhanced their performance, enabling highly efficient operation in small&#8208;scale applications such as seawater desalination and steam sterilization, even under extreme environmental conditions. Nevertheless, critical mechanisms remain insufficiently resolved: light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion dynamics and interfacial interactions during evaporation, synergistic thermal confinement and management strategies, and water transport/activation mechanisms at solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;gas interfaces mediated by suspended materials. This review systematically examines unsystematized photothermal&#8208;water conversion processes and cross&#8208;disciplinary application scenarios through analysis of archetypal evaporator configurations. By adopting an integrated multi&#8208;scale analysis framework and leveraging advanced computational modeling techniques, the metrological significance of performance metrics, inherent measurement uncertainties, and fundamental value&#8208;translation mechanisms in specialized implementations is elucidated. Concurrently, intrinsic limitations hindering large&#8208;scale deployment are identified, providing critical insights into scalability challenges across diverse operational contexts. This approach establishes a comprehensive theoretical foundation for optimizing next&#8208;generation SDIE systems while providing data references for cross&#8208;disciplinary advancement in the sustainable application of thermophotovoltaic evaporation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Protonated Porphyrin Dimer Nanoparticles with an 83.7% Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion Efficiency for Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation&#8208;manipulation molecular self&#8208;assembly of TAPP leads to the formation of protonated dimer that facilitate the transition from a saddle&#8208;shaped conformation to a quinone&#8208;like resonance structure. These structures enhance intermolecular exciton coupling, significantly improving NIR absorption and efficiently converting light into heat for TAPP NIR&#8208;NPs. This process achieves an impressive PCE of up to 83.7%, surpassing that of traditional porphyrin&#8208;derived PTAs.








Abstract
Despite the immense potential of near&#8208;infrared photothermal therapy (NIR PTT) for tumor treatment, the development of photothermal agents (PTAs) with high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) remains a substantial challenge. Here, a &#8220;protonation&#8208;manipulation molecular self&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy is presented that precisely regulates the protonation of the pyrrole nitrogen in 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPP), while maintaining the availability of the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atoms in the aniline substituents. The resulting protonated dimers facilitate the formation of a robust saddle&#8208;shaped conformation and a quinone&#8208;like resonance structure, which subsequently self&#8208;assemble into near&#8208;infrared nanoparticles (NIR NPs). These protonated dimers enhance intermolecular exciton coupling, significantly improving absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region. The photoexcitation process of TAPP NIR NPs is primarily governed by non&#8208;radiative transitions, achieving an impressive PCE of up to 83.7%, markedly surpassing that of organic PTAs such as dopamine and traditional porphyrin derivatives. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that NIR NPs effectively eliminate tumor cells while exhibiting excellent biocompatibility.

     alt="Self-Assembled Protonated Porphyrin Dimer Nanoparticles with an 83.7% Near-Infrared Photothermal Conversion Efficiency for Antitumor Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protonation-manipulation molecular self-assembly of TAPP leads to the formation of protonated dimer that facilitate the transition from a saddle-shaped conformation to a quinone-like resonance structure. These structures enhance intermolecular exciton coupling, significantly improving NIR absorption and efficiently converting light into heat for TAPP NIR-NPs. This process achieves an impressive PCE of up to 83.7%, surpassing that of traditional porphyrin-derived PTAs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the immense potential of near-infrared photothermal therapy (NIR PTT) for tumor treatment, the development of photothermal agents (PTAs) with high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) remains a substantial challenge. Here, a &#8220;protonation-manipulation molecular self-assembly&#8221; strategy is presented that precisely regulates the protonation of the pyrrole nitrogen in 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPP), while maintaining the availability of the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atoms in the aniline substituents. The resulting protonated dimers facilitate the formation of a robust saddle-shaped conformation and a quinone-like resonance structure, which subsequently self-assemble into near-infrared nanoparticles (NIR NPs). These protonated dimers enhance intermolecular exciton coupling, significantly improving absorption in the near-infrared region. The photoexcitation process of TAPP NIR NPs is primarily governed by non-radiative transitions, achieving an impressive PCE of up to 83.7%, markedly surpassing that of organic PTAs such as dopamine and traditional porphyrin derivatives. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that NIR NPs effectively eliminate tumor cells while exhibiting excellent biocompatibility. This work represents a significant advancement in performance optimization from the spectral regulation of supramolecular photosensitizers, introducing innovative methodologies for the design of aromatic nitrogen-containing PTAs functional molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergy of Block and Microporous Polymers with Tailored Zeolitic Imidazole Frameworks for Membrane&#8208;Based Direct Air Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin film composite membranes&#8208;based on PolyActive and polymer of intrinsic microporosity&#160;(PIM&#8208;1) are prepared and modified with zeolitic imidazole frameworks&#160;(ZIF) obtained by two&#8208;step solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange. Their direct air capture (DAC) performance is evaluated from 500&#160;ppm to 15% CO2. A multistage DAC study highlights polymer&#160;pairing andmodified ZIFs enhancing low&#8208;concentration CO2 capture.








Abstract
Direct air capture (DAC) concerns the separation from air of carbon dioxide (CO2), the most significant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, as a means of producing negative emissions. The challenge for the scientific and industrial communities is tremendous, and membrane technology is postulated as an efficient alternative in terms of energy, costs, and ease of implementation. Two polymers, commercial elastomeric PolyActive and high&#8208;performance polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;1), with complementary permeation&#8208;selectivity features, to form both dense and thin film composite membranes, are studied to operate in the 500&#160;ppm to 15% range of CO2 feed concentration and at 10&#8211;50 &#176;C temperatures. A study on its synergistic pairing for a multistage DAC process is evaluated and to enhance the separation performance, the membranes are modified with zeolitic imizadolate frameworks (ZIF), capable of modification by solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE). A sequential SALE process is designed using two different ligands, one hydrophilic and the other hydrophobic, to modify nanosized ZIF&#8208;8 and produce a ZIF with tailored ligand composition. This is aimed at improving both the CO2 interaction and compatibility of MOF with the membrane polymer, achieving at 500&#160;ppm a CO2 permeance of 1037 GPU with a CO2/N2 selectivity of 16.2.

         <title>Multifunctional Dithiol Crosslinking Additive Enables Highly Efficient and Stable Inkjet&#8208;Printed Perovskite Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive, 1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;mercaptobutyryloxy)butane (BD1), significantly enhances inkjet&#8208;printed perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes by simultaneously optimizing ink rheology, enabling defect passivation through dithiol and carbonyl interactions, and promoting cross&#8208;linking via thiol groups. These synergistic effects lead to the formation of robust and stable quantum dot film networks, resulting in a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 21.73%, highlighting BD1&#8217;s potential for high&#8208;performance quantum dot display applications.








Abstract
Inkjet printing provides a scalable, cost&#8208;effective approach for fabricating perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;QLEDs), particularly suited for high&#8208;resolution display applications. However, challenges such as poor ink printability and limited stability of perovskite quantum dots (Pe&#8208;QD) inks have impeded its widespread adoption. To overcome these limitations, 1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;mercaptobutyryloxy)butane (BD1), a dithiol&#8208;based cross&#8208;linkable additive is introduced to enable high&#8208;performance inkjet&#8208;printed Pe&#8208;QLEDs. BD1 serves three critical functions: i) it optimizes the rheological properties of the ink, promoting uniform droplet formation and adaptable inkjet printing process; ii) its thiol groups coordinate with under&#8208;coordinated Pb2&#8314; sites on the QD surface, mitigating ligand loss during ink formulation and deposition, thus reducing defect density and enhancing optical quality; and iii) it participates in a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction with oleic acid ligands, forming robust crosslinked networks that improve film integrity and device stability. By leveraging these synergistic effects, BD1&#8208;enabled Pe&#8208;QLEDs achieve a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 21.73%, a peak luminance of 30,637.82 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and an enhanced operational lifetime. This additive engineering strategy also demonstrates versatility across red and blue Pe&#8208;QLEDs, highlighting its broad applicability. Collectively, the findings position BD1 as a highly effective multifunctional additive for stabilizing and optimizing Pe&#8208;QD inks, paving the way for scalable production of high&#8208;resolution, full&#8208;color Pe&#8208;QLED displays and other printed optoelectronic devices.
