         <title>Sign&#8208;Switchable Poisson's Ratio Design for Bimodal Strain&#8208;to&#8208;Electrical Signal Transducing Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal strategy for constructing hybrid materials with sign&#8208;switchable Poisson's ratio is developed, enabling the material to switch between negative and positive Poisson's ratios. Upon integrating a pre&#8208;stretched silver nanowires film onto its surface, the device can switch its strain&#8208;resistance response between strain&#8208;insensitive and strain&#8208;dependent states due to the varying deformation characteristics.








Abstract
Stretchable electronic devices that conduct strain&#8208;related electronic performances have drawn extensive attention, functioning as mechanical sensors, actuators, and stretchable conductors. Although strain&#8208;insensitive or strain&#8208;responsive nature is well&#8208;achieved separately, it remains challenging to combine these two characteristics in one single device, which will offer versatile adaptability in various working situations. Herein, a hybrid material with sign&#8208;switchable Poisson's ratio (SSPR) is developed by combining a phase&#8208;change gel based reentrantreentrant honeycomb pattern and a polydimethylsiloxane film. The phase&#8208;change gel featuring thermally&#8208;regulated Young's modulus enables the hybrid material to switch between negative and positive Poisson's ratios. After integrating with a pre&#8208;stretched silver nanowires film, the obtained stretchable device performs bimodal strain&#8208;to&#8208;electrical signal transducing (Bi&#8208;SET) functions, in which the SSPR&#8208;dominated strain&#8208;resistance response switches between strain&#8208;dependent and strain&#8208;insensitive behaviors. As a proof of concept, a mode&#8208;switchable grasping system is constructed using a Bi&#8208;SET device&#8208;based controller, enabling the adaptation of grasping behaviors to various target objects.

         <title>Probiotics Bi&#8208;Enzymatic Cascade Repair System for Editing the Inflammatory Microenvironment to Boost Probiotic Therapy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel cascade repair system that enhances probiotic therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. By utilizing iMXene to neutralize harmful reactive oxygen species and delivering a gene&#8208;editing system, it activates the NLRP12 gene to reduce inflammation. The approach significantly improves intestinal health and restores microbial balance, showing promise for broader applications in managing inflammatory conditions.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease presents significant treatment challenges owing to its complex pathology. Although probiotics have shown promise as a therapeutic option, their effectiveness is often limited by low concentrations at sites of inflammation, exacerbated by excessive reactive oxygen species and inflammatory triggers. To address this, an innovative cascade repair system is developed to enhance probiotic therapeutic impact by modulating the intestinal microenvironment. This system uses iMXene's catalytic properties to neutralize reactive oxygen species in the gut and its capacity to deliver the CRISPR/dCas9 gene editing system to activate the NLR family pyrin domain containing 12 genes, helping suppress inflammation. By promoting the colonization of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, the system inhibits inflammation pathways and supports the restoration of a balanced intestinal flora through a cascade repair mechanism. These findings demonstrate significant therapeutic benefits in experimental models, with improvements in the overall well&#8208;being of treated mice and effective repair of intestinal inflammation damage. This pioneering approach holds promise for inflammatory bowel disease treatment and opens new avenues for managing other inflammatory conditions, offering valuable insights and guidance for future research into inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Manipulating Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling for Efficient Tin Halide Perovskite Blue LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel 2D perovskite (BrPMA)2SnBr4 with negligible intra&#8208;octahedral distortion and strong lattice rigidity via intermolecular interaction, which leads to a significantly reduced electron&#8211;phonon coupling and consequently excellent blue emission at room temperature, is designed. Finally, the Sn&#8208;based blue LED is successfully prepared for the first time with a EQE of 1.3% and a maximum brightness of 800&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional perovskites have opened up a new frontier in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) due to their excellent properties. However, concerns regarding the potential toxicity of Pb limited their commercial development. Sn&#8208;based perovskites are regarded as a promising candidate to replace Pb&#8208;based counterparts, while they generally exhibit strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling and consequently blue emission quenching at room temperature (RT), thus the Sn&#8208;based perovskite blue LED devices have not yet been reported. Herein, the luminescence properties are regulated by assembling a rigid organic skeleton within perovskite structure, and the protonated 4&#8208;bromobenzylamine (BrPMA+ = C7H9BrN+) is employed as A site cation to synthesize a 100&#8208;oriented 2D perovskite (BrPMA)2SnBr4, which exhibits a strong lattice rigidity via strong intermolecular interaction and consequently weak electron&#8211;phonon coupling, achieving the excellent blue PL emission at RT. The high quality (BrPMA)2SnBr4 perovskite thin films are obtained by further inhibiting oxidation and promoting crystallization. Finally, the Sn&#8208;based perovskite blue emission LED is successfully fabricated for the first time at 467&#160;nm with a champion EQE of 1.3% and a maximum brightness of 800&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This work gives insights into the luminescence mechanism of Sn&#8208;based perovskites and provides a new theoretical basis for the development of lead&#8208;free blue LEDs.

         <title>Extended Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Colloidal Quantum Dot Lasers with Nanosecond Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead sulphide (PbS) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are shown to be the first solution&#8208;processed gain medium to achieve lasing in the extended short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) spectral region. The size&#8208;dependent gain and charge dynamics are investigated to accurately predict, and realize, nanosecond lasing for the first time in PbS CQDs.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed gain media have great technological potential as lasers due to their ease of integration with on&#8208;chip photonics, scalability and tuneable optoelectronic properties. Currently, the spectral coverage of solution&#8208;processed lasers extends from visible up to telecom wavelengths in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) (&lt;1650&#160;nm). Here, the optical gain in the extended SWIR from 1600 nm to 2500&#160;nm is demonstrated, using PbSbased colloidal quantum dots (CQDs). This spectral region has many applications such as in LIDAR, biological imaging and environmental monitoring and is currently served by exotic, costly materials with limitedscalability. Using the CQDs in distributed feedback laser cavities, lasing with emission tuned between 2150 nm and 2500&#160;nm is reported. We show&#160;that due to the increased absorption cross&#8208;section of larger CQDs,&#160;the optical gain threshold is reduced by a factor of 36 compared to smaller&#8208;sized CQDs, reaching an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold down to 42 &#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, gain and lasing under nanosecond excitation are demonstrated for the first time from PbS CQDs and use transient absorption spectroscopy data to model nanosecond gain thresholds. This paves the way for realizing compact and practical CQD infrared lasers and potentially toward electrically driven laser diodes.

         <title>Ternary Compensation Enables High&#8208;sensitive Efficient Upconversion Device for NIR Visualization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic upconversion devices (UCDs) offer a promising alternative to crystalline photodiodes for infrared visualization, overcoming opacity and complex processes. A ternary compensation strategy is implemented in a non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based active layer, reducing dark current and enhancing detection. The device achieved 16.68% upconversion efficiency at 980 nm and features a large&#8208;area, lightweight, pixel&#8208;less, and semitransparent design, advancing infrared visualization technology.








Abstract
Beyond the crystalline photodiodes for infrared visualization, with the limitation of opacity and complex lithographic processes, organic upconversion device (UCD) have emerged as a potential alternative. In this research, a ternary compensation strategy is implemented in a non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based active layer to reduce the dark current of the detector and enhance its detection performance, which enables high&#8208;sensitive efficient upconversion device for near&#8208;infrared light (NIR) visualization. The device achieves an infrared&#8208;to&#8208;visible upconversion efficiency of 16.68% when resolving the 980 nm infrared signal at a power density of 0.4 mW cm&#8722;2. In addition, by replacing the semitransparent matrix electrodes, a large&#8208;area (12.25 cm2) is further fabricated, lightweight (6.5&#160;g containing encapsulation), pixel&#8208;less (equivalent resolution 1270 ppi), and semitransparent (AVT &#8776;40%) UCD with microsecond response time. The fabricated UCD is demonstrated in pixel&#8208;less active infrared naked&#8208;eye visualization and infrared counter&#8208;surveillance, fostering the advancement of infrared visualization technology.

         <title>Multifunctional Microneedle Patches Loaded With Engineered Nitric Oxide&#8208;Releasing Nanocarriers for Targeted and Synergistic Chronic Wound Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a multifunctional microneedle (MN) patch loaded with engineered nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing nanocarriers that encapsulate an antibacterial agent and are immobilized with Concanavalin A (Con A) and NO molecules for targeted and synergistic treatment of chronic wounds.








Abstract
Chronic wounds impose significant physical and mental burdens on patients. Nano&#8208;based formulations offer a promising strategy for chronic wound healing due to their non&#8208;invasive nature and enhanced biofilms penetration, but they often lack targeting capability or fail to achieve long&#8208;term and synergistic effects. In this work, a multifunctional microneedle (MN) patch loaded with engineered nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing nanocarriers are presented that encapsulate an antibacterial agent and are immobilized with Concanavalin A (Con A) and NO molecules for targeted and synergistic treatment of chronic wounds. With the assistance of MNs, the nanoparticles (NPs) can directly cross bacterial biofilms and be efficiently delivered to wound tissues, where they target harmful bacteria through the specific recognition between Con A and polysaccharides on bacterial surfaces, followed by the release of the encapsulated antimicrobial agent, thereby achieving effective antibacterial effect. Moreover, the NPs generate NO in a sustained manner as they dissociate in the wound tissue, which exerts potent anti&#8208;inflammatory action and benefits tissue regeneration, further promoting chronic wounds closure. Consequently, this work provides a novel MN patch loaded with engineered NPs designed for accelerating chronic wound healing through targeted and synergistic therapy.

         <title>Inverse Size&#8208;Scaling Ferroelectricity in Centrosymmetric Insulating Perovskite Oxide DyScO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In centrosymmetric DyScO3, nanoscale thickness gradient&#8208;induced nonpolar&#8208;polar transition is observed by atomically&#8208;resolved electron microscopy. Driven by surface charge transfer, the asymmetric Dy&#8208;Dy split and ferrodistortive octahedral order break the inversion symmetry. The inverse size&#8208;scaling ferroelectricity, prevailing in many perovskites with alternatively charged AOn+ and BO2n&#8722; (n &#8800; 0) layers, opens up a new era for novel ferroelectric study at low dimension.








Abstract
The breaking of inversion symmetry dictates the emergence of electric polarization, whose topological states in superlattices and bulks have received tremendous attention for their intriguing physics brought for novel device design. However, as for substrate oxides such as LaAlO3, KTaO3, RScO3 (R = rare earth element), their centrosymmetric trivial attributes make their functionality poorly explored. Here, the discovery of nanoscale thickness gradient&#8208;induced nonpolar&#8208;to&#8208;polar phase transition in band insulator DyScO3 is reported by using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy. As the free&#8208;standing specimen reduces to a critical thickness &#8776;5 nm, its inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken by surface charge transfer, which gives rise to asymmetric Dy atomic displacements and ferrodistortive octahedral order, as substantiated by the first&#8208;principles calculations. Apart from the observation of migratable polar vortex structures, the switchable electric polarization by applied electric field is demonstrated by the piezoresponse force microscopy experiments. Given the decisive role of critical size in generating ferroelectricity, a concept of &#8220;inverse size&#8208;scaling ferroelectric&#8221; is proposed to define a class of such materials. Distinct from the proper and improper ferroelectrics, the findings offer a new platform to explore novel low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectrics and device applications in the future.

         <title>Progress in the Stability of Small Molecule Acceptor&#8208;Based Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the stability challenges of organic solar cells with small molecule acceptors under stressors such as light, heat, oxygen, and moisture. It highlights the degradation mechanisms affecting chemical structure, morphology, and interfacial properties. Strategies for enhancing long&#8208;term stability are presented, along with key directions outlined for future research.








Abstract
Significant advancements in power conversion efficiency have been achieved in organic solar cells with small molecule acceptors. However, stability remains a primary challenge, impeding their widespread adoption in renewable energy applications. This review summarizes the degradation of different layers within the device structure in organic solar cells under varying conditions, including light, heat, moisture, and oxygen. For the photoactive layers, the chemical degradation pathways of polymer donors and small molecule acceptors are examined in detail, alongside the morphological stability of the bulk heterojunction structure, which plays a crucial role in device performance. The degradation mechanisms of commonly used anode and cathode interlayers and electrodes are addressed, as these layers significantly influence overall device efficiency and stability. Mitigation methods for the identified degradation mechanisms are provided in each section to offer practical insights for improving device longevity. Finally, an outlook presents the remaining challenges in achieving long&#8208;term stability, emphasizing research directions that require further investigation to enhance the reliability and performance of organic solar cells in real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>A Complex Concentrated Alloy with Record&#8208;High Strength&#8208;Toughness at 77 K</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assisted by domain&#8208;knowledge&#8208;informed machine learning, here a complex concentrated Fe35Co29Ni24Al10Ta2 alloy is designed, which uses twinnable L12 coherent nanoprecipitates in a high&#8208;volume fraction (&#8776;65 &#177; 3 vol.%) in a transformable FCC solid solution matrix. The combination of L12 twinning and FCC matrix transformation&#8208;induced plasticity are found to be highly effective in strengthening and strain hardening upon tensile straining at low temperature.








Abstract
High strength and large ductility, leading to a high material toughness (area under the stress&#8208;strain curve), are desirable for alloys used in cryogenic applications. Assisted by domain&#8208;knowledge&#8208;informed machine learning, here a complex concentrated Fe35Co29Ni24Al10Ta2 alloy is designed, which uses L12 coherent nanoprecipitates in a high volume fraction (&#8776;65 &#177; 3 vol.%) in a face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) solid solution matrix that undergoes FCC&#8208;to&#8208;body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) phase transformation upon tensile straining. Unlike FCC&#8208;to&#8208;BCT phase transformation involving brittle carbon&#8208;enriched martensite, the BCC martensite in this alloy does not cause brittleness at 77 K. The Fe35Co29Ni24Al10Ta2 multi&#8208;principal element alloy achieves a high yield strength &#8776;1.4&#160;GPa, a high work hardening rate &gt;4&#160;GPa, an ultimate tensile strength &#8776;2.25&#160;GPa, and a large uniform elongation &#8776;45%, leading to record&#8208;high material toughness compared with previous cryogenic alloys such as 316L series stainless steels and recent high&#8208;entropy alloys. The nanoprecipitates with nanoscale spacing (&#8776;7.5&#160;nm), apart from serving as dislocation obstacles for strengthening and dislocation sources for sustainable ductility, also undergo deformation twinning. Taken together, these mechanisms are found to be highly effective in strengthening and strain hardening upon tensile straining at liquid nitrogen temperature. These findings demonstrate how to effectively integrate strengthening mechanisms to synergize superior mechanical properties in special&#8208;purpose alloys.

         <title>Charge Carrier Density in Organic Semiconductors Modulates the Effective Capacitance: A Unified View of Electrolyte Gated Organic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A framework for electrolyte gated organic transistors (EGOTs) that unifies electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) with organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is proposed. The effective capacitance that drives the device response arises from in series capacitances of device interfaces and the chemical capacitance of the organic semiconductor. The model predicts the shape of the transfer curve of EGOTs (p&#8208;/n&#8208;type and ambipolar).








Abstract
A framework for electrolyte&#8208;gated organic transistors (EGOTs) that unifies the view of interfacial capacitive coupling of electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) with the volumetric capacitive coupling in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is proposed. The EGOT effective capacitance arises from in&#8208;series capacitances of the electrolyte/gate electrode and electrolyte/channel interfaces, and the chemical capacitance of the organic semiconductor channel whose weight with respect to the interfacial capacitance is modulated by the charge carrier density, hence by the gate voltage. The expression for chemical capacitance is derived from the DOS of the organic semiconductor, which it is assumed to exhibit exponential energy disorder in the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. The analytical expression of the EGOT current is assessed on experimental data and shown to accurately predict the shape of the whole transfer curve of an EGOT thus allowing to extract accurate values for the switch&#8208;on voltage and the interfacial transconductance, without assumptions on specific response regime and, in OECT, without invoking the volumetric capacitance. Interestingly, the EGOT model recovers EGOFET and OECT as limit cases and, in the latter case, explicitly represents the volumetric capacitance in terms of the energy disorder and the bandgap of the organic semiconductor.

         <title>Scanning Acousto&#8208;Optoelectric Spectroscopy on a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy and surface acoustic waves provide a powerful tool for investigating charge carrier dynamics in 2D materials. When interacting with the 2D semiconductor WSe2, dynamic acoustic Poole&#8211;Frenkel activation of traps enhances the optical emission efficiency. The sub&#8208;nanosecond modulation of the optical signal serves as a sensitive local probe of defects and charge carrier trapping sites.








Abstract
The charge carrier dynamics are investigated by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) inside a WSe2 monolayer on LiNbO3 by scanning acousto&#8208;optoelectric spectroscopy. A strong enhancement of the PL emission intensity is observed almost over the entire area of the flake. This enhancement increases with increasing amplitude of the wave and is especially strong at or in the vicinity to defects. The latter is attributed to the SAW&#8208;driven Poole&#8211;Frenkel activation of trapped charge carriers bound to trapping sites at these defects. In addition, the PL intensity exhibit clear periodic modulations at the SAW's frequency&#160;fSAW and at 2 fSAW. These modulations are clear and unambiguous fingerprints of spatio&#8208;temporal carrier dynamics driven by the SAW. These occur on sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales which are found in good agreement with calculated exciton dissociation times. Mapping and analyzing both effects, this study shows that scanning acousto&#8208;electric spectroscopy provides a highly sensitive and local contact&#8208;free probe which uncovers distinct local features not resolved by conventional quasi&#8208;static photoluminescence techniques. The method is ideally suited to study carrier transport in 2D and other types of nanoscale materials and to reveal dynamic exciton modulation, and carrier localization and activation dynamics in the technologically important megahertz to gigahertz frequency range.

         <title>Selective Control of Electric Charge of Weyl Fermions in Pyrochlore Iridates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous studies about Weyl fermions have mostly focused on the magnetic charges, while the electric charges are rarely explored. This work reports an intriguing linear scaling relationship between the anomalous Hall conductivity and Hall carrier density in strained Nd2Ir2O7 thin films, which points to the essential role of correlation between magnetic and electric charges in Weyl fermions.








Abstract
Weyl fermions can exhibit exotic phenomena due to their magnetic charge in momentum space, while Weyl nodes are usually located away from Fermi energy, which forms electron or hole pockets as the electric charges. Previous studies have mostly focused on the magnetic charge, however, the electric charges are rarely explored. Here, the intriguing Hall responses arising from the interplay between magnetic and electric charges of Weyl fermions in pyrochlore iridates are reported. Explicitly, unexpected linear scaling is observed between the anomalous Hall conductivity and Hall carrier density in strained Nd2Ir2O7 thin films, and its slope shows a sign change approaching the N&#233;el temperature of Nd. Theoretical calculations unveil that the cluster magnetic multipoles induce local energy inversion of Weyl nodes, which alters the electric charge of Weyl fermions and accounts for the observed nontrivial Hall responses. Moreover, the correlation between the magnetic and electric charges is further probed by voltage&#8208;controlled hydrogenation, which leads to the suppression of the anomalous Hall effect through electron filling. This work not only reveals the essential role of the both magnetic and electric charges of Weyl fermions, but also demonstrates the hydrogenation as an effective tuning knob in exploring correlated topological properties.

         <title>Measurement of Enhanced Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling Strength for Donor&#8208;Bound Electron Spins in Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant enhancement in spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) within multi&#8208;donor silicon quantum dots is demonstrated, showing SOC strengths up to 40 &#181;eV, surpassing previous benchmarks by two orders of magnitude. This advancement paves the way for precise all&#8208;electrical control of donor&#8208;bound spins and improved coupling to superconducting resonators, marking a crucial step forward in quantum computing.








Abstract
While traditionally considered a deleterious effect in quantum dot spin qubits, the spin&#8208;orbit interaction is recently being revisited as it allows for rapid coherent control by on&#8208;chip AC electric fields. For electrons in bulk silicon, spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) is intrinsically weak, however, it can be enhanced at surfaces and interfaces, or through atomic placement. Here it is showed that the strength of the spin&#8208;orbit coupling can be locally enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude in the manybody wave functions of multi&#8208;donor quantum dots compared to a single donor, reaching strengths so far only reported for holes or two&#8208;donor system with certain symmetry. These findings may provide a pathway toward all&#8208;electrical control of donor&#8208;bound spins in silicon using electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR).

         <title>Atomic Dispersed Co on NC@Cu Core&#8208;Shells for Solar Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell photocatalyst comprising atomic&#8208;dispersed Co and plasmonic Cu nanoparticles is developed for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production from seawater. This photocatalyst achieves strong synergy between the reaction environment, broad light absorption, plasmonic electric field, and active atomic sites, thereby enabling optimal seawater hydrogen production through redox reactions.








Abstract
With freshwater resources becoming increasingly scarce, the photocatalytic seawater splitting for hydrogen production has garnered widespread attention. In this study, a novel photocatalyst consisting of a Cu core coated is introduced with N&#8208;doped C and decorated with single Co atoms (Co&#8208;NC@Cu) for solar to hydrogen production from seawater. This catalyst, without using noble metals or sacrificial agents, demonstrates superior hydrogen production effficiency of 9080 &#181;molg&#8722;1h&#8722;1, i.e., 4.78% solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency, and exceptional long&#8208;term stability, operating over 340&#160;h continuously. The superior performance is attributed to several key factors. First, the focus&#8208;light induced photothermal effect enhances redox reaction capabilities, while the salt&#8208;ions enabled charge polarization around catalyst surfaces extends charge carrier lifetime. Furthermore, the Co&#9472;NC@Cu exhibits excellent broad light absorption, promoting photoexcited charge production. Theoretical calculations reveal that Co&#9472;NC acts as the active site, showing low energy barriers for reduction reactions. Additionally, the formation of a strong surface electric field from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Cu nanoparticles further reduces energy barriers for redox reactions, improving seawater splitting activity.

     alt="Atomic Dispersed Co on NC@Cu Core-Shells for Solar Seawater Splitting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A core-shell photocatalyst comprising atomic-dispersed Co and plasmonic Cu nanoparticles is developed for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production from seawater. This photocatalyst achieves strong synergy between the reaction environment, broad light absorption, plasmonic electric field, and active atomic sites, thereby enabling optimal seawater hydrogen production through redox reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With freshwater resources becoming increasingly scarce, the photocatalytic seawater splitting for hydrogen production has garnered widespread attention. In this study, a novel photocatalyst consisting of a Cu core coated is introduced with N-doped C and decorated with single Co atoms (Co-NC@Cu) for solar to hydrogen production from seawater. This catalyst, without using noble metals or sacrificial agents, demonstrates superior hydrogen production effficiency of 9080 &#181;molg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e., 4.78% solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, and exceptional long-term stability, operating over 340&#160;h continuously. The superior performance is attributed to several key factors. First, the focus-light induced photothermal effect enhances redox reaction capabilities, while the salt-ions enabled charge polarization around catalyst surfaces extends charge carrier lifetime. Furthermore, the Co&#9472;NC@Cu exhibits excellent broad light absorption, promoting photoexcited charge production. Theoretical calculations reveal that Co&#9472;NC acts as the active site, showing low energy barriers for reduction reactions. Additionally, the formation of a strong surface electric field from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Cu nanoparticles further reduces energy barriers for redox reactions, improving seawater splitting activity. This work provides valuable insights into intergrating the reaction environment, broad solar absorption, LSPR, and active single atoms into a core-shell photocatalyst design for efficient and robust solar-driven seawater splitting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Strategy Involving Microporous Microneedles Integrated with CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Macrophages for Scar Management by Regulating Fibrotic Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;macrophages (CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms) capable of targeting DPP4+ fibroblasts and modulating ECs subtype within the scar microenvironment are engineered to effectively prevent scarring. Hydrogel microporous microneedles (mMNs) are employed to deliver CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, which can effectively alleviate scar. The study demonstrates that mMNs attached to CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms may exert vital influences on skin scarring, providing a promising approach for treating posttraumatic scarring.








Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) positive fibroblasts play a pivotal role in scar development following skin injury. Heterogeneous vascular endothelial cells (ECs) within scarred areas retain the capacity to drive tissue regeneration and repair. Simultaneously, TREM2 macrophages play a crucial role in the progression and resolution of fibrosis by engaging in mutual regulation with ECs. However, effective strategies to inhibit scar formation through multi&#8208;factor regulation of the scar microenvironment remain a challenge. Here, CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;macrophages (CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms) capable of targeting DPP4+ fibroblasts and modulating ECs subtype within the scar microenvironment are engineered to effectively prevent scarring. Hydrogel microporous microneedles (mMNs) are employed to deliver CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, which can effectively alleviate scar. Single&#8208;cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) analysis reveals that CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms can modify ECs fibrotic phenotype and regulate fibrosis by suppressing the profibrotic gene leucine&#8208;rich&#8208;alpha&#8208;2&#8208;glycoprotein 1 (Lrg1). In vitro experiments further demonstrate that CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms improve the scar microenvironment by phagocytosing DPP4+ fibroblasts and suppressing TGF&#946; secretion. This, in turn, inhibits the phenotypic conversion of LRG1 ECs and provides multifactorial way of alleviating scars. This study uncovers the evidence that mMNs attached to CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms may exert vital influences on skin scarring through the regulation of the skin scar microenvironment, providing a promising approach for treating posttraumatic scarring.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Healing, Flowable, Yet Solid Electrolyte Suppresses Li&#8208;Metal Morphological Instabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries encounter challenges including dendrite penetration, electrode&#8211;electrolyte delamination, and void/crack formation. Here, by deploying a novel composite electrolyte system comprising nonconstrained ceramics within dynamic polymers, self&#8208;healing capability, flowability, and solid properties are successfully integrated into one material. Utilizing this electrolyte, the Li0&#8208;NMC811 full cell demonstrates stable operation at high current density (5 mA cm&#8722;2) for 1100 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal (Li0) solid&#8208;state batteries encounter implementation challenges due to dendrite formation, side reactions, and movement of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface in cycling. Notably, voids and cracks formed during battery fabrication/operation are hot spots for failure. Here, a self&#8208;healing, flowable yet solid electrolyte composed of mobile ceramic crystals embedded in a reconfigurable polymer network is reported. This electrolyte can auto&#8208;repair voids and cracks through a two&#8208;step self&#8208;healing process that occurs at a fast rate of 5.6&#160;&#181;m h&#8722;1. A dynamical phase diagram is generated, showing the material can switch between liquid and solid forms in response to external strain rates. The flowability of the electrolyte allows it to accommodate the electrode volume change during Li0 stripping. Simultaneously, the electrolyte maintains a solid form with high tensile strength (0.28&#160;MPa), facilitating the regulation of mossy Li0 deposition. The chemistries and kinetics are studied by operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Solid&#8208;state NMR reveals a dual&#8208;phase ion conduction pathway and rapid Li+ diffusion through the stable polymer&#8208;ceramic interphase. This designed electrolyte exhibits extended cycling life in Li0&#8211;Li0 cells, reaching 12&#160;000 h at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5000 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, owing to its high critical current density of 9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the Li0&#8211;LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) full cell demonstrates stable cycling at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1100 cycles, retaining 88% of its capacity, even under near&#8208;zero stack pressure conditions.

         <title>Pulling the Rug Out from Under: Biomechanical Microenvironment Remodeling for Induction of Hepatic Stellate Cell Quiescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In HSCs, PPNH&#8208;LQs trigger ascorbic acid oxidation and LOXL2 expression inhibition (Gear I). These effects impair processes of collagen I hydroxylation and enzyme&#8208;mediated crosslinking, leading to the impeded deposition and crosslinking of collagen I (Gear II). Consequently, the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment can be remodeled and subsequently induce HSC quiescence, which facilitates the reversal of hepatic fibrosis (Gear III).








Abstract
Hepatic fibrosis progresses concomitantly with a variety of biomechanical alternations, especially increased liver stiffness. These biomechanical alterations have long been considered as pathological consequences. Recently, growing evidence proposes that these alternations result in the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment, which drives the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Here, an inorganic ascorbic acid&#8208;oxidase (AAO) mimicking nanozyme loaded with liquiritigenin (LQ) is developed to trigger remodeling of the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment. The AAO mimicking nanozyme is able to consume intracellular ascorbic acid, thereby impeding collagen I deposition by reducing its availability. Simultaneously, LQ inhibits the transcription of lysyl oxidase like 2 (LOXL2), thus impeding collagen I crosslinking. Through its synergistic activities, the prepared nanosystem efficiently restores the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment to a near&#8208;normal physiological condition, promoting the quiescence of HSCs and regression of fibrosis. This strategy of remodeling the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment, akin to &#8220;pulling the rug out from under&#8221;, effectively treats hepatic fibrosis in mice, thereby highlighting the importance of tissue biomechanics and providing a potential approach to improve hepatic fibrosis treatment.

         <title>3D Soft Architectures for Stretchable Thermoelectric Wearables with Electrical Self&#8208;Healing and Damage Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed soft multifunctional composites enhance thermoelectric energy conversion by 70%. These stretchable thermoelectric generators exhibit exceptional structural robustness and damage tolerance, with 230% stretchability and functionality maintained even after being damaged by sharp objects and strained for thousands of cycles. Their 3D architecture also enables sufficient energy harvesting from body heat to power LEDs and wearable sensors at room temperature.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric devices (TEDs) exhibit adaptability to curved surfaces, holding significant potential for small&#8208;scale power generation and thermal management. However, they often compromise stretchability, energy conversion, or robustness, thus limiting their applications.

&lt;p&gt;3D-printed soft multifunctional composites enhance thermoelectric energy conversion by 70%. These stretchable thermoelectric generators exhibit exceptional structural robustness and damage tolerance, with 230% stretchability and functionality maintained even after being damaged by sharp objects and strained for thousands of cycles. Their 3D architecture also enables sufficient energy harvesting from body heat to power LEDs and wearable sensors at room temperature.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible thermoelectric devices (TEDs) exhibit adaptability to curved surfaces, holding significant potential for small-scale power generation and thermal management. However, they often compromise stretchability, energy conversion, or robustness, thus limiting their applications. Here, the implementation of 3D soft architectures, multifunctional composites, self-healing liquid metal conductors, and rigid semiconductors is introduced to overcome these challenges. These TEDs are extremely stretchable, functioning at strain levels as high as 230%. Their unique design, verified through multiphysics simulations, results in a considerably high power density of 115.4&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a low-temperature gradient of 10&#160;&#176;C. This is achieved through 3D printing multifunctional elastomers and examining the effects of three distinct thermal insulation infill ratios (0%, 12%, and 100%) on thermoelectric energy conversion and structural integrity.

         <title>Triggering Reversible Intercalation&#8208;Conversion Combined Chemistry for High&#8208;Energy&#8211;Density Lithium Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing both intercalation and conversion mechanisms within a single phase represents an optimal approach for achieving high energy density in cathode materials. For the purposes of reversible operation and achieving a high redox voltage, the amorphization process is proposed as a strategic design method for cathode materials. The influence of amorphization on electrode materials is meticulously confirmed in thermodynamics and kinetics.








Abstract
Combining intercalation and conversion reactions maximizes the utilization of redox&#8208;active elements in electrodes, providing a means for overcoming the current capacity ceiling. However, integrating both mechanisms within a single electrode material presents significant challenges owing to their contrasting structural requirements. Intercalation requires a well&#8208;defined host structure for efficient lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, whereas conversion reactions entail structural reorganization, which can undermine intercalation capabilities. Based on the previous study that successfully demonstrated reversible intercalation&#8211;conversion chemistry in amorphous LiFeSO4F, this study aims to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding on how this can be enabled. Experimental and theoretical investigations of a model system based on tavorite&#8208;structured LiFeSO4F revealed that amorphization governs the activation and reversibility of the combined reactions. Enhanced reversibility is achieved through the facile migration of transition metals within the amorphous matrix. Unexpectedly, it is found that amorphization also narrowed the voltage gap between the intercalation and conversion reactions. This voltage&#8208;gap reduction is explained by the thermodynamic metastability of the amorphous phase. The applicability of the approach to other intercalation hosts is further demonstrated, showing that amorphization enables reversible intercalation and conversion. These findings suggest a new strategy that leverages the full potential of intercalation and conversion reactions, introducing new avenues for cathode design.

         <title>Unlocking Intracellular Protein Delivery by Harnessing Polymersomes Synthesized at Microliter Volumes using Photo&#8208;PISA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins is challenging due to poor cell membrane permeation and endolysosomal entrapment. An oxygen tolerant Photo&#8208;PISA process is reported for the microliter&#8208;scale synthesis of polymersomes that deliver proteins into the cytosol and activate antigen&#8208;presenting cells. This high throughput approach is a highly promising strategy for the screening of early&#8208;stage therapeutic proteins and vaccine antigen candidates.








Abstract
Efficient delivery of therapeutic proteins and vaccine antigens to intracellular targets is challenging due to generally poor cell membrane permeation and endolysosomal entrapment causing degradation. Herein, these challenges are addressed by developing an oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoinitiated polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (Photo&#8208;PISA) process, allowing for the microliter&#8208;scale (10&#160;&#181;L) synthesis of protein&#8208;loaded polymersomes directly in 1536&#8208;well plates. High&#8208;resolution techniques capable of analysis at a single particle level are employed to analyze protein encapsulation and release mechanisms. Using confocal microscopy and super&#8208;resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) imaging, their ability to deliver proteins into the cytosol following endosomal escape is subsequently visualized. Lastly, the adaptability of these polymersomes is exploited to encapsulate and deliver a prototype vaccine antigen, demonstrating its ability to activate antigen&#8208;presenting cells and support antigen cross&#8208;presentation for applications in subunit vaccines and cancer immunotherapy. This combination of ultralow volume synthesis and efficient intracellular delivery holds significant promise for unlocking the high throughput screening of a broad range of otherwise cost&#8208;prohibitive or early&#8208;stage therapeutic protein and vaccine antigen candidates that can be difficult to obtain in large quantities. The versatility of this platform for rapid screening of intracellular protein delivery can result in significant advancements across the fields of nanomedicine and biomedical engineering.

         <title>Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte in Li&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Reduction for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates LHCE (localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte) as an effective electrolyte engineering strategy to enhance the efficiency of the Li&#8208;NRR process.








Abstract
The lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (Li&#8208;NRR) is a promising green alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ammonia synthesis. The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for high efficiency and stability, as it regulates reactant diffusion and suppresses side reactions. The SEI properties are greatly influenced by the Li+ ion solvation structure, which is controllable through electrolyte engineering. Although anion&#8208;derived SEI enhances selectivity and stability, it has typically been engineered using high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (HCEs), which face mass transfer, viscosity, and cost issues. In this study, a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) in the Li&#8208;NRR is first introduced, enabling the formation of anion&#8208;derived SEI in a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LCE) by enhancing the Li&#8211;anion coordination using an antisolvent. Among various antisolvents, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) achieves the highest ammonia Faradaic efficiency (73.6 &#177; 2.5%), more than double that of the LCE (34.3 &#177; 2.8%) and exceeding the HCE (56.0 &#177; 2.8%). Systematic calculations and experimental analyses show that the LHCE exhibits anion&#8208;rich solvation structures and forms&#160;thin, inorganic SEI. Moreover, the LHCE has advantages of low viscosity and high N2 solubility, which facilitate mass transport. This study suggests the application of LHCE as an effective electrolyte engineering strategy to enhance the Li&#8208;NRR efficiency.

         <title>Strong Silkworm Silk Fibers through CNT&#8208;Feeding and Forced Reeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural silkworm silk exhibiting strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa, on par with spider silk, has been developed through the integration of carbon nanotube feeding and in situ forced reeling. This method significantly enhances the &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystal content and alignment within silk, resulting in notable mechanical improvements. This work presents a scalable and eco&#8208;friendly approach for producing high&#8208;strength natural fibers.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance silk fibers, with their eco&#8208;friendly degradability and renewability, have long captivated researchers as an alternative to synthetic fibers. Spider dragline silk, renowned for its exceptional strength (&gt;1 GPa), has an extremely low yield, hindering its widespread use. While domesticated silkworms (Bombyx mori) can produce silk fibers industrially, their moderate strength (&#8776;0.5 GPa) pales in comparison to the formidable spider dragline silk. In this study, naturally produced strong silkworm silk fibers are reported with a tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa achieved through combining feeding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to silkworms and in situ forced reeling for alignment. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the interaction between the CNTs and silk fibroin, while the forced reeling process aligns these reinforcing fillers and the silk fibroin &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystals along the fiber axis. Structural analysis reveals a significant enhancement in the content and alignment of &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystals within the silk fibers, accounting for their superior mechanical properties, including tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa and Young's modulus of 24.4 GPa, surpassing various types of silkworm silk and spider silk. This advancement addresses the historical trade&#8208;off between the strength and scalability of silk, potentially paving the way for eco&#8208;friendly, biodegradable, and renewable alternatives to synthetic fibers in a variety of applications.

Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the interaction between the CNTs and silk fibroin, while the forced reeling process aligns these reinforcing fillers and the silk fibroin &#946;-sheet nanocrystals along the fiber axis. Structural analysis reveals a significant enhancement in the content and alignment of &#946;-sheet nanocrystals within the silk fibers, accounting for their superior mechanical properties, including tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa and Young's modulus of 24.4 GPa, surpassing various types of silkworm silk and spider silk. This advancement addresses the historical trade-off between the strength and scalability of silk, potentially paving the way for eco-friendly, biodegradable, and renewable alternatives to synthetic fibers in a variety of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Electroluminescence from Organic Fluorophore&#8208;Containing Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In light&#8208;emitting diodes using an organic fluorophore&#8208;containing 2D perovskite as the emitter, carrier transport, and exciton formation take place in the metal halide sheets. Then, the bright triplet excitons formed in the metal halide sheets are transferred to singlet states of the organic fluorophores. With these processes, efficient electroluminescence is observed from the organic fluorophores inside the perovskite.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional perovskites containing an organic fluorophore can be a unique emitter for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of fluorophore&#8208;containing perovskite LEDs reported thus far are still very low. In this study, these are able to boost the EQE to &#8776;10% by choosing an organic fluorophore with appropriate energy levels for the perovskite structure organization. In the fluorophore&#8208;containing perovskite LEDs, carrier transport and exciton formation take place in the perovskite's metal halide framework, thereby avoiding the direct formation of nonradiative triplet excitons on the organic fluorophores. Subsequently, the bright triplet excitons formed in the metal halide framework are transferred to form the radiative singlet states of the organic fluorophores, leading to efficient electroluminescence (EL) from the organic fluorophores regularly dispersed inside the perovskite structure. Unexpectedly higher light&#8208;outcoupling efficiency, which is caused by the light scattering in the polycrystalline perovskite layer, will be another reason for efficient EL. These findings will contribute toward the fabrication of LED&#8208;based products with high performance at a low cost.

         <title>Highly Reversible Zn Anode Design Through Oriented ZnO(002) Facets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnO(002) lattice plane with low lattice mismatch to Zn(002) endows fast ion diffusion, high Coulombic efficiency, and uniform Zn deposition, while ZnO(100) plane tends to exacerbate dendrite growth and provoke unwanted side reactions compared to bare Zn. Therefore, ZnO(002) protection layer on Zn realizes more stable performance for Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The practical implementation of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries presents formidable hurdles, including uncontrolled dendrite growth, water&#8208;induced side reactions, suboptimal Zn metal utilization, and intricate Zn anode manufacturing. Here, large&#8208;scale construction of a highly oriented ZnO(002) lattice plane on Zn anode (ZnO(002)@Zn) with thermodynamic inertia and kinetic zincophilicity is designed to address such problems. Both theoretical calculations and experiment results elucidate that the ZnO(002)@Zn possesses high Zn chemical affinity, hydrogen evolution reaction suppression, and dendrite&#8208;free deposition ability due to the abundant lattice oxygen species in ZnO(002) and its low lattice mismatch with Zn(002). These features synergistically promote ion transport and enable homogeneous Zn deposition. Consequently, the ZnO(002)@Zn anode displays a stable and prolonged cycling lifespan exceeding 500&#160;h even under a larger depth of discharge (85.6%) and realizes an impressive average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. Moreover, its efficacy is also evident in V2O5&#8208;cathode coin cells and pouch cells with not only high discharge capacity but also exceptional cycling stability. This integrated approach presents a promising avenue for addressing the challenges associated with Zn metal anodes, thereby advancing the prospects of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery technologies.

         <title>Efficient and Ultrastable Seawater Electrolysis at Industrial Current Density with Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction and Dual Cl&#8722;&#8208;Repelling Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a novel Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 micropillar catalyst with strong metal&#8208;support interaction, this work presents a high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis. It highlights the innovative dual Cl&#8722;&#8208;repelling layer to suppress chloride oxidation, significantly enhancing stability and catalytic activity, representing a revolutionary advancement in catalyst development for seawater electrolysis.








Abstract
Direct seawater electrolysis is emerging as a promising renewable energy technology for large&#8208;scale hydrogen generation. The development of Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 micropillar arrays with strong metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis is reported. The micropillar structure enhances electron and mass transfer, extending catalytic reaction steps and improving seawater electrolysis efficiency. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the strong MSI between Os and Ni4Mo/MoO2 optimizes the surface electronic structure of the catalyst, reducing the reaction barrier and thereby improving catalytic activity. Importantly, for the first time, a dual Cl&#8722; repelling layer is constructed by electrostatic force to safeguard active sites against Cl&#8722; attack during seawater oxidation. This includes a strong Os&#9472;Cl adsorption and an in situ&#8208;formed MoO42&#8722; layer. As a result, the Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 catalyst exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 113 and 336&#160;mV to reach 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for HER and OER in natural seawater from the South China Sea (without purification, with 1&#160;m KOH added). Notably, it demonstrates superior stability, degrading only 0.37 &#181;V h&#8722;1 after 2500 h of seawater oxidation, significantly surpassing the technical target of 1.0 &#181;V h&#8722;1 set by the United States Department of Energy.

         <title>Boolean Computation in Single&#8208;Transistor Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an in situ reconfigurable &#8220;computing neuron&#8221; prototype with wafer&#8208;scale fabrication distinguished from a widespread collapsed integrator artificial neuron. The ambipolar nature can be further adapted to construct highly efficient soft&#8208;XOR&#8208;based neural networks.








Abstract
Brain neurons exhibit far more sophisticated and powerful information&#8208;processing capabilities than the simple integrators commonly modeled in neuromorphic computing. A biological neuron can in fact efficiently perform Boolean algebra, including linear nonseparable operations. Traditional logic circuits require more than a dozen transistors combined as NOT, AND, and OR gates to implement XOR. Lacking biological competency, artificial neural networks require multilayered solutions to exercise XOR operation. Here, it is shown that a single&#8208;transistor neuron, harnessing the intrinsic ambipolarity of graphene and ionic filamentary dynamics, can enable in situ reconfigurable multiple Boolean operations from linear separable to linear nonseparable in an ultra&#8208;compact design. By leveraging the spatiotemporal integration of inputs, bio&#8208;realistic spiking&#8208;dependent Boolean computation is fully realized, rivaling the efficiency of a human brain. Furthermore, a soft&#8208;XOR&#8208;based neural network via algorithm&#8208;hardware co&#8208;design, showcasing substantial performance improvement, is demonstrated. These results demonstrate how the artificial neuron, in the ultra&#8208;compact form of a single transistor, may function as a powerful platform for Boolean operations. These findings are anticipated to be a starting point for implementing more sophisticated computations at the individual transistor neuron level, leading to super&#8208;scalable neural networks for resource&#8208;efficient brain&#8208;inspired information processing.

         <title>Responsive Magnetic Particle Imaging Tracer: Overcoming &#8220;Always&#8208;On&#8221; Limitation, Eliminating Interference, and Ensuring Safety in Adaptive Therapy</title>

This responsive MPI tracer for subtraction&#8208;enhanced MPI imaging, accurate molecular imaging, and environment&#8208;adaptive therapy, offers the potential to maximize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects. This technique effectively eliminates interference signals originating from non&#8208;specific liver uptake.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a novel technology utilizing superparamagnetic nanoparticles as tracers, essential for disease diagnosis and treatment guidance in preclinical animal models. Unlike other modalities, MPI provides high sensitivity, deep tissue penetration, and no signal attenuation. However, existing MPI tracers suffer from &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; signals, which complicate organ&#8208;specific imaging and hinder accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a responsive MPI tracer using pH&#8208;responsive PdFe alloy particles coated with a gatekeeper polymer. This tracer exhibits pH&#8208;sensitive Fe release and modulation of the MPI signal, enabling selective imaging with a higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and intratumoral pH quantification. Notably, this responsive tracer facilitates subtraction&#8208;enhanced MPI imaging, effectively eliminating interference from liver uptake and expanding the scope of abdominal imaging. Additionally, the tracer employs a dual&#8208;function mechanism for adaptive cancer therapy, combining pH&#8208;switchable enzyme&#8208;like catalysis with dual&#8208;key co&#8208;activation of ROS generation, and Pd skeleton that scavenges free radicals to minimize Fe&#8208;related toxicity. This advancement promises to significantly expand MPI's applicability in diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring, marking a leap forward in imaging technology.

         <title>A Metalgel with Liquid Metal Continuum Immobilized in Polymer Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new liquid metal&#8208;polymer gel material termed &#8220;metalgel&#8221;. The 92.40% vol interconnected liquid metal expands throughout the whole volume of 3D polymer networks with polymer domain size down to nanometer scale. Liquid metal is stably immobilized in metalgel via electrostatic interactions. Metalgel exhibits ultrahigh electrical conductivity (up to 3.18 &#215; 106 S&#183;m&#8722;1) and tissue&#8208;like softness (Young's modulus as low as 70 kPa).








Abstract
Gels are formed by fluids that expand throughout the whole volume of 3D polymer networks. To unlock unprecedented properties, exploring new fluids immobilized in polymer networks is crucial. Here, a new liquid metal&#8208;polymer gel material termed &#8220;metalgel&#8221; is introduced via fluid replacement strategy, featuring 92.40%&#160;vol liquid metal fluid as a continuum immobilized by interconnected nanoscale polymer network. The unique structure endows metalgel with high electrical conductivity (up to 3.18&#160;&#215;&#160;106 S&#183;m&#8210;1), tissue&#8208;like softness (Young's modulus as low as 70&#160;kPa), and low gas permeability (4.50&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8210;22&#160;m2&#183;s&#8210;1&#183;Pa&#8210;1). Besides, metalgel demonstrates electrical stability under extreme deformations, such as being run over by a 4.5&#8208;metric&#8208;tonne truck, and maintains its integrity in various environments for up to 180 days. The immobilization of high&#8208;volume&#8208;fraction liquid metal fluid is realized by electrostatic interactions is further revealed. Potential applications for metalgel are diverse and include soft electromagnetic shielding, hermetic sealing, and stimulating/sensing electrodes in implantable bioelectronics, underscoring its broad applicability.

         <title>Instantaneous Tiltmeter Triggered by Dynamic Wetting Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic motion of liquid metal in a wheat awn modeled microchannel induces high precision tiltmeter, which realizes surface topography scanning after being equipped with three dimensions platform.








Abstract
A novel instantaneous tiltmeter with dynamic and static monitoring functions is reported that is based on liquid metal dynamic wetting behavior in a bio&#8208;fabricated anisotropic microchannel. The proposed system achieves instantaneous tiltmeter functionality, offering a broad detection range (&#8722;90&#176;&#8211;90&#176;) with high precision (0.05&#176;), a rapid reaction time (0.11 s), and enhanced durability. Moreover, a seamless integration has enabled water wave detection, language programming, and human limb monitoring. Especially, the integration of tiltmeter and a 3D motion platform results in a surface structure scanning system capable of effectively performing large area (&gt;200 cm2) and height difference scanning functions. This innovative approach holds great potential for transformative changes in the fields of advanced manufacturing, flexible robotics, and the flexible sensing, further facilitating widespread adoption.

The ether/ketonic&#8208;oxygen and Lewis&#8208;acid sites contribute to a high ionic conductivity (5.7 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.84). A 1.5 Ah pouch cell with an areal capacity of &#8776;4 mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 delivers a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density of 446&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Utilizing solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) in high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries is a promising strategy for achieving high energy density and safety. However, the SPEs face the challenges such as undesirable mechanical strength, low ionic conductivity and incompatible high&#8208;voltage interface. Here, a novel crosslinked poly(ether&#8208;urethane)&#8208;based SPE with a molecular cross&#8208;linked structure is fabricated to create high&#8208;throughput Li+ transport pathway. The amino&#8208;modified Zr&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (ZrMOF) are introduced as multisite cross&#8208;linking nodes and polymer chain extenders. The abundant ether/ketonic&#8208;oxygen and Lewis acid sites in the SPE achieve high Li+ conductivity (5.7 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C) and Li+ transference number (0.84). The interpenetrating cross&#8208;linked structure of SPE with robust mechanical strength results in a record cycle life of 8000&#160;h in Li||Li symmetric cell. The high structural stability of ZrMOF and abundant electron&#8208;withdrawing urethane/ureido groups in the SPE with high oxidation potential (5.1&#160;V) enables a discharge capacity of 182 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.3 C over 500 cycles in a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li cell. Remarkably, a high energy density of 446&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in a 1.5&#8208;Ah pouch cell is obtained with high loading cathode (&#8776;4 mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating a great prospect of the current SPE for practical application in solid&#8208;state, high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Semiconductor Device Enabling Optoelectronic Detection and Neuromorphic Processing with Extended Spectral Responsivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;mode device is developed using a PbS/Si hybrid heterojunction with an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 passivation layer, enabling both optoelectronic detection and neuromorphic operation. In mode 1, it achieves ultra&#8208;wide spectral response and reproduces high&#8208;quality 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixel images. In mode 2, it acts as a neuromorphic device, achieving 96.5% accuracy in classifying standard digits.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance semiconductor devices capable of multiple functions are pivotal in meeting the challenges of miniaturization and integration in advanced technologies. Despite the inherent difficulties of incorporating dual functionality within a single device, a high&#8208;performance, dual&#8208;mode device is reported. This device integrates an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 passivation layer with a PbS/Si hybrid heterojunction, which can simultaneously enable optoelectronic detection and neuromorphic operation. In mode 1, the device efficiently separates photo&#8208;generated electron&#8208;hole pairs, exhibiting an ultra&#8208;wide spectral response from ultraviolet (265&#160;nm) to near&#8208;infrared (1650&#160;nm) wavelengths. It also reproduces high&#8208;quality images of 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixels, achieving a Q&#8208;value as low as 0.00437&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a light intensity of 8.58&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, when in mode 2, the as&#8208;assembled device with typical persistent photoconductivity (PPC) behavior can act as a neuromorphic device, which can achieve 96.5% accuracy in classifying standard digits underscoring its efficacy in temporal information processing. It is believed that the present dual&#8208;function devices potentially advance the multifunctionality and miniaturization of chips for intelligence applications.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Organic Neurohybrid Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic artificial synapse interacts with non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters present in the central nervous system by exploiting key electroactive species (i.e., H2O2) produced by neurotransmitter&#8208;specific enzymatic reactions as synaptic modulator in an electrochemical neruomorphic organic device. This enzyme&#8208;mediated neurohybrid synapse can mimic biological learning&#8208;forgetting processes, showing a faster learning phase once previously learned information is forgotten compared to the initial learning stage.








Abstract
The development of organic artificial synapses that exhibit biomimicry features also may enable a more seamless integration of neuroelectronic devices in the nervous system, allowing artificial neuromodulation to be perceived as natural behavior by neuronal cells. Nevertheless, the capability to interact with both electroactive and non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters remains a challenge since state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices mainly rely on the oxidation of electroactive species. Here, the study proposes an organic artificial synapse engineered to enable interaction with non&#8208;electroactive species present in the central nervous system. By integrating a conductive polymeric film functionalized with platinum nanoparticles, the device can catalyze the oxidation of electroactive molecules (i.e., H2O2) resulting from neurotransmitter&#8208;specific enzymatic reactions following an enzymatic functionalization, therefore exhibiting neuromorphic functions driven by non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters. The creation of devices that can interact with or monitor these neurotransmitters can be seen as a significant step toward innovative technologies to expand the understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurological disorders and the development of novel, more effective treatments for them.

         <title>Peripheral Substitution Engineering of MR&#8208;TADF Emitters Embedded With B&#8210;N Covalent Bond Towards Efficient BT.2020 Blue Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a novel B&#8211;N embedded framework, a peripheral substitution engineering has been proposed to afford ultrapure blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters, revealing a record&#8208;high EQE of 20.3%, a narrow FWHM of 20&#160;nm and CIE coordinates of (0.152, 0.046) that align with the BT.2020 blue standard.








Abstract
Compared with the classical boron/nitrogen (B/N) doped ones, multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters embedded with B&#8211;N covalent bond behave a significantly blue&#8208;shifted narrowband TADF, and thus show a greater potential in ultrapure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). As a proof of concept, herein a peripheral substitution engineering is demonstrated based on such a B&#8210;N embedded parent core. The simple approach is found to ensure easy synthesis via a one&#8208;pot lithium&#8208;free borylation&#8208;annulation, manipulate the excited states through different electronic coupling between core and substituent, and introduce the steric hindrance to minimize the unwanted spectral broadening. Impressively, ultrapure blue OLEDs are realized to give a high external quantum efficiency of 20.3% together with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.152, 0.046). The performance is well competent with those of B/N doped MR&#8208;TADF emitters, clearly highlighting that the B&#8210;N embedded framework is a novel promising paradigm towards efficient BT.2020 blue standard.

         <title>A High&#8208;Voltage n&#8208;type Organic Cathode Materials Enabled by Tetraalkylammonium Complexing Agents for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;voltage n&#8208;type organic electrode material featuring hexacyano&#8208;substituted cyclopropane dianion (CpCN62&#8211;) is reported. By leveraging the common&#8208;ion effect of tetrabutylammonium (TBA) cation in the electrolyte, the TBA salt of CpCN62&#8211; exhibits reversible two&#8208;electron redox process at 1.43 V discharge potential with stable long&#8208;term cycling, underscoring its potential as a high&#8208;performance and sustainable organic cathode material.








Abstract
Tetrabutylammonium (TBA) salt of hexacyano&#8208;substituted cyclopropane dianion (Cp(CN)62&#8722;) is prepared through a facile two&#8208;step synthetic protocol from commercially available materials and fully characterized as a high&#8208;voltage n&#8208;type organic cathode in rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The addition of tetrabutylammonium triflate (TBAOTf)&#160;to the electrolyte mitigates dissolution issues, leading to enhanced cycling stability. Remarkably, the Cp(CN)62&#8722; cathode demonstrates a high discharge voltage of 1.43&#160;V in AZIBs and retains 85% of its capacity after 1000 cycles at a high loading of 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and a cycling rate of 10C. These results, combined with spectroscopic analyses, elucidate a reversible two&#8208;electron redox process of Cp(CN)62&#8722; facilitated by the insertion/de&#8208;insertion of TBA cation. These findings underscore the potential of Cp(CN)62&#8722; as a conversion&#8208;based n&#8208;type cathode in energy storage applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an internal encapsulation strategy utilizing the synergistic effect of in situ cross&#8208;linking and &#960;&#8208;effects, achieving an upgrade of the protective layer from linear to mesh&#8208;like coverage. The internal encapsulated device exhibits an enhanced efficiency of 25.31 % and noticeably improved stability.








Abstract
Pursuing high stability becomes the core challenge in realizing the widespread application of perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Here, a practical internal&#8208;capsulation strategy is proposed by introducing cross&#8208;linkable methacrylate analogs upon the perovskite layer, hindering ion migration and preventing lead leakage to achieve stable PerSCs. Butyl methacrylate (UMA) and benzyl methacrylate (BMA) can chemically interact with the perovskite layer, especially for the BMA dimer with significant &#960;&#8208;interactions among the hanging benzene rings. Such configuration facilitated more compact coordination, thereby restoring the Fermi level of perovskite to a defect&#8208;free state and reducing carrier recombination losses. Moreover, by integrating the self&#8208;cross&#8208;linking and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;effect, the application of BMA upgraded the internal capsulation from linear protection to a compact mesh&#8208;like scale. Consequently, the application of BMA not only boosted the efficiency to 25.31% but also greatly enhanced the stability of the perovskite layer, especially for water resistance and preventing lead linkage. The internal capsulation strategy upgrading from linear to mesh&#8208;like marked an innovative direction in protecting the perovskite layer, paving the way for more sustainable PerSCs in further application.

         <title>Eradication of Large Tumors by Nanoscale Drug Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale self&#8208;assemblies constructed from Ce6 and mitoxantrone through hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking achieve photodynamic, photothermal, chemotherapy, and subsequently immunotherapy, under a single laser irradiation, to eradicate large tumors and prevent recurrence in various tumor models. The easy preparation, simple treatment process, and excellent therapeutic effect make this formulation a promising potential for clinical translation.








Abstract
Most patients with cancer are first diagnosed at an advanced disease stage, when tumors are already large and/or metastases are present. This circumstance has a negative impact on the prognosis and therapeutic effect of anticancer drugs. In this study, it is demonstrated that photosensitizer chlorin e6 and the photochemotherapy drug mitoxantrone self&#8208;assemble into relatively stable nanoassemblies (CM NAs) through hydrogen&#8208;bonding effect, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. Administration of CM NAs in combination with 660&#160;nm laser irradiation shows chemotherapeutic, photothermal, and photodynamic effects, causing tumor cell apoptosis and pyroptosis and enabling noninvasive tumor ablation without compromising the surrounding normal tissue. More importantly, treatment with CM NAs increases tumor immunogenicity, leading to a strong and long&#8208;term antitumor immune response that eradicates large tumors and provides long&#8208;term protection against tumor recurrence on various tumor models.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Lifetime Probe for Detecting Intramolecular Noncovalent Interaction in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular noncovalent interactions boost the device performance in the optoelectronic field, but cannot be directly detected in organic semiconductor films thus far. Spin lifetime as a probe to detect intramolecular noncovalent interaction is innovatively used since it can influence the spin&#8208;orbit coupling strength and thus modulate the spin lifetime. This work will significantly advance the interdisciplinary research of organic spintronics and electronics.








Abstract
Intramolecular noncovalent interaction (INCI), a crucial strategy for effectively enhancing molecular planarity and extending &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization in organic semiconductors (OSCs), has played an increasingly important role in optoelectronic applications. However, though the INCI formation is regularly considered to improve the device performance by literature, there is no feasible approach to directly and reliably characterizing its formation in practical&#8208;OSC films thus far. Here in this study, by theoretical analysis and calculation, the generation of INCIs in OSCs is found, normally consisting of relatively heavy elements, such as O&#183;&#183;&#183;Se, O&#183;&#183;&#183;S, N&#183;&#183;&#183;S interactions, etc., can induce enhanced strength of spin&#8208;orbit coupling, the primary factor dominating spin lifetime in OSCs. Based on this newly discovered theory, spin lifetime is creatively employed as a probe for sensitively detecting INCIs in OSC films via spin valves or field&#8208;induced electron paramagnetic resonance, respectively. This study will highly promote academic and applicable developments of the cross&#8208;cutting frontier research field between organic spintronics and electronics.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Additives as Repairable Reinforcements for Dynamic Covalent Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative non&#8208;covalent reinforcement strategy for dynamic covalent networks (DCNs) using a supramolecular additive (S&#8208;T) that can depolymerize and reform on demand. Acting as both compatibilizer and filler, S&#8208;T improves mechanical properties while providing a tool to control processability, thus offering an alternative to traditional non&#8208;repairable reinforcements. 








Abstract
Employing rigid (in)organic materials as reinforcement for dynamic covalent networks (DCNs) is an effective approach to develop high&#8208;performance materials. Yet, recycling of these materials after failure often necessitates inefficient chemical reprocessing or inevitably alters their performance due to unrepairable inert components. Here, a non&#8208;covalent reinforcement strategy is presented by introducing a supramolecular additive to a DCN that can reversibly depolymerize and reform on demand, therefore acting as an adaptive and repairable reinforcement. The strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions in the supramolecular polymer of triazine&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tribenzenecarboxamide (S&#8208;T) strengthen the DCN at room temperature, while its non&#8208;covalent nature allows for easy one&#8208;pot reprocessing at high temperatures. Depending on wether S&#8208;T is covalently bond to the DCN or not, it can play either the role of compatibilizer or filler, providing a synthetic tool to control the relaxation dynamics, reprocessability and mechanical properties. Moreover, the S&#8208;T reinforcement can be chemically recovered with high yield and purity, showcasing the recyclability of the composite. This conceptually novel supramolecular reinforcement strategy with temperature&#8208;controlled dynamics highlights the potential of supramolecular polymer additives to replace conventional unrepairable reinforcements.

         <title>Sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;Soldier Effect in an Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Host&#8208;Guest System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel host&#8208;guest system, wherein TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;BI is doped into TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;Cz crystals, is experimentally shown to enhance room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence quantum yields 10&#8208;fold. Groundbreaking visualization of typically undetectable guest molecules is achieved for the first time within the host crystal structure. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a unique &#8220;sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;soldier&#8221; effect, where the guest molecules control the conformations of the host, significantly influencing crystal packing. This system also exhibits efficient triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer from host to guest, promoting improved radiative decay.








Abstract
Host&#8208;guest systems have emerged as an efficient strategy for promoting organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Despite the advantages of doping guest molecules into a host matrix, the complexity of these systems and the lack of techniques to visualize host&#8208;guest interactions at the molecular scale pose significant challenges in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here, a novel host&#8208;guest RTP system is developed by incorporating low concentrations (1&#8211;10 mol%) of TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;BI (guest) into crystalline TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;Cz (host). Utilizing structural isomerism, the guest molecules are regularly incorporated into the host crystal lattice, resulting in phosphorescence quantum yields almost ten times higher than the pure compounds. The system enabled resolution of the molecular packing of the single crystal through X&#8208;ray diffraction, providing unprecedented visualization of host&#8208;guest interactions. A &#8220;sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;soldier&#8221; effect, where the minority dopant molecules (sergeants) significantly influence the packing arrangement of the host molecules (soldiers), enhances RTP is identified. Further analyses revealed that due to the host molecule's inefficient phosphorescence pathway, its long&#8208;lived dark triplets are channeled to the guest via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTET), allowing the excited energy to radiatively decay more efficiently. These insights advance the understanding of RTP mechanisms and offer practical implications for designing high&#8208;efficiency phosphorescent materials.

Despite the advantages of doping guest molecules into a host matrix, the complexity of these systems and the lack of techniques to visualize host-guest interactions at the molecular scale pose significant challenges in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here, a novel host-guest RTP system is developed by incorporating low concentrations (1&#8211;10 mol%) of TPP-4C-BI (guest) into crystalline TPP-4C-Cz (host). Utilizing structural isomerism, the guest molecules are regularly incorporated into the host crystal lattice, resulting in phosphorescence quantum yields almost ten times higher than the pure compounds. The system enabled resolution of the molecular packing of the single crystal through X-ray diffraction, providing unprecedented visualization of host-guest interactions. A &#8220;sergeant-and-soldier&#8221; effect, where the minority dopant molecules (sergeants) significantly influence the packing arrangement of the host molecules (soldiers), enhances RTP is identified. Further analyses revealed that due to the host molecule's inefficient phosphorescence pathway, its long-lived dark triplets are channeled to the guest via triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTET), allowing the excited energy to radiatively decay more efficiently. These insights advance the understanding of RTP mechanisms and offer practical implications for designing high-efficiency phosphorescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This study presents VO&#8322;&#8208;based photothermoelectric near&#8208;infrared photodetectors showing electrode&#8208;dependent and tunable super&#8208;linear photoresponse with ultralow modulation bias. The device demonstrates an exceptional photocurrent on/off ratio and high detectivity. The electrode dependence, driven by the polarity difference in the Seebeck coefficient, is also elucidated. It is ideal for intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing and night vision pattern reorganization even with noisy inputs, making it a low&#8208;power and integrative technology for future smart edge sensors.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;like intelligence is ushering humanity into an era of the Internet of Perceptions (IoP), where the vast amounts of data generated by numerous sensing nodes pose significant challenges to transmission bandwidth and computing hardware. A recently proposed near&#8208;sensor computing architecture offers an effective solution to reduce data processing delays and energy consumption. However, a pressing need remains for innovative hardware with multifunctional near&#8208;sensor image processing capabilities. In this work, Mott material (vanadium dioxide)&#8208;based photothermoelectric near&#8208;infrared photodetectors are developed that exhibit electrode&#8208;dependent and tunable super&#8208;linear photoresponse (exponent &#945; &gt; 33) with ultralow modulation bias. These devices demonstrate an opto&#8208;thermo&#8208;electro&#8208;coupled phase transition, resulting in a large photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;105), high responsivity (&#8776;500 A W&#8722;1), and well detectivity (&#8776;3.9&#160;&#215; 1012 Jones), all while maintaining rapid response speeds (&#964;r = 2 &#181;s and &#964;d = 5 &#181;s) under the bias of 1&#160;V. This electrode&#8208;dependent super&#8208;linear response is found to arise from the electron doping effect determined by the polarity of the Seebeck coefficient. Furthermore, the work showcases intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing and night vision pattern reorganization, even with noisy inputs. This work paves the way for developing near&#8208;sensor devices with potential applications in medical image preprocessing, flexible electronics, and intelligent edge sensing.

Through the meticulous design of a type&#8208;I heterojunction with a single&#8208;side barrier on the valence band and near&#8208;zero offset on the conduction band, the Sb2Te3/WSe2 heterojunction achieves the best&#8208;reported combined performance in light and gas detection. This enabled the development of the first visual&#8208;olfactory dual&#8208;mode sensor, boosting recognition accuracy of electric and fuel&#8208;powered vehicles from &#8776;50% to &#8776;96%.








Abstract
The design and fabrication of materials that can concurrently respond to light and gas within the dual&#8208;modal recognition domain present a significant challenge due to contradictory structural requirements. This innovative strategy introduces a type&#8208;I heterojunction, combining the properties of Sb2Te3 and WSe2 nanosheets, to overcome these obstacles. The heterojunction is prepared through a precise stacking approach to create a single&#8208;side barrier on the valence band and a near&#8208;zero offset on the conduction band. The resulting Sb2Te3/WSe2 heterojunction demonstrates unparalleled performance, showcasing the best integrated photoelectric and gas sensing performance in a single device to date. Based on the above features, the heterojunction successfully integrates visual and olfactory sensing performance, achieving the first biomimetic visual&#8208;olfactory dual&#8208;mode recognition in a single device. This simulation increased the accuracy of distinguishing electric and fuel&#8208;powered cars from &#8776;50% to &#8776;96%. This work introduces a novel approach to creating efficient, self&#8208;powered sensing materials, paving the way for next&#8208;generation biomimetic dual&#8208;model devices with broad applications in environmental protection, medical care, and other fields.

         <title>Plasmonic Supramolecular Nanozyme&#8208;Based Bio&#8208;Cockleburs for Synergistic Therapy of Infected Diabetic Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of the plasmonic&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalysis and self&#8208;cascade reaction strategy is employed to construct a bimetallic nanozyme&#8208;based biomimetic nano&#8208;cocklebur (GNR@CeO2@GNPs) for diabetic wound healing. Experimental results demonstrate that this promising approach maximizes the utilization of endogenous hyperglycemia and oxidative stress for downregulating hyperglycemia, non&#8208;antibiotic antibacterial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and accelerating skin regeneration.








Abstract
Diabetic wounds are a major devastating complication of diabetes due to hyperglycemia, bacterial invasion, and persistent inflammation, and the current antibiotic treatments can lead to the emergence of multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria. Herein, a bimetallic nanozyme&#8208;based biomimetic bio&#8208;cocklebur (GNR@CeO2@GNPs) is designed and synthesized for diabetic wound management by depositing spiky ceria (CeO2) shells and gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on a gold nanorod (GNR) nanoantenna. The plasmonic&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalysis and self&#8208;cascade reaction properties simultaneously boost the two&#8208;step enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity of GNR@CeO2@GNPs, leading to a significant improvement in overall therapeutic efficacy rather than mere additive effects. Under the glucose activation and 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, GNR@CeO2@GNPs material captures photons and promotes the transfer of hot electrons from GNR and GNPs into CeO2, realizing a &#8220;butterfly effect&#8221; of consuming local glucose, overcoming the limited antibacterial efficiency of an individual PTT modality, and providing substantial reactive oxygen species. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the material's exceptional antibacterial and antibiofilm properties against Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, which can reduce inflammation, promote collagen deposition, and facilitate angiogenesis, thereby accelerating wound healing. This study provides a promising new strategy to develop plasmonic&#8208;enhanced nanozymes with a catalytic cascade mode for the antibiotic&#8208;free synergistic treatment of infected diabetic wounds.

         <title>Light&#8208;Operated Diverse Logic Gates Enabled by Modulating Time&#8208;Dependent Fluorescence of Dissipative Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly systems with variable optical signals are achieved to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time&#8208;dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores.

Abstract
Light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly possesses enormous potential in the field of optical information due to controllable time&#8208;dependent optical signals, but remains a great challenge for constructing intelligent light&#8208;operated logic circuits due to the limited availability of optical signal inputs and outputs. Herein, a series of light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly systems with variable optical signals are reported to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time&#8208;dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. Three kinds of alkyl trimethylammonium homologs are employed to co&#8208;assemble with a merocyanine&#8208;based photoinduced amphiphile separately to construct a series of dissipative self&#8208;assemblies, showing unexpectedly different fluorescence control behaviors of loaded fluorophores during light irradiation and thermal relaxation processes. The opposite monotonicity of time&#8208;dependent emission intensity is achieved just by changing the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, by varying the types of trimethylammoniums and excitation wavelengths, a robust logic system is accomplished, integrating AND, XNOR, and XOR functions, which provides an effective pathway for advancing information transmission applications.

&lt;p&gt;Light-fueled dissipative self-assembly possesses enormous potential in the field of optical information due to controllable time-dependent optical signals, but remains a great challenge for constructing intelligent light-operated logic circuits due to the limited availability of optical signal inputs and outputs. Herein, a series of light-fueled dissipative self-assembly systems with variable optical signals are reported to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time-dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. Three kinds of alkyl trimethylammonium homologs are employed to co-assemble with a merocyanine-based photoinduced amphiphile separately to construct a series of dissipative self-assemblies, showing unexpectedly different fluorescence control behaviors of loaded fluorophores during light irradiation and thermal relaxation processes. The opposite monotonicity of time-dependent emission intensity is achieved just by changing the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, by varying the types of trimethylammoniums and excitation wavelengths, a robust logic system is accomplished, integrating AND, XNOR, and XOR functions, which provides an effective pathway for advancing information transmission applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Nanotheranostics with a Switchable Irradiation Mode for Immunogenic Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents new insights into a multifunctional drug delivery system (NPRBOXA) with a sequentially switching irradiation mode for cancer theranostics. NPRBOXA enables a combination of sonodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for tumor treatment. The versatile design of NPRBOXA holds promise for advancing precision oncology through enhanced therapeutic efficacy and imaging guidance.








Abstract
Nanotheranostics, which integrate diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities, offer significant potential for tumor treatment. However, current nanotheranostic systems typically involve multiple molecules, each providing a singular diagnostic or therapeutic function, leading to challenges such as complex structural composition, poor targeting efficiency, lack of spatiotemporal control, and dependence on a single therapeutic modality. This study introduces NPRBOXA, a nanoparticle functionalized with surface&#8208;bound cRGD for targeted delivery to &#945;v&#946;3/&#945;v&#946;5 receptors on tumor cells, achieving theranostic integration by sequentially switching its irradiation modes. Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, NPRBOXA emits NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, which aids in identifying the nanoparticle's location and fluorescence intensity, thereby determining the optimal treatment window. Following this, the irradiation mode switches to ultrasound irradiation at the optimal treatment window. Ultrasound irradiation induces NPRBOXA to generate reactive oxygen species, promoting the reduction of OXA&#8208;IV to OXA&#8208;II, which in turn triggers immunogenic cell death. This mechanism enables a combination of sonodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for tumor treatment. The versatile design of NPRBOXA holds promise for advancing precision oncology through enhanced therapeutic efficacy and real&#8208;time imaging guidance.

Liquid crystalline network (LCN)&#8208;based actuators grafted with Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) are fabricated. The LCN&#8208;DASAs films present synergistic effects and interactions of photochemical and photothermal effects under visible light. Furthermore, multiple applications of films including information encryptions, off&#8208;equilibrium motions grippers, and reconfigurable deformations are achieved.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline network (LCN)&#8211;based soft actuators have opened up great opportunities to fabricate emerging and intriguing smart materials, serving as potential building blocks for intelligent soft robotics. Endowing LCN actuators with complex responsive behaviors to enhance their intelligence is both challenging and highly demanded. Herein, Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) molecules with rod&#8208;like mesogen and the polymerizable group are judiciously designed and synthesized, which is strong&#8208;colored at linear form and de&#8208;coloration at cyclic form after visible light. In the colored state, the DASA presents a striking photothermal effect that is capable of driving the motions of LCN film. Upon visible light irradiation, the DASA becomes colorless, making the diminishing photothermal effect. The light&#8208;gated switching of the photothermal effect renders the LCN films to be reconfigurable and perform off&#8208;equilibrium motions. The varying glass transition temperature of LCN matrix endowing tunable isomerization rates of DASAs and the equilibrium balance of photo&#8208; and thermal&#8208;isomerization at different temperatures in LCN&#8208;P&#8208;DASA film mainly guiding the off&#8208;equilibrium or stable motions, providing high adjustability of the novel visible light&#8208;driven LCN actuators. The multiply modulated LCN&#8208;P&#8208;DASA film holds great potential in constructing complex visible light&#8208;driven soft actuators based on the synergetic effect and interactions of photochemical and photothermal effects.

         <title>2D Titanium Carbide MXene and Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence: Distance&#8208;Dependent Nonradiative Energy Transfer and Leaflet&#8208;Resolved Dye Sensing in Lipid Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes' distance&#8208;dependent energy transfer properties are examined using single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy and DNA origami nanopositioners. The findings reveal MXenes as short&#8208;distance spectroscopic nanorulers, achieving 50% energy transfer efficiency at 2.7&#160;nm with a cubic power law dependency. Single&#8208;molecule leaflet&#8208;resolved dye sensing of lipid bilayers are demonstrated with MXene energy transfer due to MXenes&#8217; sensitivity at the interface.








Abstract
Despite their growing popularity, many fundamental properties and applications of MXene materials remain underexplored. Here, the nonradiative energy transfer properties of 2D titanium carbide MXene are investigated&#160;and their application in single&#8208;molecule biosensing is explored for the first time. DNA origami positioners are used for single dye placement immobilized by a specific chemistry based on glycine&#8208;MXene interactions, allowing precise control of their orientation on the surface. Each DNA origami structure carries a single dye molecule at predetermined heights. Single&#8208;molecule fluorescence confocal microscopy reveals that energy transfer of an organic emitter (ATTO 542) on transparent thin films made of spincast Ti3C2Tx flakes follows a cubic distance dependence, where 50% of energy transfer efficiency is reached at 2.7&#160;nm (d0). MXenes are applied as short&#8208;distance spectroscopic nanorulers, determining z distances of dye&#8208;labeled supported lipid bilayers fused on MXene's hydrophilic surface. Hydration layer (2.1&#160;nm) and lipid bilayer thickness (4.5&#160;nm) values that agree with the literature are obtained. These results highlight titanium carbide MXenes as promising substrates for single&#8208;molecule biosensing of ultrathin assemblies, owing to their sensitivity near the interface, a distance regime that is typically inaccessible to other energy transfer tools.

         <title>Realizing Ultrahigh Conversion Efficiency of &#8776;9.0% in YbCd2Sb2/Mg3Sb2 Zintl Module for Thermoelectric Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high ZT of &#8776;1.43 is obtained for YbCd1.425Zn0.475Mg0.1Sb2 enabled by orbital alignment. Moreover, thermal expansion matches Fe90Sb10 barrier material with low contact resistivity and high stability is delicately designed. Leveraging the transient liquid phase bonding technique, for the first time, a YbCd2Sb2/Mg3(Sb, Bi)2 module with an ultrahigh conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.0% and good stability is successfully assembled.








Abstract
Recently, YbCd2Sb2&#8208;based Zintl compounds have been widely investigated owing to their extraordinary thermoelectric (TE) performance. However, its p orbitals of anions that determined the valence band structure are split due to crystal field splitting that provides a good platform for band manipulation by doping/alloying and, more importantly, the YbCd2Sb2&#8208;based device has yet to be reported. In this work, single&#8208;phase YbCd1.5Zn0.5Sb2 is successfully obtained through precise chemical composition control. Then, YbMg2Sb2&#8208;alloying increases the cationic vacancy defect formation energy and further optimizes carrier concentration. Moreover, the band structure of YbCd1.5Zn0.5Sb2 is subtly manipulated, and the underlying mechanism is experimentally explored. Combined with the reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a high peak ZT value of &#8764;1.43 at 700&#160;K is obtained for YbCd1.425Zn0.475Mg0.1Sb2. Subsequently, choosing Fe90Sb10 as the diffusion barrier layer and adopting the transient liquid phase bonding technique, for the first time, it is demonstrated that YbCd2Sb2/Mg3(Sb, Bi)2 TE module with an ultrahigh conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.0% at a heat difference of 430&#160;K. More importantly, this module displays good thermal stability. This work paves the way for YbCd2Sb2 materials and devices in mid&#8208;temperature heat recovery.

In this work, single-phase YbCd&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is successfully obtained through precise chemical composition control. Then, YbMg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-alloying increases the cationic vacancy defect formation energy and further optimizes carrier concentration. Moreover, the band structure of YbCd&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is subtly manipulated, and the underlying mechanism is experimentally explored. Combined with the reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a high peak &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; value of &#8764;1.43 at 700&#160;K is obtained for YbCd&lt;sub&gt;1.425&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.475&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Subsequently, choosing Fe&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; as the diffusion barrier layer and adopting the transient liquid phase bonding technique, for the first time, it is demonstrated that YbCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb, Bi)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; TE module with an ultrahigh conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.0% at a heat difference of 430&#160;K. More importantly, this module displays good thermal stability. This work paves the way for YbCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; materials and devices in mid-temperature heat recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Additive Selection to Boost Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theoretical model driven by physical and chemical knowledge is proposed, summarizing descriptors and training sets through computational simulation combined with extensive literature. By integrating machine learning prediction and artificial intelligence clustering, electrolyte additives are screened and designed for Zn&#8208;ion batteries to achieve higher stability. Experimental verification confirms the practical applicability of this approach.








Abstract
In tackling the stability challenge of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) for large&#8208;scale energy storage, the adoption of electrolyte additive emerges as a practical solution. Unlike current trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods for selecting electrolyte additives, a data&#8208;driven strategy is proposed using theoretically computed surface free energy as a stability descriptor, benchmarked against experimental results. Numerous additives are calculated from existing literature, forming a database for machine learning (ML) training. Importantly, this ML model relies solely on experimental values, effectively addressing the challenge of large solvent molecule models that are difficult to handle with quantum chemistry computation. The interpretable linear regression algorithm identifies the number of heavy atoms in the additive molecule and the liquid surface tension as key factors. Artificial intelligence (AI) clustering categorizes additive molecules, identifying regions with the most significant impact on enhancing battery stability. Experimental verification successfully confirms the exceptional performance of 1,2,3&#8208;butanetriol and acetone in the optimal region. This integrated methodology, combining theoretical models, data&#8208;driven ML, and experimental validation, provides insights into the rational design of battery electrolyte additives.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarized PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 In&#8208;Plane Heterostructures with Tandem Catalytic Mechanism for Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanosheet assemblies composed of spin&#8208;polarized PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are precisely synthesized via a liquid&#8208;phase short&#8208;range atomic diffusion strategy. A multi&#8208;site tandem mechanism is revealed on the deliberate&#8208;engineered heterostructures &#9472;O2 molecules are initially activated and cleaved on Fe sites to form O* and OH*, which are then transferred to Pd sites for the following proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps.








Abstract
Alloying has significantly upgraded the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of Pd&#8208;based catalysts through regulating the thermodynamics of oxygenated intermediates. However, the unsatisfactory activation ability of Pd&#8208;based alloys toward O2 molecules limits further improvement of ORR kinetics. Herein, the precise synthesis of nanosheet assemblies of spin&#8208;polarized PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 in&#8208;plane heterostructures for drastically activating O2 molecules and boosting ORR kinetics is reported. It is demonstrated that the deliberate&#8208;engineered in&#8208;plane heterostructures not only tailor the d&#8208;band center of Pd sites with weakened adsorption of oxygenated intermediates but also endow electrophilic Fe sites with strong ability to activate O2 molecules, which make PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 in&#8208;plane heterostructures exhibit the highest ORR specific activity among the state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pd&#8208;based catalysts so far. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical investigations reveal a tandem catalytic mechanism on PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4&#9472;Fe sites that initially activate molecular O2 and generate oxygenated intermediates being transferred to Pd sites to finish the subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cell Modules by Mediated Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapor&#8208;to&#8208;solid deposition of high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films is developed via a new process based on a 2D intermediated phase. Efficiencies of 21.1% and 20.1% are achieved for perovskite modules with active areas of 12.5 and 48.0 cm2, respectively.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can enable renewable electricity generation at low levelized costs, subject to the invention of an economically feasible technology for their large&#8208;scale fabrication, like vapor deposition. This approach is effective for the fabrication of small area (&lt;1 cm2) PSCs, but its scale&#8208;up to produce high&#8208;efficiency larger area modules has been limited by a severe imbalance between the vapor&#8208;solid reaction kinetics and the mass&#8208;transport of the volatile ammonium salt precursor. In this study, an amidine&#8208;based low&#8208;dimensional perovskite is introduced as an intermediate of the solid&#8208;vapor reaction to help resolve this limitation. This improves reaction pathway produces unique vertically monolithic grains with no detectable horizontal boundaries, which is used to produce 1.0 cm2 PSCs with an efficiency of 22.1%, as well as 12.5 and 48 cm2 modules delivering 21.1% and 20.1% efficiency, respectively. The modules retain &#8776;85% of their initial performance after 900 h of continuous operation (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 protocol) and &#8776;100% after 2800 h of storage in an ambient environment (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1 protocol).

         <title>Lattice Match&#8208;Enabled Covalent Heterointerfaces with Built&#8208;in Electric Field for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;matched In2S3/CdS heterojunction with coherent heterointerface and built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) is crafted for efficient H2O2 photosynthesis. It features a covalent In&#9472;S&#9472;Cd bridge, an exceptionally low lattice mismatch of 0.27%, and a BIEF from In2S3 to CdS. It entails rapid charge separation and transfer, achieving an outstanding H2O2 production rate of 2.09 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without the need for scavengers and oxygen bubbling.








Abstract
Crafting semiconducting heterojunctions represents an effective route to enhance photocatalysis by improving interfacial charge separation and transport. However, lattice mismatch (&#948;) between different semiconductors can significantly hinder charge dynamics. Here, meticulous lattice tailoring is reported to create a covalent heterointerface with a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF), imparting markedly improved hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis. Specifically, an In2S3/CdS heterojunction with a coherent heterointerface, characterized by covalent In&#9472;S&#9472;Cd bridge and exceptionally low lattice mismatch of 0.27%, and a BIEF from In2S3 to CdS, is rationally designed. This heterojunction entails rapid charge separation and transfer, achieving an outstanding H2O2 production rate of 2.09 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without the need for scavengers and oxygen bubbling, and a high apparent quantum efficiency of 17.73% at 400 nm. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that this Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates the adsorption of *O2 and the generation of *OOH intermediates during the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction, associated with a low Gibbs free energy. This study underscores the significance of fine&#8208;tuning interfacial lattices and integrating BIEF to accelerate photocatalysis. The simple yet robust strategy can be conveniently leveraged to enhance device performance in optoelectronics, electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and sensing.

However, lattice mismatch (&lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;) between different semiconductors can significantly hinder charge dynamics. Here, meticulous lattice tailoring is reported to create a covalent heterointerface with a built-in electric field (BIEF), imparting markedly improved hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) photosynthesis. Specifically, an In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS heterojunction with a coherent heterointerface, characterized by covalent In&#9472;S&#9472;Cd bridge and exceptionally low lattice mismatch of 0.27%, and a BIEF from In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to CdS, is rationally designed. This heterojunction entails rapid charge separation and transfer, achieving an outstanding H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 2.09 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; without the need for scavengers and oxygen bubbling, and a high apparent quantum efficiency of 17.73% at 400 nm. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that this Z-scheme heterojunction facilitates the adsorption of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the generation of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OOH intermediates during the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction, associated with a low Gibbs free energy. This study underscores the significance of fine-tuning interfacial lattices and integrating BIEF to accelerate photocatalysis. The simple yet robust strategy can be conveniently leveraged to enhance device performance in optoelectronics, electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and sensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Bioprinting of Liquid High&#8208;Cell&#8208;Proportion Bioinks in Liquid Granular Bath</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are challenges for extrusion 3D bioprinting in simultaneously satisfying the requirements of high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion, and low&#8208;viscosity bioinks, which allows the establishment of improved cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication and enhanced biological. Here, liquid high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion GelMA are found to be printed in liquid granular through ink&#8208;bath electrostatic interaction, that is, liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid 3D bioprinting (LL3DBP).








Abstract
Embedded 3D bioprinting techniques have emerged as a powerful method to fabricate 3D engineered constructs&#160;using low strength bioinks; however, there are challenges in simultaneously satisfying the requirements of high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion, and low&#8208;viscosity bioinks. In particular, the printing capacity of embedded 3D bioprinting is limited as two main challenges: spreading and diffusion, especially for liquid, high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity bioinks that can facilitate high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion. Here, a liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid 3D bioprinting (LL3DBP) strategy is developed, which used a liquid granular bath to prevent the spreading of liquid bioinks during 3D printing, and electrostatic interaction between the liquid bioinks and liquid granular baths is found to effectively prevent the diffusion of liquid bioinks. As an example, the printing of positively charged 5% w/v gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) in a liquid granular bath prepared with negatively charged &#954;&#8208;carrageenan is proved to be achievable. By LL3DBP, printing capacity is greatly advanced and bioinks with over 90% v/v cell can be printed, and printed structures with high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion exhibit excellent bioactivity.

         <title>In Situ Molecular Reconfiguration of Pyrene Redox&#8208;Active Molecules for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural evolution of organic electrolysis is revealed at the molecular level in a flow battery and decreases the electrosynthesis yield of isomers and dimers with low electrochemical activity by more than one order of magnitude through pyrene precursor structure regulation. The molecular reconfigured pyrene&#8208;based catholytes achieved a high electrolyte utilization, electron concentration, and recordable cell performance without obvious capacity decay.








Abstract
Aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs) hold great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, however, scalable, green, and economical synthetic methods for stable organic redox&#8208;active molecules (ORAMs) are still required for their practical applications. Herein, pyrene&#8208;based ORAMs are obtained via an in situ organic electrolysis strategy in a flow cell. It is revealed that the water attacking pyrenes restructured molecules to produce a variety of isomers and dimers during the electrolysis, which can be modulated by regulating the local electron cloud density and steric hindrance of pyrene precursors. As a result, the molecularly reconfigured pyrene&#8208;based catholytes, even without any further purification, achieved a high electrolyte utilization of &#8776;96% and volumetric capacity above 50&#160;Ah&#160;L&#8722;1. Inspiringly, remarkable cell stability with almost no capacity decay for &#8776;70 days is achieved, benefiting from the robust aromatic structure of the pyrene cores. The insights into the in situ electrosynthesis of pyrene&#8208;based ORAMs provided in the work will provide guidance for designing ultra&#8208;stable ORAMs for AOFB applications.

         <title>Molecular Reconfiguration of Disordered Tellurium Oxide Transistors with Biomimetic Spectral Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable transistors and neuromorphic devices are realized through surface processes on disordered tellurium oxides. The enhanced surface interactions effectively regulate carrier concentration in the channel, leading to logic functions and biomimetic wavelength selectivity. This molecular reconfiguration strategy increases the integration level of circuits and significantly promotes the development of next&#8208;generation multifunctional electronic devices.








Abstract
Reconfigurable devices with field&#8208;effect transistor features and neuromorphic behaviors are promising for enhancing data processing capability and reducing power consumption in next&#8208;generation semiconductor platforms. However, commonly used 2D materials for reconfigurable devices require additional modulation terminals and suffer from complex and stringent operating rules to obtain specific functionalities. Here, a p&#8208;type disordered tellurium oxide is introduced that realizes dual&#8208;mode reconfigurability as a logic transistor and a neuromorphic device. Due to the disordered film surface, the enhanced adsorption of oxygen molecules and laser&#8208;induced desorption concurrently regulate the carrier concentration in the channel. The device exhibits high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type characteristics with a field&#8208;effect hole mobility of 10.02 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an Ion/Ioff ratio exceeding 106 in the transistor mode. As a neuromorphic device, the vision system exhibits biomimetic bee vision, explicitly responding to the blue&#8208;to&#8208;ultraviolet light. Finally, in&#8208;sensor denoising and invisible image recognition in static and dynamic scenarios are achieved.

         <title>Balancing Potassiophilicity and Catalytic Activity of Artificial Interface Layer for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium/Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon layer with a locally ordered structure has been developed as an artificial interface to achieve a balance between K affinity and catalytic activity, which can significantly enhance the cycle life of potassium metal batteries, achieving an impressive life of 2000 h at 0.5 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Potassium metal batteries (PMBs), with high energy density and low cost, are considered a promising option for grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, challenges such as the uneven nucleation of K and instability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer result in dendrite growth and poor cyclic performance, limiting practical application. To address them, constructing an artificial interface layer with rich defects can enhance the potassium affinity and promote the uniform nucleation of potassium, yet this can also catalyze electrolyte to decompose, leading to unstable SEI formation and poor cycle stability. Herein, a carbon layer with a locally ordered structure (SC&#8208;1600) is constructed as the artificial interface to achieve a balance between K affinity and catalytic activity. This optimized design allows for the uniform nucleation of potassium metal and the formation of a dense SEI layer. SC&#8208;1600@K symmetric cell can operate for 2000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and the developed full cell shows a high capacity retention of 78% after 1500 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1. Besides, SC&#8208;1600@Na effectively extend the life of sodium metal batteries. This work provides a new insight for the construction of efficient K metal artificial interface layer.

         <title>Intrinsic Narrowband Blue Phosphorescent Materials and Their Applications in 3D Printed Self&#8208;monitoring Microfluidic Chips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to achieve intrinsic narrowband blue phosphorescent materials is demonstrated. When doping guest molecules into hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA)&#8208;acrylic acid (AA) polymer matrix, narrowband phosphorescence with the full width at half maximum of 36 nm is achieved. 3D printed structures based on 2O&#8208;Cphpz@HEA&#8208;AA are also fabricated, expanding potential applications for self&#8208;monitoring the trajectories of droplet by optical methods.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials, especially with narrowband emission properties, exhibit great potential for applications in display and sensing, but have been seldom reported. Herein, a rare example of the intrinsic narrowband blue RTP material is fabricated and reported. A series of indolo[3,2,1&#8208;kl]phenothiazine derivatives, named Cphpz, 1O&#8208;Cphpz, and 2O&#8208;Cphpz, are designed and synthesized. Due to their relatively rigid structures, these three compounds showed deep blue narrowband emissions ranging from 396 to 434&#160;nm with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 31, 26, and 31&#160;nm, respectively. To the delight, compound 2O&#8208;Cphpz displayed intrinsic narrowband blue RTP at 448 nm with FWHM of 36 nm and a long&#8208;lived lifetime of 1.08 s in hydroxyethyl acrylate and acrylic acid matrix. Photophysical studies, single crystal analyses, and TD&#8208;DFT calculations are performed to elucidate further the relationships between molecular structures and the narrowband blue RTP properties. Meanwhile, because the narrowband blue RTP is highly sensitive to humidity, a visualizing droplet path optical microfluidic chip is efficiently fabricated through the digital light processing 3D printing.This work provides a rare example and a reliable strategy to realize narrowband blue RTP and further expand their applications in self&#8208;monitoring 3D printed structures.

         <title>Embedding Reverse Electron Transfer Between Stably Bare Cu Nanoparticles and Cation&#8208;Vacancy CuWO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An embedded cation&#8208;vacancy metal&#8208;oxide interface is developed to induce the reverse strong metal&#8208;support interactions in Cu NPs, which inhibits its surface oxidation in ambient air, high&#8208;temperature agglomeration, and CO poisoning adsorption. In contrast to the Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood mechanism observed in the deposited Cu NPs, the exsolved electron&#8208;enriched Cu NPs with anion oxygen protective layers follow the Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism during CO oxidation.








Abstract
Cu nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted widespread attention in electronics, energy, and catalysis. However, conventionally synthesized Cu NPs face some challenges such as surface passivation and agglomeration in applications, which impairs their functionalities in the physicochemical properties. Here, the issues above by engineering an embedded interface of stably bare Cu NPs on the cation&#8208;vacancy CuWO4 support is addressed, which induces the strong metal&#8208;support interactions and reverse electron transfer. Various atomic&#8208;scale analyses directly demonstrate the unique electronic structure of the embedded Cu NPs with negative charge and anion oxygen protective layer, which mitigates the typical degradation pathways such as oxidation in ambient air, high&#8208;temperature agglomeration, and CO poisoning adsorption. Kinetics and in situ spectroscopic studies unveil that the embedded electron&#8208;enriched Cu NPs follow the typical Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism in CO oxidation, contrasting the Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood mechanism on the traditional Cu NPs. This mechanistic shift is driven by the Coulombic repulsion in anion oxygen layer, enabling its direct reaction with gaseous CO to form the easily desorbed monodentate carbonate.

         <title>Functional Carbon Springs Enabled Dynamic Tunable Microwave Absorption and Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional carbon spring (FCS) aerogels possess dynamic tunable microwave absorption and excellent thermal insulation due to their unique lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure. This design resolves the current conflict in co&#8208;optimizing these functions, providing the best &#8220;electromagnetic&#8208;thermal&#8221; dual protection known.









Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave pollution and thermal damage pose serious hazards to delicate instruments. Functional aerogels offer a promising solution by mitigating EM interference and isolating heat. However, most of these materials struggle to balance thermal protection with microwave absorption (MA) efficiency due to a previously unidentified conflict between the optimizing strategies of the two properties. Herein, this study reports a solution involving the design of a carbon&#8208;based aerogel called functional carbon spring (FCS). Its unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure enables tunable MA performance and excellent thermal insulation capability. Adjusting compression strain from 0% to 50%, the adjustable effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) spans up to 13.4&#160;GHz, covering 84% of the measured frequency spectrum. Notably, at 75% strain, the EAB drops to 0&#160;GHz, demonstrating a novel &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; switchability for MA performance. Its ultralow vertical thermal conductivity (12.7&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and unique anisotropic heat transfer mechanism endow FCS with superior thermal protection effectiveness. Numerical simulations demonstrate that FCS outperforms common honeycomb structures and isotropic porous aerogels in thermal management. Furthermore, an &#8220;electromagnetic&#8208;thermal&#8221; dual&#8208;protection material database is established, which intuitively demonstrates the superiority of the solution. This work contributes to the advancement of multifunctional MA materials with significant potential for practical applications.

         <title>Dynamic Lock&#8208;And&#8208;Release Mechanism Enables Reduced &#916;G at Low Temperatures for High&#8208;Performance Polyanionic Cathode in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A novel self&#8208;adaptive coordination field regulation (SACFR) strategy, underpinned by a dynamic lock&#8208;and&#8208;release (DLR) mechanism, is proposed for the first time to dynamically regulate the coordination field of reactant ions. This dynamic regulation improves reaction kinetics and reduces &#916;G at low temperatures, enabling the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)2F cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature synthesis of polyanionic cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries is highly desirable but often plagued by prolonged reaction times and suboptimal crystallinity. To address these challenges, a novel self&#8208;adaptive coordination field regulation (SACFR) strategy based on a dynamic lock&#8208;and&#8208;release (DLR) mechanism is introduced. Specifically, urea is used as a DLR carrier during synthesis, which dynamically &#8220;locks&#8221; and &#8220;releases&#8221; vanadium ions for controlled release, simultaneously &#8220;locking&#8221; H+ ions to enhance phosphate group release, thereby creating a self&#8208;adaptive coordination field that can intelligently respond to real&#8208;time demands of the reaction system. This dynamic coordination behavior contributes to both an improvement in reaction kinetics and a significant reduction in Gibbs free energy change (&#916;G). As a result, the kinetic efficiency and thermodynamic spontaneity of the reaction are greatly enhanced, enabling the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) at 90 &#176;C within just 3 hours. The as&#8208;prepared NVOPF cathode exhibits exceptional rate performance and ultra&#8208;stable cycling stability across a broad temperature range. Furthermore, the successful kilogram&#8208;scale synthesis underscores the practical potential of the innovative strategy. This work pioneers the regulation of coordination field chemistry for polyanionic cathode synthesis, providing transformative insights into material design.

         <title>Ionized Phenanthroline Derivatives Suppressing Interface Chemical Interactions with Active Layer for High&#8208;efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Exceptional Device Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel alcohol&#8208;soluble phenanthroline derivative, tbp&#8208;PhenBr, is innovatively designed and synthesized as cathode interlayer material, which can effectively suppress interface chemical interactions with the non&#8208;fullerene active layer for high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells with exceptional device stability.








Abstract
The contact interface between the charge transport interlayer and the active layer is crucial for the non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells (NF OSCs) to achieve high efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. In this study, two novel phenanthroline (Phen) derivatives, tbp&#8208;Phen and tbp&#8208;PhenBr, are developed as efficient cathode interfacial materials (CIMs). The larger steric hindrance substituents and the ionization of nitrogen atoms on the Phen framework jointly enable the tbp&#8208;PhenBr CIM with a stable film morphology and immensely suppress the detrimental interface chemical interactions with the NF active layer. Consequently, tbp&#8208;PhenBr&#8208;based OSC achieves a higher efficiency (PCE&#160;=&#160;16.34%) than bathocuproine (BCP)&#8208;based control device (PCE&#160;=&#160;13.70%) using PM6:Y6 as the active layer. More importantly, the tbp&#8208;PhenBr&#8208;based device maintains 80% of its initial efficiency (T80) for 3264 h in dark conditions and 220 h after being heated at 85&#160;&#176;C, significantly outperforming the BCP&#8208;based device. The tbp&#8208;PhenBr CIM also shows broad applicability across various binary and ternary active layer systems, affording a notable PCE of 19.49%. Additionally, the tbp&#8208;PhenBr CIM can be processed via a thermal evaporation technique and the prepared devices exhibit high reproducibility. This work provides innovative insights into the molecular design of the CIMs for stable and efficient NF OSCs.

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Adjustable, Deformable, and Packable Wireless Charging Fiber Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated wireless charging fiber supercapacitor developed by only one fiber features with adjustable size (2&#8211;20&#160;cm diameter circle), arbitrary shape and controllable wireless charging energy (0.003&#8211;313&#160;mW power), exhibiting extraordinary energy density at 1004 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Wireless charging energy storage devices eliminate bulky wires of wearable electronics. However, rigid shape and specific charging energy restrict their applications in space&#8208;limited portable electronics. Herein, an all&#8208;carbon fiber supercapacitor is presented that features shape&#8208;adjustable, packable, and energy&#8208;controllable wireless charging functions. With the unique on&#8208;dimensional circuit structure, the maximum energy transfer efficiency from the electrical energy received by the wireless charging unit to the output energy of the fiber supercapacitor can reach up to &#8776;60.8%, and meanwhile this integrated fiber device exhibits an outstanding area capacity of 803 mF cm&#8722;2 and energy density of 1004 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2, superior to most of the fiber supercapacitors. Moreover, this unique device can endure significant deformation in shape of circles ranging from 2 to 20&#160;cm diameter, and can be packed into narrow spaces, such as smart bracelet and disk&#8208;shaped pet global positioning system (GPS). By altering the device shape, the wireless charging current, voltage, and power can be adjusted in the range of 0.5&#8211;20&#160;mA, 1.4&#8211;15.5&#160;V, and 0.003&#8211;313&#160;mW, accommodating the energy requirements for nearly all existing micro&#8208;electronics. This work offers unprecedented opportunities for packable, space&#8208;confined and energy harvesting controllable wearable electronics.

         <title>Enhancing the Filler Utilization of Composite Gel Electrolytes via In Situ Solution&#8208;Processable Method for Sustainable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable method is developed to fabricate composite gel electrolytes with high filler utilization. Uniform distributed UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 fillers enhance its mechanical toughness, ionic conductivity, and cation transference number, and stabilize the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This strategy enables the sodium&#8208;ion batteries to achieve excellent cycling and wide&#8208;temperature performance.








Abstract
The composite gel electrolyte (CGE), which combines the advantages of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes and solid polymer electrolytes, is regarded as the ultimate candidate for constructing batteries with high safety and superior electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface contact. However, the ubiquitous agglomeration of nanofillers results in low filler utilization, which seriously reduces structural uniformity and ion transport efficiency, thus restricting the development of consistent and durable batteries. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable method to in situ construct CGE with high filler utilization is introduced. The homogeneous metal&#8211;organic framework fillers contribute to uniform ionic and electronic filed distribution, realizing a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Consequently, the CGE with high filler utilization achieves an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 10&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80.2%. This work provides guidance for constructing high&#8208;performance CGEs in electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Amorphous to Crystalline Transition in Nanoimprinted Sol&#8211;Gel Titanium Oxide Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wafer&#8208;scale manufacturing platform is introduced for crystalline TiO2 metasurfaces. Anatase or rutile metalenses are fabricated via thermal nanoimprint lithography and sintering. The high refractive index enhances conversion efficiency and numerical aperture. These metalenses demonstrate diffraction&#8208;limited focusing and imaging capabilities, showcasing the potential of crystalline TiO2 in advanced flat optics for improved performance in various applications.








Abstract
Crystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) (anatase and rutile) possesses a higher refractive index than amorphous TiO2 and near&#8208;zero absorption in the visible region, making them an ideal material for visible metasurfaces. However, fabrication limitations hinder their implementation into flat optics. In this work, a wafer&#8208;scale manufacturing platform is proposed for crystalline TiO2 metasurfaces. Sol&#8211;gel TiO2 is developed as a printable material in which its material phase can be precisely controlled to produce amorphous, anatase, or rutile, depending on the crystallization temperature. Therefore, anatase or rutile metalenses can be fabricated on a wafer scale using thermal nanoimprint lithography and sintering process. The high refractive index of the crystalline TiO2 contributes to the enhanced conversion efficiency of the fabricated metalenses. The fabricated metalenses exhibit diffraction&#8208;limited focusing and imaging capabilities, comparable to the theoretically ideal lenses.

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Resolved Organoid Transfection by Porous Silicon&#8208;Mediated Optoporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise control over gene delivery in 3D can refine tissue models providing insights into the complex, multicellular processes underlying development, degeneration, and disease progression. This work presents an optoporation strategy based on light&#8208;responsive porous silicon nanoparticles for the spatially&#8208;resolved transfection of organoids.








Abstract
Engineering the spatial organisation of organotypic cultures is pivotal for refining tissue models that are useful for gaining deeper insights into complex, non&#8208;cell autonomous processes. These advanced models are key to improving the understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. Controlling gene regulation through spatially&#8208;resolved delivery of nucleic acids provides an attractive approach to produce such tissue models. An emerging strategy for spatially&#8208;resolved transfection uses photosensitizing nanoparticles coupled with laser pulses to optoporate cells in culture and locally mediate gene delivery. However, localized optoporation in 3D systems remains challenging.

&lt;p&gt;Precise control over gene delivery in 3D can refine tissue models providing insights into the complex, multicellular processes underlying development, degeneration, and disease progression. This work presents an optoporation strategy based on light-responsive porous silicon nanoparticles for the spatially-resolved transfection of organoids.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering the spatial organisation of organotypic cultures is pivotal for refining tissue models that are useful for gaining deeper insights into complex, non-cell autonomous processes. These advanced models are key to improving the understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. Controlling gene regulation through spatially-resolved delivery of nucleic acids provides an attractive approach to produce such tissue models. An emerging strategy for spatially-resolved transfection uses photosensitizing nanoparticles coupled with laser pulses to optoporate cells in culture and locally mediate gene delivery. However, localized optoporation in 3D systems remains challenging. Here we propose a solution to this longstanding hurdle, demonstrating that porous silicon nanoparticles are a safe and bioresorbable photosensitising nanomaterial capable of spatially-resolved transfection of mRNA in MCF-7 organoids by near-infrared two-photon optoporation. Functionalization with an azobenzene&#8211;lysine photo-switchable moiety enhances the transfection efficiency of the nanoparticles up to 84% in a 2D cell system. Moreover, the nanoparticles enable spatially selective mRNA transfection to MCF-7 spheroids, demonstrating targeted &#160;gene delivery in complex 3D cellular environments. The approach for spatially-resolved 3D optoporation offers a way forward for the design of tailored spheroids and organoids by spatially selective nucleic acids delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimization of Charge Extraction and Interconnecting Layers for Highly Efficient Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells with High Fill Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developshighly efficient perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSC) via the simultaneous optimization of quaternary organic BHJ blend, and reduction of optical and electrical losses of interconnecting layers via self&#8208;assembly monolayer. The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.56% (certified: 24.65%), with a record fill factor (FF) of 83.62% of all types of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) till now.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential for achieving high photovoltaic (PV) performance. However, the reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and fill factors (FFs) are still subpar due to the challenges associated with charge extraction in the organic bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) and significant energy losses in the interconnecting layers (ICLs). Here, a quaternary organic BHJ blend is developed to enhance the charge extraction in the organic subcell, contributing to an increased FF of &#8805;78% under 1 sun illumination and even more under lower illumination intensities. Meanwhile, energy losses in the ICLs are reduced via the incorporation of a self&#8208;assembly monolayer (SAM), (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz), in organic BHJ to form a MoOx/SAM interface and the thorough control of the MoOx thickness to suppress parasitic absorption. The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable PCE of 25.56% (certified: 24.65%), with a record FF of 83.62%, which is among the highest PCEs of POTSCs and the highest FF of all types of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) till now. This work proves the optimization of charge extraction and ICLs are effective strategies to promote the performance of POTSCs to surpass other solution&#8208;processed perovskite&#8208;based TSCs in the near future.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of MXenes in Minutes via Low&#8208;Temperature Molten Salt Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes, including Ti3C2Tx, V4C3Tx, Nb4C3Tx, Mo2TiC2Tx, and Mo2CTx, can be rapidly synthesized via the low&#8208;temperature (130&#8211;195&#160;&#176;C) NH4HF2 molten salt etching process from their corresponding MAX phases in just 5&#8211;40&#160;min. This low&#8208;temperature molten salt etching method is easy to scale up and can yield more than 100&#160;g MXene in a single reaction.








Abstract
Developing green and efficient preparation strategies is a persistent pursuit in the field of 2D transition metal nitrides and/or carbides (MXenes). Traditional etching methods, such as HF&#8208;based or high&#8208;temperature Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;molten&#8208;salt etching route, require harsher etching conditions and exhibit lower preparation efficiency with limited scalability, severely constraining their commercial production and practical application. Here, an ultrafast low&#8208;temperature molten salt (LTMS) etching method is presented for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of diverse MXenes within minutes by employing NH4HF2 as the etchant. The increased thermal motion and improved diffusion of molten NH4HF2 molecules significantly expedite the etching process of MAX phases, thus achieving the preparation of Ti3C2Tx MXene in just 5&#160;minutes. The universality of the LTMS method renders it a valuable approach for the rapid synthesis of various MXenes, including V4C3Tx, Nb4C3Tx, Mo2TiC2Tx, and Mo2CTx. The LTMS method is easy to scale up and can yield more than 100&#160;g Ti3C2Tx in a single reaction. The obtained LTMS&#8208;MXene exhibits excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors, evidently proving the effectiveness of the LTMS method. This work provides an ultrafast, universal, and scalable LTMS etching method for the large&#8208;scale commercial production of MXenes.

         <title>Iodide Management and Oriented Crystallization Modulation for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Air Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up, all&#8208;in&#8208;one modification strategy is proposed by introducing a multisite antioxidant ergothioneine (EGT) at the buried interface to manage iodide ions and manipulate crystallization dynamics. The EGT&#8208;optimization firmly anchors I&#8722; and inhibits their oxidation to I2. The optimized all&#8208;air processed device achieves a remarkable PCE of 25.13%, which is among the highest values reported for devices fabricated in air.








Abstract
Halide&#8208;related defects at the buried interface not only cause nonradiative recombination, but also seriously impair the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a bottom&#8208;up, all&#8208;in&#8208;one modification strategy is proposed by introducing a multisite antioxidant ergothioneine (EGT) at the buried interface to manage iodide ions and manipulate crystallization dynamics. The findings demonstrate that EGT not only passivates uncoordinated Sn4+/Pb2+ defects, but also firmly anchors iodide ions and inhibits their oxidation to I2. Additionally, the modification by EGT enhances the oriented crystallization of perovskite, improves the carrier dynamics, and releases residual stresses. Consequently, the optimized all&#8208;air processed device (Rb0.02(FA0.95Cs0.05)0.98PbI2.91Br0.03Cl0.06) achieves a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.13%, which is among the highest values reported for devices fabricated in air, along with ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.191&#160;V and fill factor (FF) of 84.9%. The optimized device without encapsulation exhibits strong humidity, thermal, and operational stability under ISOS protocol. Specifically, the initial efficiency of the device is retained at 90.12% after 1512 h of thermal ageing at 65&#160;&#176;C and 90.14% after 930 h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under simulated AM1.5 illumination.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Actuated Ferroptosis Nanomotor for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;driven ROS self&#8208;supplying Z@P&#8208;F nanomotor with efficient lysosome escape and enhanced tumor penetration is successfully developed for synergistic tumor CDT/PTT. By releasing Fe2+ and H2O2 under NIR irradiation and acidic TME, Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors continuously generate large amounts of lipid ROS in the tumor and deplete intracellular GSH, thus facilitating Fe2+&#8208;mediated ferroptosis and eventually achieving effective tumor eradication.








Abstract
Ferroptosis nano&#8208;inducers have drawn considerable attention in the treatment of malignant tumors. However, low intratumoral hydrogen peroxide level and complex biological barriers hinder the ability of nanomedicines to generate sufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve tumor penetration. Here a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;driven ROS self&#8208;supplying nanomotor is successfully designed for synergistic tumor chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Janus nanomotor is created by the asymmetrical modification of polydopamine (PDA) with zinc peroxide (ZnO2) and subsequent ferrous ion (Fe2+) chelation via the polyphenol groups from the PDA, here refer as ZnO2@PDA&#8208;Fe (Z@P&#8208;F). ZnO2 is capable of slowly releasing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into an acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) providing sufficient ingredients for the Fenton reaction necessary for ferroptosis. Upon NIR laser irradiation, the loaded Fe2+ is released and a thermal gradient is simultaneously formed owing to the asymmetric PDA coating, thus endowing the nanomotor with self&#8208;thermophoresis based enhanced diffusion for subsequent lysosomal escape and tumor penetration. Therefore, the release of ferrous ions (Fe2+), self&#8208;supplied H2O2, and self&#8208;thermophoresis of nanomotors with NIR actuation further improve the synergistic CDT/PTT efficacy, showing great potential for active tumor therapy.

         <title>Construction of COF/COF Organic S&#8208;Scheme Heterostructure for Enhanced Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of organic COF/COF heterojunction with an S&#8208;scheme charge transfer pathway is designed for enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting without sacrificial agents, and the record high visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 and O2 evolution rates achieved for COF&#8208;316/Pt@TpBpy&#8208;COF.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as a new type of photocatalysts have shown unique advantages in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution, while the reported overall water&#8208;splitting systems are still very rare among various COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Herein, two COFs are integrated to construct a type of organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunction for improved overall water splitting. In this system, TpBpy&#8208;COF and COF&#8208;316 serve as H2&#8208; and O2&#8208;evolving components, respectively, which are combined through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between conjugated aromatic rings. By introducing ultra&#8208;small Pt nanoparticles (NPs) into the pores of the TpBpy&#8208;COF nanosheets (NS), the resultant COF&#8208;316/Pt@TpBpy&#8208;COF NS heterostructure achieves extremely high H2 and O2 evolution rates of 220.4 and 110.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, respectively, under visible light irradiation (&#955; &#8805; 420&#160;nm). The results of transient absorption spectra (TAS) and photoelectronic measurements indicate that the organic heterojunction interface notably facilitates the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. Further, theoretical calculations and in situ experiments confirm the spontaneous formation of the COF/COF heterojunction interface and the active sites for overall water splitting.

         <title>Boosting the Quantum Efficiency of Ionic Carbon Nitrides in Photocatalytic H2O2 Evolution via Controllable n &#8594; &#960;* Electronic Transition Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable activation of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition is presented to boost the photocatalytic H2O2 evolution in ionic carbon nitrides through the simultaneous introduction of structural distortions and defect sites. The best catalyst (2%Ox&#8208;KPHI) shows an apparent quantum yield of 41% at 410&#160;nm without the need for any cocatalysts, outperforming most previously reported carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial chemical used in numerous industrial applications, yet its manufacturing relies on the energy&#8208;demanding anthraquinone process. Solar&#8208;driven synthesis of H2O2 is gaining traction as a promising research area, providing a sustainable method for its production. Herein, a controllable activation of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition is presented to boost the photocatalytic H2O2 evolution in ionic carbon nitrides. This enhancement is achieved through the simultaneous introduction of structural distortions and defect sites (&#9472;C &#8801; N groups and N vacancies) into the KPHI framework. The optimal catalyst (2%Ox&#8208;KPHI) reached an apparent quantum yield of 41% at 410&#160;nm without the need for any cocatalysts, outperforming most previously reported carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts. Extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that a corrugated configuration and the presence of defects significantly broaden the light absorption profile, improve carrier separation and migration, promote O2 adsorption, and lower the energy barriers for H2O2 desorption. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicates that the enhanced photocatalytic performance of 2%Ox&#8208;KPHI is largely attributed to the preferential migration of electrons at defect sites over extended timescales, following the diffusion of geminate carriers across the PHI sheets.

CAT&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Macrophages
A roller, equipped with needle tires and loaded with CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, traversed this road. CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms appear like graceful angels, clearing away DPP4+ fibroblasts and regulating the fibrotic phenotype of vascular endothelial cells. The &#8220;scarred road&#8221; undergoes a transformation into smooth and flat road following compaction by a roller. More details can be found in article number 2406153 by Wen Zeng and co&#8208;workers.

Self&#8208;Thermophoretic Nanomotor
Self&#8208;thermophoresis confers Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors motility to achieve enhanced deep tumor penetration and therapy. By releasing massive Fe2+ and H2O2, Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors continuously generate ROS in the tumor, thus eventually achieving effective tumor ferroptosis. More details can be found in article number 2412227 by Yingfeng Tu, Fei Peng, Hao Tian, and co&#8208;workers.

3D Bioprinting of Liquid High&#8208;Cell&#8208;Proportion Bioinks
In extrusion&#8208;based bioprinting, bioinks have long been subject to trade&#8208;offs between physicochemical properties and biological outcomes. Due to insufficient viscosity, liquid bioinks have been considered unprintable. In article number 2412127, Lei Shao, Yong He, Xueping Wang and co&#8208;workers developed a liquid granular bath that enables embedded 3D bioprinting of liquid, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion bioinks to address this challenge.

         <title>Recent Progress on 3D Printing of Lightweight Metal Thin&#8208;Walled Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Additive manufacturing (AM) has become an integral part of industry to manufacture complex parts with a shorter turnaround time. Metal thin&#8208;walled structures are ubiquitous in many of these parts. This review aims to discuss the structure design of additively manufactured metal thin walls and the impact that thin walls have on the geometrical accuracy, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the part.








Abstract
Metal thin&#8208;walled structures are ubiquitous in various industrial applications and fabricating them through additive manufacturing (AM) enables intricate thin&#8208;wall geometries with no assembly required. However, additively manufactured metal thin walls suffer from increased heat accumulation and reduced structural stability, making it difficult to print geometrically accurate thin walls with minimal distortion and defects. Thin&#8208;walled structures also experience different thermal histories and solidification conditions compared to bulk structures, leading to drastic differences in the microstructure and mechanical properties. In this review article, the AM processing of metal thin&#8208;walled structures will be introduced. An in&#8208;depth discussion on the design strategies of additively manufactured metal thin walls will be presented regarding the restrictions imposed by the AM technology, the integration of thin walls in lightweight structures, and novel design ideation through topology optimization. The effects that the thin wall design has on the geometrical accuracy, microstructure, and mechanical properties will then be elucidated. The utilization of AM for fabricating metal thin walls across various industries will also be summarized. Finally, this review article will close on some perspectives and future work on the AM of metal thin&#8208;walled structures.

         <title>Boosting Light&#8722;Matter Interactions in Plasmonic Nanogaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic nanogap systems enhance optical processes via antenna or cavity plasmon modes, which are influenced by gap morphology. Emitters such as self&#8208;assembled monolayer molecules, quantum dots, and 2D materials couple within the nanogaps. The resulting enhanced optical processes include Raman scattering, infrared absorption, nonlinear optics, photoluminescence, strong coupling, electroluminescence, and photochemistry.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanogaps in strongly coupled metal nanostructures can confine light to nanoscale regions, leading to huge electric field enhancement. This unique capability makes plasmonic nanogaps powerful platforms for boosting light&#8211;matter interactions, thereby enabling the rapid development of novel phenomena and applications. This review traces the progress of nanogap systems characterized by well&#8208;defined morphologies, controllable optical responses, and a focus on achieving extreme performance. The properties of plasmonic gap modes in far&#8208;field resonance and near&#8208;field enhancement are explored and a detailed comparative analysis of nanogap fabrication techniques down to sub&#8208;nanometer scales is provided, including bottom&#8208;up, top&#8208;down, and their combined approaches. Additionally, recent advancements and applications across various frontier research areas are highlighted, including surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy, plasmon&#8208;exciton strong coupling, nonlinear optics, optoelectronic devices, and other applications beyond photonics. Finally, the challenges and promising emerging directions in the field are discussed, such as light&#8208;driven atomic effects, molecular optomechanics, and alternative new materials.

         <title>Multifunctional Strategies of Advanced Electrocatalysts for Efficient Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an in&#8208;depth exploration of engineering modification strategies for catalytic materials and their promising applications in C&#9472;N coupling for urea electrosynthesis. Additionally, it highlights the significance of integrating diverse modification strategies to improve the efficiency of C&#9472;N coupling in urea synthesis. Finally, the review evaluates the potential challenges and opportunities that catalytic materials for C&#9472;N coupling may encounter in the path toward future commercialization.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrogenous species (such as N2, NO, NO2&#8722;, and NO3&#8722;) for urea synthesis under ambient conditions has been extensively studied due to their potential to realize carbon/nitrogen neutrality and mitigate environmental pollution, as well as provide a means to store renewable electricity generated from intermittent sources such as wind and solar power. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics and the scarcity of active sites on electrocatalysts have significantly hindered the advancement of their practical applications. Multifunctional engineering of electrocatalysts has been rationally designed and investigated to adjust their electronic structures, increase the density of active sites, and optimize the binding energies to enhance electrocatalytic performance. Here, surface engineering, defect engineering, doping engineering, and heterostructure engineering strategies for efficient nitrogen electro&#8208;reduction are comprehensively summarized. The role of each element in engineered electrocatalysts is elucidated at the atomic level, revealing the intrinsic active site, and understanding the relationship between atomic structure and catalytic performance. This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of electrocatalytic reactions of waste nitrogenous species into urea. Moreover, this review outlines the challenges and opportunities for urea synthesis and aims to facilitate further research into the development of advanced electrocatalysts for a sustainable future.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Based Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key green energy oxidant with growing interest. This review examines non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR), aiming to optimize H2O2 production through active site regulation, heterometallic effects, oxygen vacancy engineering, and local electronic environment. It suggests a future research direction for more advanced catalyst design.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a high&#8208;value chemical widely used in electronics, textiles, paper bleaching, medical disinfection, and wastewater treatment. Traditional production methods, such as the anthraquinone oxidation process and direct synthesis, require high energy consumption, and involve risks from toxic substances and explosions. Researchers are now exploring photochemical, electrochemical, and photoelectrochemical synthesis methods to reduce energy use and pollution. This review focuses on the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) for the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, and discusses how catalyst active sites influence O2 adsorption. Strategies to enhance H2O2 selectivity by regulating these sites are presented. Catalysts require strong O2 adsorption to initiate reactions and weak *OOH adsorption to promote H2O2 formation. The review also covers advances in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), multi&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts, and highlights non&#8208;noble metal oxides, especially perovskite oxides, for their versatile structures and potential in 2e&#8722; ORR. The potential of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects to enhance catalyst performance is also discussed. In conclusion, emphasis is placed on optimizing catalyst structures through theoretical and experimental methods to achieve efficient and selective H2O2 production, aiming for sustainable and commercial applications.

         <title>Breathable and Stretchable Epidermal Electronics for Health Management: Recent Advances and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the latest advancements in stretchable and breathable epidermal electronics for personalized healthcare. It examines the design principles, fabrication techniques, and practical applications of porous substrates, highlighting their advantages in terms of breathability, biocompatibility, and mechanical robustness. Key challenges and future directions for developing high&#8208;performance on&#8208;skin electronics are also discussed.








Abstract
Advanced epidermal electronic devices, capable of real&#8208;time monitoring of physical, physiological, and biochemical signals and administering appropriate therapeutics, are revolutionizing personalized healthcare technology. However, conventional portable electronic devices are predominantly constructed from impermeable and rigid materials, which thus leads to the mechanical and biochemical disparities between the devices and human tissues, resulting in skin irritation, tissue damage, compromised signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR), and limited operational lifespans. To address these limitations, a new generation of wearable on&#8208;skin electronics built on stretchable and porous substrates has emerged. These substrates offer significant advantages including breathability, conformability, biocompatibility, and mechanical robustness, thus providing solutions for the aforementioned challenges. However, given their diverse nature and varying application scenarios, the careful selection and engineering of suitable substrates is paramount when developing high&#8208;performance on&#8208;skin electronics tailored to specific applications. This comprehensive review begins with an overview of various stretchable porous substrates, specifically focusing on their fundamental design principles, fabrication processes, and practical applications. Subsequently, a concise comparison of various methods is offered to fabricate epidermal electronics by applying these porous substrates. Following these, the latest advancements and applications of these electronics are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges are summarized and potential future directions in this dynamic field are explored.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced epidermal electronic devices, capable of real-time monitoring of physical, physiological, and biochemical signals and administering appropriate therapeutics, are revolutionizing personalized healthcare technology. However, conventional portable electronic devices are predominantly constructed from impermeable and rigid materials, which thus leads to the mechanical and biochemical disparities between the devices and human tissues, resulting in skin irritation, tissue damage, compromised signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and limited operational lifespans. To address these limitations, a new generation of wearable on-skin electronics built on stretchable and porous substrates has emerged. These substrates offer significant advantages including breathability, conformability, biocompatibility, and mechanical robustness, thus providing solutions for the aforementioned challenges. However, given their diverse nature and varying application scenarios, the careful selection and engineering of suitable substrates is paramount when developing high-performance on-skin electronics tailored to specific applications. This comprehensive review begins with an overview of various stretchable porous substrates, specifically focusing on their fundamental design principles, fabrication processes, and practical applications. Subsequently, a concise comparison of various methods is offered to fabricate epidermal electronics by applying these porous substrates. Following these, the latest advancements and applications of these electronics are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges are summarized and potential future directions in this dynamic field are explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Inorganic Nanomaterials Characterized by Advanced TEM: A Qualitative and Quantitative Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Focusing on chiral inorganic nanomaterials (CINMs), this review elucidates how advanced TEM techniques facilitate precise qualitative analysis of CINMs, including chiral atomic&#8208;level features, 0D, 1D, and 2D nanocrystals, and assemblies. It also highlights quantitative methods for determining chirality, such as 3D electron tomography, and discusses the evolution of chiral structures as monitored by the ex situ and in situ TEM technologies.








Abstract
Chiral inorganic nanomaterials (CINMs) have garnered significant interest due to their exceptional optical, electronic, and catalytic properties, offering promising advancements in energy conversion, data storage, catalysis, and biomedicine. While traditional optical spectrophotometers reveal the chiroptical performance of CINMs on an ensemble level, the direct structural visualization for the qualitative and quantitative discernment of their chiral features has become increasingly distinct with the advancements of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The need for reasonable and high&#8208;standard discrimination requirements of CINMs has driven the progress of chirality&#8208;based TEM technologies. Therefore, this review in the good season takes the initiative to summarize the current advancements in TEM technologies for CINMs characterization, emphasizing a qualitative analysis of chiral atomic&#8208;level features, 0D, 1D, and 2D nanocrystals, and assembled nanomaterials. Then, the quantitative methods for determining chirality is also highlighted, such as 3D electron tomography, and further address the evolution of chiral structures monitored by the Ex&#8208;situ and In&#8208;situ TEM technologies. By providing a roadmap for the current challenges and proposing future advancements in TEM technologies for the qualitative, quantitative, and real&#8208;time analysis of CINMs, it can drive innovations in the field of chiral nanomaterials as well as the development of TEM technologies.

         <title>Sensing Interfaces Engineering for Organic Thin Film Transistors&#8208;Based Biosensors: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs)&#8208;based biosensors are fascinating due to their properties of low cost, label&#8208;free, and inherent signal amplification. The review provides a comprehensive and timely review of optimization in sensing interface engineering, and how efficient immobilization of biological sensing probes on sensing interfaces can contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors.








Abstract
Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) enable rapid and label&#8208;free high&#8208;sensitivity detection of target analytes due to their low cost, large&#8208;area processing, biocompatibility, and inherent signal amplification. At the same time, the freedom of synthesis, tailorability, and functionalization of organic semiconductor materials and their ability to be combined with flexible substrates make them one of the ideal platforms for biosensing. However, OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors still face significant challenges, such as unexpected surface adsorption, disordered conformation, inhomogeneous graft density, and flexibility of probe molecules that biological sensing probes would face during immobilization. In this review, efficient immobilization strategies based on OTFTs biological sensing probes developed in the last 5 years are highlighted. First, the biosensors are classified according to their sensing interface. Second, a comprehensive discussion of the types of biological sensing probes is presented. Third, three commonly used methods for immobilizing biological sensing probes and their challenges are briefly described. Finally, the applications of OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors for liquid phase detection are summarized. This review provides a comprehensive and timely review of optimization in sensing interface engineering so that efficient immobilization of biological sensing probes with sensing interfaces will contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors.

Abstract
Solving the global challenge of freshwater scarcity is of great significance for over one billion people in the world. Solar water evaporation based on plasmonic nanostructures is one of the most promising technologies due to its high efficiency. However, the efficiency of this plasmonic nanostructure&#8208;based technology can hardly achieve 100%. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop new solar converters utilizing plasmonic local heating and reasonable structure design to break the limit of solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency for freshwater production. Here, a plasmonic sponge is developed as a solar evaporation converter with excellent full&#8208;solar&#8208;spectrum absorption, good heat localization performance, and fast evaporation kinetics through 3D nanostructures, achieving a 131% solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency. Distinct from the traditional 2D localized heating&#8208;based evaporation and nonmetallic 3D water evaporation, the 3D plasmonic sponge can simultaneously achieve highly efficient local heating and super large water&#8211;air interfaces for boosting solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency. The 3D plasmonic sponge can be also used as a universal converter for purifying seawater, metal ion solutions, organic pollutant solutions, and strong acid and strong alkaline solutions. The full&#8208;solar&#8208;spectrum absorption, high efficiency, and universality in water purification suggest that the novel 3D plasmonic solar converter can bring a significant way to alleviate the crisis of freshwater resources.

         <title>Molecules to Masterpieces: Bridging Materials Science and the Arts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes the convergence of materials science and art through the creation of self&#8208;assembled block copolymer lamellar thin films with vivid iridescence. These films are applied as coatings on window panels for an architectural installation as well as transformed into porous, structurally colored ceramics. The work demonstrates the potential of nanoscale engineering in artistic and architectural contexts.








Abstract
Art and materials innovation have always been intertwined, dating back to the earliest human creations. In modern times, however, the increasing specialization of materials science often restricts artists' access to cutting&#8208;edge materials. Here, the materials science aspects of an art&#8208;science collaboration between artist Kimsooja and the Wiesner Lab at Cornell University, are detailed. The project involves the development of a custom&#8208;made iridescent block copolymer coating by means of self&#8208;assembly, originally applied to transparent window panels of a fa&#231;ade for the &#8776;14&#160;m tall art installation: A Needle Woman: Galaxy Is a Memory, Earth is a Souvenir by artist Kimsooja. After several exhibitions in the US and Europe, the installation is now part of the permanent museum collection at Yorkshire Sculpture Park in Wakefield, UK. Full characterization of the solution blade&#8208;cast coatings show shear aligned, standing up lamellar morphologies that behave as volume&#8208;phase gratings with periodicities between 300 and 400&#160;nm. Coatings are also applied to foldable (origami) paper and converted into iridescent porous ceramic materials. It is hoped this work inspires and informs communities across materials science, the arts, and architecture.

         <title>Constructing Highly Porous Low Iridium Anode Catalysts Via Dealloying for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly porous iridium metal aerogels (MA), containing hierarchical pores and channels, are developed as efficient and durable oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). The developed Ir MA anode at a low Ir loading of 0.5 mgIr cm&#8722;2 demonstrated encouraging performance and durability in practical PEMWEs, significantly outperforming the commercial Ir black catalyst. The enhanced performance and durability of the Ir MA anode catalyst can be attributed to its unique morphological features for increased Ir utilization and favorable conversion from metallic Ir to oxidized Ir species during the OER with mitigated Ir dissolution.








Abstract
Iridium (Ir) is the most active and durable anode catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, their large&#8208;scale applications are hindered by high costs and scarcity of Ir. Lowering Ir loadings below 1.0 mgcm&#8722;2 causes significantly reduced PEMWE performance and durability. Therefore, developing efficient low Ir&#8208;based catalysts is critical to widely commercializing PEMWEs. Herein, an approach is presented for designing porous Ir metal aerogel (MA) catalysts via chemically dealloying IrCu alloys.

The low&#8208;Ir MEA demonstrated an acceptable decay rate of &#8776;40 &#181;V h&#8722;1 during durability tests at 0.5 (&gt;1200 h) and 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 (400 h), outperforming the commercial Ir&#8208;based MEA (175 &#181;V h&#8722;1 at 2.0 mgIr cm&#8722;2).

&lt;p&gt;Highly porous iridium metal aerogels (MA), containing hierarchical pores and channels, are developed as efficient and durable oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). The developed Ir MA anode at a low Ir loading of 0.5 mg&lt;sub&gt;Ir&lt;/sub&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; demonstrated encouraging performance and durability in practical PEMWEs, significantly outperforming the commercial Ir black catalyst. The enhanced performance and durability of the Ir MA anode catalyst can be attributed to its unique morphological features for increased Ir utilization and favorable conversion from metallic Ir to oxidized Ir species during the OER with mitigated Ir dissolution.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iridium (Ir) is the most active and durable anode catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, their large-scale applications are hindered by high costs and scarcity of Ir. Lowering Ir loadings below 1.0 mgcm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; causes significantly reduced PEMWE performance and durability. Therefore, developing efficient low Ir-based catalysts is critical to widely commercializing PEMWEs. Herein, an approach is presented for designing porous Ir metal aerogel (MA) catalysts via chemically dealloying IrCu alloys. The unique hierarchical pore structures and multiple channels of the Ir MA catalyst significantly increase electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and enhance OER activity compared to conventional Ir black catalysts, providing an effective solution to design low-Ir catalysts with improved Ir utilization and enhanced stability. An optimized membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with an Ir loading of 0.5 mg&lt;sub&gt;Ir&lt;/sub&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; generated 2.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.79&#160;V, higher than the Ir black at a loading of 2.0 mg&lt;sub&gt;Ir&lt;/sub&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1.63 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The low-Ir MEA demonstrated an acceptable decay rate of &#8776;40 &#181;V h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; during durability tests at 0.5 (&amp;gt;1200 h) and 2.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (400 h), outperforming the commercial Ir-based MEA (175 &#181;V h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2.0 mg&lt;sub&gt;Ir&lt;/sub&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Reinforcing Ionogel Bioadhesive Interface for Robust Integration and Monitoring of Bioelectronic Devices with Hard Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk&#8208;based self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel shows good adhesion performance on biological hard tissues, common bioelectrode materials, and hard biomaterials. It can be assembled with the gold resonant circuit to form a wireless sensor to monitor the wound&#8208;healing process of biological hard tissues.








Abstract
Integrating bioelectronic devices with hard tissues, such as bones and teeth, is essential for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. However, stable and durable adhesion in dynamic, moist environments remains challenging. Traditional bioadhesives often fail to maintain strong bonds, especially when interfacing with metal electrodes and hard tissues. This study introduces a self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel bioadhesive interface (IGBI) combining silk fibroin and calcium ions, designed to provide robust and conductive integration of bioelectronic devices with hard tissues. The IGBI exhibits strong adhesion (up to 186&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) and undergoes mechanical self&#8208;reinforcement through a structural transition in silk fibroin under physiological conditions. In vivo experiments demonstrate the IGBI's effectiveness in repairing bone defects and reimplanting teeth, with the added capability of wireless, real&#8208;time monitoring of bone healing. This approach allows for continuous tracking of tissue regeneration without a second invasive surgery for device removal. The IGBI represents a significant advancement in bioelectronic integration, offering a durable and versatile solution for challenging environments. Such unique self&#8208;reinforcing properties make the IGBI a promising material for biomedical applications where traditional adhesives are insufficient.

         <title>Lab&#8208;on&#8208;Fiber Operando Deciphering of a MOF Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entirely new concept of a lab&#8208;on&#8208;fiber operando method and its feasibility for deciphering reaction pathways of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) electrocatalysts are demonstrated. The developed method leverages the subtle refractive index (RI) evolution (both real and imaginary parts) of MOFs during electrocatalysis, enabling the tracking of self&#8208;reconstruction dynamics as well as the identification of underlying reactive intermediates.








Abstract
Despite the great success in deploying metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as efficient electrocatalysts, the low adoption of operando methods hinders the understanding of underlying mechanism. By leveraging the subtle refractive index evolution, including both the real and the imaginary parts, an entirely new concept of a lab&#8208;on&#8208;fiber operando method and its feasibility for &#8220;pristine&#8208;immersion&#8208;operando&#8208;post analysis&#8221; of electrocatalyts are demonstrated. Concurrent collection of absorption spectra and surface plasmon resonance is achieved by engineering fiber&#8208;optic waveguides&#160;to simultaneously induce guided light attenuation and plasmonic coupling. In situ&#8208;formed Co hydroxide and oxide reactive intermediates in zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) electrocatalyst are optically identified, which&#160;shows its underlying self&#8208;reconstruction conversions at different stages during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions, and address the gap in knowledge concerning whether ZIF&#8208;67 is a precatalyst for real catalyst production. This illuminating operando method offers intriguing opportunities to collect all the observables in a single fiber, provides an exciting potential of a new class of device with long&#8208;sought integration and miniaturization capability, and is expected to enable the electrocatalysis community to conquer challenges with conducting multimodal operando experiments outside the laboratory.

         <title>Phase Engineering of Giant Second Harmonic Generation in Bi2O2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain engineering of the ferroelectric phase transition leads to significant modulation of second harmonic generation (SHG) by six orders of magnitude in the high&#8208;performance semiconductor Bi2O2Se. The SHG signal of strained Bi2O2Se is an order of magnitude larger than that of NbOX2 (X = I, Cl) of similar thickness.









Abstract
2D materials with remarkable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) hold promise for future on&#8208;chip nonlinear optics. Relevant materials with both giant SHG response and environmental stability are long&#8208;sought targets. Here, the enormous SHG from the phase engineering of a high&#8208;performance semiconductor, Bi2O2Se (BOS), under uniaxial strain, is demonstrated. SHG signals captured in strained 20 nm&#8208;BOS films exceed those of NbOI2 and NbOCl2 of similar thickness by a factor of 10, and are four orders of magnitude higher than monolayer&#8208;MoS2, resulting in a significant second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility on the order of 1 nm&#160;V&#8722;1. Intriguingly, the strain enables continuous adjustment of the ferroelectric phase transition across room temperature. An exceptionally large tunability of SHG, approximately six orders of magnitude, is achieved through strain modulation. This colossal SHG, originating from the geometric phase of Bloch wave functions and coupled with sensitive strain tunability in this air&#8208;stable 2D semiconductor, opens new possibilities for designing chip&#8208;scale, switchable nonlinear optical&#160;devices.

         <title>Hydride&#8208;Induced Reconstruction of Pd Electrode Surfaces: A Combined Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimizing electrocatalyst performance requires insights into surface and subsurface structures under reaction conditions. This study uncovers hydrogen&#8208;induced reconstruction processes on low&#8208;index palladium (Pd) surfaces during proton electroreduction by integrating computational and experimental approaches. The results reveal that surface roughness and morphological changes arise from hydrogen&#8208;induced hydride formation and subsequent reconstruction to minimize strain in PdHx/Pd&#8208;interfaces, and not from surface dissolution.








Abstract
Designing electrocatalysts with optimal activity and selectivity relies on a thorough understanding of the surface structure under reaction conditions. In this study, experimental and computational approaches are combined to elucidate reconstruction processes on low&#8208;index Pd surfaces during H&#8208;insertion following proton electroreduction. While electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy clearly reveals pronounced surface roughening and morphological changes on Pd(111), Pd(110), and Pd(100) surfaces during cyclic voltammetry, a complementary analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry excludes Pd dissolution as the primary cause of the observed restructuring. Large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations further show that these surface alterations are related to the creation and propagation of structural defects as well as phase transformations that take place during hydride formation.

         <title>Optimizing Perovskite Surfaces to Enhance Post&#8208;Treatment for Efficient Blue Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The halide postdeposition process is optimized by engineering blue mixed&#8208;halide 3D perovskites with acetate&#8208;rich surfaces. This engineered perovskite minimizes the washing effect of isopropanol, which slows down surface reconstruction and ultimately promotes the formation of a uniform mixed&#8208;halide perovskite phase. The optimized blue 3D mixed&#8208;halide PeLEDs achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 19.28% among blue&#8208;emissive 3D PeLEDs.








Abstract
The halide postdeposition treatment technique is a widely used strategy for mitigating defects in perovskite. However, when applied to mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, it often leads to surface and internal halide heterogeneity, which compromises luminescence performance and spectral stability. In this work, blue mixed&#8208;halide 3D perovskites are engineered with acetate (Ac&#8315;)&#8208;rich surfaces to optimize the post&#8208;treatment process and achieve halide homogeneity. The findings demonstrate that the strong interaction between surface Ac&#8315; ions and Pb2+ ions significantly reduces the formation of halide vacancy defects caused by the washing effect of isopropanol during post&#8208;treatment. This defect reduction slows the infiltration of halide ions into the perovskite lattice, providing more time for surface reconstruction and minimizing the accumulation of introduced halide ions at the surface. As a result, a mild halide redistribution occurs, promoting the formation of a uniform mixed&#8208;halide perovskite phase. This approach enabled the development of blue mixed&#8208;halide 3D PeLEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 19.28% (emission peak at 482&#160;nm), comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blue reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskite&#8208;based PeLEDs. Additionally, the device demonstrated a narrowband and stable electroluminescence spectrum with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of less than 16&#160;nm.

         <title>Si&#8208;H Hydrosilane Reducing Agents for Size&#8208; and Shape&#8208;Controlled InAs Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel mild reducing agent that successfully produces large, uniform InAs colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) with excellent optoelectronic properties. The elimination of (TMS)3As in the synthesis overcomes a key practical barrier for exploiting and exploring the properties of large InAs CQDs in infrared optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
InAs colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are a promising heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free material for infrared optoelectronic devices. However, their synthesis is limited by their reagents: the acutely toxic and difficult to source tris(trimethylsilyl)arsine ((TMS)3As), as well as the strong reducing agents (e.g., Super Hydride). A reducing agent is introduced based on hydrosilanes (Si&#8208;H) to address both challenges. A synthesis strategy with this agent is demonstrated, resulting in monodisperse InAs CQDs with a tunable first excitonic peak between 520 and 900&#160;nm by hot injection, and between 900 and 1550&#160;nm by continuous injection. Furthermore, by avoiding the use of carboxyl group&#8208;containing compounds, such as oleic acid or indium acetate, the synthesis minimizes surface oxidation during InAs CQDs formation. The synthesized InAs CQDs are of high optoelectronic quality, with a lower concentration of deep trap states, as evident by the remarkable characteristics of photodetectors fabricated from these CQDs: low dark current (&#8776;150 nA&#160;cm&#8722;2), external quantum efficiency (32% at 900&#160;nm), and a fast photoresponse time (&#8776;4.4 &#181;s). The elimination of (TMS)3As in the synthesis overcomes a key practical barrier for exploiting and exploring the properties of large InAs CQDs in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Segmented, Side&#8208;Emitting Hydrogel Optical Fibers for Multimaterial Extrusion Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft side&#8208;emitting optical fibers are fabricated by multimaterial extrusion printing of hydrogel inks with contrasting optical properties. Scattering segments are distributed along waveguiding fibers and allow tailored side emission of light. The side&#8208;emitting fibers can activate photophysical processes in a surrounding gel, showing potential for phototherapies.








Abstract
Side&#8208;emitting optical fibers allow light to be deliberately outcoupled along the fiber. Introducing a customized side&#8208;emission profile requires modulation of the guiding and emitting properties along the fiber length, which is a particular challenge in continuous processing of soft waveguides. In this work, it is demonstrated that multimaterial extrusion printing can generate hydrogel optical fibers with tailored segments for light&#8208;side emission. The fibers are based on diacrylated Pluronic F&#8208;127 (PluDA). 1&#160;mm diameter fibers are printed with segments of different optical properties by switching between a PluDA waveguiding ink and a PluDA scattering ink containing nanoparticles. The method allows the fabrication of fibers with segment lengths below 500 microns in a continuous process. The length of the segments is tailored by varying the switching time between inks during printing. Fibers with customized side&#8208;emission profiles along their length are presented. The functionality of the printed fibers is demonstrated by exciting fluorescence inside a surrounding 3D hydrogel. The presented technology and material combination allow unprecedented flexibility for designing soft optical fibers with customizable optical properties using simple processes and a medical material. This approach can be of interest to improve illumination inside tissues for photodynamic therapy (PDT).

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Regeneration of Spent LiMn2O4 Cathode Into High&#8208;Performance Ni&#8208;Doped LiMn2O4 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient laser&#8208;assisted regeneration process is developed to convert spent LiMn2O4 cathodes into performance&#8208;enhanced, Ni&#8208;doped cathodes. Surface Ni doping enhances interfacial processes and prevents capacity loss at lower temperatures by forming a new interface with a reduced charge transfer energy barrier. This innovative approach offers a sustainable solution for regenerating spent lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes.








Abstract
The rapid increase in lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) production, fueled by the rise of electric vehicles, highlights significant challenges in managing end&#8208;of&#8208;life LIBs, particularly regarding environmental impact and waste management. Traditional recycling methods, such as pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes, are energy&#8208;intensive and consume substantial reagents. In this study, a laser&#8208;assisted regeneration method is introduced for LiMn2O4 (LMO) cathodes, enabling in situ Ni doping into spent LMO cathodes (r&#8208;LMO&#8208;Ni) to enhance electrochemical performance. Surface Ni&#8208;doping improves interfacial processes and reduces capacity loss at lower temperatures by creating a new interface with a lower charge transfer energy barrier. The r&#8208;LMO&#8208;Ni cathode surpasses pristine LMO cathodes, achieving a specific capacity of 112.95&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 1 C and retaining 95.1% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 0 &#176;C. A techno&#8208;economic analysis supports the feasibility of this laser&#8208;assisted regeneration approach, offering an innovative pathway for upcycling spent cathodes and developing next&#8208;generation Mn&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Tunable Mirror&#8208;Symmetric Type&#8208;III Ising Superconductivity in Atomically&#8208;Thin Natural Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ising superconductors are known for remarkable resilience to external in&#8208;plane magnetic fields (B&#8741;) due to the protection of strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling fields &#945;SOC. By forming Cooper pairing states in mirror&#8208;symmetric Fermi surfaces with highly anisotropic &#945;SOC, a new type&#8208;III Ising superconductivity is discovered in atomically&#8208;thin natural van der Waals heterostructures of TaSe2/SnSe with anomalous B&#8741;&#8208;enhanced Tc.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) crystals with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) provide great opportunities for exploring unconventional 2D superconductors, wherein new pairing states emerge due to the interplay of SOC with crystalline symmetries, electronic correlations, quenched disorders and external modulation forces, etc. Here, a distinct mirror&#8208;symmetry protected Ising pairing state with unprecedented &#915;&#8208; and M&#8208;valley symmetries in natural vdW heterostructures (vdWH) of interweaving tetragonal SnSe and trigonal 1H&#8208;TaSe2 monolayers is reported, in which the unidirectional lattice interlocking effectively suppresses the K&#8208;valley Ising pairing mechanism by incommensurate charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave (CDW) transitions. In the 2D limit of an TaSe2/SnSe bilayer with intact basal mirror symmetry (Mz), the mirror&#8208;symmetric vdWH Ising superconductors show anomalous in&#8208;plane magnetic field B&#8214;&#8208;controlled enhancements in the critical temperature Tc, which is completely absent for multilayer vdWHs with broken Mz induced by orthorhombic stacking between nearest&#8208;neighbour TaSe2 monolayers. The experimental observations consistently reveal a mirror symmetry&#8208;protected type&#8208;III Ising state in the inversion asymmetric lattice of 1H&#8208;TaSe2, which is predicted to be a mixture of spin&#8208;singlet and spin&#8208;triplet&#160;states.

By forming Cooper pairing states in mirror-symmetric Fermi surfaces with highly anisotropic &#945;&lt;sub&gt;SOC&lt;/sub&gt;, a new type-III Ising superconductivity is discovered in atomically-thin natural van der Waals heterostructures of TaSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SnSe with anomalous &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;&#8741;&lt;/sub&gt;-enhanced &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals (vdW) crystals with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) provide great opportunities for exploring unconventional 2D superconductors, wherein new pairing states emerge due to the interplay of SOC with crystalline symmetries, electronic correlations, quenched disorders and external modulation forces, etc. Here, a distinct mirror-symmetry protected Ising pairing state with unprecedented &#915;- and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;-valley symmetries in natural vdW heterostructures (vdWH) of interweaving tetragonal SnSe and trigonal 1H-TaSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers is reported, in which the unidirectional lattice interlocking effectively suppresses the &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;-valley Ising pairing mechanism by incommensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) transitions. In the 2D limit of an TaSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SnSe bilayer with intact basal mirror symmetry (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;), the mirror-symmetric vdWH Ising superconductors show anomalous in-plane magnetic field &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;&#8214;&lt;/sub&gt;-controlled enhancements in the critical temperature &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, which is completely absent for multilayer vdWHs with broken &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; induced by orthorhombic stacking between nearest-neighbour TaSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers. The experimental observations consistently reveal a mirror symmetry-protected type-III Ising state in the inversion asymmetric lattice of 1H-TaSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is predicted to be a mixture of spin-singlet and spin-triplet&#160;states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bonding Optimization Strategies for Flexibly Preparing Multi&#8208;Component Piezoelectric Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible high piezoelectric film can be prepared by mixing crystal components with water&#8208;soluble polymer through co&#8208;dissolution&#8208;evaporation. Bonding optimization strategies, including choosing the PEO exhibiting weaker bonding interactions with crystal components, and slightly increasing the amount of either component of TMCM&#8208;CdCl3 during co&#8208;dissolution, can improve the crystallization yield and further enhance the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane d33 (&#8776;71 pC/N), and exceed most flexible piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Flexible films with optimal piezoelectric performance and water&#8208;triggered dissolution behavior are fabricated using the co&#8208;dissolution&#8211;evaporation method by mixing trimethylchloromethyl ammonium chloride (TMCM&#8208;Cl), CdCl2, and polyethylene oxide (PEO, a water&#8208;soluble polymer). The resultant TMCM trichlorocadmium (TMCM&#8208;CdCl3) crystal/PEO film exhibited the highest piezoelectric coefficient (d33) compared to the films employing other polymers because PEO lacks electrophilic or nucleophilic side&#8208;chain groups and therefore exhibits relatively weaker and fewer bonding interactions with the crystal components. Furthermore, upon slightly increasing the amount of one precursor of TMCM&#8208;CdCl3 during co&#8208;dissolution, this component gained an advantage in the competition against PEO for bonding with the other precursor. This in turn improved the co&#8208;crystallization yield of TMCM&#8208;CdCl3 and further enhanced d33 to &#8776;71 pC/N, exceeding that of polyvinylidene fluoride (a commercial flexible piezoelectric) and most other molecular ferroelectric crystal&#8208;based flexible films. This study presents an important innovation and progress in the methodology and theory for maintaining a high piezoelectric performance during the preparation of flexible multi&#8208;component piezoelectric crystal films.

         <title>Metal Doping Enabling Defective CoMo&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets as Highly Efficient Photosensitizers for NIR&#8208;II Photodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal doping is used to construct a series of defect&#8208;rich M&#8208;doped CoMo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (M = Mn, Cu, Al, Ni, Mg, Zn) photosensitizers for NIR&#8208;II photodynamic therapy (PDT). The defect&#8208;rich amorphous Zn&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets exhibit the optimal PDT performance under NIR&#8208;II 1270 nm laser irradiation, achieving highly efficient cancer cell killing and tumor elimination.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is attracting widespread attention as a promising strategy for tumor treatment. However, the efficacy of PDT is severely limited by the insufficient tissue penetration depth of the light source and low reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation efficiency. Herein, the metal doping strategy is reported to construct a series of defect&#8208;rich M&#8208;doped amorphous CoMo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (a&#8208;M&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH, M = Mn, Cu, Al, Ni, Mg, Zn) photosensitizers (PSs) for NIR&#8208;II PDT. Especially, M&#8208;doped CoMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets are synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method and then etched by acid treatment to prepare defect&#8208;rich a&#8208;M&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets. Under NIR&#8208;II 1270 nm laser irradiation, the defect&#8208;rich a&#8208;Zn&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets exhibit the optimal PDT performance compared with other a&#8208;M&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets, and also possess much higher ROS production activity (3.9 times) than that of the pristine a&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH, with a singlet oxygen quantum yield up to 1.86, which is the highest among all the reported PSs. After polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification, the a&#8208;Zn&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH&#8208;PEG nanosheets can function as an effective inorganic PS for PDT, effectively inducing cell apoptosis in vitro and eradicating tumors in vivo. Notably, transcriptome sequencing analysis and further molecular validation highlight the critical role of the apoptotic/p53/AMPK/oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathways in a&#8208;Zn&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH&#8208;PEG&#8208;induced cancer cell apoptosis.

         <title>Asymmetric Structural MXene/PBO Aerogels for High&#8208;Performance Electromagnetic Interference Shielding with Ultra&#8208;Low Reflection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of in situ growth method, heterostructure MXene@Ni electromagnetic functional fillers with good impedance matching performance are prepared by &#8220;electrostatic adsorption&#8208;solvothermal reduction&#8221;. And the obtained asymmetric structural (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8208;(MXene/PNF) aerogels prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer freeze&#8208;drying based on the layered modular design concept present high&#8208;performance electromagnetic interference shielding with ultra&#8208;low reflection and infrared camouflage.








Abstract
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with low electromagnetic (EM) waves reflection characteristics are ideal materials for blocking EM radiation and pollution. Materials with low reflectivity must be constructed using materials with excellent EM waves absorption properties. However, materials simultaneously possessing both low reflectivity and excellent EMI shielding performance remain scarce, consequently, multilayer structures need to be developed. Poly(p&#8208;phenylene&#8211;2,6&#8211;benzobisoxazole) nanofibers (PNF) are prepared by deprotonation. PNF are combined with MXene and heterostructure MXene@Ni prepared by in&#8208;situ growth; MXene@Ni/PNF acts as an EM absorption layer while MXene/PNF acts as an EM reflective layer. Finally, (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels are prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer freeze&#8208;drying based on the layered modular design concept. Experimental characterizations revealed that (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels enable the efficient absorption&#8208;reflection&#8208;reabsorption of EM waves, effectively eliminating EMI. When the mass ratio of MXene to Ni in MXene@Ni is 1:6 and the mass fraction of MXene in the reflective layer is 80 wt.%, the (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels exhibit excellent EMI shielding performance (71 dB) and a very low reflection coefficient (R = 0.10). Finite element simulations verified that the developed asymmetric structural aerogels achieve high EMI shielding performance with low reflection characteristics. In addition, (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels display excellent infrared camouflage ability.

         <title>In&#8208;Plane Adaptive Heteroepitaxy of 2D Cesium Bismuth Halides with Engineered Bandgaps on c&#8208;Sapphire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Cs2Bi3X9 (X = Br, Cl, I) perovskite crystals with variable lattice constants and engineered bandgaps are synthesized via adaptive heteroepitaxy on c&#8208;sapphire substrates. Photodetectors based on these epitaxial crystals exhibit significantly improved photodetection performance, indicating the effectiveness of epitaxial growth strategy for high&#8208;quality crystals. This work advances the integration of multicomponent 2D materials on dielectric substrates for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The heteroepitaxy of 2D materials with engineered bandgaps are crucial to broaden the spectral response for their integrated optoelectronic devices. However, it is a challenge to achieve the high&#8208;oriented epitaxy and integration of multicomponent 2D materials with varying lattice constants on the same substrate due to the limitation of lattice matching. Here, in&#8208;plane adaptive heteroepitaxy of a series of high&#8208;oriented 2D cesium bismuth halide (Cs3Bi2X9, X = I, Br, Cl) single crystals with varying lattice constants from 8.41 to 7.71 &#197; is achieved on c&#8208;plane sapphire with distinct lattice constant of 4.76 &#197; at a low temperature of 160&#160;&#176;C in an air ambient, benefiting from tolerable interfacial strain by switching compressive stress to tensile stress during a 30&#176; rotation of crystal orientation. First&#8208;principles calculation demonstrates that those are all thermodynamically stable phases, deriving from multiple minima of interfacial energy between single crystals and sapphire substrate. The detectivity of Cs3Bi2I9 photodetector reaches up to 3.7 &#215; 1012 Jones, deriving from high single&#8208;crystal quality. This work provides a promising experimental strategy and basic theory to boost the heteroepitaxy and integration of 2D single crystals with varying lattice constants on low&#8208;cost dielectric substrate, paving the way for their applications in integrated optoelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;2D Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (X = Br, Cl, I) perovskite crystals with variable lattice constants and engineered bandgaps are synthesized via adaptive heteroepitaxy on &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-sapphire substrates. Photodetectors based on these epitaxial crystals exhibit significantly improved photodetection performance, indicating the effectiveness of epitaxial growth strategy for high-quality crystals. This work advances the integration of multicomponent 2D materials on dielectric substrates for optoelectronic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heteroepitaxy of 2D materials with engineered bandgaps are crucial to broaden the spectral response for their integrated optoelectronic devices. However, it is a challenge to achieve the high-oriented epitaxy and integration of multicomponent 2D materials with varying lattice constants on the same substrate due to the limitation of lattice matching. Here, in-plane adaptive heteroepitaxy of a series of high-oriented 2D cesium bismuth halide (Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;9,&lt;/sub&gt; X = I, Br, Cl) single crystals with varying lattice constants from 8.41 to 7.71 &#197; is achieved on &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-plane sapphire with distinct lattice constant of 4.76 &#197; at a low temperature of 160&#160;&#176;C in an air ambient, benefiting from tolerable interfacial strain by switching compressive stress to tensile stress during a 30&#176; rotation of crystal orientation. First-principles calculation demonstrates that those are all thermodynamically stable phases, deriving from multiple minima of interfacial energy between single crystals and sapphire substrate. The detectivity of Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; photodetector reaches up to 3.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jones, deriving from high single-crystal quality. This work provides a promising experimental strategy and basic theory to boost the heteroepitaxy and integration of 2D single crystals with varying lattice constants on low-cost dielectric substrate, paving the way for their applications in integrated optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Adaptive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Discriminates Xylene Isomers by Shape&#8208;Responsive Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape&#8208;responsive MOF is employed to discern subtle shape differences among xylene isomers. The adsorbent deforms adaptively to match the shapes of isomer molecules, translating these diverse shapes into characteristic deformation energies. With &#8220;adaptive fitting&#8221; mechanism, where deformation energy scales with the mismatch between molecular shape and pore geometry, the adsorbent energetically favors PX over other isomers, thereby achieving energy&#8208;sieving of xylene isomers.









Abstract
The separation of xylene isomers, especially para&#8208;xylene, is a crucial but challenging process in the chemical industry due to their similar molecular dimensions. Here, a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework, Ni(ina)2, (ina = isonicotinic acid) is employed to effectively discriminate xylene isomers. The adsorbent with adaptive deformation accommodates the shapes of isomer molecules, thereby translating their subtle shape differences into characteristic framework deformation energies. Through a combination of multiple local flexibility behaviors, Ni(ina)2 exhibits guest&#8208;specific structural transformations that energetically favor para&#8208;xylene over other isomers. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and theoretical investigations validate this &#8220;adaptive fitting&#8221; mechanism, where the degree of structural deformation scales with the mismatch between the molecular shape and pore geometry. As a result, Ni(ina)2 achieves exceptional para&#8208;xylene selectivity in both liquid and vapor phase separations, maintaining a high para&#8208;xylene purity and productivity. This work demonstrates a novel strategy of exploiting framework flexibility to address challenging molecular separations and provides fresh insights into the design of selective adsorbents.

         <title>Modulation in Spin State of Co3O4 Decorated Fe Single Atom Enables a Superior Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co3O4 nanoparticles are invited to anchor on Fe1&#8208;NC. It is found the spin state of Fe and Co is effectively modulated. Thereby, a boosted ORR and OER performance is achieved for Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC proved by 163.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 in the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB test.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the keystone for the industrialization of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB). In this work, the modulation in the spin state of Fe single atom on nitrogen doped carbon&#160;(Fe1&#8208;NC) is devised by Co3O4 (Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC), and a mediate spin state is recorded. Besides, the d band center of Fe is downshifted associated with the increment in eg filling revealing the weakened interaction with OH* moiety, resulting in a boosted ORR performance. The ORR kinetic current density of Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC is 2.0&#8208; and 5.6 times higher than Fe1&#8208;NC and commercial Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, high spin state is found for Co in Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC contributing to the accelerated surface reconstruction of Co3O4 witnessed by operando Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies. A robust OER activity with overpotential of 352&#160;mV at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved, decreased by 18 and 60&#160;mV by comparison with Co3O4@NC and IrO2. The operando Raman reveals a balanced adsorption of OH* species and its deprotonation leading to robust stability. The ZAB performance of Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC is 193.2&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and maintains for 200&#160;h. Furthermore, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB shows a promising battery performance of 163.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell Analysis of Local Nascent Protein Deposition in 3D Microenvironments via Extracellular Protein Identification Cytometry (EPIC)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knowledge of the extracellular matrix drives the understanding of cell behavior. However, current analysis methods are limited to either bulk or low&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis, thus masking the heterogeneity in matrix deposition. Extracellular protein identification cytometry (EPIC) combines the high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis of flow cytometry with engineered microniche 3D cell culture, jointly enabling in situ matrix analysis of large cell populations.








Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM) guides cell behavior and tissue fate. Cell populations are notoriously heterogeneous leading to large variations in cell behavior at the single&#8208;cell level. Although insights into population heterogeneity are valuable for fundamental biology, regenerative medicine, and drug testing, current ECM analysis techniques only provide either averaged population&#8208;level data or single&#8208;cell data from a limited number of cells. Here, extracellular protein identification cytometry (EPIC) is presented as a novel platform technology that enables high&#8208;throughput measurements of local nascent protein deposition at single&#8208;cell level. Specifically, human primary chondrocytes are microfluidically encapsulated in enzymatically crosslinked microgels of 16 picoliter at kHz rates, forming large libraries of discrete 3D single&#8208;cell microniches in which ECM can be deposited. ECM proteins are labeled using fluorescence immunostaining to allow for nondestructive analysis via flow cytometry. This approach reveals population heterogeneity in matrix deposition at unprecedented throughput, allowing for the identification and fluorescent activated cell sorting&#8208;mediated isolation of cellular subpopulations. Additionally, it is demonstrated that inclusion of a second cell into microgels allows for studying the effect of cell&#8208;cell contact on matrix deposition. In summary, EPIC enables high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis of nascent proteins in 3D microenvironments, which is anticipated to advance fundamental knowledge and tissue engineering applications.

         <title>Interfacial Metal&#8208;Solvent Chelation for Direct Regeneration of LiFePO4 Cathode Black Mass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address interfacial challenges in spent LiFePO4&#160;(LFP) black mass, such as structural deterioration and residual impurities, a metal&#8208;solvent chelation strategy leveraging the strong chelation of the Acac&#8722; anion is presented. This approach enables effective spent LFP regeneration by surface reconstruction of the degraded LFP with reducing lithium diffusion barriers and enhancing lithium supplementation.








Abstract
Direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries presents a promising approach to effectively reuse valuable resources and benefit the environment. Unlike controlled laboratory conditions that commonly facilitate impurity purification and minimize structural damage, the LiFePO4 cathode black mass faces significant interfacial challenges, including structure deterioration, cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase residues, and damage from storage procedures, which hinder lithium replenishment and structure regeneration. Here, a metal&#8208;solvent chelation reaction using a lithium acetylacetonate solution is introduced to address these challenges under ambient conditions. This method regulates the near&#8208;surface structure through strong chelation between Acac&#8210; anions and Fe (III) elements, thus effectively eliminating the degraded amorphous phase and residual fluorine compounds. By direct lithium connection and reducing diffusion barriers, the reconstructed surface facilitates the re&#8208;lithiation process. The regenerated LiFePO4 cathodes demonstrate a capacity retention of 88.5% after 400 cycles at 1 C, while also outperforming traditional recycling methods in terms of environmental and economic benefits. This approach provides a promising solution for regenerating degraded LiFePO4 cathodes from actual dismantled black mass, thereby accelerating the practical application of battery recycling.

This method regulates the near-surface structure through strong chelation between Acac&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;&lt;/sup&gt; anions and Fe (III) elements, thus effectively eliminating the degraded amorphous phase and residual fluorine compounds. By direct lithium connection and reducing diffusion barriers, the reconstructed surface facilitates the re-lithiation process. The regenerated LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes demonstrate a capacity retention of 88.5% after 400 cycles at 1 C, while also outperforming traditional recycling methods in terms of environmental and economic benefits. This approach provides a promising solution for regenerating degraded LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes from actual dismantled black mass, thereby accelerating the practical application of battery recycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Non&#8208;Covalent Interaction Via Single Atom to Boost Interfacial Charge Transfer Toward Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Co&#8208;N4 is coordinated with 5&#8208;fluoroanthranilic acid (FAA) molecules, and used as a non&#8208;covalent hole&#8208;extracting layer on a BiVO4 substrate. The interfacial non&#8208;covalent interaction reduces the energy barrier of charge transfer between the BiVO4 and hole&#8208;extracting layer. The current density increased to 5.47 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and continuous operation for 105 h.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for hydrogen generation holds immense potential for addressing environmental and energy crises. Tailoring non&#8208;covalent interaction via a single atom is anticipated to realize prominent hole extracting facilitating PEC performance, but it has never been reported. In this study, single atom Co&#8208;N4 is coordinated with 5&#8208;fluoroanthranilic acid (FAA) molecules, then used as a non&#8208;covalent hole&#8208;extracting layer on a BiVO4 substrate. Experiments including X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectra, Kelvin probe force microscopy, transient absorption, and theoretical calculation demonstrate the FAA coordination alters the local configuration of the central Co atom, adjusting the interfacial non&#8208;covalent interaction, thereby reducing the barrier of charge transfer between BiVO4 and the hole&#8208;extracting layer. Consequently, photogenerated carriers are more effectively separated, and the PEC water oxidation performance is significantly enhanced with the photocurrent density of 5.47&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus RHE, much higher than those of previously reported BiVO4 photoanodes composited with porphyrin&#8208;based compounds. Experiments and theoretical simulation confirm that the boosted PEC performance originates from exceptional interfacial charge transfer rather than surface catalysis dynamic. This study provides an efficient strategy for tailoring non&#8208;covalent interaction by regulating single&#8208;atom coordination and promoting hole extract to boost PEC water oxidation activity.

         <title>High Efficiency (&gt;10%) AgBiS2 Colloidal Nanocrystal Solar Cells with Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based Polymer Hole Transport Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new BD2FCT material is developed as an advanced HTL tailored for AgBiS2 CNC solar cells through precise molecular engineering. This new polymer effectively reduces charge recombination at the CNC/HTL interfaces, thereby leading to enhanced charge extraction. Incorporation of the IEICO&#8208;4F into BD2FCT further improves charge funneling and absorption, resulting in a notable 10.1% PCE for AgBiS2 CNC solar cells.








Abstract
Silver bismuth disulfide (AgBiS2) colloidal nanocrystals (CNCs) have emerged as ecofriendly photoactive materials with excellent photoconductivity and high absorption coefficients, in compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) guidelines. To maximize the theoretical potential of AgBiS2 CNC solar cells, a new diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer, BD2FCT, optimized as a hole transport layer (HTL), is developed. This asymmetric thiophene&#8208;rich polymer HTL effectively complements the optical absorption spectrum of CNCs and forms a homogeneous layer atop the CNCs, facilitating favorable vertical charge transfer through intrinsic molecular packing. Furthermore, the BD2FCT HTL aligns energetically with AgBiS2, significantly reducing charge recombination at the CNC/HTL interfaces and enhancing charge extraction and photocurrent generation across the entire optical absorption spectrum. These characteristics are further optimized through precise molecular engineering. Additionally, a low&#8208;bandgap acceptor, IEICO&#8208;4F, is structurally incorporated with the BD2FCT polymer to further improve charge funneling and complementary absorption. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals enhanced hole transfer from CNC to BD2FCT&#8208;29DPP:IEICO&#8208;4F, resulting in reduced charge recombination and efficient charge extraction. Consequently, a BD2FCT&#8208;based AgBiS2 CNC solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.1%, demonstrating significant improvements in short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF).

         <title>Engineering Semiconducting Polymeric Nanoagonists Potentiate cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway Activation and Elicit Long Term Memory Against Recurrence in Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a comprehensive strategy is adopted that integrates innate immune responses with tumor&#8208;targeting PTT to simultaneously tackle multiple immune&#8208;suppressive mechanisms in breast cancer. The modulation of the TME is confirmed through the PTT&#8208;mediated ICD and the transactivation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway in immune cells (macrophages and DCs) of the TME due to the released dsDNA via ICD.








Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer has an immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; microenvironment, which leads to resistance to current immunotherapy. The activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has been thought a promising strategy to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. In this study, we adopted a comprehensive strategy that integrates innate immune responses with tumor&#8208;targeting photothermal therapy (PTT) to simultaneously tackle multiple immune&#8208;suppressive mechanisms in breast cancer. This semiconducting polymeric nanoagonists (DPTT&#8208;Mn Lipo NPs) mediated PTT can effectively initiate tumor cell apoptosis and induce ICD, thereby reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME and activating STING. We confirmed the modulation of the TME through the PTT&#8208;mediated ICD effect and the transactivation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway in immune cells of the TME due to the released dsDNA via ICD, such as macrophages and DCs. Indeed, DPTT&#8208;Mn Lipo NPs&#8208;mediated PTT promoted M1 polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, augmented T&#8208;cell infiltration, facilitated dendritic cell (DC) maturation, and regulated type I interferon factor secretion, leading to efficient tumor suppression. Most importantly, the combination of DPTT&#8208;Mn Lipo NPs&#8208;based PTT with a checkpoint blockade therapy (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) can elicit long&#8208;term immune memory besides tumor eradication. Collectively, this nano&#8208;system can systemically activate antitumor immunity through STING activation and potentially establish long&#8208;term memory against tumor recurrence.

         <title>Controlling Ion Uptake in Carboxylated Mixed Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of p&#8208;channel carboxylated mixed conductors is investigated to advance understanding and design strategies toward next&#8208;generation OMIEC systems. Varying side&#8208;chain functionality, distinctive swelling character during electrochemical doping/dedoping with model chao&#8208;/kosmotropic electrolytes is uncovered. As revealed for the first time through operando grazing incidence X&#8208;ray fluorescence studies, carboxyl functionalization leads to robust cation interactions, mitigating swelling.








Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) have garnered significant attention due to their capacity to transport both ions and electrons, making them ideal for applications in energy storage, neuromorphics, and bioelectronics. However, charge compensation mechanisms during the polymer redox process remain poorly understood, and are often oversimplified as single&#8208;ion injection with little attention to counterion effects. To advance understanding and design strategies toward next&#8208;generation OMIEC systems, a series of p&#8208;channel carboxylated mixed conductors is investigated. Varying side&#8208;chain functionality, distinctive swelling character is uncovered during electrochemical doping/dedoping with model chao&#8208;/kosmotropic electrolytes. Carboxylic acid functionalized polymers demonstrate strong deswelling and mass reduction during doping, indicating cation expulsion, while ethoxycarbonyl counterparts exhibit prominent mass increase, pointing to an anion&#8208;driven doping mechanism. By employing operando grazing incidence X&#8208;ray fluorescence (GIXRF), it is revealed that the carboxyl functionalized polymer engages in robust cation interaction, whereas ester functionalization shifts the mechanism towards no cation involvement. It is demonstrated that cations are pivotal in mitigating swelling by counterbalancing anions, enabling efficient anion uptake without compromising performance. These findings underscore the transformative influence of functionality&#8208;driven factors and side&#8208;chain chemistry in governing ion dynamics and conduction, providing new frameworks for designing OMIECs with enhanced performance and reduced swelling.

         <title>The First Kr&#8208;Selective Carbon Molecular Sieve for Inverse Adsorption of Krypton Over Xenon at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a novel &#8220;molecular cut&#8208;off method&#8221; paired with thermal&#8208;regulated pyrolysis to tailor ultramicropores within carbon molecular sieves. This approach reveals the thermal&#8208;evolution of the carbon structure and enables the molecular sieving of krypton from xenon at room temperature. This pioneering material demonstrates unprecedented selectivity, marking the first instance of achieving such targeted Kr/Xe separation through these innovative techniques.








Abstract
The efficient adsorption&#8208;based separation of krypton (Kr) and xenon (Xe) is of paramount importance but is challenged by their similar physicochemical properties. While carbon adsorbents are theoretically promising for Kr/Xe sieving, practical success has remained elusive. Here, a series of ultramicroporous carbon molecular sieves synthesized from sucrose&#8208;derived hydrochar is reported. The study employs careful characterization and controlled thermal pyrolysis to tailor ultramicropore formation and elucidate the evolution of the carbon framework. The leading material, C&#8208;Suc&#8208;750, has an ideal pore size of &#8776;4.0 &#197;. In particular, C&#8208;Suc&#8208;750 has achieved a remarkable Kr/Xe uptake ratio of 39.3 at ambient conditions, setting a new benchmark for selective Kr adsorption and molecular sieving of Kr/Xe. Breakthrough experiments further confirm the superior molecular sieving performance of C&#8208;Suc&#8208;750, highlighting its potential for Kr recovery in nuclear waste treatment. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate the critical role of narrow slit&#8208;pore of the carbon molecular sieve in molecular sieving separation of Kr/Xe, providing insights into the mechanism driving this selectivity.

         <title>Synergistic Degradation of Durable Polymer Networks by Light and Acid Enabled by Pyrenylsilicon Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant advancement in resolving the incompatibility between photodegradablity and photostability of polymer materials is reported by developing a novel cleavage reaction of the C&#8211;Si bond under simultaneous exposure to light and acid. The synergistic activation of polymer materials can be applied to a wide range of materials, including color&#8208;tunable optical materials, tough elastic materials, and additive/subtractive 3D&#8208;photoprinting materials.








Abstract
Material photocontrol has gained importance in process engineering and biomedical applications. However, highly photoreactive materials are intrinsically unstable to light, which limits their continuous use in lit environments owing to their gradual deterioration. Herein, synergistically photocontrollable materials in the presence of acid are developed to overcome the conventional trade&#8208;off between their photoreactivity and photostability. Pyrenylsilicon derivatives are designed as synergistically cleavable moieties on C&#8211;Si bonds under simultaneous treatment with light and acid through photoinduced dearomatization and protonation to generate the Wheland intermediate, whereas the derivatives are highly stable to light or acid alone. The unique reactivity of pyrenylsilicon derivatives is applied to various polymer network crosslinkers, enabling synergistic control and degradation of materials with light and acids. Because of their high photostability in the absence of acids, these materials can be utilized as optical materials, robust elastomers, and 3D photoprinted gels.

         <title>3D Nanofabrication via Directed Material Assembly: Mechanism, Method, and Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided material assembly, as an important mechanism of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanofabrication, has led to breakthroughs in fabrication resolution, material generality, and throughput, and enabled numerous new opportunities for nanotechnology. This review summarizes recent advances in this promising strategy with an emphasis on the synergy among different microscopic driving forces with different regioselective designs to achieve nanoscale assembly precision and sophisticated 3D structure design.








Abstract
Fabrication of complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structures at nanoscale is the core of nanotechnology, as it enables the creation of various micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;devices such as micro&#8208;robots, metamaterials, sensors, photonic devices, etc. Among most 3D nanofabrication strategies, the guided material assembly, an efficient bottom&#8208;up approach capable of directly constructing designed structures from precise integration of material building blocks, possesses compelling advantages in diverse material compatibility, sufficient driving forces, facile processing steps, and nanoscale resolution. In this review, we focus on assembly&#8208;based fabrication methods capable of creating complex 3D nanostructures (instead of periodic or 2.5D&#8208;only structures). Recent advances are classified based on the different assembly mechanisms, i.e., assembly driven by chemical reactions, physical interactions, and the synergy of multiple microscopic interactions. The design principles of representative fabrication strategies with an emphasis on their respective advantages, e.g., structural design flexibility, material compatibility, resolution, or applications are analyzed. In the summary and outlook, existing challenges, as well as possible paths to solutions for future development are reviewed. We believe that with recent advances in assembly&#8208;based nanofabrication strategies, 3D nanofabrication has achieved tremendous progress in resolution, material generality, and manufacturing cost, for it to make a greater impact in the near future.

         <title>Triphenylamine&#8208;Based Conjugated Microporous Polymers as the Next Generation Organic Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel porous polymer based on triphenylamine (LPCMP) is demonstrated as an exceptional cathode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This study highlights improvements in intrinsic conductivity, practical capacity, and redox potential. The protonated LPCMP cathode shows a capacity of 146&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 3.6&#160;V, high power density, and maintains stability over 1000 cycles, offering a significant breakthrough for high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power organic LIBs.








Abstract
This paper presents a study on a novel porous polymer based on triphenylamine (LPCMP) as an excellent cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Through structural design and a scalable post&#8208;synthesis approach, improvements in intrinsic conductivity, practical capacity, and redox potential in an organic cathode material is reported. The designed cathode achieves a notable capacity of 146&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; with an average potential of 3.6&#160;V, using 70% active material content in the electrode. Additionally, through appropriate structural design, the capacity can increase to 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. Even at a high current density of 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185; (360C), the cathode maintains a capacity of 74&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, enabling full charge within 10 s. A high specific energy density of 569&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; (at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;) is combined with a very high power density of 94.5&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; (at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185; corresponding to a specific energy density of 263&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;) surpassing the power density of graphene&#8208;based supercapacitors. It exhibits highly stable cyclic performance across various current densities, retaining almost 95% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 5.5C. This work presents a significant breakthrough in developing high&#8208;capacity, high&#8208;potential organic materials for sustainable, high&#8208;energy, and high&#8208;power lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Robust and Versatile Biodegradable Unclonable Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Labels with Multi&#8208;Mode Optical Encoding Using Protein&#8208;Mediated Luminescent Calcite Signatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable, robust, and versatile PUF platform with multi&#8208;mode encoding, multi&#8208;level cryptographic keys, and multiple authentication operations is developed by imprinting chaotically grown calcites on a versatile protein film. This all&#8208;biomaterial&#8208;based PUF exhibits superior encoding diversity, eco&#8208;friendly manufacturing, authentication ease, stability, and versatility over existing biocompatible PUF labels, providing a practical, high&#8208;security solution for combating counterfeiting across various applications.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are emerging as a cutting&#8208;edge technology for enhancing information security by providing robust security authentication and non&#8208;reproducible cryptographic keys. Incorporating renewable and biocompatible materials into PUFs ensures safety for handling, compatibility with biological systems, and reduced environmental impact. However, existing PUF platforms struggle to balance high encoding capacity, diversified encryption signatures, and versatile functionalities with sustainability and biocompatibility. Here, all&#8208;biomaterial&#8208;based unclonable anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels featuring multi&#8208;mode encoding, multi&#8208;level cryptographic keys, and multiple authentication operations are developed by imprinting biomimetic&#8208;grown calcites on versatile silk protein films. In this label, the inherent non&#8208;clonability comes from the randomized characteristics of calcites, mediated by silk protein during crystal growth. The successful embedding of photoluminescent molecules into calcite lattices, assisted by silk protein, allows the resulting platform to utilize fluorescence patterns alongside birefringence for high&#8208;capacity encoding. This design facilitates easy and rapid authentication through Hamming distance and convolutional neural networks using standard cameras and portable microscopes. Moreover, angle&#8208;dependent polarization patterns enable multi&#8208;level key generation, while multi&#8208;spectral fluorescence signals offer multi&#8208;channel keys. The developed anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels combine biodegradability, green manufacture, easy authentication, high&#8208;level complexity, low cost, robustness, patternability, and versatility, offering a practical and high&#8208;security solution to combat counterfeiting across various applications.

Incorporating renewable and biocompatible materials into PUFs ensures safety for handling, compatibility with biological systems, and reduced environmental impact. However, existing PUF platforms struggle to balance high encoding capacity, diversified encryption signatures, and versatile functionalities with sustainability and biocompatibility. Here, all-biomaterial-based unclonable anti-counterfeiting labels featuring multi-mode encoding, multi-level cryptographic keys, and multiple authentication operations are developed by imprinting biomimetic-grown calcites on versatile silk protein films. In this label, the inherent non-clonability comes from the randomized characteristics of calcites, mediated by silk protein during crystal growth. The successful embedding of photoluminescent molecules into calcite lattices, assisted by silk protein, allows the resulting platform to utilize fluorescence patterns alongside birefringence for high-capacity encoding. This design facilitates easy and rapid authentication through Hamming distance and convolutional neural networks using standard cameras and portable microscopes. Moreover, angle-dependent polarization patterns enable multi-level key generation, while multi-spectral fluorescence signals offer multi-channel keys. The developed anti-counterfeiting labels combine biodegradability, green manufacture, easy authentication, high-level complexity, low cost, robustness, patternability, and versatility, offering a practical and high-security solution to combat counterfeiting across various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superconductivity up to 14.2 K in MnB4 Under Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconductivity in 3d&#8208;transition metal&#8208;based compounds with magnetic elements is important and rare. This study reports the discovery of pressure induced superconductivity in MnB4 with the highest onset transition temperature (14.2 K) among the stoichiometric Mn&#8208;based superconductors. This work offers a promising avenue to explore high&#8208;Tc superconductivity by combining the 3d&#8208;transition metal magnetic elements and light elements.








Abstract
The discovery of superconductivity in 3d transition&#8208;metal compounds with strong magnetism is interesting but rare. Especially for Mn&#8208;based compounds, there exist only very limited materials that show superconductivity. Here, the discovery of superconductivity is reported with an onset transition temperature up to 14.2 K in a Mn&#8208;based material MnB4, which is the highest value among the stoichiometric Mn&#8208;based superconductors. By applying high pressure, the continuous suppression of a weak semiconducting behavior and the occurrence of superconductivity after &#8776;30 GPa are found. With further increasing pressure, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is gradually enhanced and reaches the maximum onset transition value of &#8776;14.2&#160;K at 150 GPa. The synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction data reveal the unchanged monoclinic (S.G: P21/c) symmetry but an unusual crossover of the lattice parameters b and c in a certain pressure region as confirmed by the theoretical calculation. The findings show a promising way to explore high Tc superconductivity by combining the 3d&#8208;transition metal magnetic elements and light elements.

         <title>Integrating Interactive Ir Atoms into Titanium Oxide Lattice for Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactive Ir atoms with varied geometric structure play a crucial role in promoting the intrinsic oxygen&#8208;evolution activity, as it can optimize the intermediate adsorption by adjusting the d&#8208;band center of active Ir sites. This correlation of Ir atoms benefits their valence stability, suppressing the over&#8208;oxidation of active Ir and synergistically improving the catalyst durability.








Abstract
Iridium (Ir)&#8208;based oxide is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalyst for acidic water oxidation, yet it is restricted to a few Ir&#8208;O octahedral packing modes with limited structural flexibility. Herein, the geometric structure diversification of Ir is achieved by integrating spatially correlated Ir atoms into the surface lattice of TiO2 and its booting effect on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is investigated. Notably, the resultant i&#8208;Ir/TiO2 catalyst exhibits much higher electrocatalytic activity, with an overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and excellent stability of 315 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic electrolyte. Both experimental and theoretical findings reveal that flexible Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Ir coordination with varied geometric structure plays a crucial role in enhancing OER activity, which optimize the intermediate adsorption by adjusting the d&#8208;band center of active Ir sites. Operando characterizations demonstrate that the interactive Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Ir units can suppress over&#8208;oxidation of Ir, effectively widening the stable region of Ir species during the catalytic process. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, equipped with i&#8208;Ir/TiO2 as an anode, gives a low driving voltage of 1.63 V at 2 A cm&#8722;2 and maintains stable performance for over 440 h. This work presents a general strategy to eliminate the inherent geometric limitations of IrOx species, thereby inspiring further development of advanced catalyst designs.

         <title>Thermionic Emission in Artificially Structured Single&#8208;Crystalline Elemental Metal/Compound Semiconductor Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rawat et al. present a novel class of epitaxial lattice&#8208;matched metal/semiconductor superlattice by pairing refractory hexagonal elemental metals and wide&#8208;bandgap III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. Exemplified by the Hf/AlN as an archetypical system, cross&#8208;plane thermionic emission and significant enhancement in cross&#8208;plane Seebeck coefficient attributed to carrier energy filtering by Schottky barriers are demonstrated.








Abstract
Metal/semiconductor superlattices represent a fascinating frontier in materials science and nanotechnology, where alternating layers of metals and semiconductors are precisely engineered at the atomic and nano&#8208;scales. Traditionally, epitaxial metal/semiconductor superlattice growth requires constituent materials from the same family, exhibiting identical structural symmetry and low lattice mismatch. Here, beyond this conventional constraint, a novel class of epitaxial lattice&#8208;matched metal/semiconductor superlattices is introduced that utilizes refractory hexagonal elemental transition metals and wide&#8208;bandgap III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. Exemplified by the Hf/AlN superlattices exhibiting coherent layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer epitaxial growth, cross&#8208;plane thermionic emission is observed through current&#8211;voltage measurements accomplished for the first time in any metal/semiconductor superlattices. Further, thermoreflectance measurements reveal significant enhancement in cross&#8208;plane Seebeck coefficients attributed to carrier energy filtering by Schottky barriers. Demonstration of artificially structured elemental&#8208;metal/wide&#8208;bandgap compound&#8208;semiconductor superlattices promises to usher in new fundamental physics studies and cutting&#8208;edge applications such as tunable hyperbolic metamaterials, quantum computing, and thermionic&#8208;emission&#8208;based thermoelectric and thermophotonic energy conversion devices.

         <title>Efficient Quasi&#8208;Homogenous Photocatalysis Enabled by Molecular Nanophotocatalysts with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Motif</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule&#8208;based quasi&#8208;homogeneous nanophotocatalyst is developed by solution&#8208;processing of donor&#8208;acceptor molecules from micrometer&#8208;sized powder into &#8776;60&#160;nm uniform nanoparticles assisted by hydrophilic surfactants. This quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalyst demonstrated greatly improved light&#8208;harvesting, water&#8208;wettability, and exciton dissociation, resulting in distinctly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate from a negligible level.








Abstract
Polymer semiconductors have attracted much attention for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, but they typically exhibit micrometer&#8208;sized particles in water&#8208;suspension, causing severe loss in light absorption and exciton recombination. Here a molecular nanophotocatalyst featuring a donor&#8208;acceptor motif is presented that solution is processed via a facile stirring nanoprecipitation method assisted by hydrophilic surfactants, enabling an efficient quasi&#8208;homogenous hydrogen evolution. In contrast to the original bulk powder (heterogeneous system), these quasi&#8208;homogenous nanophotocatalysts exhibit significantly improved light&#8208;harvesting, water&#8208;wettability, and exciton dissociation, resulting in distinctly enhanced (by four&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude) photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate. The optimized nanophotocatalysts (4CzPN/DDBAB/SDBS) generate an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate&#160;of 116.42&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and apparent quantum yield of 30.2% at 365&#160;nm, which are among the highest reported for single&#8208;junction organic photocatalysts. The scalability of the quasi&#8208;homogenous photocatalysts is further demonstrated using a flow&#8208;based flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) processing.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Featuring Highly Tunable Dynamic Aggregation States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Processibility tuning of MOFs has always been a significant but challenging goal. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable MOF, NKU&#8208;Mg&#8208;1, is successfully constructed by utilizing the behavior of dynamic coordination bonds, achieving facile manipulation of the aggregation state. Its intrinsic solution processability and multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive emission features make it a promising candidate material for expanding multifunctional luminescent (e.g. circularly polarized luminescence) applications.








Abstract
The limited processability of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is hindered flexibility in the manipulation of their aggregation state and applications. Therefore, achieving highly processable MOFs is of great significance but a challenging goal. Herein, a facile strategy is presented for achieving the construction of solution&#8208;processable Mg&#8208;based MOF, NKU&#8208;Mg&#8208;1, allowing for dynamic control of the aggregation state through dynamic self&#8208;assembly (DySA) process and reversible circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switcher modulation. Notably, micron&#8208;sized crystals of NKU&#8208;Mg&#8208;1 can be readily dispersed in water to form nano&#8208;sized colloids, triggered by the dynamic COO&#8208;Mg coordination bonding interruption by the competitive H2O&#8208;Mg bonding. Accordingly, the aggregation state of the colloid MOF can be readily tuned from 50&#8211;80&#160;nm up to 1000&#160;nm, in turn enabling control of aggregation&#8208;dependent emission. Specially, the solid&#8208;phase aggregation can be controlled via structural transitions between 3D NKU&#8208;Mg&#8208;1&#8208;rec&#8208;1 and 2D NKU&#8208;Mg&#8208;1&#8208;rec&#8208;2 nano&#8208;crystals, as confirmed by 3D electron diffraction. Furthermore, benefiting from its highly dynamic tunable aggregation nature, the rational incorporation of the chiral module confers significant CPL activity (glum up to 0.01). Importantly, controllable dynamic aggregation enables reversible switching of the CPL activity by precisely regulating the aggregation states. The solution&#8208;processable and dynamic aggregation&#8208;tunable features endow it highly promising for applications.

         <title>Superior Capacitive Energy Storage Enabled by Molecularly Interpenetrating Interfaces in Layered Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer dielectrics are ubiquitous in electronics and electrical power systems, but suffer from low energy density (Ue) and charge&#8211;dischage efficiency (&#951;). Here a scalable approach utilizing the designed molecularly interpenetrating interfaces is presented to achieve all&#8208;organic dielectric polymers with an ultahigh Ue of 22.89&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at &#951; &#8805; 90%, far outperforming exisitng polymer dielectrics.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are essential for advanced electronics and electrical power systems, yet they suffer from low energy density (Ue) due to their low dielectric constant (K) and the inverse relationship between K and breakdown stength (Eb). Here a scalable approach utilizing the designed molecularly interpenetrating interfaces is presented to achieve all&#8208;organic dielectric polymers with high Ue and charge&#8211;dischage efficiency (&#951;). Distinctive intermolecular interactions and microstructural changes, as demonstrated experimentally and theoretically, are introduced by the molecularly interpenetrating interfaces, resulting in simultaneous improvements in dielectric responses and mechanical strength while inhibiting electrical conduction &#8211; outcomes unattainable in conventional layered polymers. Consequently, exceptional improvments in both K and Eb are achieved, yielding a very high Ue of 22.89&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with &#951; &#8805; 90%, outperforming current layered polymer dielectrics. The bilayers can be easily fabricated into large&#8208;area films with high uniformity and outstanding capacitive stability (&gt;500&#8201;000 cycles), offering a practical route to scalable high&#8208;Ue polymer dielectrics for electrical energy storage.

         <title>Army Ant Nest Inspired Adaptive Textile for Smart Thermal Regulation and Healthcare Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the thermal adaptability of army ant nest, an innovative textile, Army ant Nest Textile (ANT), is developed for intelligent thermal regulation and healthcare monitoring. The ANT swiftly reacts to perspiration, enhancing heat dissipation through improved radiation transmission and air exchange. Additionally, it integrates colorimetric sensors for temperature, sweat pH, and UV intensity, providing vital risk signals for users.








Abstract
A textile material that can dynamically adapt to different environments while serving as an immediate alert system for early detection of life&#8208;threatening factors in the surroundings, not only enhances the individual's health management but also contributes to a reduction in energy consumption for space cooling and/or heating. In nature, different species have their own adaptation system to ambient temperature. Inspired by the army ant nest, herein a thermal adaptive textile known as Army ant Nest Textile (ANT) for thermal management and health monitoring is reported. This textile can promptly respond to perspiration, rapidly absorb sweat, and then transform its architecture to facilitate heat dissipation. Simultaneously, the colorimetric sensing function of ANT allows it to emulate the &#8220;site migration&#8221; behavior of the army ant nest, which empowers individuals to expeditiously identify multiple health&#8208;related signals such as body temperature, UV radiation, and sweat pH values, and warn them to move to a secure environment, thereby effectively reducing the likelihood of physical harm. Together with its excellent scalability and biocompatibility, the ANT offers a promising direction for the development of next&#8208;generation smart e&#8208;textiles for personal thermal and healthcare management, while satisfying the growing demand for energy saving.

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Polyphenol&#8208;Based Antidepressant for Alleviating Colitis&#8208;Associated Mental Disorders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research develops a metal&#8211;polyphenol&#8208;based nanomaterial for use as an antidepressant, which can be orally administered for modulating the microbiota&#8211;gut&#8211;brain axis in colitis mice. The nanomaterial reduces neuroinflammation, enhances hippocampal neural plasticity, modulates hippocampal immune responses, and restores neurotransmitter homeostasis in colitis mice, eventually alleviating colitis&#8208;associated mental disorders, including depression&#8208;like behavior, anxiety&#8208;like behavior, cognitive impairment, and despair.








Abstract
Emerging evidence suggests that patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are predisposed to psychosocial disturbances, such as depression and anxiety. Regrettably, clinical antidepressants exhibit unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy in IBD&#8208;associated psychosocial disturbances, primarily attributed to the inherent intestinal disorders and intricate bidirectional relationship between the gut and the brain. Herein, we report a metal&#8211;polyphenol&#8208;based antidepressant to alleviate mental disorders in dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced experimental acute colitis mice via modulating the microbiota&#8211;gut&#8211;brain axis. The antidepressant, termed CSMTC, comprises a core of melittin&#8208;encapsulated natural antioxidant enzymes (i.e., catalase and superoxide dismutase) and a protective shell composed of tannic acid&#8211;cerium ion network. Upon oral administration to colitis mice, CSMTC can effectively restore colonic redox balance, reinforce the intestinal barrier, modulate gut microbiota composition, maintain the blood&#8211;brain barrier integrity, and regulate systemic immune responses. Notably, behavioral test results reveal that CSMTC significantly alleviates the colitis&#8208;associated mental disorder (e.g., depression&#8208;like behavior) via the microbiota&#8211;gut&#8211;brain axis by reducing neuroinflammation, enhancing hippocampal neural plasticity, modulating hippocampal immune responses, and restoring neurotransmitter homeostasis. This work may have implications for the development of new nanodrugs for treating inflammation&#8208;associated complications.

This Perspective covers photonic nanomaterials and devices currently used in photobiomodulation and optogenetics for digitally controlled neurostimulation, providing the potential for neuro&#8208;immune interactions.








Abstract
The nervous and immune systems are closely interconnected, and influence the onset and progress of various diseases. Accordingly, understanding the interaction of the neural system and the immune system becomes very important for the treatment of intractable diseases with the analysis of therapeutic mechanisms, such as autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and so on. The conventional immunomodulation treatments have been mainly carried out by drug administration, but they have suffered from systemic negative side&#8208;effects with only limited effects on the specific disease. In this Perspective, photonic nanomaterials and devices are reviewed and discussed for digitally controlled neurostimulating photomedicine via photobiomodulation and optogenetics from the unique viewpoint of neuro&#8208;immune cross&#8208;talks. The prospects and perspectives to integrate photonic nanomaterials with advanced wearable and implantable healthcare devices are also provided and highlighted to revolutionize the therapeutic strategies by the interaction of neural and immune systems, and optimize the treatment protocols for futuristic digital photomedicine. This approach will revolutionize the fields of neurostimulation and immune regulation for further clinical applications.

Accordingly, understanding the interaction of the neural system and the immune system becomes very important for the treatment of intractable diseases with the analysis of therapeutic mechanisms, such as autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and so on. The conventional immunomodulation treatments have been mainly carried out by drug administration, but they have suffered from systemic negative side-effects with only limited effects on the specific disease. In this Perspective, photonic nanomaterials and devices are reviewed and discussed for digitally controlled neurostimulating photomedicine via photobiomodulation and optogenetics from the unique viewpoint of neuro-immune cross-talks. The prospects and perspectives to integrate photonic nanomaterials with advanced wearable and implantable healthcare devices are also provided and highlighted to revolutionize the therapeutic strategies by the interaction of neural and immune systems, and optimize the treatment protocols for futuristic digital photomedicine. This approach will revolutionize the fields of neurostimulation and immune regulation for further clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large Scale Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Polycrystalline Wafer Achieved by Hot&#8208;Pressed Strategy for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot&#8208;pressed AG3Bi2I9 (AG: aminoguanidinium) polycrystalline wafers possess a high mobility&#8208;lifetime product of 5.66 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 and therefore achieve high X&#8208;ray sensitivity of 2675 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Besides, the wafers have the X&#8208;ray detection limit as low as 11.8 nGy s&#8722;1, excellent long&#8208;term working stability, and high spatial resolution of 5.9 lp mm&#8722;1 in imaging.








Abstract
Halide perovskites (HPs) have demonstrated excellent direct X&#8208;ray detection performance. Lead&#8208;free perovskite polycrystalline wafers have outstanding advantages in large&#8208;area X&#8208;ray imaging applications due to their area&#8208;scalability, thickness&#8208;controllability, large bulk resistivity, and ease of integration with large&#8208;area thin film transistor arrays. However, currently lead&#8208;free perovskite polycrystalline wafers possess low sensitivity, typically less than 1000 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, which severely limits their X&#8208;ray detection applications. Here, high&#8208;quality and large scale polycrystalline wafers of AG3Bi2I9 (AG: aminoguanidinium) with short intercluster distances are successfully prepared using a hot&#8208;pressing method. The wafers possess high mobility&#8208;lifetime product of 5.66 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 and therefore achieve high X&#8208;ray sensitivity of 2675 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, which can be comparable to those of the high&#8208;quality single crystal counterpart reported by the previous research (7.94 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 and 5791 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2), and represent the best results of the currently lead&#8208;free HP polycrystalline wafers. Besides, the wafers exhibit the X&#8208;ray detection limit as low as 11.8 nGy s&#8722;1, excellent long&#8208;term working stability, and high spatial resolution of 5.9 lp mm&#8722;1 in imaging. The findings demonstrate that AG3Bi2I9 polycrystalline wafers are feasible for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection and imaging system.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Assisted Passivation Growth of 2D Ultrathin &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 Crystals for High&#8208;Performance Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface&#8208;assisted passivation growth strategy is designed to synthesize ultrathin and large size &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 crystals with the thickness down to 0.77 nm and the lateral size up to 163 &#181;m. Experiments and theoretical calculations substantiate the growth mechanism. Remarkably, &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 flakes based photodetectors exhibit excellent performance and anisotropic photodetection that surpass or are comparable to other 2D materials devices.








Abstract
2D nonlayered materials (NLMs) have garnered considerable attention due to unique surface structure and bright application prospect. However, owing to the strong interatomic forces caused by intrinsic isotropic chemical bonds in all directions, the direct synthesis of ultrathin and large area 2D NLMs remains a tremendous challenge. Here, the surface&#8208;assisted passivation growth strategy is designed to synthesize ultrathin and large size &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 crystals with the thickness down to 0.77 nm and the lateral size up to 163 &#181;m. These results are primarily ascribed to the bonding between Se atoms and the unsaturated Bi atoms on the surface of &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3, resulting in the surface passivation and promoting the obtaining of ultrathin &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3. Strikingly, the photodetectors based on &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 flakes exhibit a high photoresponsivity of 71.91 A W&#8722;1, an excellent detectivity of 6.09 &#215; 1013 Jones, a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 2.4 &#215; 104%, an outstanding anisotropic photodetection and excellent UV imaging capability at 365 nm. This work sheds light on the synthesis of 2D ultrathin NLMs and promotes their applications in multifunctional optoelectronics.

         <title>Root&#8208;Growth&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Morphology&#8208;Evolution of Microsized Bismuth Surrounded by Microsized Hard Carbon for Stabilized Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by &#8220;root growth in soil&#8221;, microsized Bi particles (&#181;m&#8208;Bi, as &#8220;seeds&#8221;) surrounded by microsized hard carbon particles (&#181;m&#8208;HC) matrix (as &#8220;soil&#8221;) are ingeniously dispersed through a simple mixing approach. This design utilizes the morphological self&#8208;evolution of &#181;m&#8208;Bi into Bi&#8208;nanonetworks between dispersed &#181;m&#8208;HC, leading to 2000 stable cycles.








Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type materials are desirable for high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Different from nanoengineering with pre&#8208;reserving void space and confined carbon coatings, microsized particles promise high specific/volumetric capacities, easy manufacturing, and low cost but are prone to rapid capacity loss. Herein, inspired by the process of &#8220;root growth in soil&#8221;, microsized Bi particles (&#181;m&#8208;Bi, as &#8220;seeds&#8221;) surrounded by microsized hard carbon particles (&#181;m&#8208;HC, as &#8220;soil&#8221;) are ingeniously dispersed through a simple mixing approach. This design utilizes the morphological self&#8208;evolution of &#181;m&#8208;Bi into Bi&#8208;nanonetworks between dispersed &#181;m&#8208;HC during repeated (de)sodiations, leading to a stable capacity retention of 99.8% for 2000 cycles, higher than that of the &#181;m&#8208;Bi electrode (7.2%) at a high mass loading of 5.5 mg cm&#8722;2. The interconnected Bi&#8208;nanonetworks and &#181;m&#8208;HC particles provide continuous electron pathways and facilitate electrolyte infiltration, which effectively boosts electrical contact, stable cycling, and high&#8208;rate capability. Especially, the hybrid Bi40HC60 (optimized weight ratio) thick&#8208;film electrode shows boosted comprehensive electrochemical performance, superior to HC and &#181;m&#8208;Bi electrodes. The Bi40HC60||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell, assembled without any pre&#8208;treatment, delivers 4500 stable cycles. This nature&#8208;inspired strategy provides a simple yet practical approach for employing the electrochemically driven evolution of micro&#8208;sized active materials and realizing high specific/volumetric capacities, fast kinetics, and long&#8208;term cycling stability.

The past few years have witnessed the rapid exploration of natural and synthetic materials to construct electronic skins (e&#8208;skins) to emulate the multisensory functions of human skins driven by promising applications. Among various materials employed in functional e&#8208;skins, biopolymers are particularly notable for their exceptional biocompatibility and abundant resources. Despite remarkable progress in engineering biopolymeric materials, a timely and holistic review focusing on the design, synthesis, and modification of biopolymers tailored for biopolymers&#8208;derived e&#8208;skins (Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins) is lacking. In this review, the key attributes of biopolymers are introduced&#160;to establish a fundamental understanding fordeveloping functional Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins. Next, the recent progress in harnessing various natural and synthetic biopolymers as building blocks for constructing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins is systematically discussed, providing insights into maximizing the distinctive attributes of biopolymers. Subsequently, the benefits of nature&#8208;inspired Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins achieved through heterogeneous composite and structural engineering are highlighted, infusing fresh momentum into the advancement of e&#8208;skins. Then, the promising applications of Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins in multisensory functions are summarized, including both local monitoring and remote teleoperation, as well as sustainable energy harvesting that empowers e&#8208;skins. Finally, the remaining fundamental and technical challenges in advancing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins are presented to provoke future designs that emulate and even go beyond human skins.

         <title>Electrical Dissipation Factor Measurements of Droplet Impact&#8208;Derived Microgels with Different Topological Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing rapid cross&#8208;linking, the study captures magnetic microgels with different macroscopic topological structures from droplet evolution. The study investigates the effect of the topological structures on the physical properties of macroscopic model materials and discovers that the toroidal structures of genus (1) exhibit a high intensity of electrical dissipation and can be tuned through assembling and symmetry breaking at low frequencies.








Abstract
Topology, the study of properties that are invariant under continuous transformations, in which the number of pores (genus) is a profound concept that determines a number of properties that have been verified in many microscopic systems, but have not been studied in macroscopic materials. Microgels are widely used materials, and based on microfluidics, regular, stable, and reproducible microgels can be prepared, but studies from the perspective of topological principles have not been reported. In this paper, a system based on a boric acid ester rapid cross&#8208;linking strategy that can rapidly capture topological changes during the transient process of droplet&#8208;to&#8208;ring transition is proposed. The electrical dissipation properties associated with different transient topologies during the process are also investigated, demonstrating that the change of topological structures in macroscopic materials also affected their electrical properties, laying the foundation for the design of modulated macroscopic micro structured materials based on topology theory.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Buckled Nanofibrous Ceramic Aerogels with Ultra&#8208;Large Stretchability and Tensile&#8208;Insensitive Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired design and synthesis of ultra&#8208;stretchable ceramic aerogels based on highly buckled nanofibers is reported to solve the formidable fiber fracture in ceramic aerogels. The resulting material features unusual combination of ultra&#8208;large stretchability, excellent thermomechanical stability and tensile&#8208;insensitive thermal insulating property, which addresses the critical and bottleneck problem of low structural stability induced thermal runaway in ceramic aerogels.








Abstract
Ceramic aerogels have exhibited many superior characteristics with promising applications. As an attractive material system for thermal insulation under extreme conditions, ceramic aerogels are required to withstand complex thermomechanical stress to retain their super&#8208;insulating properties but, they often suffer from severe fracture damage that can lead to catastrophic failure. Herein, inspired by the tendrils of Parthenocissus, we report a design and synthesis of ultra&#8208;stretchable ceramic aerogels constructed by highly buckled nanofibers. The buckling of nanofibers is formed by asymmetric deformation through two&#8208;component off&#8208;axial electrospinning method. The resulting aerogels feature an ultra&#8208;large stretchability with a tensile strain of up to 150% and high restorability with a tensile strain of up to 80%. They also display a near&#8208;zero Poisson's ratio (4.3 &#215; 10&#8722;2) and a near&#8208;zero thermal expansion coefficient (2.6 &#215; 10&#8722;7 per&#160;&#176;C), resulting in excellent thermomechanical stability. Benefiting from this ultra&#8208;stretchability, the aerogels exhibit a unique tensile&#8208;insensitive thermal insulation performance with thermal conductivities remaining only &#8776;106.7 mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 1000&#160;&#176;C. This work promotes the development of ceramic aerogels for robust thermal insulation under extreme conditions and establishes a set of fundamental considerations in structural design of stretchable aerogels for a wide spectrum of applications.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Ultrabroadband Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of ultrabroadband NIR phosphors with excellent luminescence properties while free of rare&#8208;metal elements, is developed by revealing and then manipulating the weak&#8208;field&#8208;site occupation of Cr3+ in spinel compounds that are conventionally believed to only show strong&#8208;field&#8208;site occupation. The resulting NIR phosphor&#8208;converted LED possesses unprecedentedly high brightness, ultra&#8208;wide spectral coverage, and low cost.








Abstract
Trivalent chromium (Cr3+) is an attractive near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitter, but its ultrabroadband NIR emission is limited to host crystals containing large amounts of rare&#8208;metal elements and usually suffers from low internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and poor thermal stability. Here, a class of high&#8208;performance, rare&#8208;metal&#8208;free ultrabroadband NIR phosphors, are reported by revealing that weak&#8208;field Cr3+ centers featuring broadband NIR emission with near&#8208;unity IQEs are intrinsic, though in trace quantities, to Cr3+ doped MgAl2O4 spinel (MAS) and its derivatives well&#8208;known for their narrowband far&#8208;red emission. It is shown that such weak&#8208;field Cr3+ centers stem from cation inversion ubiquitous in spinel compounds, and their quantity can be increased simply by superstoichiometric Al2O3/Ga2O3. Then SiO2 is introduced into Al2O3&#8208;excess MAS to break the inversion symmetry of Cr3+ centers for greatly improving the probabilities of their otherwise parity&#8208;forbidden 3d&#8211;3d transitions. The as&#8208;fabricated phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes are capable of emitting ultrabroadband NIR light with high photoelectric efficiency (16.0%) and optical power (180.8&#160;mW), and excellent spectral stability, which apparently outperforms existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices.

         <title>Local Proton&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of a High&#8208;Entropy Borate Library</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high local protons&#8208;mediated room&#8208;temperature solution method is developed to synthesize a new type of high entropy borates nanosheets with arbitrary metal component numbers from 5 to 12 up to 3302 kinds in total within 1&#160;min.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy compounds (HECs) provide extensive possibilities for exploring distinctive properties and potential applications. However, most HECs reported so far are synthesized by an arduous high&#8208;temperature treatment and special equipment, which is clearly not scalable for practical application. Here a scalable room&#8208;temperature solution synthetic strategy is reported for a library of high&#8208;entropy borates with arbitrary metal component numbers from 5 to 12 up to 3302 kinds in total and more than a hundred grams per operation within one minute. In conjunction with theoretical and in situ investigations, it is uncovered that the highly local concentration of protons at ethanol/aqueous interface is favorable to the creation of a stable thermodynamic microenvironment and a desirable kinetic miscibility reservoir, thus enabling a formation of single&#8208;phase borates. With the FeCoNiMoCu high&#8208;entropy borate, it is further shows that it functions as a highly active catalyst for catalytic oxygen evolution reaction. The work opens up opportunities for the scalable synthesis of HECs for energy storage and conversion applications.

         <title>Polymorphing Hydrogels Regulated by Photo&#8208;reactive DNA Cross&#8208;links</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;reactive DNA&#8208;cross&#8208;linked hydrogels are presented that enable polymorphing under patterned light. The photo&#8208;reactive DNA crosslinks act as a regulator in morphing of the hydrogels, adjusting the lengths of the cross&#8208;links depending on the wavelength of light. Spatiotemporal controllability and reprogrammable features of the polymorphing hydrogels within a one&#8208;pot system offer advanced solutions for applications in soft robotics and 4D printing.








Abstract
Polymorphing hydrogels can morph into another structure on demand with reprogrammable features. This concept extends the degree of morphing beyond that of traditional shape&#8208;morphing hydrogels, which predetermine their morphing capabilities at the fabrication stage. However, current polymorphing hydrogels face limitations due to the need for complex, non&#8208;sustained responsiveness or additional chemical steps for reconfigurable morphing. Here, photo&#8208;reactive DNA&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymorphing hydrogels are presented that enable polymorphing under patterned light. The photo&#8208;reactive DNA cross&#8208;links act as a regulator in changing the shapes of the hydrogels by adjusting the lengths of the cross&#8208;links depending on the wavelength of light, which allows precise and dynamic morphing in a programmable way through a one&#8208;pot reaction. The high programmability involving spatiotemporal controllability and reprogrammable features offers advanced solutions for multifunctional soft machines and applications requiring complex processes.

         <title>Crystallinity&#8208;Controlled Hexagonal Boron Nitride&#8208;Based Memristors for Fully Integrated Reservoir Computing Processors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallinity&#8208;controlled h&#8208;BN films are synthesized using the PECVD method. Memristors based on h&#8208;BN films exhibit reservoir dynamics and synaptic characteristics depending on the films&#8217; crystallinity. The fully integrated reservoir computing processor is realized by integrating the physical reservoir and readout synapse devices in three dimensions. The integrated processor demonstrates excellent temporal data processing capabilities.








Abstract
Memristors based on 2D materials (2DMs) have attracted considerable research interest due to their excellent switching performance. Former synthesis methods for 2DMs aimed to synthesize 2DMs with a large grain size. However, these methods cause a stochastic distribution of defects in high&#8208;density memristor arrays, resulting in device nonuniformity. Moreover, high synthesis temperatures and mechanical transfer make it difficult to implement large&#8208;area memristor arrays and additional integration. Therefore, synthesis methods of nanocrystalline 2DMs for memristors are essential. In this study, crystallinity&#8208;controlled hexagonal boron nitride is&#160;directly synthesized&#160;on metal electrodes, and a fully integrated memristor&#8208;based reservoir computing processor is implemented. Memristors using nanocrystalline hexagonal boron nitride (NC h&#8208;BN) exhibit volatile switching and reliable reservoir dynamics. Memristors using amorphous boron nitride (a&#8208;BN) exhibit nonvolatile switching and linear potentiation/depression curves (&#945;P = &#8722;0.475, &#945;D = 0.656). By integrating NC h&#8208;BN and a&#8208;BN memristors in three dimensions, an efficient reservoir computing processor with integrated reservoir and readout layers is realized. Overall, the neural network of the integrated processor shows high accuracy for inferring temporal data. Hence, the crystallinity&#8208;controlled hexagonal boron nitride synthesis method paves the way for the realization of fully integrated reservoir computing processors.

         <title>Operando Studies Redirect Spatiotemporal Restructuration of Model Coordinated Oxides in Electrochemical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a suite of advanced surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk operando characterizations and systematic computations are combined to successfully establish a link between oxygen&#8208;evolving performance and operational spatiotemporal behaviors on model&#8208;coordinated oxides during electrochemical oxidation. The underlying catalysis mechanism and activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off are further revealed and solved in electrode and device.








Abstract
Tetrahedral, pyramidal, and octahedral metal&#8208;oxygen coordinated ligands are fundamental components in all metal&#8208;oxide structures. Understanding the impacts of their spatiotemporal behaviors during electrochemical oxidation is crucial for diverse applications, yet remains unsolved due to challenges in designing model oxides and conducting operando characterizations. Herein, combining a suite of advanced operando characterizations and systematic computations, a link between oxygen&#8208;evolving performance and operational structural properties is established on model oxides. Compared with tetrahedral and octahedral structures, pyramidal structure is more susceptible to OH&#8722; attack due to its pristine unsaturated and asymmetric features and constant single&#8208;electron occupancy on the active z2 orbital during reaction, leading to surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk restructuration into active amorphous high&#8208;valence CoOOHx with edge&#8208;sharing configurations. This is accompanied by ion leaching to create nanoscale space, following a leaching tendency of Sr2+ &gt; Ba2+ &gt; La3+ &gt; Y3+. Operando soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrates a harder non&#8208;uniform dehydrogenation process over time (Co3+OOH &#8594; Co3+/4+OOHx &#8594; Co4+OO) because of the enhanced Co&#63743;O covalency with higher energy barriers. Lattice oxygen participates in active CoOOHx formation but sacrifices stability. To address this activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off, an ion&#8208;tuning strategy is proposed to simultaneously enhance both activity and stability in electrode and device.

         <title>Sonoactivated Z&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Enhanced Sonodynamic Mitophagy Inhibition and Triple Negative Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of a liquid Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction nanosonosensitizer&#8208;based sonodynamic mitophagy inhibition strategy for inducing enhanced sonodynamic therapy (SDT) efficacy synergistic with self&#8208;protective mitophagy inhibition against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer, offering a promising &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; tumor&#8208;killing paradigm.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a potent therapeutic modality to generate intratumoral toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in combating refractory triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, its therapeutic efficacy is compromised due to pro&#8208;survival cancer&#8208;cell mitophagy to mitigate mitochondrial oxidative damage. Here, an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; tumor&#8208;therapeutic strategy that integrates nanosonosensitizer&#8208;augmented noninvasive SDT with mitophagy inhibition is reported. This is achieved using a rationally constructed sonoactivated liquid Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction that connects sonosensitizer PtCu3 nanocages and mitophagy&#8208;blocking sonosensitizer BP nanosheets via an amphipathic organic linker (PEI&#8208;PEG5000&#8208;C18). The conjugated electron mediator (M, Cp*Rh(phen)Cl) is strategically positioned between the 2 sonosensitizers to facilitate electron transfer. This M&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme configuration prolongs the separation of sonoactivated electron&#8208;hole pairs, leading to efficient ROS generation upon ultrasound stimulation. Importantly, Cu2+ released from PtCu3 expedites BP degradation by reducing phosphorus vacancy formation energy, improving the overall biodegradability of BP&#8208;M&#8208;PtCu3 and favoring phosphate ions production. These ions elevate lysosomal pH, inhibiting the hydrolysis of damaged mitochondria within autophagic lysosomes, thus preventing cancer cell self&#8208;preservation under oxidative stress and effectively eliminating TNBC. It is believe that the M&#8208;based sonoactivated Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction will be a promising sonosensitizer structure, and the sonodynamic mitophagy inhibition strategy offers valuable prospects for cancer treatment.

         <title>Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite with Strong Light and Oxygen Stability for All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, thiomalic acid (TA) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution to suppress defects caused by light&#8208;induced iodide ion migration, thereby enhancing the photo&#8208;stability of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. The sulfhydryl group on TA can resist oxygen corrosion, which also imparts good air stability to the Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite. Ultimately, it is fabricated a two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell that achieved a power conversion efficiency of 28.6% with improved operational stability.








Abstract
Research on mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is gaining significant attention due to their potential for high efficiency in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, Sn2+ in Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite is susceptible to oxidation, leading to a high defect density. The oxidation primarily occurs through two pathways: one involving a reaction with oxygen, and the other related to iodine defects, which generate I2 and further accelerate the oxidation of Sn2&#8314;, greatly reducing stability. First, to tackle the photo&#8208;stability issues caused by iodine defects, amber acid (AA) is screened as the additive. The Carboxyl group on AA can strongly coordinate with Sn2+, reinforcing the Sn&#9472;I bond and electrostatically interacting with negatively charged defects. This interaction inhibits the photoinduced formation of I2 and the subsequent oxidation of Sn2+, thereby enhancing the stability of Sn&#9472;Pb PSCs under continuous illumination. Building on the foundation of AA, a reductive sulfhydryl group is introduced to synthesize thiomalic acid (TA).

     alt="Sn-Pb Perovskite with Strong Light and Oxygen Stability for All-Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, thiomalic acid (TA) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution to suppress defects caused by light-induced iodide ion migration, thereby enhancing the photo-stability of Sn-Pb perovskites. The sulfhydryl group on TA can resist oxygen corrosion, which also imparts good air stability to the Sn-Pb perovskite. Ultimately, it is fabricated a two-terminal all-perovskite tandem solar cell that achieved a power conversion efficiency of 28.6% with improved operational stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on mixed Sn-Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is gaining significant attention due to their potential for high efficiency in all-perovskite tandem solar cells. However, Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in Sn-Pb perovskite is susceptible to oxidation, leading to a high defect density. The oxidation primarily occurs through two pathways: one involving a reaction with oxygen, and the other related to iodine defects, which generate I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and further accelerate the oxidation of Sn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;, greatly reducing stability. First, to tackle the photo-stability issues caused by iodine defects, amber acid (AA) is screened as the additive. The Carboxyl group on AA can strongly coordinate with Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, reinforcing the Sn&#9472;I bond and electrostatically interacting with negatively charged defects. This interaction inhibits the photoinduced formation of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the subsequent oxidation of Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby enhancing the stability of Sn&#9472;Pb PSCs under continuous illumination. Building on the foundation of AA, a reductive sulfhydryl group is introduced to synthesize thiomalic acid (TA). It inhibits the formation of Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; in both the perovskite precursor and the perovskite film, thereby improving air stability while maintaining strong photostability. Consequently, single PSCs achieved a champion efficiency of 22.7%. The best-performing two-terminal all-perovskite tandem solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 28.6% with improved operational stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
