         <title>Advanced Polymeric Nanoparticles for Cancer Immunotherapy: Materials Engineering, Immunotherapeutic Mechanism and Clinical Translation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here recent advances in engineered polymeric nano&#8208;paradigms that are uniquely suited to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy while decreasing the immune response associated toxicity are discussed and highlighted. The viewpoint on this emerging field lying at the interface of polymeric chemistry/material science and cancer immunology for accelerating clinical translation is provided.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy, which leverages immune system components to treat malignancies, has emerged as a cornerstone of contemporary therapeutic strategies. Yet, critical concerns about the efficacy and safety of cancer immunotherapies remain formidable. Nanotechnology, especially polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs), offers unparalleled flexibility in manipulation&#8208;from the chemical composition and physical properties to the precision control of nanoassemblies. PNPs provide an optimal platform to amplify the potency and minimize systematic toxicity in a broad spectrum of immunotherapeutic modalities. In this comprehensive review, the basics of polymer chemistry, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art designs of PNPs from a physicochemical standpoint for cancer immunotherapy, encompassing therapeutic cancer vaccines, in situ vaccination, adoptive T&#8208;cell therapies, tumor&#8208;infiltrating immune cell&#8208;targeted therapies, therapeutic antibodies, and cytokine therapies are delineated. Each immunotherapy necessitates distinctively tailored design strategies in polymeric nanoplatforms. The extensive applications of PNPs, and investigation of their mechanisms of action for enhanced efficacy are particularly focused on. The safety profiles of PNPs and clinical research progress are discussed. Additionally, forthcoming developments and emergent trends of polymeric nano&#8208;immunotherapeutics poised to transform cancer treatment paradigms into clinics are explored.

         <title>Longitudinal and Noninvasive Intracellular Recordings of Spontaneous Electrophysiological Activity in Rat Primary Neurons on Planar MEA Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach is presented to noninvasively porate neurons on planar MEA electrodes and enable the recording of intracellular&#8208;like action potentials without interfering with the spontaneous activity of the network not affecting the neuronal health. In particular, it is shown that the method works on commercial MEA electrodes integrated on both high density and high&#8208;throughput MEAs.








Abstract
Presently, the in vitro recording of intracellular neuronal signals on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) requires complex 3D nanostructures or invasive and approaches such as electroporation. Here, it is shown that laser poration enables intracellular coupling on planar electrodes without damaging neurons or altering their spontaneous electrophysiological activity, allowing the process to be repeated multiple times on the same cells. This capability distinguishes laser&#8208;based neuron poration from more invasive methods like electroporation, which typically serve as endpoint measurement for cells. It is demonstrated that planar MEA electrodes, when combined with laser cell optoporation and live cell staining, can record spontaneous intracellular signaling from primary neurons in vitro. This approach allows for the detection of attenuated signals resembling positive monophasic intracellular action potentials. Recordings after laser optoporation also reveal subthreshold signals such as post&#8208;synaptic potentials that are essential for assessing neuronal network plasticity and connectivity. Moreover, the noninvasiveness of the process enables repeated intracellular recordings over multiple days from the same cells.

         <title>Bioinspired Smart Triboelectric Soft Pneumatic Actuator&#8208;Enabled Hand Rehabilitation Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative, lobster tail&#8208;inspired triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator (TENG&#8208;SPA) is introduced, featuring self&#8208;powered sensing capabilities. Leveraging these features, a smart TENG&#8208;SPA&#8208;enabled hand rehabilitation robot is developed, showing great promise in replacing the traditional assessment method&#8212;which relies on clinicians for manual stretching, subjective resistance evaluation, and experience&#8208;based scoring&#8212;thereby driving the transformation from traditional rehabilitation medicine to modern digital rehabilitation medicine.









Abstract
Quantitative assessment for post&#8208;stroke spasticity remains a significant challenge due to the encountered variable resistance during passive stretching, which can lead to the widely used modified Ashworth scale (MAS) for spasticity assessment depending heavily on rehabilitation physicians. To address these challenges, a high&#8208;force&#8208;output triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator&#160;(TENG&#8208;SPA) inspired by a lobster tail is developed. The bioinspired TENG&#8208;SPA can generate approximately 20 N at 0.1&#160;MPa, providing sufficient stretching force for spastic fingers. The anti&#8208;interference, durability, and electrical output characteristics of the TENG&#8208;SPA under varying conditions&#8212;such as different air pressures, bending frequencies, and simulated spastic finger stretching&#8212;are explored, demonstrating TENG&#8208;SPA's ability to sense resistance during the stretching process. Furthermore, a TENG&#8208;SPA&#8208;enabled hand rehabilitation robot system integrated with the convolutional neural network (CNN) is further developed, which is tested in a clinical trial involving 15 stroke patients. The results have demonstrated that a classification accuracy for the levels of finger spasticity reaches 93.3% and the MAS scores predicted by the CNN regression model exhibit a strong linear relationship with the actual MAS (R2 = 0.8451, p &lt;&#160;0.01). This study presents promising potential applications in digital rehabilitation medicine, human&#8211;machine interaction, biomedicine, and related fields.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Nanoscintillators for X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Photodynamic Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators (BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG) is designed and engineered to enhance X&#8208;PDT for unresectable HCC treatment. Precise tumor localization capability of SRT and effective X&#8208;ray energy absorbing and transferring capability of BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG endowing BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG&#8208;mediated X&#8208;PDT approach with significant HCC therapeutic potential. Therefore, phosphorescent HOF&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT is an ideal alternative therapy for patients with unresectable HCC.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray induced photodynamic therapy (X&#8208;PDT) leverages penetrating X&#8208;ray to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for treating deep&#8208;seated tumors. However, conventional X&#8208;PDT typically relies on heavy metal inorganic scintillators and organic photosensitizers to produce 1O2, which presents challenges related to toxicity and energy conversion efficiency. In this study, highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent nanoscintillators based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) are designed and engineered, termed BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG, to enhance X&#8208;PDT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG functions simultaneously as both scintillator and photosensitizer, effectively absorbing and transferring X&#8208;ray energy to generate abundant 1O2. Both in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that internalized BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG efficiently produces significant quantities of 1O2 upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. Additionally, X&#8208;ray exposure directly inflicts DNA damage, and the synergistic effects of these mechanisms result in pronounced cell death and substantial tumor growth inhibition, with a significant inhibition rate of up to 90.4% in vivo assessments. RNA sequencing analyses reveal that X&#8208;PDT induces apoptosis in Hepa1&#8208;6 cells while inhibiting cell proliferation, culminating in tumor cell death. Therefore, this work highlights the considerable potential of efficient phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT as a promising therapeutic approach for HCC, providing a highly effective alternative with negligible toxicity for patients with unresectable tumors.

         <title>Additives&#8208;Modified Electrodeposition for Synthesis of Hydrophobic Cu/Cu2O with Ag Single Atoms to Drive CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag single atoms deposited hydrophobic Cu/Cu2O heterostructure (AgSA&#8208;Cu/Cu2O) is designed and synthesized via modified one&#8208;step electrodeposition. In situ Raman spectra and DFT calculations reveal that Ag single atoms delay the reduction of Cu2O and promote the electron transfer. AgSA&#8208;Cu/Cu2O helps promoting *CO to *COH, exhibiting a FEC2+ of 86.1% and 90.2% for CO2 electroreduction in H&#8208;type cell and flow cell, respectively.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;based electrocatalysts are recognized as crucial catalysts for CO2 electroreduction into multi&#8208;carbon products. However, achieving copper&#8208;based electrocatalysts with adjustable valences via one&#8208;step facile synthesis remains a challenge. In this study, Cu/Cu2O heterostructure is constructed by adjusting the anion species of the Cu ions&#8208;containing electrolyte during electrodeposition synthesis. Then, Cu/Cu2O with tuned nanoarchitectures ranging from dendrites to polyhedrons is achieved by introducing transition metal ions as additives, leading to an adjustable interfacial microenvironment for CO2/H2O adsorption on the Cu/Cu2O electrodes. Additionally, the polyhedral Cu/Cu2O catalysts are used as templates for depositing Ag single atoms (AgSA), which are known as synergistic active sites for promoting *CO to *COH toward C2+ products. The prepared AgSA&#8208;Cu/Cu2O catalyst is evaluated in a flow cell and exhibited a FEC2+ of 90.2% and a partial current density (jc2+) of 426.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for CO2 electroreduction. As revealed by in situ Raman spectra and density functional theory calculations, the introduction of Ag single atoms slows down the reduction of Cu+ during CO2 electroreduction, especially at a high current density. This work provides a promising paradigm for diverse control of the compositions and hydrophobicity of Cu&#8208;based catalysts for selective CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products.

The crystallization mechanism of the biomimetic calcification method triggers a secondary conformational transition of proteins from &#945;&#8208;helix to &#946;&#8208;sheet in solvents. The adoption of the &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation enhances the affinity for metal ions, thereby intensifying the competitive interaction with organic ligands and expediting crystal formation and encapsulation.








Abstract

In this study, it is presented that a protein&#8208;assisted biomimetic calcification method for the in situ synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials. A series of unique core&#8208;shell structures are created by utilizing proteins as templates and guiding agents in the nucleation step, creating ideal conditions for shell growth. To further understand the influence of the protein and organic ligand on the morphology of the MOF shell, the competing mechanism toward metal ions is supposed. Through systematic experiments and analyses, a strategy to construct unique precursor structures by controlling calcification nucleation is proposed. After carbonization, protein&#8208;containing precursors exhibit exceptional porous characteristics, stability, and high nitrogen content. These attributes make them promising materials as sulfur hosts in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSB). Electrochemical tests confirm that biomimetic calcification&#8208;assisted 3D carbonaceous structure can effectively immobilize dissolved polysulfides, demonstrating strong adsorption and catalytic capabilities. This discovery not only opens up new avenues for employing biomimetic calcification as a sustainable method for batteries but also enlightens the fields of materials science, catalytic chemistry, and energy storage.

         <title>Electrically Switchable Multi&#8208;Stable Topological States Enabled by Surface&#8208;Induced Frustration in Nematic Liquid Crystal Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a liquid crystal (LC) cell with well&#8208;designed surface anchoring patterns, electrical switching between multi&#8208;stable states with distinct optical properties is obtained. Dual&#8208;frequency LC with frequency dependent dielectric properties is used to realize repeatable switching between different topological states with and without disclination lines. Metastability without the need for an applied voltage is demonstrated.








Abstract
In liquid crystal (LC) cells, the surface patterning directs the self&#8208;assembly of the uniaxial building blocks in the bulk, enabling the design of stimuli&#8208;response optical devices with various functionalities. The combination of different anchoring patterns at both substrates can lead to surface induced frustration, preventing a purely planar and defect&#8208;free configuration. In cells with crossed assembly of rotating anchoring patterns, elastic deformations allow to obtain a defect&#8208;free bulk configuration, but an electrical stimulus can induce disclination lines. The disclination network is preserved without applied voltage. Depending on the electric field treatment and geometrical parameters, different multi&#8208;stable states with and without disclinations are obtained. This is demonstrated with the help of dual&#8208;frequency LCs, for which the frequency dependent dielectric properties allow repeatable switching between multi&#8208;stable states. Topological protection and the associated energy barrier between different states explains the observed metastability. The obtained configurations are retrieved with Q&#8208;tensor simulations and the validity is confirmed by matching optical simulations with experimentally obtained microscopy images. The realized multi&#8208;stable topological states interact differently with light, resulting in distinct optical properties. Optimization allows to switch between a highly transparent state and an opaque state, opening up opportunities for smart windows with low energy consumption.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained Biophotocatalytic Nano&#8208;Organelle Reactors with Programmable DNA Switches for Combating Tumor Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the challenges of limited light penetration and insufficient oxygen supply in PDT for metastatic tumor treatment, a self&#8208;contained organelle&#8208;mimicking nanoreactor is engineered with DNA switches using cell&#8208;inspired compartmentalization technology. It utilizes endogenous glucose as a biofuel, luminol as a light source, and hemoglobin as an oxygen supplier to achieve self&#8208;illuminating chemiexcited PDT via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer.








Abstract
Metastasis, the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients, presents challenges for conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to its reliance on localized light and oxygen application to tumors. To overcome these limitations, a self&#8208;sustained organelle&#8208;mimicking nanoreactor is developed here with programmable DNA switches that enables bio&#8208;chem&#8208;photocatalytic cascade&#8208;driven starvation&#8208;photodynamic synergistic therapy against tumor metastasis. Emulating the compartmentalization and positional assembly strategies found in living cells, this nano&#8208;organelle reactor allows quantitative co&#8208;compartmentalization of multiple functional modules for the designed self&#8208;illuminating chemiexcited PDT system. Within the space&#8208;confined nanoreactor, biofuel glucose is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which enhances luminol&#8208;based chemiluminescence (CL), consequently driving the generation of photochemical singlet oxygen (1O2) via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer. Meanwhile, hemoglobin functions as a synchronized oxygen supplier for both glucose oxidation and PDT, while also exhibiting peroxidase&#8208;like activity to produce hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Crucially, the nanoreactor keeps switching off in normal tissues, with on&#8208;demand activation in tumors through toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement. These findings demonstrate that this nanoreactor, which is self&#8208;sufficient in light and oxygen and precise in striking tumors, presents a promising paradigm for managing highly metastatic cancers.

         <title>Polyproline&#8208;Polyornithine Diblock Copolymers with Inherent Mitochondria Tropism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis and characterization of polypeptide&#8208;based diblock copolymers with inherent mitochondria&#8208;targeting properties. Utilizing a scalable 2&#8208;step polymerization method, these polymers exhibit energy&#8208;independent cellular uptake and cardiolipin&#8208;specific mitochondrial targeting. Their anti&#8208;tumorigenic activity, biocompatibility, and selective mitochondrial accumulation underscore their potential as versatile platforms for targeted subcellular drug delivery and precision mitochondrial nanomedicine applications.









Abstract
Mitochondria play critical roles in regulating cell fate, with dysfunction correlating with the development of multiple diseases, emphasizing the need for engineered nanomedicines that cross biological barriers. Said nanomedicines often target fluctuating mitochondrial properties and/or present inefficient/insufficient cytosolic delivery (resulting in poor overall activity), while many require complex synthetic procedures involving targeting residues (hindering clinical translation). The synthesis/characterization of polypeptide&#8208;based cell penetrating diblock copolymers of poly&#8208;L&#8208;ornithine (PLO) and polyproline (PLP) (PLOn&#8208;PLPm, n:m ratio 1:3) are described as mitochondria&#8208;targeting nanocarriers. Synthesis involves a simple two&#8208;step methodology based on N&#8208;carboxyanhydride ring&#8208;opening polymerization, with the scale&#8208;up optimization using a &#8220;design of experiments&#8221; approach. The molecular mechanisms behind targetability and therapeutic activity are investigated through physical/biological processes for diblock copolymers themselves or as targeting moieties in a poly&#8208;L&#8208;glutamic (PGA)&#8208;based conjugate. Diblock copolymers prompt rapid cell entry via energy&#8208;independent mechanisms and recognize mitochondria through the mitochondria&#8208;specific phospholipid cardiolipin (CL). Stimuli&#8208;driven conditions and mitochondria polarization dynamics, which decrease efficacy depending on disease type/stage, do not compromise diblock copolymer uptake/targetability. Diblock copolymers exhibit inherent concentration&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;tumorigenic activity at the mitochondrial level. The diblock copolymer conjugate possesses improved safety, significant cell penetration, and mitochondrial accumulation via cardiolipin recognition. These findings may support the development of efficient and safe mitochondrial&#8208;targeting nanomedicines.

The synthesis/characterization of polypeptide-based cell penetrating diblock copolymers of poly-L-ornithine (PLO) and polyproline (PLP) (PLO&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-PLP&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, n:m ratio 1:3) are described as mitochondria-targeting nanocarriers. Synthesis involves a simple two-step methodology based on N-carboxyanhydride ring-opening polymerization, with the scale-up optimization using a &#8220;design of experiments&#8221; approach. The molecular mechanisms behind targetability and therapeutic activity are investigated through physical/biological processes for diblock copolymers themselves or as targeting moieties in a poly-L-glutamic (PGA)-based conjugate. Diblock copolymers prompt rapid cell entry via energy-independent mechanisms and recognize mitochondria through the mitochondria-specific phospholipid cardiolipin (CL). Stimuli-driven conditions and mitochondria polarization dynamics, which decrease efficacy depending on disease type/stage, do not compromise diblock copolymer uptake/targetability. Diblock copolymers exhibit inherent concentration-dependent anti-tumorigenic activity at the mitochondrial level. The diblock copolymer conjugate possesses improved safety, significant cell penetration, and mitochondrial accumulation via cardiolipin recognition. These findings may support the development of efficient and safe mitochondrial-targeting nanomedicines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Distinct Transmission of Left&#8208; and Right&#8208;Handed Magnon Modes in Compensated Ferrimagnet/Antiferromagnet Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed magnons, thermally generated in a compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, propagate efficiently through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Within NiO, these magnons undergo distinct decay processes, unveiling a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission induced by interfacial spin&#8208;flop coupling. These findings provide new insights for advancing chirality&#8208;based magnonics.








Abstract
The chirality of magnons, exhibiting left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed polarizations analogous to the counterparts of spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down, has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing. However, the potential of this paradigm is constrained by the controllable excitation and transmission of chiral magnons. Here, the magnon transmission is explored in the Gd3Fe5O12/NiO/Pt structures. It is demonstrated that both left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed magnon modes, thermally generated in the compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, can efficiently propagate through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Remarkably, these modes undergo distinct decay processes in NiO, manifested by different evolutions of the spin diffusion length with temperature. This behavior can be explained by an exchange model rooted in the spin&#8208;flop magnetic configuration between Gd3Fe5O12 and NiO, which establishes a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission. These findings offer significant fundamental insight into controlling chiral magnons, opening avenues for chirality&#8208;based magnonics.

         <title>Multiscale Understanding of Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells: Mechanisms, Electrocatalysts, Polymers, and Cell Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are a promising sustainable electrochemical technology with potential applications in aircraft, submarines, vehicles, etc. This review aims to provide an overview of recent advances in AEMFCs by examining four key aspects: reaction mechanisms, electrochemical catalysts, anion exchange polymers, and fuel cell management, covering from microscale to macroscale.








Abstract
Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are among the most promising sustainable electrochemical technologies to help solve energy challenges. Compared to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), AEMFCs offer a broader choice of catalyst materials and a less corrosive operating environment for the bipolar plates and the membrane. This can lead to potentially lower costs and longer operational life than PEMFCs. These significant advantages have made AEMFCs highly competitive in the future fuel cell market, particularly after advancements in developing non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal anode electrocatalysts, anion exchange membranes and ionomers, and in understanding the relationships between cell operating conditions and mass transport in AEMFCs. This review aims to compile recent literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of AEMFCs in three key areas: i) the mechanisms of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media; ii) recent advancements in the synthesis routes and structure&#8208;property relationships of cutting&#8208;edge HOR and ORR electrocatalysts, as well as anion exchange membranes and ionomers; and iii) fuel cell operating conditions, including water management and impact of CO2. Finally, based on these aspects, the future development and perspectives of AEMFCs are proposed.

         <title>A Wenzel Interfaces Design for Homogeneous Solute Distribution Obtains Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Wenzel model is successfully constructed at the interface to achieve a super&#8208;hydrophilic substrate, greatly alleviating the coffee&#8208;ring effect during the large&#8208;area perovskite film printing process. The highly hydrophilic nature of the interface, along with its unique microstructure, greatly facilitates the efficient and rapid deposition of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process.








Abstract
The coffee&#8208;ring effect, caused by uneven deposition of colloidal particles in perovskite precursor solutions, leads to poor uniformity in perovskite films prepared through large&#8208;area printing. In this work, the surface of SnO2 is roughened to construct a Wenzel model, successfully achieving a super&#8208;hydrophilic interface. This modification significantly accelerates the spreading of the perovskite precursor solution, reducing the response delay time of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process. Additionally, the micro&#8208;spherical depression structure on the SnO2 surface effectively inhibits the migration of colloidal particles toward the edges of liquid film, trapping perovskite colloidal particles at the buried interfaces and improving film uniformity. Due to the synergistic effect of super&#8208;hydrophilicity and micro&#8208;rough structure on the surface of SnO2, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of perovskite crystals. Therefore, the efficiency of printing prepared flexible devices (0.101 cm2) reached 25.42% (certified 25.12%). Moreover, the efficiency of rigid and flexible large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs) based on meniscus&#8208;coating manufacture reached 21.34% and 16.99% (100 cm2), respectively, and demonstrated superior environmental stability by maintaining an initial efficiency of 91% after being stored in atmospheric conditions for 2000 h, offering practical guidance for fabricating high&#8208;performance and stable large&#8208;scale perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

         <title>The Role of Long&#8208;Range Interactions Between High&#8208;Entropy Single&#8208;Atoms in Catalyzing Sulfur Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the mechanism of high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom catalysts (HESAC), this study reveals how long&#8208;range interactions and entropy govern electron states, enhancing electrocatalysis for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with a superior rate capacity of 3.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 10 C.








Abstract
Sulfur conversion reactions are the foundation of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries but usually possess sluggish kinetics during practical battery operation. Herein, a high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom&#160;catalyst (HESAC) is synthesized for this process. In contrast to conventional dual&#8208;atom catalysts that form metal&#8211;metal bonds, the center metal atoms in HESAC are not bonded but exhibit long&#8208;range interactions at a sub&#8208;nanometer distance (&lt;9 &#197;). The synergistic effect between the long&#8208;range interactions and entropy changes enables the regulation of d&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;electron states. This alteration in the electronic structure improves the adsorption and electronic conductivity of intermediate polysulfides, thereby accelerating their conversion kinetics. Consequently, this leads to a significant enhancement in specific capacities by &#8776;40% at high rates compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts. The resulting lithium&#8211;sulfur battery with HESAC demonstrates a remarkable areal capacity of 3.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 10 C. These findings provide valuable insights into the design principle of metal atom catalysts for electrochemical reactions.

New carbon&#8208;based materials (CMs) are recommended as attractively active materials due to their diverse nanostructures and unique electron transport pathways, demonstrating great potential for highly efficient energy storage applications, electrocatalysis, and beyond. Among these newly reported CMs, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived CMs have achieved impressive development momentum based on their high specific surface areas, tunable porosity, and flexible structural&#8208;functional integration. However, obstacles regarding the integrity of porous structures, the complexity of preparation processes, and the precise control of active components hinder the regulation of precise interface engineering in CMs. In this context, this review systematically summarizes the latest advances in tailored types, processing strategies, and energy&#8208;related applications of MOF&#8208;derived CMs and focuses on the structure&#8208;activity relationship of metal&#8208;free carbon, metal&#8208;doped carbon, and metallide&#8208;doped carbon. Particularly, the intrinsic correlation and evolutionary behavior between the synergistic interaction of micro/nanostructures and active species with electrochemical performances are emphasized. Finally, unique insights and perspectives on the latest relevant research are presented, and the future development prospects and challenges of MOF&#8208;derived CMs are discussed, providing valuable guidance to boost high&#8208;performance electrochemical electrodes for a broader range of application fields.

         <title>Valence Electron: A Descriptor of Spinel Sulfides for Sulfur Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The valence electron model, serving as an efficient descriptor, reveals the catalytic activity of spinel sulfides by elucidating the opposing roles of metal&#8211;sulfur covalent bonding and lattice sulfur&#8211;lithium ionic bonding. This insight enables the rational design of the highly efficient (FeCo)3(PS)4 catalyst, significantly enhancing lithium&#8211;sulfur battery performance.








Abstract
Catalysts are essential for achieving high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The precise design and regulation of catalytic sites to strengthen their efficiency and robustness remains challenging. In this study, spinel sulfides and catalyst design principles through element doping are investigated. This research highlights the distinct role of lattice sulfur sites in lithium polysulfide conversion and emphasizes the differences in catalytic activity between metal and anion sites. The valence electron model as a descriptor can characterize catalytic performance, guiding the design of a (FeCo)3(PS)4 catalyst co&#8208;doped with cation and anion. The (FeCo)3(PS)4 exhibits the highest catalytic performance among spinel catalysts to data, particularly under high sulfur loading conditions. It achieves an initial specific capacity of 1205.9 mAh g&#8722;1 (6.1 mAh cm&#8722;2) at a sulfur loading of 5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and 1192.7 mAh g&#8722;1 (11.9 mAh cm&#8722;2) at 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, demonstrating excellent electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Prussian Blue Analogues &#8220;Dressed&#8221; in MXene Nanosheets Tightly for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By intelligent adjusting the dimensions of the MXene nanosheets, the Co&#8208;PBA@MXene heterostructures are successfully prepared with core&#8212;shell&#8208;like structures, which are different from the common sandwich&#8208;like structures and exhibited enhanced electrochemical performance in LIBs. This study will promotes the development of the synthesis of MXene&#8208;based hybrids, which have broad application prospects.









Abstract
MXenes, have been considered as a new generation anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries for lower lithium&#8208;ion diffusion barriers and superior conductivity. Unfortunately, their structures are prone to aggregation and stacking, hindering further shuttle of lithium ions and electrons, resulting in lower discharge capacity. Therefore, the introduction of interlayer spacers for the preparation of MXene&#8208;based hybrids has attracted much attention. Introducing Prubssian blue analogues (PBAs) as a new interlayer spacer to combine with MXene nanosheets can not only preserve the high conductivity of MXene and inhibit the volume expansion and structural degradation of the PBA component, but also inherit the characteristics of large specific surface area and high porosity of PBAs. By intelligent regulating the size of MXene sheets, Co&#8208;PBA@MXene hybrids with common sandwich&#8208;like structures and superior core&#8208;shell&#8208;like structures have been successfully obtained. Furthermore, Co@M(x:y) hybrids are prepared by intelligently adjusting the shell thickness of MXene through intelligently controlling of the mass ratio between Co&#8208;PBA and MXene. Among them, the Co@M(5:2) anode exhibits an excellent capacity (603&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles) and superior long&#8208;term cycling stability due to the protective and conductive properties provided by the MXene shell and multi&#8208;redox pairs and rich porosity from Co&#8208;PBA core.

         <title>PO43&#8722; Tetrahedron Assisted Chelate Engineering for 10.67%&#8208;Efficient Antimony Selenosulfide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[hk0] orientation and complex deep&#8208;level defects of Sb2(S,Se)3 film limit carrier transport in solar cells. In this work, tetrahedral ions are innovatively employed to regulate the reaction kinetics and optimize the growth orientation and defects. Thus, the tetrahedral PO43&#8208; can induce desirable [hk1] orientation and defect passivation, which delivers a 10.67% efficiency.








Abstract
Anisotropic carrier transport and deep&#8208;level defect of antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) absorber are two vital auses restraining the photovoltaic performance of this emerging thin&#8208;film solar cell. Herein, chelate engineering is proposed to prepare high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 film based on hydrothermal deposition approach, which realizes desirable carrier transport and passivated defects by using tetrahedral PO43&#8722; ion in dibasic sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4, DSP). The PO43&#8722; Lewis structure, on one hand in the form of [(SbO)3(PO4)] chelate, can adsorb on the polar planes of cadmium sulfide (CdS) layer, promoting the heterogeneous nucleation, and on the other hand, the tetrahedral PO43&#8722; inhibits horizontal growth of (Sb4S(e)6)n ribbons due to size effects, thus achieving desirable [hk1] orientation. Moreover, the introduction PO43&#8722; effectively passivates the antisite defect SbS1. These synergistic effects have effectively improved carrier transport and reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination of the Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber. Consequently, the DSP&#8208;modified Sb2(S,Se)3 device efficiency increases from 8.59% to 10.67%.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Antiskyrmions in Canted Ferrimagnetic CoHo Alloy Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature antiskyrmions are observed in CoHo alloy films with various thicknesses using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Rotating magnetic fields (H) are used to enhance their areal density by an order of magnitude compared to that under individual vertical H. The accurately balancing between dipolar interactions and magnetic anisotropy is experimentally and theoretically confirmed to facilitate antiskyrmion nucleation.








Abstract
Magnetic antiskyrmions, the anti&#8208;quasiparticles of magnetic skyrmions, possess alternating Bloch&#8208; and N&#233;el&#8208;type spin spirals, rendering them promising for advanced spintronics&#8208;based information storage. To date, antiskyrmions are demonstrated in a few bulk materials featuring anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions and a limited number of artificial multilayers. Identifying novel film materials capable of hosting isolated antiskyrmions is critical for memory applications in topological spintronics. Herein, the formation of room&#8208;temperature antiskyrmions in single ferrimagnetic CoHo rare&#8208;metal alloy films of varying thicknesses, observed using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy is reported. Furthermore, rotating magnetic fields (H) are proposed to facilitate antiskyrmion nucleation and enhance their areal density by an order of magnitude compared to that in the same area under individual vertical H. In addition, experimental and phenomenological analysis confirm that antiskyrmion nucleation can be attributed to spin reorientation involving spontaneous canted magnetism, as evidenced by polarized neutron reflectometry. Micromagnetic simulations further show that the antiskyrmion density significantly depends on the magnitude of the rotating field. These findings expand the family of known antiskyrmion&#8208;hosting materials and provide insights into their formation mechanisms, thus serving as a basis for their application in topological spintronics.

Furthermore, rotating magnetic fields (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;) are proposed to facilitate antiskyrmion nucleation and enhance their areal density by an order of magnitude compared to that in the same area under individual vertical &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, experimental and phenomenological analysis confirm that antiskyrmion nucleation can be attributed to spin reorientation involving spontaneous canted magnetism, as evidenced by polarized neutron reflectometry. Micromagnetic simulations further show that the antiskyrmion density significantly depends on the magnitude of the rotating field. These findings expand the family of known antiskyrmion-hosting materials and provide insights into their formation mechanisms, thus serving as a basis for their application in topological spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Predicting the Mechanical Properties of Supramolecular Gels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prediction of gelation is an important target, yet current models do not predict any post&#8208;gel properties. Critically, it is the properties of the gels that are important for a specific application. Supramolecular gels are often kinetically trapped, meaning that predicting gel properties is inherently a difficult challenge. Here, the first successful a priori prediction of gel properties for such self&#8208;assembled, supramolecular systems is reported.








Abstract
The prediction of gelation is an important target, yet current models do not predict any post&#8208;gel properties. Gels can be formed through the self&#8208;assembly of many molecules, but close analogs often do not form gels. There has been success using a number of computational approaches to understand and predict gelation from molecular structures. However, these approaches focus on whether or not a gel will form, not on the properties of the resulting gels. Critically, it is the properties of the gels that are important for a specific application, not simply whether a gel will be formed. Supramolecular gels are often kinetically trapped, meaning that predicting gel properties is inherently a difficult challenge. Here, the first successful a priori prediction of gel properties for such self&#8208;assembled, supramolecular systems is reported.

         <title>Imine&#8208;Linked 3D Covalent Organic Framework Membrane Featuring Highly Charged Sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Channels for Exceptional Lithium&#8208;Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ growth of a consecutive, intact imine&#8208;linked three&#8208;dimensional&#160;covalent organic framework (3D&#8208;COF) layer on the polymeric membrane enables efficient lithium&#8208;ion extraction, wherein highly&#8208;charged sub&#8208;1 nm channels employing size exclusion effect and ion affinity differences ensure high Li+/Mg2+ selectivity and fast Li+ flux.








Abstract
Coupling ion exclusion and interaction screening within sub&#8208;nanoconfinement channels in novel porous material membranes hold great potential to realize highly efficient ion sieving, particularly for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion extraction. Diverse kinds of advanced membranes have been previously reported to realize this goal but with moderate performance and complex operations gained. Herein, these issues are circumvented by preparing the consecutive and intact imine&#8208;linked three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework&#160;(i.e., COF&#8208;300) membranes via a simple solvothermal approach and employing the intrinsically interconnected sub&#8208;1&#160;nm one&#8208;dimensional channels for exceptional lithium&#8208;ion sieving. The synthesized membranes with highly charged angstrom scale channels of &#8776;0.78&#160;nm achieve an excellent Li+ permeance (0.123&#160;mol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) with an ultrahigh Li+/Mg2+ of 36 in the binary system. The experimental measurement and theoretical calculation reveal that a channel size right exactly between Li+ and Mg2+ enables restricted Mg2+ penetration. Meanwhile, the ion affinity interaction screening with imine groups further strengthens the fast Li+ permeability but severely suppresses the Mg2+ passage. In particular, the synthesized three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framwork membranes also have a remarkable separation performance during a long&#8208;term operation test without sacrificing trade&#8208;off, demonstrating chemistry stability and mechanical integrity under the high&#8208;salinity aqueous environment.

         <title>A Multiresonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Dendrimer with Intramolecular Energy Transfer: Application for Efficient Host&#8208;Free Green Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;emitting Diodes</title>

An&#160;MR&#8208;TADF dendrimer, 2GtBuCzCO2HDCzB, features an encapsulated MR&#8208;TADF core surrounded by a donor&#8208;acceptor TADF moiety containing donor dendrons. The non&#8208;doped SP&#8208;OLEDs with 2GtBuCzCO2HDCzB exhibit narrowband green emission peaking at 495&#160;nm (FWHM of 30&#160;nm) and show an EQEmax at 24.0% and small efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQE1000 of 20.2%.








Abstract
The development of narrowband emissive, bright, and stable solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SP&#8208;OLEDs) remains a challenge. Here, a strategy is presented that merges within a single emitter a TADF sensitizer responsible for exciton harvesting and an MR&#8208;TADF motif that provides bright and narrowband emission. This emitter design also shows strong resistance to aggregate formation and aggregation&#8208;cause quenching. It is based on a known MR&#8208;TADF emitter DtBuCzB with a donor&#8208;acceptor TADF moiety consisting of either tert&#8208;butylcarbazole donors (tBuCzCO2HDCzB) or second&#8208;generation carbazole&#8208;based donor dendrons (2GtBuCzCO2HDCzB) and a benzoate acceptor. The TADF moiety acts as an exciton harvesting antenna and transfers these excitons via F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer to the MR&#8208;TADF emissive core. The SP&#8208;OLEDs with 2GtBuCzCO2HDCzB and tBuCzCO2HDCzB thus show very high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax of 27.9 and 22.0%) and minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off out to 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Optical Activity of Chiral Excitons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective mass model of excitons in chiral semiconductors is presented, accounting for parity mixing resulting from polar distortions, resulting in allowed magnetic dipole transitions. In a prototypical chiral 2D hybrid perovskite semiconductor, circular dichroism is shown to emerge via cross&#8208;coupling of Rashba&#8208;like and chiral/helical spin&#8208;texture components, while in perovskite nanocrystals, chiroptical properties are not contingent on chiral lattice distortions.









Abstract
Recent activity in the area of chiroptical phenomena has been focused on the connection between structural asymmetry, electron spin configuration and light/matter interactions in chiral semiconductors. In these systems, spin&#8208;splitting phenomena emerge due to inversion symmetry breaking and the presence of extended electronic states, yet the connection to chiroptical phenomena is lacking. Here, we develop an analytical effective mass model of chiral excitons, parameterized by density functional theory. The model accounts for parity mixing of the band edge Bloch functions resulting from polar distortions, resulting in allowed magnetic dipole transitions. Through the study of a prototypical chiral 2D hybrid perovskite semiconductor, we show that circular dichroism of the chiral exciton and its interband continuum emerges from spin&#8208;splitting via cross&#8208;coupling of Rashba&#8208;like and chiral/helical spin&#8208;texture components. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, and as a counterpoint, we apply our model to describe chiroptical properties of three&#8208;dimensionally confined excitons in perovskite nanocrystals that occur without chiral lattice distortions.

         <title>Biopolymer&#8208;Based Flame Retardants and Flame&#8208;Retardant Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advancements in producing sustainable flame&#8208;retardant materials using biopolymers as additive agents, functional coatings, and structural matrices. The focus is on advanced applications for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, thermal insulation, and fire warning devices. Most of these applications utilize biopolymers derived from non&#8208;food sources such as cellulose, lignin, chitosan, and alginates obtained from plants and marine organisms.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;This review presents recent advancements in producing sustainable flame-retardant materials using biopolymers as additive agents, functional coatings, and structural matrices. The focus is on advanced applications for lithium-ion batteries, thermal insulation, and fire warning devices. Most of these applications utilize biopolymers derived from non-food sources such as cellulose, lignin, chitosan, and alginates obtained from plants and marine organisms.

         <title>Interfacial Water Regulation for Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia at Ultralow Overpotentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydroxide regulation strategy is proposed for optimizing the interfacial H2O behavior for accelerating the hydrogenation conversion of nitrate to ammonia at ultralow overpotentials. The well&#8208;designed Ru&#9472;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst exhibits a remarkable energy efficiency of 44.6% at +0.1 V vs. RHE and a nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for NH3 synthesis at 0 V vs. RHE, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;art NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Nitrate electroreduction is promising for achieving effluent waste&#8208;water treatment and ammonia production with respect to the global nitrogen balance. However, due to the impeded hydrogenation process, high overpotentials need to be surmounted during nitrate electroreduction, causing intensive energy consumption. Herein, a hydroxide regulation strategy is developed to optimize the interfacial H2O behavior for accelerating the hydrogenation conversion of nitrate to ammonia at ultralow overpotentials. The well&#8208;designed Ru&#9472;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst shows a remarkable energy efficiency of 44.6% at +0.1&#160;V versus RHE and a nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for NH3 synthesis at 0&#160;V versus RHE. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that Ni(OH)2 can regulate the interfacial H2O structure with a promoted H2O dissociation process and contribute to the spontaneous hydrogen spillover process for boosting NO3&#8722; electroreduction to NH3 at Ru sites. Furthermore, the assembled rechargeable Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722;/ethanol battery system exhibits an outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability during the charge&#8211;discharge tests with the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added ammonium acetate, showing great potential for simultaneously achieving nitrate removal, energy conversion, and chemical synthesis. This work can not only provide a guidance for interfacial H2O regulation in extensive hydrogenation reactions but also inspire the design of a novel hybrid flow battery with multiple functions.

         <title>Programmable Magnetic Hysteresis in Orthogonally&#8208;Twisted 2D CrSBr Magnets via Stacking Engineering.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisting and stacking are key for engineering twisted 2D magnets, as shown here by stacking pristine monolayers and bilayers of CrSBr with a twist&#8208;angle of 90&#176;. By creating symmetric (monolayer/monolayer and bilayer/bilayer) and asymmetric (monolayer/bilayer) twisted heterostructures, the switch between volatile and non&#8208;volatile magnetic memory at zero&#8208;field and the appearance of abrupt magnetic reversal processes and hysteresis&#160;are controlled on demand.









Abstract
Twisting 2D van der Waals magnets allows the formation and control of different spin&#8208;textures, as skyrmions or magnetic domains. Beyond the rotation angle, different spin reversal processes can be engineered by increasing the number of magnetic layers forming the twisted van der Waals heterostructure. Here, pristine monolayers and bilayers of the A&#8208;type antiferromagnet CrSBr are considered as building blocks. By rotating 90 degrees these units, symmetric (monolayer/monolayer and bilayer/bilayer) and asymmetric (monolayer/bilayer) heterostructures are fabricated. The magneto&#8208;transport properties reveal the appearance of magnetic hysteresis, which is highly dependent upon the magnitude and direction of the applied magnetic field and is determined not only by the twist&#8208;angle but also by the number of layers forming the stack. This high tunability allows switching between volatile and non&#8208;volatile magnetic memory at zero&#8208;field and controlling the appearance of abrupt magnetic reversal processes at either negative or positive field values on demand. The phenomenology is rationalized based on the different spin&#8208;switching processes occurring in the layers, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. The results highlight the combination between twist&#8208;angle and number of layers as key elements for engineering spin&#8208;switching reversals in twisted magnets, of interest toward the miniaturization of spintronic devices and realizing novel spin textures.

         <title>A Chain Entanglement Gelled SnO&#8322; Electron Transport Layer for Enhanced Perovskite Solar Cell Performance and Effective Lead Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating DAES&#8208;PVP polymer and LiCl into a SnO2 aqueous solution, an in situ polymerized, chain&#8208;entangled SnO2 electron transport layer is developed. This approach resulted in a perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 24.77% and enhanced stability. Additionally, the new SnO2 layer demonstrated significant lead protection effects.








Abstract
SnO&#8322; is a widely used electron transport layer (ETL) material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and its design and optimization are essential for achieving efficient and stable PSCs. In this study, the in situ formation of a chain entanglement gel polymer electrolyte is reported in an aqueous phase, integrated with SnO&#8322; as the ETL. Based on the self&#8208;polymerization of 3&#8208;[[2&#8208;(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethylammonium]propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonic acid (DAES) in an aqueous environment, combining the catalytic effect of LiCl (as a Lewis acid) with the salting&#8208;out effect, and the introduction of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the other polymer chain, a chain entanglement gelled SnO2 (G&#8208;SnO2) structure is successfully constructed with a wide range of functions. The PDEAS&#8208;PVP chain entanglement gel achieves passivation and Pb2&#8314; capture through chemical chelation mechanisms is explored. The results demonstrated that the all&#8208;in&#8208;air prepared PSC based on G&#8208;SnO2 exhibited an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.77% and retained 83.3% of their initial efficiency after 2100 h of air exposure. Additionally, the PDEAS&#8208;PVP exposes more C&#9552;O and S&#9552;O active sites, significantly enhanced the lead absorption capability of the PSCs.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Hysteresis of Electronic Polarization in Anti&#8208;Ferromagnet FePS3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hysteresis of electronic polarization in the anti&#8208;ferromagnetic semiconductor FePS3 is demonstrated via light, resulting in the optical multiferroic phase. The hysteresis of the electronic polarization occurs due to the octupolar polarization within the spin lattice, which suggests a new mechanism for controlling electronic polarization in magnetic materials using light.








Abstract
Research on manipulating materials using light has garnered significant interest, yet examples of controlling electronic polarization in magnetic materials remain scarce. Here, the hysteresis of electronic polarization in the anti&#8208;ferromagnetic semiconductor FePS3 is demonstrated via light. Below the N&#233;el temperature, linear dichroism (i.e., optical anisotropy) without structural symmetry breaking is observed. Light&#8208;induced net polarization aligns along the a&#8208;axis (zigzag direction) at 1.6&#160;eV due to the dipolar polarization and along the b&#8208;axis (armchair direction) at 2.0&#160;eV due to the combined effects of dipolar and octupolar polarizations, resulting from charge transfer from the armchair to the zigzag direction by light. Unexpected hysteresis of the electronic polarization occurs at 2.0&#160;eV due to the octupolar polarization, in contrast to the absence of such hysteresis at 1.6&#160;eV. This is attributed to a symmetry breaking of the light&#8208;induced phase of FePS3 involving electronic polarization within the spin lattice. Here a new mechanism is suggested for generating and controlling electronic polarization in magnetic materials using light, with implications for future device applications.

         <title>Intrinsic Anti&#8208;Freezing, Tough, and Transparent Hydrogels for Smart Optical and Multi&#8208;Modal Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsic anti&#8208;freezing and transparent hydrogel with good mechanical properties is prepared through the construction of microphase&#8208;separated nanochannels. In addition, the hydrogel can be used as intelligent optical waveguides and flexible sensors, demonstrating great potential in low&#8208;temperature electronic and optical applications.








Abstract
Hydrogels have received great attention due to their molecular designability and wide application range. However, they are prone to freeze at low temperatures due to the existence of mass water molecules, which can damage their flexibility and transparency, greatly limiting their use in cold environments. Although adding cryoprotectants can reduce the freezing point of hydrogels, it may also deteriorate the mechanical properties and face the risk of cryoprotectant leakage. Herein, the microphase&#8208;separated structures of hydrogels are regulated to confine water molecules in sub&#8208;6&#160;nm nanochannels and increase the proportion of bound water, endowing the hydrogels with intrinsic anti&#8208;freezing properties, high mechanical strength, good stretchability, remarkable fracture energy, and puncture resistance. Even after being kept in liquid nitrogen for 1000&#160;h, the hydrogel still maintains good transparency. The hydrogel can exhibit excellent low&#8208;temperature shape memory and intelligent optical waveguide properties. Additionally, the hydrogel can be assembled into strain and pressure sensors for flexible sensing at both room and low temperatures. The intrinsically anti&#8208;freezing microphase&#8208;separated hydrogel offers broad prospects in low&#8208;temperature electronic and optical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Approaches to Engineer Fluorescent Nanosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;based optical sensors are powerful tools to identify and image (biological) molecules. Optimizing surface chemistry and photophysics of these sensors is essential, but current methods limit throughput. This article discusses bottlenecks and highlights opportunities and requirements for high throughput and the scalability of non&#8208;classical recognition strategies.








Abstract
Optical sensors are powerful tools to identify and image (biological) molecules. Because of their optoelectronic properties, nanomaterials are often used as building blocks. To transduce the chemical interaction with the analyte into an optical signal, the interplay between surface chemistry and nanomaterial photophysics has to be optimized. Understanding these aspects promises major opportunities for tailored sensors with optimal performance. However, this requires methods to create and explore the many chemical permutations. Indeed, many current approaches are limited in throughput. This affects the chemical design space that can be studied, the application of machine learning approaches as well as fundamental mechanistic understanding. Here, an overview of selection&#8208;limited and synthesis&#8208;limited approaches is provided to create and identify molecular nanosensors. Bottlenecks are discussed and opportunities of non&#8208;classical recognition strategies are highlighted such as corona phase molecular recognition as well as the requirements for high throughput and scalability. Fluorescent carbon nanotubes are powerful building blocks for sensors and their huge chemical design space makes them an ideal platform for high throughput approaches. Therefore, they are the focus of this article, but the insights are transferable to any nanosensor system. Overall, this perspective aims to provide a fresh perspective to overcome current challenges in the nanosensor field.

         <title>RAFT Polymerization for Advanced Morphological Control: From Individual Polymer Chains to Bulk Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is a transformative technique in polymer science, offering unprecedented control over polymer morphology across a vast range of length scales. Recent advances leverage RAFT's precision and versatility to enable advanced materials design by dictating monomer sequences at the molecular level, manipulating self&#8208;assembly to make mesoscale structures, and controlling micro&#8208;phase separation for intricate 3D printed structures.








Abstract
Control of the morphology of polymer systems is achieved through reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization techniques such as Reversible Addition&#8208;Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT). Advanced RAFT techniques offer much more than just &#8220;living&#8221; polymerization &#8212; the RAFT toolkit now enables morphological control of polymer systems across many decades of length&#8208;scale. Morphological control is explored at the molecular&#8208;level in the context of syntheses where individual monomer unit insertion provides sequence&#8208;defined polymers (single unit monomer insertion, SUMI). By being able to define polymer architectures, the synthesis of bespoke shapes and sizes of nanostructures becomes possible by leveraging self&#8208;assembly (polymerization induced self&#8208;assembly, PISA). Finally, it is seen that macroscopic materials can be produced with nanoscale detail, based on phase&#8208;separated nanostructures (polymerization induced microphase separation, PIMS) and microscale detail based on 3D&#8208;printing technologies. RAFT control of morphology is seen to cross from molecular level to additive manufacturing length&#8208;scales, with complete morphological control over all length&#8208;scales.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Pixel Event Photoactive Device for Real&#8208;Time, In&#8208;Sensor Spatiotemporal Optical Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces a single&#8208;pixel event photoactive device with selective carrier integration that merges spatiotemporal event sensing and built&#8208;in short&#8208;term memory. It processes multibit parallel data and recognizes patterns ultrafast (0.4&#160;&#181;s) with ultralow energy use (25 femtojoules). Adjusting its speed allows trajectory and position detection of events through optical flow sensing.








Abstract
The increasing demand for energy&#8208;efficient, sophisticated optical sensing technologies in various applications, from machine vision to optical communication, highlights the necessity for innovations in spatiotemporal information sensing and processing at a nearly single&#8208;pixel scale. Traditional methods, including multi&#8208;pixel photodetector arrays and event&#8208;based camera systems, often fail to provide rapid, real&#8208;time detection and processing of dynamic events within the sensor. This shortcoming is particularly notable in handling high&#8208;dimensional spatiotemporal data, where the dependency on sequential data input and external processing tools leads to latency, reduced throughput, and heightened energy consumption, thereby impeding real&#8208;time parallel data processing capabilities. Here, a carrier&#8208;selective, single&#8208;pixel, position&#8208;sensitive planar photoactive device that integrates spatiotemporal event sensing with inherent short&#8208;term memory capabilities is introduced. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept single&#8208;pixel event photoactive device enables in&#8208;sensor spatiotemporal parallel optical information processing, efficiently managing multibit (&gt;4 bit) data simultaneously and facilitating ultrafast (&#8776;0.4&#160;&#181;s) recognition of input patterns with low energy consumption (25 femtojoules). Additionally, by adjusting the operating speed from continuous to pulsed light illumination, the sensor array can detect trajectories and absolute position of events, offering in&#8208;sensor optical flow detection. This single&#8208;pixel event photodetector marks significant advancement toward developing compact, energy&#8208;efficient, ultrafast sensors suitable for a wide range of in sensor&#8208;based photonic applications.

         <title>Enhancing Resistance to Wetting Transition through the Concave Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the pulvilli of the leaf beetle (Gastrophysa atrocyanea), a new design strategy is introduced to enhance the wetting stability of superhydrophobic surfaces through the implementation of concave structures. The air caps forming on the concavity contribute to preventing the Cassie&#8208;Baxter to Wenzel transition under continuous exposure to various impacts and hydrostatic pressures.








Abstract
Water&#8208;repellent superhydrophobic surfaces are ubiquitous in nature. The fundamental understanding of bio/bio&#8208;inspired structures facilitates practical applications surmounting metastable superhydrophobicity. Typically, the hierarchical structure and/or reentrant morphology have been employed hitherto to suppress the Cassie&#8208;Baxter to Wenzel transition (CWT). Herein, a new design concept is reported, an effect of concave structure, which is vital for the stable superhydrophobic surface. The thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the concave pillars are evaluated by continuous exposure to various hydrostatic pressures and sudden impacts of water droplets with various Weber numbers (We), comparing them to the standard superhydrophobic normal pillars. Specifically, the concave pillar exhibits reinforced impact resistance preventing CWT below a critical We of &#8776;27.6, which is &#8776;1.6 times higher than that of the normal pillar (&#8776;17.0). Subsequently, the stability of underwater air film (plastron) is investigated at various hydrostatic pressures. The results show that convex air caps formed at the concave cavities generate downward Laplace pressure opposing the exerted hydrostatic pressure between the pillars, thus impeding the hydrostatic pressure&#8208;dependent underwater air diffusion. Hence, the effects of trapped air caps contributing to the stable Cassie&#8208;Baxter state can offer a pioneering strategy for the exploration and utilization of superhydrophobic surfaces.

Specifically, the concave pillar exhibits reinforced impact resistance preventing CWT below a critical &lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt; of &#8776;27.6, which is &#8776;1.6 times higher than that of the normal pillar (&#8776;17.0). Subsequently, the stability of underwater air film (plastron) is investigated at various hydrostatic pressures. The results show that convex air caps formed at the concave cavities generate downward Laplace pressure opposing the exerted hydrostatic pressure between the pillars, thus impeding the hydrostatic pressure-dependent underwater air diffusion. Hence, the effects of trapped air caps contributing to the stable Cassie-Baxter state can offer a pioneering strategy for the exploration and utilization of superhydrophobic surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anisotropic Ferroelectricity in Polar Vortices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the existence and anisotropic nature of macroscopic polarization components that emerge within lattices of nanoscale polar vortices are demonstrated. In particular, the component parallel to the vortex axis shows novel switching behavior that can be harnessed for multistate memory, with excellent stability of numerous intermediate states demonstrated.








Abstract
The exotic polarization configurations of topologically protected dipolar textures have opened new avenues for realizing novel phenomena absent in traditional ferroelectric systems. While multiple recent studies have revealed a diverse array of emergent properties in such polar topologies, the details of their atomic and mesoscale structures remain incomplete. Through atomic&#8208; and meso&#8208;scale imaging techniques, the emergence of a macroscopic ferroelectric polarization along both principal axes of the vortex lattice while performing phase&#8208;field modeling to probe the atomic scale origins of these distinct polarization components is demonstrated. Additionally, due to the anisotropic epitaxial strain, the polarization switching behavior perpendicular and parallel to the vortices is highly anisotropic, with switching along the vortex axes occurring over numerous decades in field&#8208;pulse width. This slow switching process allows for the deterministic control of the polarization state, enabling a non&#8208;volatile, multi&#8208;state memory with excellent distinguishability and long retention&#160;times.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Rapid Elimination of Antibiotic Resistance Contaminations Using Graphitic Carbon Nitride Tailored with Carrier Confinement Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carrier confinement domains alter the inherent sp2 hybridized plane structure of graphitic carbon nitride, further inducing stronger electron delocalization and long&#8208;range order, which promotes faster separation and migration of photogenerated carrier, accelerates redox reaction decoupling and photodynamic antibiotic resistance removal.








Abstract
Solar water disinfection facilitated by photocatalyst has been considered a viable point&#8208;of&#8208;use (POU) method for mitigating antibiotic resistance contaminations at the household or community levels. Here, density functional theory calculations are used to guide the fabrication of a carrier confinement domains (CCD)&#8208;decorated graphitic carbon nitride (CN) photocatalyst. The CCD integration effectively disrupts the electron distribution symmetry of CN, amplifies its local electron density, and facilitates the formation of a long&#8208;range ordered structure, thereby enhancing charge separation efficiency. Importantly, the CCD directs the migration of photogenerated carriers to specific regions upon light illumination, effectively minimizing their spatial proximity. As a result, the overall reactive oxygen species level of the photocatalytic system is markedly elevated, with a twelvefold increase in H2O2 concentration, alongside a significant rise in &#8226;O2&#8722; and &#8226;OH steady&#8208;state concentrations. Remarkably, a record&#8208;high disinfection efficiency is attained, successfully inactivating 7 log of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria within 30&#160;min. Additionally, the photocatalyst can be integrated into a continuous&#8208;flow fixed&#8208;bed reactor, facilitating clean water production for up to 60&#160;h at a rate of 121&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;day&#8722;1, highlighting its significant potential for POU applications.

         <title>Breaking Mass Transport Limit for Hydrogen Evolution&#8208;Inhibited and Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass transport limit is circumvented by the pulsed charging protocols, achieving (002)&#8208;textured, dendrite&#8208;free, and hydrogen&#8208;evolution&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping at ultrahigh current density up to 160 mA cm&#8722;2. The Zn batteries accordingly achieve high current density (50&#8211;100 mA cm&#8722;2), high areal mass loading (29 mgcathode cm&#8722;2), and high areal capacity (7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
It is commonly accepted that batteries perform better at low current densities below the mass&#8208;transport limit, which restricts their current rate and capacity. Here, it is demonstrated that the performance of Zn metal electrodes can be dramatically enhanced at current densities and cut&#8208;off capacities exceeding the mass&#8208;transport limit by using pulsed&#8208;current protocols. These protocols achieve cumulative plating/stripping capacities of 11.0 Ah cm&#8722;2 and 3.8 Ah cm&#8722;2 at record&#8208;high current densities of 80 and 160 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The study identifies and understands the promoted (002)&#8208;textured Zn growth and suppressed hydrogen evolution based on the thermodynamics and kinetics of competing reactions. Furthermore, the over&#8208;limiting pulsed&#8208;current protocol enables long&#8208;life Zn batteries with high mass loading (29 mgcathode cm&#8722;2) and high areal capacity (7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2), outperforming cells using constant&#8208;current protocols at equivalent energy and time costs. The work provides a comprehensive understanding of the current&#8208;capacity&#8208;performance relationship in Zn plating/stripping and offers an effective strategy for dendrite&#8208;free metal batteries that meet practical requirements for high capacity and high current rates.

         <title>Strong Anisotropy and Giant Photothermoelectricity of 1D Alloy Nb3Se12I&#8208;Based Photodetector for Ultrabroadband Light&#8208;Detection and Encryption Imaging Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional Nb3Se12I photodetector integrated broadband imaging and encrypted communications are realized based on the photothermoelectric effect and polarization sensitivity. The photothermoelectric and photoconductive effect synergistic detection mechanism enable high responsivity and rapid operation across a broad wavelength spectrum from deep&#8208;ultraviolet to terahertz. The encrypted method of polarization state compensation for photothermoelectric current converting image data into polarization states enhances information security. This work provides an effective strategy to advance anisotropic thermoelectric materials for high&#8208;capacity, secure communication applications.








Abstract
Securing high&#8208;capacity and safe communication holds great potential for ushering in the new era of digital society. In this study, a wide&#8208;band photodetector based on the quasi&#8208;1D niobium selenide compounds (Nb3Se12I), showing up photothermoelectric (PTE) dominated multiple synergistic effects with high responsivity across a wide wavelength range from deep&#8208;ultraviolet (254&#160;nm) to terahertz (0.30 THz), providing an efficient strategy for high&#8208;capacity optical processing is introduced. Combined with the polarized&#8208;sensitive property of the Nb3Se12I photodetector, an encrypted imaging technology using polarization&#8208;resolved PTE current is developed. This technology is capable of transforming encrypted messages into polarization states, which can be restored through a specially designed decryption algorithm, greatly enhancing the concealment and security of the information transmission process. Overall, the Nb3Se12I&#8208;based detector manifests in terms of high responsivity (283.2 A W&#8722;1 to 520&#160;nm, 1632.4 A W&#8722;1 to 980&#160;nm, and 1868.1 A W&#8722;1 for short&#8208;wave infrared light of 2200&#160;nm), suitable response speed of 43 &#181;s for 0.30 THz wave and polarization anisotropy ratio of 1.83. The versatile abilities of photodetector in the realm of ultrabroadband polarized detection and encryption imaging may advance the use of anisotropic thermoelectric materials in high&#8208;capacity and secure information communication applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene@CuCo2O4 /PE Separator for Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Large&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>

This study presents a multifunctional ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene/CuCo2O4/PE separator that can suppress LiPSs shuttling, enhance sulfur redox kinetics, and regulate Li+ deposition, and consequently achieve an outstanding energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in a 10Ah&#8208;level pouch cell.








Abstract
The shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), sluggish reaction kinetics, and uncontrolled lithium deposition/stripping remain the main challenges in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs), which are aggravated under practical working conditions, i.e., high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte in large&#8208;capacity pouch cells. This study introduces a Ti3C2Tx MXene@CuCo2O4 (MCC) composite on a polyethylene (PE) separator to construct an ultrathin MXene@CuCo2O4/PE (MCCP) film. The MCCP functional separator can deliver superior LiPSs adsorption/catalysis capabilities via the MCC composite and regulate the Li+ deposition through a conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene framework, enhancing redox kinetics and cycling lifetime. When paired with sulfur/carbon (S/C) cathode and lithium metal anode, the resultant 10 Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with the ultrathin MCCP separator achieves an energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the whole cell and a stable running of 100 cycles under practical operation conditions (cathode loading = 10.0&#8201;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, negative/positive areal capacity ratio (N/P ratio) = 2, and electrolyte/sulfur weight ratio (E/S ratio) = 2.6&#8201;&#181;L mg&#8722;1). Furthermore, through a systematic evaluation of the as&#8208;prepared Li&#8208;S pouch cell, the study unveils the operational and failure mechanisms of LSBs under practical conditions. The achievement of ultrahigh energy density in such a large&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;sulfur pouch cell will accelerate the commercialization of LSBs.

         <title>Dirac&#8208;Like Fermions Anomalous Magneto&#8208;Transport in a Spin&#8208;Polarized Oxide 2D Electron System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous magneto&#8208;transport dominated by non&#8208;trivial Berry curvature and Dirac&#8208;like fermions is exhibited by an engineered 2D electron system (2DES) at (111) LaAlO3/EuTiO3/SrTiO3 interface, where structural and electronic properties are tailored to mimic that of magnetic gapped topological insulators.









Abstract
In a 2D electron system (2DES) the breaking of the inversion, time&#8208;reversal and bulk crystal&#8208;field symmetries is interlaced with the effects of spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) triggering exotic quantum phenomena. Here, epitaxial engineering is used to design and realize a 2DES characterized simultaneously by ferromagnetic order, large Rashba SOC and hexagonal band warping at the (111) interfaces between LaAlO3, EuTiO3, and SrTiO3 insulators. The 2DES displays anomalous quantum corrections to the magneto&#8208;conductance driven by the time&#8208;reversal&#8208;symmetry breaking occurring below the magnetic transition temperature. The results are explained by the emergence of a non&#8208;trivial Berry phase and competing weak anti&#8208;localization/weak localization back&#8208;scattering of Dirac&#8208;like fermions, mimicking the phenomenology of gapped topological insulators. These findings open perspectives for the engineering of novel spin&#8208;polarized functional 2DES holding promises in spin&#8208;orbitronics and topological&#160;electronics.

         <title>Bidirectional Photovoltage&#8208;Driven Oxide Transistors for Neuromorphic Visual Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional photovoltage&#8208;driven neuromorphic visual sensor is constructed by connecting the different electrodes of two perovskite solar cells to the two gates of ion&#8208;regulated In2O3 transistors. The mem&#8208;reservoir chip is also proposed for handing object movement and dynamic color recognition.








Abstract
Biological vision is one of the most important parts of the human perception system. However, emulating biological visuals is challenging because it requires complementary photoexcitation and photoinhibition. Here, the study presents a bidirectional photovoltage&#8208;driven neuromorphic visual sensor (BPNVS) that is constructed by monolithically integrating two perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with dual&#8208;gate ion&#8208;gel&#8208;gated oxide transistors. PSCs act as photoreceptors, converting external visual stimuli into electrical signals, whereas oxide transistors generate neuromorphic signal outputs that can be adjusted to produce positive and negative photoresponses. This device mimics the human vision system's ability to recognize colored and color&#8208;mixed patterns. The device achieves a static color recognition accuracy of 96% by utilizing the reservoir computing system for feature extraction. The BPNVS mem&#8208;reservoir chip is also proposed for handing object movement and dynamic color recognition. This work is a significant step forward in neuromorphic sensing and complex pattern recognition.

         <title>Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons in 3R ZnIn2S4 with Broken Inversion Symmetry for High&#8208;Performance Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D 3R&#8208;phase ZnIn2S4 with broken inversion symmetry is systematically investigated for its intrinsic self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). Benefiting from the presence of intrinsic STEs, the photoconductive effects induced by STEs can enhance their applicability in photodetection with remarkable broad&#8208;spectrum performance.








Abstract
Exploring novel materials with intrinsic self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) is crucial for advancing optoelectronic technologies. In this study, 2D 3R&#8208;phase ZnIn2S4, featuring broken inversion symmetry, is introduced to investigate intrinsic STEs. This material exhibits a broadband photoluminescence (PL) emission with a full width at half maximum of 164&#160;nm and a large Stokes shift of &#8776;0.6&#160;eV, which arises from the distortion of [ZnS4]6&#8208; tetrahedral unit induced by the symmetry breaking and strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. The photophysical properties of the STEs exhibit a high Huang&#8208;Rhys factor (15.0), rapid STEs formation time (166&#160;fs), and extended STEs lifetime (1039&#160;ps), as demonstrated by experimental evidence from temperature&#8208;dependent PL, Raman spectroscopy, and ultrafast absorption spectroscopy. Additionally, STE&#8208;induced photoconductive&#160;effect is elucidated, indicating that intrinsic STEs in 3R&#8208;ZnIn2S4 can provide a synergistic effect that enhances absorption capacity, localization, and lifetime by capturing the self&#8208;trapped hole state. Consequently, the 2D 3R&#8208;ZnIn2S4 photodetector exhibits remarkable broad&#8208;spectrum photosensitivity, including a photo&#8208;switching ratio of 11286, response times of less than 0.6&#160;ms, responsivity of 15.2&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, detectivity of 1.02&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#185;&#185; Jones, and external quantum efficiency of 5032% under 375&#160;nm light. These findings provide new ideas for exploring materials with intrinsic STEs to achieve novel high&#8208;performance photodetector applications.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Tunable Enhancement of Piezoelectricity in a Novel Molecular Multiferroic Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first strain engineering in molecular ionic multiferroics. Under a strain of 2.0%, a tenfold increase in piezoelectric performance and a significant reduction of 50% in the ferroelectric coercive field are observed, which unveils a novel strategy to augment the performance of molecular multiferroics.








Abstract
Multiferroics are appealing because of application potentials in data storage devices, sensors, transducers, and energy harvesters. Molecular multiferroics emerge as a promising alternative to inorganic multiferroics due to flexibility, light weight, low toxicity, solution processing, structural diversity, and chemical tunability. While researches have predominantly focused on perovskite structures, studies on molecular ionic multiferroics remain relatively limited. It is urgent to creatively build a novel platform for studying and developing the coupling and interaction between the stress, electricity, and magnetism. Knowing this, the work focuses on a novel organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid multiferroic N&#8208;ethyl&#8208;N&#8208;(fluoromethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;methylethylammonium tetrabromoferrate (III) showing coexisting magnetic and electric orderings. It undergoes antiferromagnetic, ferroelectric, and ferroelastic transitions. Notably, under a strain of 2.0%, the piezoelectric response increases tenfold, and the coercive field of ferroelectric polarization is reduced by half. The strain&#8208;induced enhancement of piezoelectricity is rarely reported in molecular multiferroics. Density functional theory is employed to predict that the mechanism of the large piezoelectric response under strain engineering is related to the cation rotation and phase switching between the stable phase and an energetically competitive metastable phase. This study creates a new paradigm to develop molecular multiferroics and future microelectronic devices for energy conversion.

         <title>Evidence of Quasi&#8208;Na Metallic Clusters in Sodium Ion Batteries through In Situ X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly defective ultrathin carbon nanosheets&#8208;8 (HDCS&#8208;8) anode uniformly adsorbs Na+ in the high&#8208;voltage slope region, resulting in the formation of small particle hexagonal quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters. Subsequently, the HDCS&#8208;8 anode transforms the small particle hexagonal systems clusters into large particle orthorhombic systems of quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters in the low&#8208;voltage region.








Abstract
Carbonaceous materials have been considered the most promising anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost, good electrical conductivity, and structural stability. The main challenge of carbonaceous anodes prior to their commercialization is low initial coulomb efficiencies, derived from a lack of an efficient technique to reveal a fundamental comprehension of sodium storage mechanisms. Here, the direct observation of quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters in carbonaceous anodes during cycling through in situ XRD is reported. By means of such a technique, a strong self&#8208;adsorption behavior forming quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters is detected within a rationally designed highly defective ultrathin carbon nanosheets (HDCS) anode. Such a self&#8208;adsorption and crystalline system transformation mechanism in HDCS brings capacity retention about 100% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. This work provides a new principle for designing high&#8208;performance carbon anodes for SIBs.

         <title>Disrupting Intracellular Homeostasis by Copper&#8208;Based Nanoinducer with Multiple Enzyme&#8208;Mimicking Activities to Induce Disulfidptosis&#8208;Enhanced Pyroptosis for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;based nanoinducer (CGBH NNs) aimed to disrupt intracellular metabolism and redox homeostasis for inducing tumor cells disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced immunogenic pyroptosis. The combination of these two cell death modes could promote the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and inflammatory cytokines, reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME and enhancing immune cells infiltration. The evoked robust immune responses helped to suppress tumor progression.








Abstract
Given the crucial role of abnormal homeostasis in tumor cells for maintaining their growth, it may be more efficient with less effort to develop anti&#8208;tumor strategies that target multiple combined mechanisms by disrupting intracellular homeostasis. Here, a copper&#8208;based nanoinducer (CGBH NNs) with multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities is designed and constructed to induce disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis through disrupting multiple intracellular homeostasis for effective tumor immunotherapy. Within the tumor microenvironment (TME), CGBH NNs can disrupt intracellular glucose homeostasis and inhibit NADPH production, leading to accumulation of cystine, which further blocked the substrate and key enzyme for synthesizing glutathione. Subsequently, through cascade catalytic reactions involving enzyme activities (glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like, glucose oxidase and peroxidase&#8208;like activities), CGBH NNs can produce massive reactive oxygen species&#160;(ROS) and further disrupt intracellular redox homeostasis, resulting in the disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis. The tumor cells undergoing immunogenic pyroptosis can release various cytosolic contents and inflammatory factors, eliciting robust immune responses by facilitating immune cell infiltration, and reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME. After the combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, CGBH NNs can effectively suppress the tumor growth and prolong the survival time of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This work presents a novel paradigm to trigger disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis by destroying intracellular homeostasis for anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Enhanced Photosensitizer Wettability via Anchoring Competition of Violet Phosphorus Quantum Dots for Breakthroughs in Photodynamic Film Sterilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy to enhance the wettability of photosensitizers in photodynamic films (VP/Hy&#8208;BC films) by anchoring violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs). This approach effectively boosts the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances antibacterial efficacy. Computational modeling and experimental findings demonstrate the promising potential of VP/Hy&#8208;BC films for applications in antibacterial packaging.








Abstract
Wettability is important for photodynamic film sterilization since higher wettability enhances the capture of bacteria in contact with photosensitizers. Herein, a small number of violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs) are anchored into hypericin bacterial cellulose films (VP/Hy&#8208;BC films) to improve wettability, reducing the water contact angle from 56.8&#176; to 33.0&#176;. This modification facilitated more effective interactions between the bacteria and photosensitizers, rapidly inactivating 7 log10 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus within 60&#160;min. First&#8208;principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that VPQDs, with their low spatial site resistance, reduced the intermolecular Hy self&#8208;aggregation force. This increased the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of VP/Hy by &#8776;25.7%, thereby decreasing hydrophobic photosensitizer aggregation. Consequently, more active sites are exposed, remarkably improving the photoelectron transfer efficiency. VP/Hy&#8208;BC demonstrated exceptional efficacy in inhibiting bacterial proliferation; for instance, it extended beef shelf life by up to 10 days. The findings of this study will aid the development of health&#8208;conscious, eco&#8208;friendly, and efficient antimicrobial packaging films.

         <title>Boosting Carrier Transport in Quasi&#8208;2D/3D Perovskite Heterojunction for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite/Organic Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;2D/3D heterojunction&#8208;based WBG perovskite is constructed to repair the surface defects and weaken the quantum&#8208;well confinement effect. These advances reduce interfacial carrier transport loss, contributing to balanced carrier recombination in the interconnecting layer. The resulting perovskite/organic tandems exhibit record power conversion efficiencies of 25.92% (0.0628&#160;cm2) and 24.63% (1.004&#160;cm2), as well as robust operational stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites are continuously in the limelight owing to their applicability in tandem solar cells. The main bottlenecks of WBG perovskites are interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination and carrier transport loss caused by interfacial defects and large energy&#8208;level offsets, which induce additional energy losses when WBG perovskites are stacked with organic solar cells in series because of unbalanced carrier recombination in interconnecting layer (ICL). To solve these issues, 1,3&#8208;propanediammonium iodide (PDADI) is incorporated to form Dion&#8211;Jacobson &#8208;phase quasi&#8208;2D perovskites with mixed high&#8208;n&#8208;values in WBG perovskites. PDADI simultaneously repairs the shallow/deep defects and establishes a Type&#8208;II energy&#8208;level alignment between quasi&#8208;2D/3D and 3D perovskites for rapid carrier extraction. More importantly, the short&#8208;chain diammonium cation in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite with high n&#8208;values results in a short Pb&#8211;I inorganic layer spacing, which enhances the interlayer electronic coupling and weakens the quantum&#8208;well confinement effect that restricts carrier transport. The suppressed transport loss increases the electron concentration in the ICL for balanced carrier recombination. The 0.0628 and 1.004 cm2 perovskite/organic tandems achieve remarkable efficiencies of 25.92% and 24.63%, respectively. The quasi&#8208;2D capping layer can inhibit ion migration, allowing perovskite/organic tandems to show excellent operational stability (T85 &gt;&#160;1000&#160;h).

         <title>Substantially Enhanced Spin Polarization in Epitaxial CrTe2 Quantum Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A firm and clear picture of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin texture indeed gives direct evidence of the intrinsic effective spin polarization of CrTe2. Atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;resolved measurements show a significantly enhanced spin polarization in a 3 ML CrTe2 film, opens up an exciting opportunity to investigate exotic spin physics in 2D limit.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets, which extend to the monolayer (ML) limit, are rapidly gaining prominence in logic applications for low&#8208;power electronics. To improve the performance of spintronic devices, such as vdW magnetic tunnel junctions, a large effective spin polarization of valence electrons is highly desired. Despite its considerable significance, direct probe of spin polarization in these 2D magnets has not been extensively explored. Here, using 2D vdW ferromagnet of CrTe2 as a prototype, the spin degrees of freedom in the thin films are directly probed using Mott polarimetry. The electronic band of 50 ML CrTe2 thin film, spanning the Brillouin zone, exhibits pronounced spin&#8208;splitting with polarization peaking at 7.9% along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. Surprisingly, atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;resolved measurements show a significantly enhanced spin polarization in a 3 ML CrTe2 film, achieving 23.4% polarization even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The demonstrated correlation between spin polarization and film thickness highlights the pivotal influence of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, interlayer interactions, and itinerant behavior on these properties, as corroborated by theoretical analysis. This groundbreaking experimental verification of intrinsic effective spin polarization in CrTe2 ultrathin films marks a significant advance in establishing 2D ferromagnetic atomic layers as a promising platform for innovative vdW&#8208;based spintronic devices.

         <title>Intratumoral Injectable Redox&#8208;Responsive Immune Niche Improves the Abscopal Effect in Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intratumoral injectable nanofiber&#8208;based tumor immune niche (TIN) is engineered with redox&#8208;responsive IL&#8208;2 nanogels (NGs), &#945;&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 NGs, and poly(I:C). The TIN converts X&#8208;ray radiotherapy (XRT)&#8208;treated tumor into in situ cancer vaccine by expanding neoantigen&#8208;specific tumor&#8208;infiltrating lymphocytes at the treated primary tumor site, thereby eliciting robust systemic anticancer activity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (XRT) is often utilized to improve the immune checkpoint blockade response in cancer management. Such combination treatment can enhance the abscopal effect, facilitating a prolonged and durable systemic response. However, despite intense research efforts, only a minority of patients respond to this approach, and novel strategies to increase the abscopal effect are urgently needed. Here, the development of an intratumoral (i.t.) injectable nanofiber (NF)&#8208;based tumor immune niche (TIN) that converts XRT&#8208;treated tumors into an in situ cancer vaccine, eliciting robust systemic antitumor immunity, is reported. This NF&#8208;based immune niche incorporates redox&#8208;degradable anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 (&#945;&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4) nanogels (NGs) and interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) NGs for controlled release in hypoxic irradiated tumors, reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment into a pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment, and expanding the tumor&#8208;infiltrating CD8+ T cell population. Additionally, it is functionalized with polyinosinic&#8208;polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) to promote antigen&#8208;presenting cell maturation and prime neoantigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells. In vitro studies demonstrate TIN's ability to prime antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells and increase antigen&#8208;specific cell&#8208;killing efficiency under in vitro immunosuppressive conditions. In vivo studies confirm TIN's ability to elicit robust systemic anticancer activity in mouse melanoma and colorectal cancer models without inducing severe immune&#8208;related adverse events.

         <title>Wearable Haptics for Orthotropic Actuation Based on Perpendicularly Nested Auxetic SMA Knotting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable haptics for orthotropic actuation (WHOA) can be used for teleoperation of drones and robots with directional sensory perception in 3D space. The perpendicularly nested auxetic pattern with parylene coating provide orthotopically decoupled tactile feedback and wearable multimodal haptics.








Abstract
Smart wearable tactile systems, designed to deliver different types of touch feedback on human skin, can significantly improve engagement through diverse actuation patterns in virtual or augmented reality environments. Here, a perpendicularly nested auxetic wearable haptic interface is reported for orthotropically decoupled multimodal actuation (WHOA), capable of producing diverse tactile feedback modes with 3D sensory perception. WHOA incorporates shape memory alloy wires that are intricately knotted into an auxetic structure oriented along orthotropic dual axes. Its perpendicularly nested auxetic structure enables orthotropic actuation, allowing independent expansion and contraction along both x and y&#8208;axes, as confirmed by force&#8208;strain and displacement&#8208;time performance tests. Additionally, the perylene coating provides orthogonal electrical isolation to WHOA, allowing for stripe&#8208;specific localized actuation and enabling multiple tactile feedback modes. As an orthotropic wearable haptic interface, WHOA distinguishes between x&#8208;axis and y&#8208;axis directions and ultimately delivers multi&#8208;dimensional information regarding movements in 3D space through tactile feedback. As a result, when worn on the foot or arm, WHOA naturally delivers spatiotemporal tactile information to the user, facilitating navigation and teleoperation with 3D sensory perception.

         <title>Biomimetic Structural Hydrogels Reinforced by Gradient Twisted Plywood Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural design of natural structural hydrogels in crustacean exoskeletons, this work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels with gradient twisted plywood structure. The structural hydrogels achieve an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength, modulus, and toughness, coupled with recorded high fatigue threshold, superior impact resistance, and programmable shape morphing capability.








Abstract
Naturally structural hydrogels such as crustacean exoskeletons possess a remarkable combination of seemingly contradictory properties: high strength, modulus, and toughness coupled with exceptional fatigue resistance, owing to their hierarchical structures across multiple length scales. However, replicating these unique mechanical properties in synthetic hydrogels remains a significant challenge. This work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels by employing cholesteric liquid crystal self&#8208;assembly followed by nanocrystalline engineering. The resulting hydrogels exhibit a long&#8208;range ordered gradient twisted plywood structure with high crystallinity to mimic the design of crustacean exoskeletons.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the structural design of natural structural hydrogels in crustacean exoskeletons, this work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels with gradient twisted plywood structure. The structural hydrogels achieve an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength, modulus, and toughness, coupled with recorded high fatigue threshold, superior impact resistance, and programmable shape morphing capability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally structural hydrogels such as crustacean exoskeletons possess a remarkable combination of seemingly contradictory properties: high strength, modulus, and toughness coupled with exceptional fatigue resistance, owing to their hierarchical structures across multiple length scales. However, replicating these unique mechanical properties in synthetic hydrogels remains a significant challenge. This work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels by employing cholesteric liquid crystal self-assembly followed by nanocrystalline engineering. The resulting hydrogels exhibit a long-range ordered gradient twisted plywood structure with high crystallinity to mimic the design of crustacean exoskeletons. Consequently, the structural hydrogels achieve an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength (46&#160;&#177;&#160;3&#160;MPa), modulus (496&#160;&#177;&#160;25&#160;MPa), and toughness (170&#160;&#177;&#160;14&#160;MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), together with recorded high fatigue threshold (32.5&#160;kJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and superior impact resistance (48&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;kJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Additionally, through controlling geometry and compositional gradients of the hierarchical structures, a programmable shape morphing process allows for the fabrication of complex 3D hydrogels. This study not only offers valuable insights into advanced design strategies applicable to a broad range of promising hierarchical materials, but also pave the ways for load-bearing applications in tissue engineering, wearable devices, and soft robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This study introduces a novel single&#8208;step proximity vapor transfer technique to develop large, transparent neuromorphic devices using van der Waals materials. The device exhibits biological synapse&#8208;like behavior, supporting logic gate operations, neurotransmission, and imaging.

Abstract
Neuromorphic computing, which involves the creation of artificial synapses capable of mimicking biological brain activity, has intrigued researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). To advance neuromorphic computing, a highly efficient 2D material&#8208;based artificial synapse capable of performing logical and arithmetic operations must be developed. However, fabricating large, uniform films or high&#8208;quality structures of 2D materials remains challenging because of their multistep and complex fabrication processes. In the present study, to produce large (&#216; &#8776; 3 in.), uniform, transparent neuromorphic devices, a novel single&#8208;step approach called proximity vapor transfer (PVT) that utilizes van der Waals (vdW) materials is employed. This single&#8208;step technique, which involves the fabrication of vdW materials on various substrates (glass, ITO, AZO, Mo, and Cu), allows control of the thickness and bandgap tunability. The Schottky device developed via the PVT method using vdW SnS with neurotransmitter (acetylcholine)&#8208;like functionality emulates biological synapses and exhibits photoelectronic synaptic behavior with wide&#8208;field&#8208;of&#8208;view synaptic plasticity. In addition, logic gate operations (NOT, OR, AND), reward&#8208;cascade neurotransmission, and imaging can be performed using 3 &#215; 3 arrays of the device. This study represents a significant step toward the development of transparent and large&#8208;area synaptic devices, which are crucial for advancing AI applications.

         <title>Albumin&#8208;Chaperoned Deep&#8208;NIR Triarylmethane Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast In Vivo Imaging and Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>

NIR&#8208;phototherapy necessitates bright, stable, biocompatible fluorophores absorbing/emitting beyond 800 nm. Molecular engineering guidelines are established that brightness may be improved via rigidification, stability via steric shielding, and biocompatibility via the installation of multiple water&#8208;soluble groups. Nevertheless, the resulting fluorochromic scaffold is expected to be synthetically challenging. BSA&#8208;chaperoning of a structurally flexible deep NIR&#8208;absorbing dye is a feasible solution to the problem.








Abstract
Fluorophores absorbing/emitting in the deep near&#8208;infrared (deep NIR) spectral region, that is, 800 nm and beyond, hold great promise for in vivo bioimaging, diagnosis, and phototherapy due to deeper tissue penetration. The bottleneck is the lack of bright, stable, and readily synthesized deep NIR fluorophores. Here, it is reported that the albumin&#8208;chaperon strategy is a viable one&#8208;for&#8208;all strategy to address these difficulties. A focused library of deep&#8208;NIR absorbing dyes (EA5) is easily synthesized via a two&#8208;step cascade. They are neither very stable nor bright in phosphate buffer&#160;due to a propeller&#8208;type flexible scaffold. Through screening, EA5_c3 is found to exhibit a high affinity toward bovine serum albumin (BSA). Binding&#8208;associated structural rigidification resulted in a gigantic 26&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement. The albumin chaperone also greatly improved the stability of EA5_c3 by shielding the bisbenzannulated triarylmethane core from nucleophilic or oxidative species. The resulting EA5_c3@BSA exhibits high biocompatibility. It offered high&#8208;resolution vasculature, lymph systems, tumors, and other tissue imaging with its bright deep NIR emission. At the same time, it exhibits prominent potential in photoacoustic imaging and photothermal treatment of subcutaneous and orthotopic breast tumors. These findings provide insights into robust and high&#8208;performance fluorophores with deep NIR regions for theranostic against aggressive cancers.

         <title>Boosting the Structural and Electrochemical Stability of Chloride&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conducting Perovskite Solid Electrolytes by Alkali Ion Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali ion doping is proposed to endow the CsSnCl3 solid electrolyte with a robust cubic structure against broad temperature variations at 213&#8722;473 K or a high relative humidity of 90%. Mild annealing further modifies the microstructure, resulting in a two fold increase in chloride ion conductivity and impressive electrochemical stability in various solid&#8208;state chloride ion batteries.








Abstract
The use of chloride&#8208;based solid electrolytes derived from Lewis acid&#8210;base reactions enables the construction of various new rechargeable batteries, such as chloride ion batteries (CIBs). However, a critical problem with these electrolytes is their poor stability under low&#8208;temperature, moist, or electrochemical conditions, which can lead to deterioration of the phase structure and a loss of ion conduction. Herein, the robust cubic structure of tin&#8208;based perovskite chloride&#8212;a chloride ion conductor&#8212;is achieved by alkali ion doping at the tin site via direct mechanical milling. The as&#8208;prepared cubic CsSn0.925Na0.075Cl2.925 (CSNC) electrolyte exhibits outstanding structural stability over a broad temperature range of 213&#8722;473 K or under a high relative humidity of up to 90%, at which the typical chloride electrolytes previously reported deteriorate because of moisture. Importantly, mild annealing can modify the microstructure of the CSNC, resulting in a two fold increase in ionic conductivity and an increase in electrochemical stability, which is superior to those of other chloride electrolytes reported in previous studies. The effective chloride&#8208;ion transfer and wide electrochemical window of the CSNC are further demonstrated in different solid&#8208;state CIBs.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Bipolar Covalent Organic Framework Cathode for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neoteric strategy is put forward using a redox&#8208;bipolar covalent organic framework cathode constructed from aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units to explore the ion co&#8208;storage characteristics in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. With this delicate structure and special storage mode, the resultant cathode shows impressive electrochemical properties at a wide temperature range, and all&#8208;organic sodium ion batteries also showcase the possibility of practical applications.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the construction of redox&#8208;bipolar COFs with the anions and cations co&#8208;storage feature for SIBs is rarely reported. Herein, redox&#8208;bipolar COF constructed from aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units (TPAD&#8208;COF)&#160;is developed as the cathode material in SIBs for the first time. The unique integration of conductive aniline skeletons and quinone redox centers endows TPAD&#8208;COF with high ionic/electrical conductivity, abundant redox&#8208;active sites, and fascinating bipolar features. Consequently, the elaborately tailored TPAD&#8208;COF cathode exhibits higher specific capacity (186.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and superior cycling performance (over 2000 cycles at 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with 0.015% decay rate per cycle). Impressively, TPAD&#8208;COF also displays a high specific capacity of 101&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 even at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. As a proof of concept, all&#8208;organic SIBs (AOSIBs) are assembled using TPAD&#8208;COF cathode and disodium terephthalate anode, which also show impressive electrochemical properties, indicating the potential application of TPAD&#8208;COF cathode in AOSIBs.

     alt="Redox-Bipolar Covalent Organic Framework Cathode for Advanced Sodium-Organic Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A neoteric strategy is put forward using a redox-bipolar covalent organic framework cathode constructed from aniline-fused quinonoid units to explore the ion co-storage characteristics in sodium-ion batteries. With this delicate structure and special storage mode, the resultant cathode shows impressive electrochemical properties at a wide temperature range, and all-organic sodium ion batteries also showcase the possibility of practical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redox-active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the construction of redox-bipolar COFs with the anions and cations co-storage feature for SIBs is rarely reported. Herein, redox-bipolar COF constructed from aniline-fused quinonoid units (TPAD-COF)&#160;is developed as the cathode material in SIBs for the first time. The unique integration of conductive aniline skeletons and quinone redox centers endows TPAD-COF with high ionic/electrical conductivity, abundant redox-active sites, and fascinating bipolar features. Consequently, the elaborately tailored TPAD-COF cathode exhibits higher specific capacity (186.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.05&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and superior cycling performance (over 2000 cycles at 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 0.015% decay rate per cycle). Impressively, TPAD-COF also displays a high specific capacity of 101&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; even at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. As a proof of concept, all-organic SIBs (AOSIBs) are assembled using TPAD-COF cathode and disodium terephthalate anode, which also show impressive electrochemical properties, indicating the potential application of TPAD-COF cathode in AOSIBs. The work will pave the avenue toward advanced COFs cathode for rechargeable batteries through rational molecular design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating the Local Spin States in Spinel Oxides to Promote the Activity of Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study regulates the local spin states by incorporating Ni into Co3O4 and explores their impact on activity in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. High spin Ni ions facilitate electron transfer from the catalyst to the unoccupied orbitals of CO2, providing sufficient active sites for the nucleation and growth of small Li2CO3 crystals, thereby improving reversibility.








Abstract
Due to the high energy barrier, slow reaction kinetics, and complex reaction environments of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries, the development of durable and efficient catalysts is essential. Transition metal oxides are promising for their availability, stability, and 3d electronic features, with spin states playing an important role in CO2 activation. In this study, the local spin states are regulated by incorporating Ni into Co3O4 and its impact on activity in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries is explored. The results show that Ni atoms with high spin states in Ni0.1Co2.9O4 facilitate electron transfer from the catalyst to the unoccupied orbitals of CO2, providing sufficient active sites for the nucleation and growth of small Li2CO3 crystals. These small crystals have a low decomposition barrier, leading to improved battery efficiency. Therefore, Ni0.1Co2.9O4 shows superior catalytic performance with an overpotential of 0.72&#160;V and an energy efficiency of &#8776;70% after 500&#160;h. This work provides insights into the relationship between spin states and CO2 reactions, highlighting a promising avenue for developing high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Observation of Highly Spin&#8208;Polarized Dangling Bond Surface States in Rare&#8208;Earth Pnictide Tellurides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique type of surface states in a family of ternary rare&#8208;earth pnictide tellurides with robust band structure and sizeable spin splitting is realized. Spin ARPES measurements reveal high spin polarization and distinct spin&#8208;momentum locking texture, arising from local site asymmetry and surface&#8208;purified spin&#8208;orbital texture. This work presents an intriguing spin&#8208;orbital&#8208;momentum&#8208;layer locking phenomenon, shedding lights on potential spintronic applications.








Abstract
To generate and manipulate spin&#8208;polarized electronic states in solids are crucial for modern spintronics. The textbook routes employ quantum well states or Shockley/topological type surface states whose spin degeneracy is lifted by strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking at the surface/interface. The resultant spin polarization is usually truncated because of the intertwining between multiple orbitals. Here a unique type of surface states is realized, namely, dangling bond surface states in a family of ternary rare&#8208;earth pnictide tellurides RePnTe (Re = La, Gd, Ce; Pn = Sb, Bi), with robust band structure and sizeable spin splitting. Spin and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal high spin polarization and distinct spin&#8208;momentum locking texture, which, according to the theoretical analysis, arise from local site asymmetry and surface&#8208;purified spin&#8208;orbital texture. The work extends the so&#8208;called &#8220;hidden spin polarization&#8221; from the bulk to the surface, presenting an intriguing spin&#8208;orbital&#8208;momentum&#8208;layer locking phenomenon, which may shed lights on potential spintronic applications.

         <title>Vacancies Engineering in Molybdenum Boride MBene Nanosheets to Activate Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental realization of 2D Mo&#8208;vacancy molybdenum boride (Mo4/3B2) MBene nanosheets is demonstrated with intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic character by selectively etching bulk MAB phase (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2. The Mo4/3B2 nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K.








Abstract
The rapid development of low energy dissipation spintronic devices has stimulated the search for air&#8208;stable 2D nanomaterials possessing room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism. Here the experimental realization of 2D Mo4/3B2 nanosheets is reported with intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic characteristics by vacancy engineering. These nanosheets are synthesized by etching the bulk MAB phase (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2 into Mo4/3B2 nanosheets in ZnCl2 molten salt. The Mo4/3B2 nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties, with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K, while vacancy&#8208;free MoB MBene exhibits paramagnetism. It is elucidated that the Mo&#8208;vacancy defect generates large density of states near the Fermi surface and spontaneously spin&#8208;split bands through first&#8208;principles calculations, which contributes to the non&#8208;zero magnetic moment in Mo4/3B2 nanosheets. This work lays the groundwork for activating the magnetic properties of MBene nanosheets by vacancy engineering, offering the possibilities for development of practical spintronic devices.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage of Twisted Structures in Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using machine learning, a variety of PU&#8208;based polymers are forecasted and successfully synthesized two with a high dielectric constant (K) and thermal stability. Combining these with PI via hydrogen bonds to form twisted HNP, both K and Eb are improved. Impressively, HNP&#8208;20% reaches an Ud of 6.42 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics possess outstanding advantages for high&#8208;power energy storage applications such as high breakdown strength (Eb) and efficiency (&#951;), while both of them decrease rapidly at elevated temperatures. Although several strategies have been evaluated to enhance Eb and heat resistance, the discharged energy density (Ud) is still limited by the planar conjugated structure. In this study, a novel approach to manipulate polymer morphology is introduced, thereby influencing dielectric properties. A range of polyurea (PU)&#8208;based polymers are predicted from different structural unit combinations by machine learning and synthesized two representative polymers with high dielectric constants (K) and thermal stability. These polymers are combined with PI to form a twisted polymer via hydrogen bonding interactions (HNP). Both experimental results and computational simulations demonstrate the twisted structure disrupts the conjugated structure to widen the bandgap and increase dipole moment through the twisting of polar groups, leading to simultaneous improvements in both K and Eb. Consequently, HNP&#8208;20% achieves an ultrahigh Ud of 6.42 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200 &#176;C. This work opens a new avenue to scalable high Ud all&#8208;polymer dielectric for high&#8208;temperature applications.

Combining these with PI via hydrogen bonds to form twisted HNP, both &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; are improved. Impressively, HNP-20% reaches an &lt;i&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; of 6.42 J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200&#160;&#176;C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer dielectrics possess outstanding advantages for high-power energy storage applications such as high breakdown strength (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) and efficiency (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;), while both of them decrease rapidly at elevated temperatures. Although several strategies have been evaluated to enhance Eb and heat resistance, the discharged energy density (&lt;i&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) is still limited by the planar conjugated structure. In this study, a novel approach to manipulate polymer morphology is introduced, thereby influencing dielectric properties. A range of polyurea (PU)-based polymers are predicted from different structural unit combinations by machine learning and synthesized two representative polymers with high dielectric constants (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;) and thermal stability. These polymers are combined with PI to form a twisted polymer via hydrogen bonding interactions (HNP). Both experimental results and computational simulations demonstrate the twisted structure disrupts the conjugated structure to widen the bandgap and increase dipole moment through the twisting of polar groups, leading to simultaneous improvements in both &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;. Consequently, HNP-20% achieves an ultrahigh Ud of 6.42 J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; with an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200 &#176;C. This work opens a new avenue to scalable high Ud all-polymer dielectric for high-temperature applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Nematic Graphene Films with a mesoporous Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition method is presented for the precise fabrication of chiral nematic graphene film, which exhibits uniform Na plating without dendrite formation and noteworthy thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding performance. This work paves the way for creating a large family of chiral nematic materials in various applications of photoelectric conversion, energy storage, electromagnetism, and separation.








Abstract
Ordering a crucial material like pure&#8208;graphene into the chiral nematic structure can potentially revolutionize the fields of photonics, chiral separation, and energy storage. However, the controlled fabrication of highly ordered graphene films with a long&#8208;range chiral nematic mesoporous structure is very challenging and as such, has not been achieved. Here, a chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition growth strategy is presented for the precise fabrication of mesoporous chiral nematic graphene films by using nanocrystalline cellulose as templates. It is evidenced that such graphene films possess the left&#8208;hand helical ordering, chiral nematic mesoporous structure with adjustable pore sizes (6.4&#8211;13.1&#160;nm), tailored pitch, excellent electrical conductivity (556 S cm&#8722;1), high specific surface area (1508 m2&#160;g&#8722;1) and mechanical flexibility. By coating Na anode with this film, uniform Na plating is achieved with no dendrite formation, resulting from its unique chiral nematic structure and tunable physicochemical properties. The films also achieved impressive thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding, i.e., 35&#8211;63&#160;dB, demonstrating their potentially multi&#8208;disciplinary applications.

         <title>Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Functionalized Cellulose Hydrogel Electrolyte for Dual&#8208;Interface Stabilization in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique one&#8208;gel&#8208;for&#8208;two&#8208;electrodes strategy is developed to simultaneously solve the challenges at both anode and cathode interfaces in aqueous zinc batteries. By constructing a carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized cellulose hydrogel electrolyte, the solvation structure of Zn2+ at Zn anode and the unfavored deposition of byproducts at phenazine cathode can be effectively regulated, thus enabling the dendrite&#8208;free and side reaction&#8208;suppressed aqueous zinc batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) are considered one of the most promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, achieving a stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface remains a challenge for developing high&#8208;performance AZBs. Herein, taking the Zn||phenazine (PNZ) system as a prototype, where the proton uptake/removal mechanism dominates in the cathode, a carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized cellulose hydrogel electrolyte is designed to simultaneously solve the issues at both the anode and cathode interfaces. Specifically, the hydrogel electrolyte can not only regulate Zn2+ ions at the Zn anode side but also supply H+ ions at the PNZ cathode side to avoid the unfavored deposition of zinc sulfate hydroxides. Benefiting from the unique one&#8208;gel&#8208;for&#8208;two&#8208;electrodes strategy, the dendrite&#8208;free and side reaction&#8208;suppressed aqueous Zn||PNZ cells are developed with a high specific capacity (311 mAh g&#8722;1, 99% utilization of the theoretical capacity) and a long cycle life (over 1500 cycles within 2 months). This study proposes a facile and low&#8208;cost electrolyte strategy for stabilizing AZBs.

         <title>Greatly Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell and Zn&#8208;Air Battery via Hole Inner Edge Reconstruction of 2D Pd Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A widespread hole inner edge reconstruction (HIER) phenomenon as overstretched outermost crystal facets is revealed in Pd nanomeshes prepared through a facile gram&#8208;scale room&#8208;temperature reduction method. Contributed by the HIER phenomenon, a tremendous improvement in the electrocatalytic activity is identified, which significantly improved the anion exchange membrane fuel cells and Zn&#8208;air batteries assembled with Pd NM/C cathode catalyst.








Abstract
Platinum group metals (PGM) have yet to be the most active catalysts in various sustainable energy reactions. Their high cost, however, has made maximizing the activity and minimizing the dosage become an urgent priority for the practical applications of emerging technologies. Herein, a novel 2D&#160;Pd nanomesh structure possessing hole inner reconstructed edges (HIER) with exposed high energy facets and overstretched lattice parameters is fabricated through a facile room&#8208;temperature reduction method at gram&#8208;scale yields. The HIER enhances the catalytic performance of Pd in electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), achieving superior mass activity (MA) of 2.672 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is 27.8 fold and 23.6 fold higher, respectively, than those of the commercial Pt/C (0.096 A mgPt&#8722;1) and Pd/C (0.113 A mgPd&#8722;1) at 0.9 VRHE. Most significantly, in H2&#8208;air anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) and Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB) applications, this unique Pd catalyst delivers a much&#8208;outperformed peak power density of 0.86 and 0.22&#160;W cm&#8722;2, respectively, compared with 0.54 and 0.13&#160;W cm&#8722;2 of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, indicating a novel pathway in electrocatalyst designs through HIER engineering.

         <title>Unlocking the Trade&#8208;off Between Intrinsic and Interfacial Thermal Transport of Boron Nitride Nanosheets by Surface Functionalization for Advanced Thermal Interface Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the trade&#8208;off between the intrinsic and interfacial thermal transport of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) within thermal interface material. The surface functionalization maintains the intrinsic high thermal conductivity of BNNS while significantly increasing binding energy between micro/nano interfaces in BNNS&#8208;based TIMs, effectively reducing interfacial thermal resistance of BNNS joint interfaces and interfaces between BNNSs and the matrix.








Abstract
The increasing computing power of AI presents a major challenge for high&#8208;power chip solution and heat dissipation. Boron nitride nanosheet&#8208;based thermal interface materials (BNNS&#8208;based TIMs) exhibit excellent electrical insulation property, ensuring the secure and stable operation of chips. However, the efficiency of micro/nano interfacial thermal transport is limited, impeding further enhancements in the thermal conductivity (TC) of BNNS&#8208;based TIMs. Here, a strategy of surface functionalization is reported to unlock the trade&#8208;off between the intrinsic and interfacial thermal transport of BNNS within TIMs. These results suggest that the surface functionalization maintains the intrinsic high TC of BNNS while significantly increasing binding energy between micro/nano interfaces in BNNS&#8208;based TIMs, effectively reducing interfacial thermal resistance of BNNS joint interfaces and interfaces between BNNSs and the matrix by 50% and 26.1%, respectively. The BNNS&#8208;based TIMs exhibit excellent TC (&#8776;21&#8211;25&#160;W/(m&#183;K)) and ultralow Young's modulus, which can promote the development of flexible high&#8208;performance chip cooling technology in the AI industry.

         <title>Synergetic Modulation of Electronic Properties of Cobalt Oxide via &#8220;Tb&#8221; Single Atom for Uphill Urea and Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen (H2) production via water electrolysis benefits from switching the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The topologically doped rare&#8208;earth single atom &#8216;Tb&#8217; on defective Co3O4 (TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4) achieves superior UOR performance. The catalyst achieves 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density at 1.27&#160;V, &#8722;35&#160;mV, and 1.22&#160;V for UOR, H2 evolution reaction, and Bifunctional UOR electrolyzer, respectively with remarkable stability.








Abstract
Exploring single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysts in hybrid urea&#8208;assisted water electrolysis offers a viable alternative to both Hydrogen (H2) generation and polluted water treatment. However, the unfavorable electronic stabilization, low SA content, intrinsically slow kinetics, and imbalanced adsorption&#8208;desorption steps are the bottleneck for its scale&#8208;up implementation. Herein, a rare&#8208;earth Terbium single atom (TbSA) is topologically stabilized on defect&#8208;rich Co3O4 (TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4) by Tb&#9472;O co&#8208;ordination for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and H2 evolution reaction (HER). Benefitting from the strong TbSA interaction with the d&#8208;Co3O4, the TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4 achieves a 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density at 1.27&#160;V and &#8722;35&#160;mV for UOR and HER, respectively. Remarkably, when TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4 is applied as a bi&#8208;functional catalyst in a two&#8208;electrode system, it merely requires 1.22&#160;V to acquire 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with excellent operational stability for 100 h. The hybrid electrolyzer can be successfully empowered by the triboelectric nanogenerator, AA battery, and solar panel with a nominal potential of 1.5&#160;V. The mechanistic investigation predicts &#8220;TbSA&#8221; insertion in d&#8208;Co3O4 lowered the potential determining step, attributed to balanced reaction energetics for adsorption&#8208;desorption of intermediates and favorable charge transfer characteristics for UOR. This work offers a new paradigm to explore the catalytic properties of rare&#8208;earth &#8220;f&#8208;block&#8221; elements to create advanced electrocatalysts via structural modulation.

         <title>Reversible Configurations of 3&#8208;Coordinate and 4&#8208;Coordinate Boron Stabilize Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni Cathodes with Superior Cycling Stability for Practical Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

This work demonstrates a Li2SiO3&#8208;coated Li(Ni0.95Co0.04Mn0.01)0.99B0.01O2 ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode, delivering a high reversible capacity and superior cycling stability. This is the first time to realize the real B&#8208;doping, which exists in terms of 3&#8208;coordinate and 4&#8208;coordinate configurations with high electrochemical reversibility during de&#8208;/lithiation, greatly stabilizing oxygen anions and impeding Ni&#8208;ion migration with high structure stability and rapid Li&#8208;ion diffusion.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathodes are the leading candidate for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and ultrahigh capacity. However, the increased Ni content causes larger volume variations and worse lattice oxygen stability during cycling, resulting in capacity attenuation and kinetics hysteresis. Herein, a Li2SiO3&#8208;coated Li(Ni0.95Co0.04Mn0.01)0.99B0.01O2 ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode that well&#8208;addresses all the above issues, which is also the first time to realize the real doping of B ions is demonstrated. The as&#8208;obtained cathode delivers a reversible capacity of up to 237.4 mAh g&#8722;1 (924 Wh kg&#8722;1cathode) and a superior capacity retention of 84.2% after 500 cycles at 1C in pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cells. Advanced characterizations and calculations verify that the boron&#8208;doping is existed in terms of 3&#8208;coordinate and 4&#8208;coordinate configurations and their high electrochemical reversibility during de&#8208;/lithiation, which greatly stabilizes oxygen anions and impedes Ni&#8208;ion migration to Li layer. Furthermore, the B&#8208;doping engineers the primary particle microstructure for better relaxing the lattice strain and accelerating Li&#8208;ion diffusion. This work advances the energy density of cathode materials into the domain of above 900&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and the concept will inspire more intensive study on ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Thermally Superinsulating Polyhexahydrotriazine Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple one&#8208;step synthesis of closed&#8208;loop recyclable PHT aerogels is presented, which are made from commercially available aromatic amines and PFA. These PHT aerogels display thermal superinsulation, pronounced thermal stability, great mechanical performance, and intrinsic hydrophobicity. Furthermore, PHT aerogels can be depolymerized under acidic aqueous conditions, allowing the monomers to be reused to prepare fresh aerogels.








Abstract
Organic aerogels are an advanced class of materials renowned for their ultralow thermal conductivity and highly porous architecture, making them ideal for applications in thermal insulation, catalysis, and chemical absorption. However, these polymeric networks pose environmental concerns as their permanently crosslinked scaffold makes recycling back to the original monomers virtually impossible. To tackle this issue and develop next&#8208;generation organic aerogel, a set of polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT)&#160;aerogels specifically designed for closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling are prepared. Remarkably, these innovative materials can selectively be synthesized in a one&#8208;step condensation reaction using commercially available aromatic amines. They showcase outstanding thermally insulating performance, along with strong mechanical performance, pronounced thermal stability, and intrinsic hydrophobicity, all achieved without the need for additional modifications. More importantly, these aerogels exhibit quantitative depolymerization under acidic aqueous conditions, achieving high yields and purities of the recovered monomers. The successful preparation of fresh organic aerogels from recycled monomers with nearly identical material properties underscores the efficiency and reliability of this recycling process. The facile one&#8208;step synthesis process, combined with the high&#8208;performance properties and excellent recyclability of these PHT aerogels, accelerates the advancement of sustainable thermally superinsulating materials.

         <title>Anomalously High Apparent Young's Modulus of Ultrathin Freestanding PZT Films Revealed by Machine Learning Empowered Nanoindentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neural network machine learning model is developed to accurately determine the Young's modulus, pretension, and thickness of freestanding films from nanoindentation force&#8211;displacement curves, with which anomalously high Young's modulus is discovered of ultrathin PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) film as large as 229.4 &#177; 12.1 GPa. The enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric effect, and the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient is estimated to be &#8776; 200 nC&#160;m&#8722;1.








Abstract
The mechanical properties at small length scales are not only significant for understanding the intriguing size&#8208;dependent behaviors but also critical for device applications. Nanoindentation via atomic force microscopy is widely used for small&#8208;scale mechanical testing, yet determining the Young's modulus of quasi&#8208;2D films from freestanding force&#8211;displacement curve of nanoindentation remains challenging, complicated by both bending and stretching that are highly nonlinear.

&lt;p&gt;A neural network machine learning model is developed to accurately determine the Young's modulus, pretension, and thickness of freestanding films from nanoindentation force&#8211;displacement curves, with which anomalously high Young's modulus is discovered of ultrathin PbZr&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PZT) film as large as 229.4 &#177; 12.1 GPa. The enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric effect, and the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient is estimated to be &#8776; 200 nC&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanical properties at small length scales are not only significant for understanding the intriguing size-dependent behaviors but also critical for device applications. Nanoindentation via atomic force microscopy is widely used for small-scale mechanical testing, yet determining the Young's modulus of quasi-2D films from freestanding force&#8211;displacement curve of nanoindentation remains challenging, complicated by both bending and stretching that are highly nonlinear. To overcome these difficulties, a machine learning model is developed based on the back propagation (BP) neural network and finite element training to accurately determine the Young's modulus, pretension, and thickness of freestanding films from nanoindentation force&#8211;displacement curves simultaneously, improving the computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude over conventional brute force curve fitting. Using this technique, anomalously high apparent Young's modulus is discovered of 2.8&#160;nm thick PbZr&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PZT) film as large as 229.4&#160;&#177;&#160;12.1&#160;GPa, much higher than the bulk value. The enhancement can be attributed to the strain gradient-induced flexoelectric effect, and the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient is estimated to be &#8776;200&#160;nC&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Engineered Biomimetic Cancer Cell Membrane Nanosystems Trigger Gas&#8208;Immunometabolic Therapy for Spinal&#8208;Metastasized Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) generated by MP@AL&#8208;mediated gas&#8208;immunometabolic therapy inhibited tumor cell respiration, on the one hand, to ensure the continuation of the lactate depletion response and reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, and on the other hand, NO&#8208;induced tumor immunogenic cell death, synergistically stimulating the immune response and amplifying the efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Despite great progress in enhancing tumor immunogenicity, conventional gas therapy cannot effectively reverse the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME), limiting immunotherapy. The development of therapeutic gases that are tumor microenvironment responsive and efficiently reverse the TIME for precisely targeted tumor gas&#8208;immunometabolic therapy remains a great challenge. In this study, a novel cancer cell membrane&#8208;encapsulated pH&#8208;responsive nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing biomimetic nanosystem (MP@AL) is prepared. Lactate oxidase (Lox) in MP@AL consumed oxygen to promote the decomposition of lactate, a metabolic by&#8208;product of tumor glycolysis, and the generation of H2O2, while L&#8208;arginine (L&#8208;Arg) in MP@AL is oxidized by H2O2 to generate nitric oxide (NO). For one thing, NO led to mitochondrial dysfunction in tumor cells to reduce oxygen consumption and promote the efficiency of Lox in lactate decomposition, thus reversing lactate&#8208;induced TIME; for another, NO effectively triggered immunogenic cell death, activated anti&#8208;tumor immune response and long&#8208;term immune memory, and ensured a favorable effect in the synergistic interaction with PD&#8208;L1 antibody for inhibiting tumor growth and recurrence. Therefore, a novel gas&#8208;immunometabolic therapy dual closed&#8208;loop nanosystem for enhancing tumor immunogenicity and remodeling lactate&#8208;induced TIME is established. Overall, this work will provide new ideas for gas therapy to effectively remodel the TIME to enhance cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Congruent Glass Composite Scintillator for Efficient High&#8208;Energy Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The congruent glass composite scintillator with good processing capability&#160;and high scintillation light yield is constructed, which solves the problem of poor preparation and processing properties of scintillation single crystal and ceramic. The constructed glass composite scintillator is further verified in applications such as X&#8208;ray imaging and real&#8208;time radiation detection of fibers. These findings not only represent a novel design concept for the development of glass composite but also suggest a great step for expanding the scope of scintillators.








Abstract
The scintillator is the most crucial component in the high&#8208;energy ray detection system. The available scintillators suffer from the insurmountable drawbacks including poor shaping ability for single crystal and ceramic and low efficiency for glass. Here, a glass composite scintillator is proposed from a congruent crystallization system which possesses both excellent processability and high scintillating yield. It can be fabricated into diverse shapes and sizes including the bulk and tiny fiber. Benefitting from the unique compositing combination with a high crystallization ratio, the glass composite exhibits a giant scintillating light yield of &#8776;26,000 photons per MeV. The practical application for X&#8208;ray imaging is demonstrated and a high spatial resolution of 12 l&#160;p&#160;mm&#8722;1 is achieved. Furthermore, the fiber derived detector is built and the remote and micro&#8208;area detection is realized. These findings not only represent a novel design concept for the development of glass composite but also suggest a great step for expanding the scope of scintillators.

         <title>Dynamic Transition Metal Network via Orbital Population Design Stabilizes Lattice Oxygen Redox in Stoichiometric Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordered transition metal (TM) network is crucial for the activity and reversibility of lattice oxygen in batteries. A t2g orbital population rule is proposed to guide the design of ordered TM networks, supported by calculated structures and the synthesized ordered TM oxides reported. This work establishes a promising pathway for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes by controlling TM ordering.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries employing stoichiometric layered Li metal oxides as cathodes are now reaching the energy density limits due to single cationic redox chemistry. Lattice oxygen redox (LOR) has been discovered in these materials, as a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density paradigm observed in Li&#8208;rich materials. Nevertheless, the origin of this process is not understood, preventing the rational design of better cathode materials. Here, employing stoichiometric Ni&#8208;based cathodes, it is demonstrated that LOR originates from a dynamic transition metal (TM) network caused by ion migration during the electrochemical process. This network is confirmed to be ribbon through both ex&#8208; and in&#8208;situ STEM observations, facilitating reversible LOR. Finally, a t2g orbital population rule is proposed to guide the design of ordered TM networks, supported by calculated structures and the synthesized ordered TM oxides reported. This work explains the mechanism of LOR in stoichiometric layered cathode materials, and sets a promising direction for the design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes through the regulation of TM ordering.

         <title>Superhydrophobicity With Self&#8208;Adaptive Water Pressure Resistance and Adhesion of Pistia Stratiotes Leaf</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pistia stratiotes leaf exhibits superhydrophobicity with high water pressure resistance and low adhesion, attributed to its self&#8208;adaptive deformable microstructure with unique re&#8208;entrant features. Under pressure, these microstructures deform to increase the solid&#8208;liquid contact area, enhancing water pressure resistance. The re&#8208;entrant features elevate the deformation threshold, enabling an effective adaptive response.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces are promising for optimizing amphibious aircraft by minimizing water drag and adhesion. Achieving this involves ensuring these surfaces can resist high liquid pressure caused by deep water and fluid flow. Maximizing the solid&#8208;liquid contact area is a common strategy to improve liquid pressure resistance. However, this approach inevitably increases solid&#8208;liquid adhesion, making it challenging to guarantee a trade&#8208;off between the two wetting characteristics. Here, it is found that the Pistia stratiotes leaf exhibits superhydrophobicity with high water pressure resistance and low adhesion, attributed to its self&#8208;adaptive deformable microstructure with unique re&#8208;entrant features. Under pressure, these microstructures deform to increase the solid&#8208;liquid contact area, thereby enhancing water pressure resistance. The re&#8208;entrant features elevate the deformation threshold, enabling higher modulus microstructures to achieve adaptive response. This facilitates the recovery of deformed microstructures, restoring the air layer and maintaining low adhesion. Following these concepts, Pistia stratiotes leaf&#8208;inspired surfaces are fabricated, achieving an 183% improvement in water impact resistance and an &#8776;80% reduction in adhesion after overpressure compared to conventional superhydrophobic surfaces. The design principles inspired by Pistia stratiotes promise significant advancements in amphibious aircraft and other trans&#8208;media vehicles.

The design principles inspired by &lt;i&gt;Pistia stratiotes&lt;/i&gt; promise significant advancements in amphibious aircraft and other trans-media vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Device Ballistic&#8208;Electron&#8208;Emission Spectroscopy for Accurately In Situ Mapping Energy Level Alignment at Metal&#8211;Organic Semiconductors Interface</title>

         <dc:description>
A precise in situ method&#8212;employing in&#8208;device ballistic&#8208;electron&#8208;emission spectroscopy with hot&#8208;electron transistor configuration&#8212;is presented for detecting energy barriers at metal/organic semiconductor interfaces, achieving an accuracy of &#177;0.03&#160;eV. This technique is applicable to n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type and ambipolar semiconductors and can detect subtle barrier changes caused by film treatment processes, providing a reliable tool for organic electronics.








Abstract
Energy level alignment at metal/organic semiconductors (OSCs) interface governs electronic processes in organic electronics devices, making its precise determination essential for understanding carrier transport behaviors and optimizing device performance. However, it is proven that accurately characterizing the energy barrier at metal/OSC interface under operational conditions remains challenging due to the technical limitations of traditional methods. Herein, through integrating highly&#8208;improved device constructions with an ingenious derivative&#8208;assisted data processing method, this study demonstrates an in&#8208;device ballistic&#8208;electron&#8208;emission spectroscopy using hot&#8208;electron transistors to accurately characterize the energy barrier at metal/OSC interface under in&#8208;operando conditions. This technique is found that a remarkable improvement in measurement accuracy, reaching up to &#177;0.03&#160;eV, can be achieved&#8212;surpassing previous techniques (&#177;0.1&#8211;0.2&#160;eV). The high accuracy allows us to monitor subtle changes in energy barriers at metal/OSC interface caused by variations in the aggregation state of OSCs, a phenomenon that is theoretically possible but failed to be directly demonstrated through conventional methods. Moreover, this study makes demonstration that this technology is universally applicable to various metal/OSC interfaces consisting of electron&#8208;transporting, hole&#8208;transporting, and ambipolar OSCs. These findings manifest the great potential of this method to advance both theoretical exploration and technical applications in organic electronics.

         <title>In Situ Encapsulation of Atomically Precise Nanoclusters in Reticular Frameworks via Mechanochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical synthesis approach to encapsulate atomically precise nanoclusters (APNCs) in reticular frameworks in a controlled manner is proposed. This method significantly broadens the range of APNC@framework composites, facilitating the on&#8208;demand construction and regulation of component&#8208;specific nanocomposites.








Abstract
The combination of atomically precise nanoclusters (APNCs) and reticular frameworks is promising for generating component&#8208;specific nanocomposites with emergent properties. However, traditional liquid&#8208;phase synthesis often hampers this potential by damaging APNCs and limiting combination diversity. Here, mechanochemical synthesis to explore the encapsulation of diverse oil&#8208; and water&#8208;soluble APNCs within various reticular frameworks is employed, establishing a database of 21 unique APNC&#8722;framework combinations, including metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8722;organic frameworks (COFs), hydrogen&#8722;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), and multivariate MOFs. These framework coatings not only spatially immobilize APNCs but also secure their structures, preventing aggregation and degradation while enhancing stability and activity. Encapsulating Au25 in HOFs resulted in a remarkable 315&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity compared to Au25 homogeneous catalyst, highlighting the framework's crucial role in catalytic enhancement. The mechanochemical synthesis strategy facilitates tailored support screening, catering to specific needs, and shows promise for developing multifunctional systems, including enzyme&#8722;APNC@frameworks material for cascade reactions.

         <title>Three&#8208;Level Chirality Transfer and Amplification in Liquid Crystal Supramolecular Assembly for Achieving Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;level chirality transfer and amplification from point chirality of small molecules to helical chirality of helical polymers and finally to supramolecular chirality of cholesteric liquid crystals consisting of chiral nonfluorescent polymers and nematic liquid crystals is constructed. Full&#8208;color and white CPL are realized via further introducing achiral fluorophores. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting security, information encryption, and chiral logic gate applications are developed.








Abstract
Chiral liquid crystal supramolecular assembly provides an ideal strategy for constructing excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. However, the chirality transfer in chiral liquid crystals normally occurs at two levels from the configurational chirality to the supramolecular phase chirality. The more precise and more levels of chirality transmission are fascinating but remain challenging. The present work reports the first success of three&#8208;level chirality transfer and amplification from configurationally point chirality of small molecules to conformationally helical chirality of helical polymers and finally to supramolecular phase chirality of cholesteric liquid crystals composed of chiral nonfluorescent polymers (P46) and nematic liquid crystals. Noticeably, the helical twisting power of P46 is five&#8208;fold larger than its monomer. Full&#8208;color and white CPL with maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor up to 1.54 and photoluminescence quantum yield up to 63.8% are realized utilizing helical supramolecular assembly combined with selective reflection mechanism. Also significantly, the electrically stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL switching device as well as anti&#8208;counterfeiting security, information encryption, and chiral logic gate applications are developed. This study deepens the understanding of chirality transfer and amplification across different hierarchical levels.

         <title>Augmenting Protein Degradation Capacity of PROTAC through Energy Metabolism Regulation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is presented to augment the protein degradation capability of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) by modulating external nutrient supply and employing nanocarrier&#8208;based targeted delivery. The results demonstrate that a reduction in nutrient supply can enhance protein metabolism and significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs when combined with nanocarriers.








Abstract
The ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for degrading over 70&#8211;80% of cellular proteins. Consequently, proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are developed to induce the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins of interest (POIs) by the UPS. To amplify the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs, energy metabolism regulation is first harnessed to boost UPS function in tumor cells. Proteomic and ubiquitinome analyzes reveal that total ubiquitinated proteins and proteasome activity are significantly increased in 143B and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumor cells following fasting&#8208;mimicking diet (FMD) treatment. As a result, the degradation efficiency of PROTACs targeting focal adhesion kinase (FAK&#8208;P) or bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4&#8208;P) is significantly enhanced in FMD&#8208;treated 143B and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumor cells. Then, silica&#8208;coated iron oxide nanoparticles are developed modified with tumor cell membranes for targeted delivery of PROTACs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence imaging confirm that nanocarriers significantly improve the delivery efficiency of PROTACs in FMD&#8208;treated 143B or MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumors. In vivo studies demonstrate that the antitumor efficacy of FAK&#8208;P and BRD4&#8208;P is greatly augmented when combined with targeted delivery and FMD treatment. Overall, this study presents a strategy to enhance the efficacy of PROTACs in cancer therapy.

         <title>Durable Organic Coating&#8208;Free Superhydrophobic Metal Surface by Paracrystalline State Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic coating&#8208;free durable self&#8208;superhydrophobic metal surface is achieved by a strategy of femtosecond laser element doping microstructuring on Al alloys followed by repetitive low&#8208;temperature annealing in this work. This novel design, which endows the metal surface with properties of unique air storage nanostructures, low free energy, and high chemical stability, can effectively avoid disadvantages of traditional sticking organic modifiers to long&#8208;termly keep the extreme water repellency.








Abstract
The chemical instability of traditional organically&#8208;decorated superhydrophobic metal surfaces is a significant issue, severely limiting practical applications. This is due to the susceptibility of low surface energy coatings to ion permeation, decomposition, and exfoliation, especially in harsh environments. Here, organic coating&#8208;free, durable superhydrophobic surfaces on Al alloys by developing the paracrystalline state of a bionic anthill tribe structure is successfully achieved, using femtosecond laser element&#8208;doping microstructuring followed by repetitive annealing processes. Remarkably, the inherent superhydrophobic properties of the sample are maintained for &#8776;2000 h in a corrosive 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution, significantly surpassing the performance of traditional organic coatings. Moreover, this inherent superhydrophobicity remains nearly unchanged, even after rigorous electrochemical reaction measurements. Additional tests involving UV irradiation (&gt;100 h), freezing cycles (&gt;100 cycles), and acid/alkali resistance (&gt;65 h) further demonstrate that the environmental adaptability of the surface far exceeds that of silane&#8208;coated surfaces. Ab initio calculations reveal that the formation of the paracrystalline state reduces surface energy and enhances chemical stability, thereby extending the durability of the superhydrophobic metal. These findings offer a powerful strategy for utilizing atomic&#8208;level structural rearrangements to design inherent superhydrophobic surfaces without the need for organic coatings.

         <title>A Synergistically Enhanced Triboelectric&#8208;Electromagnetic Hybrid Generator Enabled by Multifunctional Amorphous Alloy for Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Powered System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating multifunctional Fe72Si8B20 into the hybrid generator not only increases the output current and current retention of TENG by 28.75% and 85.24%, respectively, but also boosts the output power of EMG by 51.05%. Additionally, the variable impedance system effectively utilizes the output characteristics of TENG and EMG, resulting in a 198% improvement in energy utilization efficiency compared to conventional constant impendence systems.








Abstract
Triboelectric&#8208;electromagnetic hybrid generator (TEHG) has emerged as an effective technology for mechanical energy harvesting. However, the independent operation of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and electromagnetic generator (EMG), along with tribo&#8208;materials wear and magnetic field divergence, constrain the device's overall performance. To address these challenges, a synergistically enhanced TEHG (SE&#8208;TEHG) is proposed based on the multifunctional amorphous alloy. Following detailed material analyses, Fe72Si8B20 is selected as the synergistic layer for its low surface roughness, high Vickers&#8208;hardness, amorphous structure, and high magnetization. Compared to Al, this material not only boosts TENG's output current and current retention rate by 28.75% and 85.24%, but also improves EMG's output power by 51.05%. In constructing a self&#8208;powered system with TEHG, a significant impedance discrepancy exists between the energy harvester (with matched impendence of 16 M&#937; for TENG and 110 k&#937; for EMG) and the application end. Without power management circuits, the demonstrated self&#8208;powered variable impedance system achieves an energy utilization efficiency that is 2.98 times greater than the conventional constant impedance system. The integration of multifunctional materials to realize strong&#8208;coupling hybrid generators, combined with the customization of variable impedance systems, set a milestone in efficient mechanical energy harvesting and utilization.

         <title>Mesoporous Acridinium&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Long&#8208;lived Charge&#8208;Separated Exciton Mediated Photocatalytic [4+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Acridinium&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COFs) featuring systematic trap states is designed to generate charge&#8208;separated excitons with enhanced lifetime. Large 4&#160;nm&#8208;sized mesoporous channels and ultra&#8208;stable excitons resulted in the COF functioning as an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst toward Diels&#8208;Alder type oxidative [4+2] annulation with a million times enhanced interfacial charge dissipation response.








Abstract
Readily tuneable porosity and redox properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) result in highly customizable photocatalysts featuring extended electronic delocalization. However, fast charge recombination in COFs severely limits their photocatalytic activities. Herein a new mode of COF photocatalyst design strategy to introduce systematic trap states is programmed, which aids the formation and stabilization of long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated excitons. Installing cationic acridinium functionality in a pristine electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine COF via postsynthetic modification resulted in a semiconducting photocatalytic donor&#8211;acceptor dyad network that performed rapid and efficient oxidative Diels&#8208;Alder type [4+2] annulation of styrenes and alkynes to fused aromatic compounds under the atmospheric condition in good to excellent yields. Large mesopores of &#8776;4&#160;nm diameter ensured efficient mass flow within the COF channel. It is confirmed that the catalytic performance of COF originates from the ultra&#8208;stable charge&#8208;separated excitons of 1.9&#160;nm diameter with no apparent radiative charge&#8208;recombination pathway, endorsing almost a million times better photo&#8208;response and catalysis than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Doped Facet&#8208;Selective Copper Nanowires for Activating CO&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research reports a nickel&#8208;doped copper nanowire catalyst for highly selective ethanol production from CO electroreduction. The theoretical calculations and operando spectroelectrochemical investigations cooperatively demonstrate that nickel&#8208;doping onto copper surface can regulate the interfacial water structure and water dissociation kinetics, which significantly influences the hydrogenation kinetics of a key C2 intermediate (*CHCOH), and thus leading to a high selectivity switch from ethylene to ethanol.








Abstract
Ethanol isa promising energy vector for closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle through reversible electrochemical redox. Currently, ethanol electrosynthesissuffers from low product selectivity due to the competitive advantage of ethylene in CO2/CO electroreduction. Here, a facet&#8208;selective metal&#8208;doping strategy is reported, tuning the reaction kinetics of CO reduction paths and thus enhancing the ethanol selectivity. The theoretical calculations reveal that nickel (Ni)doped Cu(100) surface facilitates water dissociation to form adsorbed hydrogen, which promotesselective electrochemical hydrogenation of a key C2 intermediate (*CHCOH) toward ethanol path over ethylene path. Experimentally, a solution&#8208;phase synthesis of a Ni&#8208;doped {100}&#8208;dominated Copper nanowires (Cu NWs) catalyst is reported, enabling an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 56% and a selectivity ratio of ethanol to ethylene of 2.7, which are &#8776;4 and 15 times larger than those of undoped Cu NWs, respectively. The operando spectroscopic characterizations&#160;confirm that Ni&#8208;doping in Cu NWs can alter the interfacial water activity and thus regulate the C2 product selectivity. With further electrode engineering, a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer using Ni&#8208;doped Cu NWs catalysts demonstrates an ethanol Faradaic efficiency over 50% at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a full cell voltage of &#8776;2.7&#160;V and operates stably for over 300 h.

         <title>Piezoelectric Heterojunctions as Bacteria&#8208;Killing Bone&#8208;Regenerative Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2/Bi2WO6 piezoelectric heterojunctions with engineered oxygen vacancies, interfacial built&#8208;in electric fields and piezoelectric properties are constructed as bone implants. The heterojunctions achieve highly efficient and dynamic antimicrobial functions through near infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered photothermal and photodynamic therapies. Meanwhile, the mechanical forces of the stem cells grown on the implants trigger the heterojunctions to produce electric fields in situ, significantly promoting osteogenesis.








Abstract
Heterojunctions are widely used in energy conversion, environmental remediation, and photodetection, but have not been fully explored in regenerative medicine. In particular, piezoelectric heterojunctions have never been examined in tissue regeneration. Here the development of piezoelectric heterojunctions is shown to promote bone regeneration while eradicating pathogenic bacteria through light&#8208;cellular force&#8208;electric coupling. Specifically, an array of heterojunctions (TiO2/Bi2WO6), made of piezoelectric nanocrystals (Bi2WO6) decorating TiO2 nanowires, is fabricated as a biocompatible implant. Upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared light, the piezoelectric heterojunctions generate reactive oxygen species and heat to kill bacteria through photodynamic and photothermal therapy, respectively. Meanwhile, the mechanical forces of the stem cells grown on the implant trigger the heterojunctions to produce electric fields that further promote osteogenesis to achieve osteointegration. The heterojunctions effectively suppress postoperative recurrent infections while promoting osseointegration through the local electric fields induced by cells. Therefore, the piezoelectric heterojunctions represent a promising antibacterial tissue&#8208;regenerative implant.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterojunctions are widely used in energy conversion, environmental remediation, and photodetection, but have not been fully explored in regenerative medicine. In particular, piezoelectric heterojunctions have never been examined in tissue regeneration. Here the development of piezoelectric heterojunctions is shown to promote bone regeneration while eradicating pathogenic bacteria through light-cellular force-electric coupling. Specifically, an array of heterojunctions (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), made of piezoelectric nanocrystals (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) decorating TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires, is fabricated as a biocompatible implant. Upon exposure to near-infrared light, the piezoelectric heterojunctions generate reactive oxygen species and heat to kill bacteria through photodynamic and photothermal therapy, respectively. Meanwhile, the mechanical forces of the stem cells grown on the implant trigger the heterojunctions to produce electric fields that further promote osteogenesis to achieve osteointegration. The heterojunctions effectively suppress postoperative recurrent infections while promoting osseointegration through the local electric fields induced by cells.

         <title>Opto&#8208;Electrical Decoupled Phototransistor for Starlight Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study develops a heterojunction&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect transistor (HGFET) based on an opto&#8208;electric decoupling mechanism, designed to suppress noise and enhance sensitivity, enabling starlight detection. The infrared HGFET detector demonstrates a detectivity exceeding 1014 Jones at 1300 nm, with a detectable radiation intensity as low as 0.46 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a maximum speed in tens of microseconds, showing great potential for high&#8208;resolution, cost&#8208;effective passive night vision imaging sensors.








Abstract
Highly sensitive shortwave infrared (SWIR) detectors are essential for detecting weak radiation (typically below 10&#8722;8 W&#183;Sr&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;&#181;m&#8722;1) with high&#8208;end passive image sensors. However, mainstream SWIR detection based on epitaxial photodiodes cannot effectively detect ultraweak infrared radiation due to the lack of inherent gain. Here, we develop a heterojunction&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect transistor (HGFET) consisting of a colloidal quantum dot (CQD)&#8208;based p&#8208;i&#8208;n heterojunction and a carbon nanotube (CNT) field&#8208;effect transistor, which achieves a high inherent gain based on an opto&#8208;electric decoupling mechanism for suppressing noise. The stacked heterojunction absorbs infrared radiation and separates electron&#8211;hole pairs. Then, the generated photovoltage tunes the drain current of the CNT FET through an Y2O3 gate insulator. As a result, the HGFET significantly detects and amplifies SWIR signals with a high inherent gain while minimally amplifying noise, leading to a recorded specific detectivity above 1014&#8201;Jones at 1300&#160;nm and a recorded maximum gain&#8208;bandwidth product of 69.2 THz. Direct comparative testing indicates that the HGFET can detect weak infrared radiation at 0.46 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2 levels; thus, compared to commercial and reported SWIR detectors, this detector is much more sensitive and enables starlight detection or vision. As the fabrication process is very compatible with CMOS readout integrated circuits, the HGFET is a promising SWIR detector for realizing passive night vision imaging sensors with high resolutions that are high&#8208;end, highly sensitive, and inexpensive.

         <title>Balanced Miscibility and Crystallinity by 2D Acceptors Enabled Halogen&#8208;Free Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells to Achieve 19.28% Efficiency</title>

Linear and branch side chains on chemical structures lead to the unique crystal structures of the elliptical and rectangular frameworks, respectively. The difference in intermolecular interaction significantly impacts the self&#8208;aggregation tendency and compatibility with a guest acceptor. It found that excessive crystallinity with great self&#8208;aggregation negatively affected molecular packing, while a moderate crystalline collaborated well with the guest acceptor and achieved a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of 19.28% based on scalable and stable halogen&#8208;free solvent&#8208;processed organic solar cells.








Abstract
Two highly crystalline 2D acceptors, ATIC&#8208;C11 and ATIC&#8208;BO, with acenaphthene&#8208;expanded quinoxaline central cores, have been demonstrated with very different characteristics in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). The difference in side chains induces their distinctive molecular packing mode and unique crystal structure, in which ATIC&#8208;C11 displays a 3D structure with an elliptical framework, and ATIC&#8208;BO gives a rectangular framework. Their high crystallinity contributes to organized molecular packing in ternary devices, thus low energetic disorder and suppressed energy loss. Through the analysis of morphology and carrier kinetics, it is found that ATIC&#8208;BO's strong self&#8208;aggregation and immiscibility induce large aggregates and severely impede charge transfer (CT) and dissociation. Conversely, ATIC&#8208;C11's suitable crystallinity and compatibility positively regulate the crystalline kinetics during film formation, thus forming much&#8208;ordered molecular packing and favorable phase separation size in blend films. As a result, ATIC&#8208;C11&#8208;based ternary devices achieve a high efficiency of 19.28% with potential in scalability and stability, which is the top&#8208;ranking efficiency among nonhalogenated solvent&#8208;processed OSCs. This work not only displays highly efficient and stable halogen&#8208;free solvent&#8208;processed organic photovoltaics (OPVs), but also offers a new thought for material design and selection rule on the third component in highly efficient ternary OSCs.

Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN), an innovative material for ferroelectric memory applications, is scaled down to an ultra&#8208;thin thickness of 3 nm while maintaining compatibility with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor fabrication standards, marking a notable breakthrough in the field. Moreover, reducing the operating voltage to 4.35 V represents a significant milestone in advancing low&#8208;voltage AlScN&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) has emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation ferroelectric memories, offering a much higher remanent charge density than other materials with a stable ferroelectric phase. However, the inherently high coercive field requires a substantial decrease in film thickness to lower the operating voltage. Significant leakage currents present a severe challenge during the thickness scaling, especially when maintaining compatibility with complementary&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication standards. This study adopts a HfN0.4 bottom electrode, which minimizes lattice mismatch with Al0.7Sc0.3N (ASN), forming a coherent bottom interface that effectively reduces leakage currents even at thickness &lt;&#160;5&#160;nm. CMOS&#8208;compatible HfN0.4/ASN/TiN stack, deposited without vacuum break between each layer, demonstrates exceptional scalability, confirming the ferroelectricity of ASN films at thicknesses down to 3&#160;nm. The coercive voltage is decreased to 4.35&#160;V, significantly advancing low&#8208;voltage AlScN devices that align with CMOS standards.

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of Orientation and Steric Hindrance Induced by Alkyl Chain Length in Ammonium Salt Passivator Toward High&#8208;performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic ammonium salts with varying alkyl chain lengths are used to passivate perovskite surface defects and optimize energy band alignment. Nonylammonium acetate (NAAc) achieves superior passivation through optimal molecular orientation and minimized steric hindrance, leading to 25.79% PCE in inverted PSCs utilizing vacuum flash technology in ambient conditions.









Abstract
Organic ammonium salts are extensively utilized for passivating surface defects in perovskite films to mitigate trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. However, the influence of alkyl chain length on the molecular orientation and spatial steric hindrance of ammonium salt remains underexplored, hindering advancements in more effective passivators. Here, a series of organic ammonium salts is reported with varying alkyl chain lengths to passivate surface defects and optimize band alignment. It is revealed that long alkyl chains promote parallel molecular orientation on the perovskite surface, thereby reinforcing interaction with surface defects, whereas excessive chain length introduces steric hindrance, weakening anion&#8208;perovskite interactions. Nonylammonium acetate (NAAc) with optimal chain length achieves the ideal balance between chemical interactions, resulting in superior passivation.

This marks a record PCE for inverted PSCs utilizing vacuum flash technology in ambient conditions. Additionally, the NAAc&#8208;passivated devices retain 91% of their initial PCE after 1200&#160;h of continuous maximum power point operation.

&lt;p&gt;Organic ammonium salts with varying alkyl chain lengths are used to passivate perovskite surface defects and optimize energy band alignment. Nonylammonium acetate (NAAc) achieves superior passivation through optimal molecular orientation and minimized steric hindrance, leading to 25.79% PCE in inverted PSCs utilizing vacuum flash technology in ambient conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic ammonium salts are extensively utilized for passivating surface defects in perovskite films to mitigate trap-assisted nonradiative recombination. However, the influence of alkyl chain length on the molecular orientation and spatial steric hindrance of ammonium salt remains underexplored, hindering advancements in more effective passivators. Here, a series of organic ammonium salts is reported with varying alkyl chain lengths to passivate surface defects and optimize band alignment. It is revealed that long alkyl chains promote parallel molecular orientation on the perovskite surface, thereby reinforcing interaction with surface defects, whereas excessive chain length introduces steric hindrance, weakening anion-perovskite interactions. Nonylammonium acetate (NAAc) with optimal chain length achieves the ideal balance between chemical interactions, resulting in superior passivation. Through NAAc passivation, high-performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules are achieved, with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 25.79% (certified 25.12%) and 19.62%, respectively. This marks a record PCE for inverted PSCs utilizing vacuum flash technology in ambient conditions. Additionally, the NAAc-passivated devices retain 91% of their initial PCE after 1200&#160;h of continuous maximum power point operation. This work offers new insights into the interplay between molecular orientation and steric hindrance, advancing the design of high-performance PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing 3D Crosslinked Macromolecular Networks as a Highly Efficient Interface Layer for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D macromolecular network consisting of zinc ion&#8208;bonded potato starch (StZ) is constructed as an interface layer for Zn metal anode. The StZ network provides abundant Zn2+ transport channels and facilitates Zn2+ desolvation, enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition while minimizing parasitic reactions. This approach offers an efficient strategy for achieving excellent electrochemical performance in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are experiencing rapid development due to their high theoretical capacity, abundant zinc resources, and intrinsic safety. However, the progress of AZIBs is hindered by uncontrollable parasitic reactions and excessive dendrite growth, which compromise the durability and effective utilization of zinc metal anodes. To address these challenges, the study has constructed a 3D crosslinked macromolecular network composed of zinc ion&#8208;bonded potato starch (StZ) as an interface layer on Zn foil (StZ&#8208;Zn) to inhibit hydrogen evolution, regulate Zn2+ flux, and ensure uniform Zn deposition. Density functional theory calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, COMSOL Multiphysics simulations, and in situ Raman spectra demonstrate that the 3D StZ interface layer facilitates Zn2+ desolvation by restructuring the solvation shells. This process reduces the concentration of H2O at the anode, thereby inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction. Consequently, Zn2+ transport is more efficient, promoting a homogeneous Zn2+ flux and enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. As a result, StZ&#8208;Zn||StZ&#8208;Zn symmetric cell delivers a superb lifespan of 4800 h at the current density of 5 mA cm&#8722;2, and the corresponding cumulative capacity is as high as 12000 mAh cm&#8722;2. Notably, StZ&#8208;Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cell can stably operate for 2500 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1 with an outstanding capacity retention of 92%.

         <title>Adaptable Hydrogel with Strong Adhesion of Wet Tissue for Long&#8208;Term Protection of Periodontitis Wound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prime challenge in hydrogel treatment of periodontitis is short retention. An in situ light&#8208;curing hydrogel is designed to achieve long&#8208;term protection of periodontal wounds. A paste precursor is configured to achieve stayability before curing, and rapid light&#8208;curing achieves strong adhesion between hydrogel and tissue. This design concept provides a promising solution for novel long&#8208;lasting oral medical hydrogel dressings.









Abstract
Periodontitis is a severe gum infection characterized by inflammation of the tissues surrounding the teeth. The disease is challenging to manage due to its exposure to a wet and dynamic oral environment, where conventional hydrogels often suffer from weak adhesion, short residence time, and vulnerability to bacterial invasion. In this study, an innovative hydrogel system based on in situ light curing is proposed. The hydrogel precursor, comprising sodium alginate and a calcium ion network, is designed and adhere to the irregular and smooth surfaces of periodontal tissue before curing. Upon light irradiation, a second network polymerizes rapidly, establishing multiple interactions with the tissue, which enhances adhesion strength. Benefited from this engineering strategy, the hydrogel&#160;exhibits a low swelling rate, effectively mitigating adhesion loss in the moist oral environment. Additionally, the hydrogel demonstrates excellent long&#8208;lasting wet adhesion, maintaining its presence in periodontal tissue over 120 hours. It also serves as an effective physical barrier against bacterial invasion, achieving a blocking efficiency of 99.9%. This novel design concept offers a promising approach for developing advanced medical dressings for periodontitis, providing sustained therapeutic benefits.

         <title>Multifunctional Biocomposite Materials from Chlorella vulgaris Microalgae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fabrication and post&#8208;processing technique is introduced to achieve uniform, lightweight, biocomposites based on C. vulgaris through extrusion 3Dprinting. The bioink formulation and dehydration process yield materials with mechanical properties and thermal conductivity comparable to traditional polymer and wood&#8208;based composites. This approach can be adapted to using other microalgae for large&#8208;scale production, in response to increasing global material demand.








Abstract
Extrusion 3D&#8208;printing of biopolymers and natural fiber&#8208;based biocomposites enables the fabrication of complex structures, ranging from implants' scaffolds to eco&#8208;friendly structural materials. However, conventional polymer extrusion requires high energy consumption to reduce viscosity, and natural fiber reinforcement often requires harsh chemical treatments to improve adhesion. We address these challenges by introducing a sustainable framework to fabricate natural biocomposites using Chlorella vulgaris microalgae as the matrix. Through bioink optimization and process refinement, we produced lightweight, multifunctional materials with hierarchical architectures. Infrared spectroscopy analysis reveals that hydrogen bonding plays a critical role in the binding and reinforcement of Chlorella cells by hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). As water content decreases, the hydrogen bonding network evolves from water&#8208;mediated interactions to direct hydrogen bonds between HEC and Chlorella, enhancing the mechanical properties. A controlled dehydration process maintains continuous microalgae morphology, preventing cracking. The resulting biocomposites exhibit a bending stiffness of 1.6 GPa and isotropic heat transfer and thermal conductivity of 0.10 W/mK at room temperature, demonstrating effective thermal insulation. These characteristics make Chlorella biocomposites promising candidates for applications requiring both structural performance and thermal insulation, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional materials in response to growing environmental demands.

         <title>Graphene Readout Silicon&#8208;Based Microtube Photodetectors for Encrypted Visible Light Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale graphene&#8208;readout silicon&#8208;based microtube photodetectors are designed for Mbps&#8208;level visible light communication reception. The device enable effective photodetection and rapid readout, resulting in a 75&#160;ns response time and 6803&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 responsivity. The photodetector achieves a 140&#176; field of view and dichroic ratio up to 16.09, offering the potential in internet of things and information security.








Abstract
The implementation of an advanced light receiver is imperative for the widespread application of visible light communication. However, the integration of multifunctional and high&#8208;performance visible light receivers is still limited by device structure and system complexity. Herein, a graphene&#8208;readout silicon&#8208;based microtube photodetector is proposed as the receiver for omnidirectional Mbps&#8208;level visible light communication. The integration of graphene&#8208;semiconductor material systems simultaneously ensures the effective absorption of incident light and rapid readout of photogenerated carriers, and the device exhibits an ultrafast response speed of 75&#160;ns and high responsivity of 6803&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1. In addition, the microtube photodetector realizes the omnidirectional light&#8208;trapping and enhanced polarization photodetection. As the receiving end of the visible light communication system, the microtube photodetector achieves a data rate of up to 778&#160;Mbps, a field of view of 140&#176;, and the encrypted visible light communication of polarized light, providing a new possibility for the future development of the internet of things and information security.

The integration of graphene-semiconductor material systems simultaneously ensures the effective absorption of incident light and rapid readout of photogenerated carriers, and the device exhibits an ultrafast response speed of 75&#160;ns and high responsivity of 6803&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, the microtube photodetector realizes the omnidirectional light-trapping and enhanced polarization photodetection. As the receiving end of the visible light communication system, the microtube photodetector achieves a data rate of up to 778&#160;Mbps, a field of view of 140&#176;, and the encrypted visible light communication of polarized light, providing a new possibility for the future development of the internet of things and information security.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Pressure&#8208;Sensitive, Repositionable Bioadhesive for Instant, Atraumatic Surgical Application on Internal Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
While ubiquitous in everyday life, pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (e.g., scotch tape) are limited to dry surfaces. By integrating hydrogels and pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives, a pressure&#8208;sensitive bioadhesive that adheres to internal organs is fabricated. The unique adhesive properties of pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives enable the atraumatic interfacing between surgical equipment and internal tissues for tissue stabilization and fault&#8208;tolerant integration of bioelectronics.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives are widely utilized due to their instant and reversible adhesion to various dry substrates. Though offering intuitive and robust attachment of medical devices on skin, currently available clinical pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives do not attach to internal organs, mainly due to the presence of interfacial water on the tissue surface that acts as a barrier to adhesion. In this work, a pressure&#8208;sensitive, repositionable bioadhesive (PSB) that adheres to internal organs by synergistically combining the characteristic viscoelastic properties of pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives and the interfacial behavior of hydrogel bioadhesives, is introduced. Composed of a viscoelastic copolymer, the PSB absorbs interfacial water to enable instant adhesion on wet internal organs, such as the heart and lungs, and removal after use without causing any tissue damage. The PSB's capabilities in diverse on&#8208;demand surgical and analytical scenarios including tissue stabilization of soft organs and the integration of bioelectronic devices in rat and porcine models, are demonstrated.

         <title>Photocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Acetylene to Polymer&#8208;Grade Ethylene with Molecular and Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Cobaloximes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel photocatalytic systems based on homogeneous and heterogeneous cobaloximes are reported. By leveraging their hydrogen atom transfer catalytic activity, exquisitely efficient and selective acetylene photocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation is reported. Integrating the cobaloximes in a metal&#8211;organic framework results in more stable and durable catalysis.








Abstract
The semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene&#8208;rich gas streams is a high&#8208;priority industrial chemical reaction for producing polymer&#8208;grade ethylene. Traditional thermocatalytic routes for acetylene reduction to ethylene, despite progress, still require high temperatures and high H2 consumption, possess relatively low selectivity, and use a noble metal catalyst. Light&#8208;powered strategies are starting to emerge, given that they have the potential to use directly the abundant and sustainable solar irradiation, but are ineffective. Here an efficient, &gt;99.9% selective, visible&#8208;light powered, catalytic conversion of acetylene to ethylene is reported. The catalyst is a homogeneous molecular cobaloxime that operates in tandem with a photosensitizer at room temperature and bypasses the use of non&#8208;environmentally friendly and flammable H2 gas feed. The reaction proceeds through a cobalt&#8208;hydride intermediate with &#8776;100% conversion of acetylene under competitive (ethylene co&#8208;feed) conditions after only 50 min, and with no evolution of H2 or over&#8208;hydrogenation to ethane. The cobaloxime is further incorporated as a linker in a metal&#8211;organic framework; the result is a heterogeneous catalyst for the conversion of acetylene under competitive (ethylene co&#8208;feed) conditions that can be recycled up to six times and remains catalytically active for 48 h, before significant loss of performance is observed.

         <title>Unlocking Topological Effects in Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three fully conjugated 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs with distinct topologies are designed and synthesized for efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production. The topological effects play a crucial role in regulating the charge carrier dynamics in COFs. The hxl topology significantly enhances charge separation and transport, achieving an unprecedented 1.41% efficiency for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic H2O2 production in COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a compelling platform for the efficient photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Constructed with diverse topologies from various molecular building units, COFs can exhibit unique photocatalytic properties. In this study, three &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs with distinctly different topologies (hcb, sql, and hxl) are designed to investigate the topological effect on the overall photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen. Despite their similar chemical and band structures, the QP&#8208;HPTP&#8208;COF with hxl topology outperformed other COFs in the photosynthesis of H2O2, demonstrating a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.41%. Comprehensive characterizations confirmed that the hxl topology can substantially improve charge separation and transfer, thereby significantly enhancing photocatalytic performance. This study not only unravels the topology&#8208;directed charge carrier dynamics in COFs but also establishes a molecular engineering framework for developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for sustainable H2O2 production.

         <title>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)&#8208;Inspired Fully Printed Soft Pressure Sensor Array with Self&#8208;Adaptive Pressurization for Highly Reliable Individualized Long&#8208;Term Pulse Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by pulse diagnosis methods in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this work reports a self&#8208;adaptive pressure sensing platform (PSP) that combines the fully printed flexible pressure sensor array with an adaptive wristband&#8208;style pressure system to enable 3D reconstruction of the pulse.








Abstract
Reliable, non&#8208;invasive, continuous monitoring of pulse and blood pressure is essential for the prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. However, the pulse wave varies drastically among individuals or even over time in the same individual, presenting significant challenges for the existing pulse sensing systems. Inspired by pulse diagnosis methods in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this work reports a self&#8208;adaptive pressure sensing platform (PSP) that combines the fully printed flexible pressure sensor array with an adaptive wristband&#8208;style pressure system can identify the optimal pulse signal. Besides the detected pulse rate/width/length, &#8220;Cun, Guan, Chi&#8221; position, and &#8220;floating, moderate, sinking&#8221; pulse features, the PSP combined with a machine learning&#8208;based linear regression model can also accurately predict blood pressure such as systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure values. The developed diagnostic platform is demonstrated for highly reliable long&#8208;term monitoring and analysis of pulse and blood pressure across multiple human subjects over time. The design concept and proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept demonstrations also pave the way for the future developments of flexible sensing devices/systems for adaptive individualized monitoring in the complex practical environments for personalized medicine, along with the support for the development of digital TCM.

         <title>Standing 1D Chains Enable Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Selenium Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate&#8208;heating strategy is adopted to facilitate the interfacial bonding between Se and substrate, enabling the growth of Se films with a vertical orientation. The resulting Se films exhibit a 4&#8208;times increase in carrier mobility compared to horizontally&#8208;oriented Se films. Solar cells fabricated using these Se films achieve a record efficiency of 8.1%.








Abstract
The recent surge in tandem solar cells and indoor photovoltaics has renewed interest in selenium (Se), the world's first photovoltaic material, due to its intrinsic wide bandgap of &#8776;1.9&#160;eV, high stability, and non&#8208;toxicity in small quantities when applied in photovoltaics. However, with a 1D chained crystal structure, Se tends to grow crystalline films with a lying orientation&#8212;chains parallel to substrates arising from the low surface energy; this results in poor carrier transport across chains held together by weak van der Waals forces. Here a substrate&#8208;heating strategy that facilitates the interfacial bonding between Se and substrate is introduced, enabling the growth of Se films with a standing orientation&#8212;chains perpendicular to substrates. This achieves efficient carrier transport along covalently bonded chains. The resulting Se films thereby exhibit a fourfold increase in carrier mobility compared to lying&#8208;oriented Se films. Consequently, Se solar cells are achieved with the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.1% under AM1.5G 1&#8208;sun illumination. The unencapsulated devices exhibit negligible efficiency loss after 1&#160;000 h of storage under ambient conditions.

         <title>Transcytosable and Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Liposome Enables Deep Penetration of Biofilm for Surgical Site Infection Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vascular&#8208;cell&#8208;adhesion&#8208;molecule&#8208;1 (VCAM1)&#8208;targeted and ultrasound&#8208;activated liposome (ligand&#8208;modified, perfluoropentane&#8208;encapsulated, and dual Ce6 and OTM&#8208;integrated liposome) is capable of overcoming the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in biofilm&#8208;associated surgical site infection. VCAM1&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic&#8208;cavitation&#8208;induced EPS collapse consecutively achieve efficient drug accumulation and deep penetration, then lead to potent biofilm eradication.








Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;associated surgical site infection (BSSI) is a common and grievous postoperative complication lacking effective remedies, mainly due to the poor drug accumulation and penetration in the biofilms featured by dense extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). Here, it is found that the vascular cell adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (VCAM1) is highly overexpressed in the vascular cells of BSSI. It is proposed that the combination of VCAM1&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic cavitation can consecutively overcome the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and EPS for biofilm eradication. To demonstrate the feasibility, a VCAM1&#8208;targeted and ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated liposome (LPCOTML) loaded with a reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;responsive lipoid prodrug of oleoyl meropenem, sonosensitizer of lipoid Ce6, and perfluoropentane is developed. LPCOTML can recognize the receptors on vascular cells, and initiate receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis for transendothelial transport into the BSSI periphery. LPCOTML subsequently transforms from nanoparticle into microbubble via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition under US irradiation, triggering strong ultrasonic cavitation to blow up the EPS and deeply penetrate the biofilms. The sonosensitizer Ce6 induces ROS production under US irradiation and triggers the release of meropenem to induce potent antibacterial effect in a BSSI model. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the biological barriers in BSSI via combining receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic cavitation.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning Empowered Customized Chiral Metasurface for Calibration&#8208;Free Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a deep learning&#8208;driven data iteration strategy alongside a global optimization network, showcasing excellent capabilities in expediting metasurface design and unearthing complex light&#8208;matter interactions. As anticipated, it enables the customized and easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement design of chiral metasurfaces and advanced sensing abilities for enantiomer&#8208;specific analysis of bio&#8208;samples in a calibration&#8208;free manner.








Abstract
As a 2D metamaterial, metasurfaces offer an unprecedented avenue to facilitate light&#8208;matter interactions. The current &#8220;one&#8208;by&#8208;one design&#8221; method is hindered by time&#8208;consuming, repeated testing within a confined space. However, intelligent design strategies for metasurfaces, limited by data&#8208;driven properties, have rarely been explored. To address this gap, a data iterative strategy based on deep learning, coupled with a global optimization network is proposed, to achieve the customized design of chiral metasurfaces. This methodology is applied to precisely identify different chiral molecules in a label&#8208;free manner. Fundamentally different from the traditional approach of collecting data purely through simulation, the proposed data generation strategy encompasses the entire design space, which is inaccessible by conventional methods. The dataset quality is significantly improved, with a 21&#8208;fold increase in the number of chiral structures exhibiting the desired circular dichroism (CD) response (&gt;0.6). The method's efficacy is validated by a monolayer structure that is easily prepared, demonstrating advanced sensing abilities for enantiomer&#8208;specific analysis of bio&#8208;samples. These results demonstrate the superior capability of data&#8208;driven schemes in photonic design and the potential of chiral metasurface&#8208;based platforms for calibration&#8208;free biosensing applications. The proposed approach will accelerate the development of complex systems for rapid molecular detection, spectroscopic imaging, and other applications.

         <title>Air&#8208;Processed Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells With Full Lifecycle Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;step air&#8208;processed efficient PSCs with full lifecycle management are effectively realized by the polymer&#8208;stabilized precursor ink. The modified PSCs deliver an impressive efficiency of 25.18% with superior environmental and mechanical stability. The end&#8208;of&#8208;life PSCs with lead leakage suppression and device regeneration will not pose a threat to the environmental and biological safety.








Abstract
Despite the outstanding power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) realized over the years, the entire lifecycle from preparation and operation to discarding of PSCs still needs to be carefully considered when it faces the upcoming large&#8208;scale production and deployment. In this study, bio&#8208;derived chitin&#8208;based polymers are employed to realize the full lifecycle regulation of air&#8208;processed PSCs by forming multiple coordinated and hydrogen bonds to stabilize the lead iodide and organic salt precursor inks, accelerating the solid&#8211;liquid reaction and crystallization of two&#8208;step deposition process, then achieving the high crystalline and oriented perovskites with less notorious charge defects in the open air. The air&#8208;prepared PSCs exhibit a decent efficiency of 25.18% with high preparation reproducibility and improved operational stability toward the harsh environment and mechanical stress stimuli. The modified PSCs display negligible fatigue behavior with keeping 92% of its initial efficiency after operating for 32 diurnal cycles (ISOS&#8208;LC&#8208;1 protocol). Meanwhile, closed&#8208;loop lead management of end&#8208;of&#8208;life PSCs including suppression of lead leakage, toxicity evaluation of broken devices, and recycling of lead iodide components are comprehensively investigated. This work sheds light on a promising avenue to realize the entire lifecycle regulation of air&#8208;processed efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Constructing an Active Sulfur&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich Surface for Selective *CH3&#8208;CH3 Coupling in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 Conversion With 92% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic MoO3&#8208;x significantly lowers the formation energy of sulfur vacancies in ZnIn2S4, resulting in a sulfur&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich surface within the ZnIn2S4/MoO3&#8208;x photocatalyst. This enhances CO2 adsorption and activation, reduces the energy barrier for HCOO* formation, and promotes efficient *CH3&#8208;CH3 coupling. Consequently, the system achieves a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion rate of 467.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 92.0%.








Abstract
To achieve high selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products, increasing the number of CO2 adsorption sites and lowering the energy barriers for key intermediates are critical. A ZnIn2S4 (ZIS)/MoO3&#8208;x (Z&#8208;M) photocatalyst is presented, in which plasmonic MoO3&#8208;x generates hot electrons, creating a multielectron environment in ZIS that facilitates efficient C&#9472;C coupling reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that MoO3&#8208;x reduces the formation energy of sulfur vacancies (SV) in ZIS, thereby enhancing CO2 adsorption and activation. The SV&#8208;rich surface lowers the energy barrier for forming HCOO* to &#8722;0.33 eV whereas the energy barrier for forming *COOH is 0.77 eV. Successive hydrogenation of HCOO* leads to *CH2, which converts to *CH3 with an energy barrier of &#8722;0.63 eV. The energy barrier for *CH3&#8208;CH3 coupling is 0.54 eV, which is lower than the 0.73 eV for *CH2&#8208;CH2 coupling to form *C2H4. Thus, Z&#8208;M preferentially produces C2H6 over C2H4. Under visible light, Z&#8208;M achieves a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion rate of 467.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 92.0% selectivity. This work highlights the dual role of plasmonic photocatalysts in enhancing CO2 adsorption and improving C2+ production in CO2 reduction.

&lt;p&gt;Plasmonic MoO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; significantly lowers the formation energy of sulfur vacancies in ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in a sulfur-vacancy-rich surface within the ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/MoO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalyst. This enhances CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and activation, reduces the energy barrier for HCOO&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; formation, and promotes efficient &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coupling. Consequently, the system achieves a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; conversion rate of 467.3 &#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a selectivity of 92.0%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve high selectivity in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products, increasing the number of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption sites and lowering the energy barriers for key intermediates are critical. A ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (ZIS)/MoO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; (Z-M) photocatalyst is presented, in which plasmonic MoO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; generates hot electrons, creating a multielectron environment in ZIS that facilitates efficient C&#9472;C coupling reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that MoO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; reduces the formation energy of sulfur vacancies (S&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) in ZIS, thereby enhancing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and activation. The S&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;-rich surface lowers the energy barrier for forming HCOO&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; to &#8722;0.33 eV whereas the energy barrier for forming &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;COOH is 0.77 eV. Successive hydrogenation of HCOO&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; leads to &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which converts to &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with an energy barrier of &#8722;0.63 eV. The energy barrier for &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coupling is 0.54 eV, which is lower than the 0.73 eV for &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coupling to form &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, Z-M preferentially produces C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; over C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Under visible light, Z-M achieves a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; conversion rate of 467.3 &#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 92.0% selectivity.

Tissue Adhesives
Pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives, such as scotch tape, demonstrate adhesion limited to dry substrates. By integrating the interfacial behavior of hydrogels, Yuhan Lee, Hyunwoo Yuk, Seongjun Park, and co&#8208;workers have synthesized a pressure&#8208;sensitive bioadhesive capable of instant and repositionable adhesion on wet internal organs, such as the lungs. This class of adhesives exhibits potential utility in on&#8208;demand surgical and analytical scenarios, including fault&#8208;tolerant integration of surgical tools and sensors. More details can be found in article number 2407116.

Superhydrophobic Concave Pillar
In article number 2409389, Dong Woog Lee and co&#8208;workers report a stable superhydrophobic surface achieved through a novel concave morphology design. The concave pillar structures enhance resistance to wetting transitions under both impact and hydrostatic pressure. The air trapped in the concavities during water contact plays a crucial role in maintaining stable superhydrophobicity by forming a convex air cap.

Polyhexahydrotriazine Aerogels
In article number 2412502 by &#381;eljko Tomovi&#263; and co&#8208;workers, a simple one&#8208;step synthesis of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT) aerogels is presented, which are made from commercially available aromatic amines and paraformaldehyde. These PHT aerogels display thermal superinsulation, pronounced thermal stability, great mechanical performance, and intrinsic hydrophobicity. Furthermore, PHT aerogels can be depolymerized under acidic aqueous conditions, allowing the monomers to be reused to prepare fresh aerogels.

Piezoelectric Heterojunctions
Heterojunctions, made of piezoelectric nanocrystals and nanowires, can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat to kill bacteria under the irradiation of near&#8208;infrared light. These heterojunctions produce electric signals under the forces applied by the stem cells grown on them and such electric signals further promote bone formation. Hence, they can not only achieve osteointegration but also eradicate implant&#8208;associated infections. More details can be found in article number 2413171 by Chengyun Ning, Peng Yu, Chuanbin Mao, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>The Development, Essence and Perspective of Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper summarizes the development of six milestones of nitrogen reduction to ammonia, and concludes its commonalities and characteristics. Accordingly, the essence of ammonia synthesis is extracted, that is the reaction pathways are influenced by the energy barrier of reaction intrmediates, which can be altered by proton sources, auxiliaries and catalysts, providing design guidance for efficient ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Ammonia plays a pivotal role in agriculture and meanwhile holds promising potential as an energy vector for the hydrogen economy, where the nitrogen reduction to ammonia is a critical pathway for achieving sustainable development. Over the past hundred years, ammonia synthesis has undergone several breakthrough developments from Haber&#8208;Bosch process to photo/electro&#8208;catalysis and Li&#8208;mediated strategy, but still faces the challenges of low yield rate, selectivity and efficiency. Therefore, there is a pressing demand to develop efficient and green ammonia synthesis from nitrogen. This review summarizes the development of the nitrogen reduction to ammonia, highlighting six milestones during the whole journey. From the development direction, this work finds and extracts the essence of ammonia synthesis, that is the reaction pathways are affected by the energy barrier of reaction intermediates, which can be altered by proton sources, auxiliaries and catalysts. Then this work discusses the detailed overview of the significant development of proton source, auxiliaries and catalysts. Finally, based on the essence, the possible opportunities of ammonia synthesis from nitrogen reduction are presented, including the design of new ammonia synthesis pathways and efficient catalysts. The deep insight of nitrogen reduction to ammonia will provide a design guidance for efficient ammonia synthesis.

         <dc:description>
This review delves into the interdisciplinary engineering advancements that have expanded the functionality and biomedical applications of microneedles, with a focus on electronic, electromagnetic and magnetic, photonic, and mechanical engineering.








Abstract
Microneedles (MNs), composed of an array of micro&#8208;sized needles and a supporting base, have transcended their initial use to replace hypodermic needles in drug delivery and fluid collection, advancing toward multifunctional platforms. In this review, four major areas are summarized in interdisciplinary engineering approaches combined with MNs technology. First, electronics engineering, the most extensively researched field, enables applications in biomonitoring, electrical stimulation, and closed&#8208;loop theranostics through the generation, transmission, and transformation of electrical signals. Second, in electromagnetic engineering, the responsiveness of electromagnetic induction offers prospects for remote and programmable therapeutic applications. Third, photonic engineering endows MNs with novel functionalities, such as waveguiding and photonic manipulation to enhance optical therapeutic capabilities and facilitate the visualization of disease progression and treatment processes. Lastly, it reviewed the role of mechanical engineering in conferring shape adaptability and programmable motion features necessary for various MNs applications. This review focuses on the functionalities that emerge from the intersection of MNs with complementary engineering technologies, aiming to inspire further research and innovation in microneedle technology for biomedical applications.

         <title>Catalytic Biomaterials&#8208;Activated In Situ Chemical Reactions: Strategic Modulation and Enhanced Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the modulation of fundamental catalytic reactions, a cornerstone in addressing disease treatment through an interdisciplinary lens. Central to this review's discussion is the regulation of chemical reactions while concurrently accounting for the complex microenvironments of diseases to achieve specificity, efficiency, and control of in situ chemical reactions. It seeks to clarify the mechanisms underpinning catalytic biomaterials activated in situ chemical reactions and evaluate their potential to revolutionize treatment strategies across various pathological conditions.








Abstract
Chemical reactions underpin biological processes, and imbalances in critical biochemical pathways within organisms can lead to the onset of severe diseases. Within this context, the emerging field of &#8220;Nanocatalytic Medicine&#8221; leverages nanomaterials as catalysts to modulate fundamental chemical reactions specific to the microenvironments of diseases. This approach is designed to facilitate the targeted synthesis and localized accumulation of therapeutic agents, thus enhancing treatment efficacy and precision while simultaneously reducing systemic side effects. The effectiveness of these nanocatalytic strategies critically hinges on a profound understanding of chemical kinetics and the intricate interplay of reactions within particular pathological microenvironments to ensure targeted and effective catalytic actions. This review methodically explores in situ catalytic reactions and their associated biomaterials, emphasizing regulatory strategies that control therapeutic responses. Furthermore, the discussion encapsulates the crucial elements&#8208;reactants, catalysts, and reaction conditions/environments&#8208;necessary for optimizing the thermodynamics and kinetics of these reactions, while rigorously addressing both the biochemical and biophysical dimensions of the disease microenvironments to enhance therapeutic outcomes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical reactions underpin biological processes, and imbalances in critical biochemical pathways within organisms can lead to the onset of severe diseases. Within this context, the emerging field of &#8220;Nanocatalytic Medicine&#8221; leverages nanomaterials as catalysts to modulate fundamental chemical reactions specific to the microenvironments of diseases. This approach is designed to facilitate the targeted synthesis and localized accumulation of therapeutic agents, thus enhancing treatment efficacy and precision while simultaneously reducing systemic side effects. The effectiveness of these nanocatalytic strategies critically hinges on a profound understanding of chemical kinetics and the intricate interplay of reactions within particular pathological microenvironments to ensure targeted and effective catalytic actions. This review methodically explores in situ catalytic reactions and their associated biomaterials, emphasizing regulatory strategies that control therapeutic responses. Furthermore, the discussion encapsulates the crucial elements-reactants, catalysts, and reaction conditions/environments-necessary for optimizing the thermodynamics and kinetics of these reactions, while rigorously addressing both the biochemical and biophysical dimensions of the disease microenvironments to enhance therapeutic outcomes. It seeks to clarify the mechanisms underpinning catalytic biomaterials and evaluate their potential to revolutionize treatment strategies across various pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis Strategies for High Entropy Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for high entropy materials nanoparticles preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms.








Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) of high entropy materials (HEMs) have attracted significant attention due to their versatility and wide range of applications. HEM NPs can be synthesized by fragmenting bulk HEMs or disintegrating and recrystallizing them. Alternatively, directly producing HEMs in NP form from atomic/ionic/molecular precursors presents a significant challenge. A widely adopted strategy involves thermodynamically driving HEM NP formation by leveraging the entropic contribution but incorporating strategies to limit NP growth at the elevated temperatures used for maximizing entropy. A second approach is to kinetically drive HEM NP formation by promoting rapid reactions of homogeneous reactant mixtures or using highly diluted precursor dissolutions. Additionally, experimental evidence suggests that enthalpy plays a significant role in driving HEM NP formation processes at moderate temperatures, with the high energy cost of generating additional surfaces and interfaces at the nanoscale stabilizing the HEM phase. This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for HEM NP preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms. Such insights are critical for fine&#8208;tuning experimental conditions to achieve specific outcomes, ultimately enabling the effective synthesis of optimized generations of these advanced materials for both current and emerging applications across various scientific and technological fields.

Abstract
The rapid development of wearable and intelligent flexible devices has posed strict requirements for power sources, including excellent mechanical strength, inherent safety, high energy density, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Zn&#8208;ion batteries with aqueous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (AQSSEs) with various functional groups that contain electronegative atoms (O/N/F) with tunable electron accumulation states are considered as a promising candidate to power the flexible devices and tremendous progress has been achieved in this prospering area. Herein, this review proposes a comprehensive summary of the recent achievements using the AQSSE in flexible devices by focusing on the significance of different functional groups. The fundamentals and challenges of the ZIBs are introduced from a chemical view in the first place. Then, the mechanism behind the stabilization of the flexible ZIBs with the functionalized AQSSE is summarized and explained in detail. Then the recent progress regarding the enhanced electrochemical stability of the ZIBs with the AQSSE is summarized and classified based on the functional groups on the polymer chain. The advanced characterization methods for the AQSSE are briefly introduced in the following sections. Last but not least, current challenges and future perspectives for this promising area are provided from the authors' point of view.

         <title>Solution Processable Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Synthesis Strategy and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in design strategies for synthesizing solution&#8208;processable metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and MOF&#8208;based systems, including methods such as direct dispersion in ionic liquids, direct synthesis, etc. It emphasizes their applications in fabricating structured objects, membranes, and/or films for molecular storage, separation, and chemical sensing. The review also discusses future challenges and perspectives. 








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by inorganic secondary building units with organic linkers via reticular chemistry, inherently suffer from poor solution processability due to their insoluble nature, resulting from their extensive crystalline networks and structural rigidity. The ubiquitous occurrence of precipitation and agglomeration of MOFs upon formation poses a significant obstacle to the scale&#8208;up production of MOF&#8208;based monolith, aerogels, membranes, and electronic devices, thus restricting their practical applications in various scenarios. To address the previously mentioned challenge, significant strides have been achieved over the past decade in the development of various strategies aimed at preparing solution&#8208;processable MOF systems. In this review, the latest advance in the synthetic strategies for the construction of solution&#8208;processable MOFs, including direct dispersion in ionic liquids, surface modification, controllable calcination, and bottom&#8208;up synthesis, is comprehensively summarized. The respective advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Additionally, the intriguing applications of solution&#8208;processable MOF systems in the fields of liquid adsorbent, molecular capture, sensing, and separation are systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities about the continued advancement of solution&#8208;processable MOFs and their potential applications are outlooked.

         <dc:description>
Polarization techniques are revolutionizing material functionalities across energy, environmental, and electronic sectors. This review comprehensively examines polarization mechanisms such as piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and pyroelectric effects, alongside strategies like doping and heterostructures. It highlights its pivotal role in enhancing charge dynamics, modifying surface chemistries, and facilitating energy&#8208;efficient designs in various applications.








Abstract
The sustainable future relies on the synergistic development of energy, environmental, and electronic systems, founded on the development of functional materials by exploring their quantum mechanisms. Effective control over the distribution and behavior of charges within these materials, a basic quantum attribute, is crucial in dictating their physical, chemical, and electronic properties. At the core of charge manipulation lies &#8220;polarization&#8221;&#8212;a ubiquitous phenomenon marked by separating positive and negative charges. This review thoroughly examines polarization techniques, spotlighting their transformative role in catalysis, energy storage, solar cells, and electronics. Starting with the foundational mechanisms underlying various forms of polarization, including piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and pyroelectric effects, the perspective is expanded to cover any asymmetric phenomena that generate internal fields, such as heterostructures and doping. Afterward, the critical role of polarization across various applications, including charge separation, surface chemistry modification, and energy band alignment, is highlighted. Special emphasis is placed on the synergy between polarization and material properties, demonstrating how this interplay is pivotal in overcoming existing technological limitations and unlocking new functionalities. Through a comprehensive analysis, a holistic roadmap is offered for harnessing polarization across the broad spectrum of applications, thus finding sustainable solutions for future energy, environment, and electronics.

         <title>Recent Advances in High&#8208;Entropy Layered Oxide Cathode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The basic concepts, design principles, synthetic methods, advanced characterization, and theoretical calculations of high&#8208;entropy layered oxides are summarized here for alkali metal&#8208;ion battery (AMIB) cathodes. It highlights the recent advances in high&#8208;entropy strategies for improving the electrochemical performance of layered oxide cathodes, and existing problems and possible solutions, providing guidance for the development of layered oxides for highly efficient AMIB cathodes.








Abstract
Since the electrochemical de/intercalation behavior is first detected in 1980, layered oxides have become the most promising cathode material for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (Li+/Na+/K+; AMIBs) owing to their facile synthesis and excellent theoretical capacities. However, the inherent drawbacks of unstable structural evolution and sluggish diffusion kinetics deteriorate their electrochemical performance, limiting further large&#8208;scale applications. To solve these issues, the novel and promising strategy of high entropy has been widely applied to layered oxide cathodes for AMIBs in recent years. Through multielement synergy and entropy stabilization effects, high&#8208;entropy layered oxides (HELOs) can achieve adjustable activity and enhanced stability. Herein, the basic concepts, design principles, and synthesis methods of HELO cathodes are introduced systematically. Notably, it explores in detail the improvements of the high&#8208;entropy strategy on the limitations of layered oxides, highlighting the latest advances in high&#8208;entropy layered cathode materials in the field of AMIBs. In addition, it introduces advanced characterization and theoretical calculations for HELOs and proposes potential future research directions and optimization strategies, providing inspiration for researchers to develop advanced HELO cathode materials in the areas of energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Formation Dynamics of Thermally Stable 1D/3D Perovskite Interfaces for High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation dynamics of low&#8208;dimensional perovskites derived from N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methanamine hydroiodide (M&#8208;NMAI) are studied. The exclusively produced thermally stable 1D structure on 3D perovskite films other than heterogeneous nucleation preferred Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper 2D perovskite structure benefits the resulting n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells to achieve a peak efficiency of 25.51% with significantly enhanced thermal stability.








Abstract
Direct understanding of the formation and crystallization of low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskites with varying dimensionalities employing the same bulky cations can offer insights into LD perovskites and their heterostructures with 3D perovskites. In this study, the secondary amine cation of N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methylammonium (M&#8208;NMA+) and the formation dynamics of its corresponding LD perovskite are investigated. The intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of M&#8208;NMA+ and their connection with inorganic PbI6 octahedrons within the product structures control the formation of LD perovskite. In an N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) precursor solution, both 1D and 2D products can be obtained. Interestingly, due to the strong interaction between M&#8208;NMA+ and the DMF solvent, compared to the 1D phase, the formation of 2D perovskites is uniquely dependent on heterogeneous nucleation. Nevertheless, post&#8208;treatment of 3D perovskite films with an isopropanol solution of M&#8208;NMAI leads to the exclusive formation of thermally stable 1D phases on the surface. The resulting 1D/3D heterostructure facilitates perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to not only achieve a record efficiency of 25.51% through 1D perovskite passivation but also significantly enhance the thermal stability of unencapsulated devices at 85&#160;&#176;C. This study deepens the understanding of the formation dynamics of LD perovskites and offers an efficient strategy for fabricating stable and high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Untangling the Role of Capping Agents in Manipulating Electrochemical Behaviors Toward Practical Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the critical role of capping agents in nanomaterials synthesis and bulk crystal growth, the role of capping agents in manipulating the electrochemical behaviors of AZIBs is untangled. The multifunctional role of the capping agents in terms of the Zn anode, electrolyte, and cathode validates stable and practical AZIBs.








Abstract
Long&#8208;standing challenges including notorious side reactions at the Zn anode, low Zn anode utilization, and rapid cathode degradation at low current densities hinder the advancement of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Inspired by the critical role of capping agents in nanomaterials synthesis and bulk crystal growth, a series of capping agents are employed to demonstrate their applicability in AZIBs. Here, it is shown that the preferential adsorption of capping agents on different Zn crystal planes, coordination between capping agents and Zn2+ ions, and interactions with metal oxide cathodes enable preferred Zn (002) deposition, water&#8208;deficient Zn2+ ion solvation structure, and a dynamic cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Benefiting from the multi&#8208;functional role of capping agents, dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating and stripping with an improved Coulombic efficiency of 99.2% and enhanced long&#8208;term cycling stability are realized. Remarkable capacity retention of 91% is achieved for cathodes after more than 500 cycles under a low current density of 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1, marking one of the best cycling stabilities to date. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of capping agents in manipulating electrochemical behaviors, which should inspire and pave a new avenue of research to address the challenges in practical energy storage beyond AZIBs.

         <title>Molecular Ferroelectrics for Highly Sensitive Detection Toward Low&#8208;Frequency Sound Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study represents the first use of molecular ferroelectrics in the construction of a piezoelectric acoustic sensor for low&#8208;frequency sound detection. This piezoelectric acoustic sensor exhibits excellent sensitivity (47.43 mV Pa&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) frequency resolution (up to 0.1 Hz), discrimination, and detection of low&#8208;frequency sounds. This acoustic sensor efficiently captures acoustic signals from various sources, such as heartbeats, music, animal sounds, and voices, and exhibits&#160;superior performance characteristics.








Abstract
Human hearing cannot sensitively detect sounds below 100&#160;Hz, which can affect the physical well&#8208;being and lead to dizziness, headaches, and nausea. Piezoelectric acoustic sensors still lack sensitivity to low&#8208;frequency sounds owing to the low piezoelectric coefficient or high elastic modulus of materials. The low elastic modulus and substantial piezoelectric coefficient of molecular ferroelectric materials make them excellent candidates for acoustic sensors. In this study, the molecular ferroelectric, [(CH3)3NCH2Cl]CdCl3, is used as a piezoelectric active layer in the construction of a piezoelectric acoustic sensor for low&#8208;frequency sound detection. The sensor exhibits high sensitivity (47.43&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at 87&#160;Hz, with an excellent level of frequency resolution (up to 0.1&#160;Hz). This facilitates the accurate discrimination and detection of low&#8208;frequency sounds, which is suitable for noise detection applications. The sensor differentiates between various musical instruments and heartbeats, and recognizes audio signals. This study highlights the potential of molecular ferroelectric materials in piezoelectric acoustic device applications, including noise detection, health monitoring, and human&#8208;computer interactions.

         <title>Riveting Nucleation Enabled Long Cycling Life Calcium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Na metal mediator preferentially rivets the plating/stripping of the Ca metal anode on carbon substrates, endowing the Ca metal anode with an unprecedented cycling life, high coulombic efficiency, and rate capability.








Abstract
Calcium metal batteries with high capacity and low cost are promising alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, its development is crucially impeded by the irreversible Ca metal anode, which is highly associated with uncontrollable Ca plating/stripping. Here, we report a new riveting strategy to regulate the nucleation and growth of a Ca metal anode in the 3D structure of a carbon nanotube film (CNF) by introducing in situ&#8208;formed Na metal mediators. Na metal mediators are found to first deposit in the CNF substrate prior to Ca nucleation and subsequently induce dense and uniform Ca plating due to their thermodynamically favorable kinetics. Therefore, even at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8722;2, it realizes the uniform nucleation and growth of dendrite&#8208;free Ca metal. Moreover, an unprecedented cycling life of over 800 cycles is also achieved for Ca metal batteries with a high coulombic efficiency above 98.4%. This work demonstrates the significance of a riveting strategy to enable the superior performance of Ca metal batteries by regulating the plating/stripping behaviors of Ca metal anodes and paves a new way for the development of Ca metal batteries.

         <title>Leech&#8208;Inspired Amphibious Soft Robot Driven by High&#8208;Voltage Triboelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance, temperature&#8208;controllable, and high&#8208;voltage DC triboelectric nanogenerator (HDC&#8208;TENG) is proposed. This HDC&#8208;TENG is used to develop a triboelectric bionic robot driving system (TEBR), which stably drives and controls leech&#8208;inspired dielectric elastomer robots (LSR). With the TEBR, the LSR achieves amphibious motion, payload crawling, and small&#8208;slope climbing through the design of extensible dielectric elastomer muscle segments.








Abstract
Leech locomotion, characterized by alternating sucker attachment and body contraction provides&#160;high adaptability and stability on complex terrains. Herein, a leech&#8208;inspired triboelectric soft robot is proposed for the first time, capable of amphibious movement, climbing, and load&#8208;carrying crawling. A high&#8208;performance triboelectric bionic robot system is developed to drive and control electro&#8208;responsive soft robots. Its core components include: i) a leech&#8208;inspired soft robot (LSR) made from segmented dielectric elastomer muscles. ii) The triboelectric sucker produces anisotropic frictional forces. iii) The multi&#8208;channel high&#8208;voltage&#160;output triboelectric nanogenerator (HDC&#8208;TENG) effectively drives the LSR. iv) The high&#8208;voltage triboelectric control unit adapted for the HDC&#8208;TENG enables flexible LSR control. Using the scalable structure of the dielectric elastomer muscles enables the LSR to achieve&#160;a maximum crawling speed of 0.39 body lengths per minute on land (45 mm min&#8722;1) and 0.22 body lengths per minute in liquid (30.5 mm min&#8722;1). It can also carry a payload of 11.55 grams on acrylic while crawling. This research provides a sustainable and promising new solution for self&#8208;powered high&#8208;voltage energy sources suitable for electro&#8208;responsive soft robots.

         <title>Suppression of Sepsis Cytokine Storm by Escherichia Coli Cell Wall&#8208;Derived Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Escherichia coli wall&#8208;derived carbon dots (E&#8208;CDs) competitively bind to lipopolysaccharide&#8208;binding protein, promoting Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 degradation via the lysosomal pathway and inhibiting nuclear factor kappa&#8208;B activation activation. Additionally, E&#8208;CDs reduce oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA release, thereby suppressing overactivation of the stimulator of interferon gene pathway. This study highlights the potential of E&#8208;CDs to suppress cytokine storms, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for sepsis.








Abstract
Sepsis is a life&#8208;threatening disease caused by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often involving the translocation of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) into the bloodstream, triggering a cytokine storm. Despite its severity, no effective drugs currently exist for sepsis treatment. This study explores whether pathogen&#8208;derived carbon dots can mitigate their inherent toxicity while leveraging their structural similarity to pathogens to competitively bind pattern recognition receptors, thereby inhibiting sepsis. Based on this concept, E. coli wall&#8208;derived carbon dots (E&#8208;CDs) are synthesized and shown to reduce inflammatory cytokine production, protect organ function, and improve survival in septic mice. Mechanistic studies reveal that E&#8208;CDs competitively bind to lipopolysaccharide&#8208;binding protein with lipopolysaccharide, promoting toll&#8208;like receptor 4 degradation via the lysosomal pathway and inhibiting nuclear factor kappa&#8208;B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) activation. Additionally, E&#8208;CDs exhibit antioxidant properties, reducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA release, thereby suppressing overactivation of the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. In septic cynomolgus monkeys and patient&#8208;derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells, E&#8208;CDs alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress. Overall, this study demonstrates that E&#8208;CDs can suppress the cytokine storm in sepsis by co&#8208;silencing innate immune pathways, suggesting that converting pathogens into carbon dots offers a novel therapeutic strategy.

         <title>Wood and Cellulose: the Most Sustainable Advanced Materials for Past, Present, and Future Civilizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wood and cellulose are the most abundant and important sustainable materials on the planet at the disposal to solve major societal challenges. This perspective, written for all materials scientists, highlights how breakthroughs in cellulose nanotechnology combined with functional nanomaterials can revolutionize important areas like construction, electronics, recycling, and intelligent materials at scale, toward a sustainable future.








Abstract
Wood, with its constituent building block cellulose, is by far the most common biomaterial on the planet and has been the most important material used by humans to establish civilization. If there is one single biomaterial that should be studied and used by materials scientists across disciplines to achieve a sustainable future, it is cellulose. This perspective provides insights for the general materials science community about the unique properties of wood and cellulose and how they may be used in advanced sustainable materials to make a substantial societal impact. The focus is on sawn wood or cellulose fibers produced at scale by industry and the more recent cellulosic nanomaterials, highlighting the areas where these cellulose&#8208;based materials can be valorized into higher&#8208;order functions. Numerous articles have comprehensively reviewed different areas where cellulose is currently used in advanced materials science. The objective here is to provide general insight for all material scientists and to provide the opinions about the areas in which cellulose and wood have the largest potential to make a significant societal impact, especially to realize next&#8208;generation sustainable materials for construction, food, water, energy, and information. Discussing key areas where future research is needed to open avenues toward a more sustainable future is ended.

     alt="Wood and Cellulose: the Most Sustainable Advanced Materials for Past, Present, and Future Civilizations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood and cellulose are the most abundant and important sustainable materials on the planet at the disposal to solve major societal challenges. This perspective, written for all materials scientists, highlights how breakthroughs in cellulose nanotechnology combined with functional nanomaterials can revolutionize important areas like construction, electronics, recycling, and intelligent materials at scale, toward a sustainable future.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood, with its constituent building block cellulose, is by far the most common biomaterial on the planet and has been the most important material used by humans to establish civilization. If there is one single biomaterial that should be studied and used by materials scientists across disciplines to achieve a sustainable future, it is cellulose. This perspective provides insights for the general materials science community about the unique properties of wood and cellulose and how they may be used in advanced sustainable materials to make a substantial societal impact. The focus is on sawn wood or cellulose fibers produced at scale by industry and the more recent cellulosic nanomaterials, highlighting the areas where these cellulose-based materials can be valorized into higher-order functions. Numerous articles have comprehensively reviewed different areas where cellulose is currently used in advanced materials science. The objective here is to provide general insight for all material scientists and to provide the opinions about the areas in which cellulose and wood have the largest potential to make a significant societal impact, especially to realize next-generation sustainable materials for construction, food, water, energy, and information. Discussing key areas where future research is needed to open avenues toward a more sustainable future is ended.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferroelectric Optical Memristors Enabled by Non&#8208;Volatile Electro&#8208;Optic Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the development of a non&#8208;volatile optical memristor enabled by the electro&#8208;optic (EO) effect in ferroelectric PMN&#8208;PT, which supports deterministic, repeatable multilevel EO states for phase modulation. A tunable waveplate achieving phase shifts from 0 to &#960;/2 is presented, demonstrating the potential of relaxor ferroelectrics in non&#8208;volatile memory and photonic networks.








Abstract
Memristors enable non&#8208;volatile memory and neuromorphic computing. Optical memristors are the fundamental element for programmable photonic integrated circuits due to their high&#8208;bandwidth computing, low crosstalk, and minimal power consumption. Here, an optical memristor enabled by a non&#8208;volatile electro&#8208;optic (EO) effect, where refractive index modulation under zero field is realized by deliberate control of domain alignment in the ferroelectric material Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8208;PbTiO3(PMN&#8208;PT) is proposed. The non&#8208;volatile EO memristor is designed exclusively for the modulation of the optical phase without degrading the optical transparency, and it allows the support for deterministic and repeated non&#8208;volatile multilevel EO states. A non&#8208;volatile tunable waveplate composed of the optical memrisor for free&#8208;space optics, which allows for deterministic multilevel, and non&#8208;volatile phase shifts from 0 to &#960;/2 is presented. The state switching rate of the memristor is less than 100&#160;ms, with a switching energy consumption of 234&#160;nJ, and the states can be retained for up to 12&#160;h without requiring static power consumption. These results demonstrate a novel approach to fully realizing non&#8208;volatile optical memristors, where only optical phase modulation is involved, providing unprecedented opportunities for the development of new ferroelectric memristors.

         <title>Programmable Electromagnetic Wave Absorption via Tailored Metal Single Atom&#8208;Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper proposes a methodology that emphasizes precise control of single atom&#8208;graphene interactions to address electromagnetic interference challenges, the methodology includes material selection, material preparation, and structure&#8211;activity correlation analysis, and ultimately leads to the establishment of programmable electromagnetic wave absorption properties through the creation of a library of diverse single atom&#8208;graphene materials.








Abstract
Metal single atoms (SA)&#8208;support interactions inherently exhibit significant electrochemical activity, demonstrating potential in energy catalysis. However, leveraging these interactions to modulate electronic properties and extend application fields is a formidable challenge, demanding in&#8208;depth understanding and quantitative control of atomic&#8208;scale interactions. Herein, in situ, off&#8208;axis electron holography technique is utilized to directly visualize the interactions between SAs and the graphene surface. These interactions facilitate the formation of dispersed nanoscale regions with high charge density and are highly sensitive to external electromagnetic (EM) fields, resulting in controllable dynamic relaxation processes for charge accumulation and restoration. This leads to customized dielectric relaxation, which is difficult to achieve with current band engineering methods. Moreover, these electronic behaviors are insensitive to elevated temperatures, having characteristics distinct from those of typical metallic or semiconducting materials. Based on these results, programmable EM wave absorption properties are achieved by developing a library of SA&#8208;graphene materials and precisely controlling SA&#8208;support interactions to tailor their responses to EM waves in terms of frequency and intensity. This advancement addresses the customized anti&#8208;EM interference requirements of electronic components, greatly enhancing the development of integrated circuits and micro&#8208;nano chips. Future efforts will concentrate on manipulating atomic interactions in SA&#8208;support, potentially revolutionizing nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Synthetic Aspects and Characterization Needs in MOF Chemistry &#8211; from Discovery to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Overcoming the challenges of phase discovery, synthesis optimization and scale&#8208;up, characterization, and computational studies is essential to accelerate the large&#8208;scale application of MOFs. Life&#8208;cycle analyses and techno&#8208;economic analyses need to be performed to realistically assess their potential for industrial relevance. This mini&#8208;review provides recommendations, to accelerate and facilitate the knowledge transfer leading to large&#8208;scale applications of MOFs.








Abstract
Even if MOFs are recently developed for large&#8208;scale applications, the road to applications of MOFs is long and rocky. This requires to overcome challenges associated with phase discovery, synthesis optimization, basic and advanced characterization, and computational studies. Lab&#8208;scale results need to be transferred to large&#8208;scale processes, which is often not trivial, and life&#8208;cycle analyses and techno&#8208;economic analyses need to be performed to realistically assess their potential for industrial relevance. Based on the experience in the field of stable, functional MOFs combining advanced synthesis, characterization, and modeling, this mini&#8208;review gives recommendations especially for non&#8208;specialists, for example, from chemical engineers to medical doctors, to accelerate and facilitate knowledge transfer which will ultimately lead to the application of MOFs. The recommendations will include the reporting of synthesis and characterization data as well as standardization and detailed information required for the application of data mining and machine learning techniques, which are increasingly used to accelerate the discovery of new materials and data analysis. Once a suitable MOF is identified and its key properties determined, translational studies shall finally be carried out in collaboration with end&#8208;users to validate performance under real conditions and allow understanding of the processes involved.

         <title>Manganese Galvanic Cells Intervene in Tumor Metabolism to Reinforce cGAS&#8208;STING Activation for Bidirectional Synergistic Hydrogen&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese galvanic cells (MnG) are prepared via liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation and in situ galvanic replacement to modulate tumor metabolism, thereby enhancing cGAS&#8208;STING activation for bidirectional synergistic H2&#8208;immunotherapy. MnG not only potentiates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway through sustained release of Mn2+ but also regulates tumor glucose metabolism to inhibit the TREX2 expression, thereby providing favorable support for antitumor therapy.








Abstract
The cGAS&#8208;STING pathway is pivotal in initiating antitumor immunity. However, tumor metabolism, particularly glycolysis, negatively regulates the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Herein, Mn galvanic cells (MnG) are prepared via liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation and in situ galvanic replacement to modulate tumor metabolism, thereby enhancing cGAS&#8208;STING activation for bidirectional synergistic H2&#8208;immunotherapy. The obtained MnG can be etched by water, enabling efficient and sustained generation of H2 gas and Mn2+. MnG not only activated and amplified the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway through the sustained release of Mn2+ but also regulated tumor glucose metabolism to inhibit the expression of three prime repair exonuclease 2 (TREX2), thereby synergistically enhancing the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. The injection of MnG into tumors resulted in a robust immune response, thereby providing favorable support for antitumor therapy. Consequently, the combination of MnG with immune checkpoint blockade therapy resulted in significant suppression of both primary tumors and distant tumors. Furthermore, the MnG&#8208;lipiodol dispersion exhibited remarkable efficacy in combination with transarterial embolization (TAE)&#8208;gas&#8208;immunotherapy in a rabbit orthotopic liver tumor model. The present study underscores the significance of employing a metal galvanic cell strategy for enhanced immunotherapy, thereby offering a novel approach for rational design of bioactive materials to augment immunotherapeutic effectiveness.

This study presents W&#8208;doped Ni3N as a bifunctional catalyst for hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis. Through compressive strain and electronic structure tuning via high&#8208;valence W doping, the catalyst exhibits enhanced HER and HzOR. W&#8208;doped Ni3N shows superior bifunctional performance with low overpotentials, offering an efficient alternative to conventional water electrolysis and addressing challenges of noble metal cost and sluggish kinetics.

As promising bifunctional electrocatalysts, transition metal nitrides are expected to achieve an efficient hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) by fine&#8208;tuning electronic structure via strain engineering, thereby facilitating hydrogen production. However, understanding the correlation between strain&#8208;induced atomic microenvironments and reactivity remains challenging. Herein, a generalized compressive strained W&#8208;Ni3N catalyst is developed to create a surface with enriched electronic states that optimize intermediate binding and activate both water and N2H4. Multi&#8208;dimensional characterizations reveal a nearly linear correlation between the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and the d&#8208;band center of W&#8208;Ni3N under strain state. Theoretically, compressive strain enhances the electron transfer capability at the surface, increasing donation into antibonding orbitals of adsorbed species, which accelerates the HER and HzOR. Leveraging both compressive strain and the modified electronic structure from W incorporation, the W&#8208;Ni3N catalysts demonstrate outstanding bifunctional performance, achieving overpotentials of 46&#160;mV for HER at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 81&#160;mV for HzOR at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, W&#8208;Ni3N catalyst achieves efficient overall hydrazine splitting at a low cell voltage of 0.185&#160;V for 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, maintaining stability for &#8776;450 h. This work provides new insights into the dual engineering of strain and electronic structure in the design of advanced catalysts.

         <title>Reversible Nanocomposite by Programming Amorphous Polymer Conformation Under Nanoconfinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by how protein folding and hierarchical structures are synergized in biocomposites for function gain, nanoconfinements are utilized to modulate how polymers are entangled and disentangled within polymer&#8208;grafted&#8208;nanoparticle (PGNP) assemblies to form pseudo bonds and thus, engineer high&#8208;performance, reversible single component nanocomposites.








Abstract
Nanoconfinements are utilized to program how polymers entangle and disentangle as chain clusters to engineer pseudo bonds with tunable strength, multivalency, and directionality. When amorphous polymers are grafted to nanoparticles that are one magnitude larger in size than individual polymers, programming grafted chain conformations can &#8220;synthesize&#8221; high&#8208;performance nanocomposites with moduli of &#8776;25GPa and a circular lifecycle without forming and/or breaking chemical bonds. These nanocomposites dissipate external stresses by disentangling and stretching grafted polymers up to &#8776;98% of their contour length, analogous to that of folded proteins; use both polymers and nanoparticles for load bearing; and exhibit a non&#8208;linear dependence on composition throughout the microscopic, nanoscopic, and single&#8208;particle levels.

         <title>Enhancing Photovoltaically Preferred Orientation in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite for Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nicotinamide derivatives with multi&#8208;functional groups modulate crystal growth and mitigate defects in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite, favoring the photovoltaically preferred (100) facet and energy band alignment, enabling efficient and stable single&#8208;junction wide&#8208;bandgap and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells with efficiencies of 19.34% and 28.57%, respectively.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG PSCs) have promising applications in tandem devices yet suffer from low open&#8208;circuit voltages (VOCs) and less stability. To address these issues, the study introduces multifunctional nicotinamide derivatives into WBG PSCs, leveraging the regulation on photovoltaically preferential orientation and optoelectronic properties via diverse functional groups, e.g., carbonyl, amino. Isonicotinamide (IA) molecule emerges as the most effective agent, enhancing crystallization kinetics and defect passivation due to its unique planar spatial configuration. Incorporating IA into WBG perovskites improves the (100) preferred crystal orientation, reduces trap density, and enables well&#8208;matched energy band alignment. High&#8208;performance 1.77&#160;eV WBG PSCs are achieved with a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.34% and a VOC of 1.342&#160;V, leading to the fabrication of the best&#8208;performing all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell with a PCE of 28.53% (certified 28.27%) and excellent operational stability, maintaining over 90% of the initial efficiency under 1 sun illumination for 600 h.

         <title>Fe/Mo&#8208;Based Lipid Peroxidation Nanoamplifier Combined with Adenosine Immunometabolism Regulation to Augment Anti&#8208;Breast Cancer Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe/Mo&#8208;based LPO nanoamplifier (FMO@P NPs) realizes LPO amplification through GSH depletion and ROS burst for ICD evocation, which combines with immunometabolic checkpoint A2AR blockage for enhancing ICD&#8208;mediated immunotherapy by relieving ADO&#8208;related immunosuppression. This novel joint strategy completely ablates the primary tumor and inhibits the metastasis and recurrence of breast cancer.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;mediated immunization strategies have great potential against breast cancer. However, traditional strategies neglect the increase in the immunosuppressive metabolite, adenosine (ADO), during ICD, leading to insufficient therapeutic outcomes. In this study, it is found that the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) is significantly expressed in breast cancer and positively associated with regulatory T (Treg) cells. Herein, a strategy combining Fe/Mo&#8208;based lipid peroxidation (LPO) nanoamplifiers and A2AR blockade is reported to maximize ICD&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;tumor immunity. This LPO nanoamplifier causes LPO explosion by the Fe (II)&#8208;mediated Fenton reaction and Mo(V)&#8208;mediated Russell mechanism. Subsequently, it elicits the ICD magnification of tumor cells by inducing multiple regulated cell death patterns of ferroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Additionally, the A2AR antagonist (SCH58261), an immunometabolic checkpoint blocker, is found to relieve ADO&#8208;related immunosuppression, amplify anti&#8208;tumor immunological effects, and elicit immune memory responses. This robust anti&#8208;tumor immunity is observed in primary, distant, pulmonary metastatic, and recurrent tumors. This study provides a novel strategy for optimizing ICD&#8208;mediated immunotherapy and highlights the benefits of combining LPO explosion with A2AR blockade to enhance breast cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Buried Interface Modulation Using Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer and Ionic Liquid Hybrids for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite and Perovskite/CuInGaSe2 Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface modulation approach that utilizes ionic liquid to enhance the uniformity of self&#8208;assembled monolayer distribution and to regulate the high&#8208;quality growth of perovskites is pioneered. This method has demonstrated impressive efficiencies of 25.68% and 22.53% for normal&#8208;bandgap (NBG) and wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), respectively. Furthermore, four&#8208;terminal (4T) perovskite/CIGS solar cells with an efficiency of 28.34% are achieved.








Abstract
Effective modifications for the buried interface between self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) and perovskites are vital for the development of efficient, stable inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and their tandem photovoltaics. Herein, an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;SAM hybrid strategy is developed to synergistically optimize the uniformity of SAMs and the crystallization of perovskites above. Specifically, an ionic liquid of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;3&#8208;iumbis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)amide (BMIMTFSI) is incorporated into the SAM solution, enabling reduced surface roughness, improved wettability, and a more evenly distributed surface potential of the SAM film. Leveraging this optimized substrate, a favorable growth of high&#8208;quality perovskite crystals is achieved. Furthermore, the introduced functional ions readily bond with the perovskites, effectively passivating undesirable cation or halide vacancies of the perovskite near the buried interface. Remarkably, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.68% and 22.53% are obtained for normal&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.55&#160;eV) and wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) (&#8776;1.66&#160;eV) PSCs along with improved operational stability. Additionally, a champion PCE of 19.50% is achieved for semitransparent WBG PSCs, further delivering an impressive PCE of 28.34% for integrated four&#8208;terminal tandem photovoltaics when combined with CuInGaSe2 solar cells.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elastocaloric thermal battery based on distinctive phase&#8208;change alloys is developed, which stably stores low&#8208;temperature waste heat as latent heat and releases it on demand through applied stress at ambient temperature. These alloys, with desired transformation characteristics, are efficiently discovered using a generative learning&#8208;enabled inverse design framework, which converts the hand&#8208;drawn target heat flow curve into tangible compositional and processing designs.









Abstract
An elastocaloric thermal battery based on generative learning&#8208;designed phase&#8208;change alloys is developed to facilitate the efficient recycling of low&#8208;temperature waste heat. This battery stores thermal energy as latent heat in a phase&#8208;change alloy and releases it on demand through applied stress at ambient temperature. Alloy compositions and corresponding processing parameters, tailored to desired transformation characteristics, are efficiently discovered through a generative learning&#8208;enabled inverse design framework, which converts the hand&#8208;drawn target heat flow curve into tangible compositional and processing designs.

         <title>Control of Two Solid Electrolyte Interphases at the Negative Electrode of an Anode&#8208;Free All Solid&#8208;State Battery based on Argyrodite Electrolyte</title>

Anode&#8208;free all solid&#8208;state batteries employ &#8220;empty&#8221; current collector with three active interfaces that determine electrochemical stability; lithium metal &#8208; SE interphase (SEI&#8208;1), lithium &#8208; current collector interface, and collector &#8208; SE interphase (SEI&#8208;2). Bilayer of 140 nm magnesium/30 nm tungsten (Mg/W&#8211;Cu) controls the three interfaces and allows for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance in half&#8208;cells and full cells.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free all solid&#8208;state batteries (AF&#8208;ASSBs) employ &#8220;empty&#8221; current collector with three active interfaces that determine electrochemical stability; lithium metal &#8211; Solid electrolyte (SE) interphase (SEI&#8208;1), lithium &#8211; current collector interface, and collector &#8211; SE interphase (SEI&#8208;2). Argyrodite Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) solid electrolyte (SE) displays SEI&#8208;2 containing copper sulfides, formed even at open circuit. Bilayer of 140&#160;nm magnesium/30&#160;nm tungsten (Mg/W&#8208;Cu) controls the three interfaces and allows for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance in half&#8208;cells and fullcells. AF&#8208;ASSB with NMC811 cathode achieves 150 cycles with Coulombic efficiency (CE) above 99.8%. With high mass&#8208;loading cathode (8.6 mAh cm&#8722;2), AF&#8208;ASSB retains 86.5% capacity after 45 cycles at 0.2C. During electrodeposition of Li, gradient Li&#8208;Mg solid solution is formed, which reverses upon electrodissolution. This promotes conformal wetting/dewetting by Li and stabilizes SEI&#8208;1 by lowering thermodynamic driving force for SE reduction. Inert refractory W underlayer is required to prevent ongoing formation of SEI&#8208;2 that also drives electrochemical degradation. Inert Mo and Nb layers likewise protect Cu from corroding, while Li&#8208;alloying layers (Mg, Sn) are less effective due to ongoing volume changes and associated pulverization. Mechanistic explanation for observed Li segregation within alloying LixMg layer is provided through mesoscale modelling, considering opposing roles of diffusivity differences and interfacial stresses.

         <title>Colloid&#8208;Forming Prodrug&#8208;Hydrogel Composite Prolongs Lower Intraocular Pressure in Rodent Eyes after Subconjunctival Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal drug aggregates (CDAs) are repurposed as a platform for long&#8208;acting ocular drug delivery. Timolol palmitate CDAs are stabilized within an in situ gelling hydrogel and injected subconjunctivally, reducing intraocular pressure (IOP)&#160;for 49 d with lower systemic exposure compared to conventional eye drops. This approach transforms CDAs into a promising tool for sustained, localized drug delivery.








Abstract
Colloidal drug aggregates (CDAs) are challenging in drug discovery due to their unpredictable formation and interference with screening assays. These limitations are turned into a strategic advantage by leveraging CDAs as a drug delivery platform. This study explores the deliberate formation and stabilization of CDAs for local ocular drug delivery, using a modified smallmolecule glaucoma drug. A series of timolol prodrugs are synthesized and self&#8208;assembled into CDAs. Of four prodrugs, timolol palmitate CDAs have a critical aggregate concentration of 2.72&#160;&#181;M and sustained in vitro release over 28 d. Timolol palmitate CDAs are dispersed throughout in situ gelling hyaluronan&#8208;oxime hydrogel and injected into the subconjunctival space of rat eyes. The intraocular pressure is significantly reduced for at least 49 d with a single subconjunctival injection of timolol&#8208;palmitate CDAs compared to 6&#160;h for conventional timolol maleate. The systemic blood concentrations of timolol are significantly lower, even after 6&#160;h, for timolol palmitate CDA&#8208;loaded hydrogel versus free timolol maleate, thereby potentially reducing the risk of systemic side effects. This innovative approach redefines the role of CDAs and provides a framework for long&#8208;acting ocular therapeutics, shifting their perception from a drug screening challenge to a powerful tool for sustained local drug delivery.

         <title>Linear Enhanced 3D Nanofluid Force&#8208;Electric Conversion Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D ANF/CNF nanofluidic membrane is developed for using a passive linear force&#8208;electric conversion device, which demonstrates high flux, high porosity, and short ion transport path, overcoming the limitation of the inherent trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity in traditional 1D and 2D membranes. This work provides valuable insights for future research on highly sensitive force sensors.








Abstract
The inherent trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity has constrained further improvement of passive linear force&#8208;electric conversion performance in nanofluidic pressure sensors. To overcome this limitation, a 3D nanofluidic membrane with high mechanical strength utilizing aramid nanofibers/carbon nanofiber (ANF/CNF) dual crosslinking is developed. Due to the abundant surface functional groups of CNF and the high mechanical strength of ANF, this large&#8208;scale integrated 3D nanofluidic membrane exhibits advantages of high flux, high porosity, and short ion transport path, demonstrating superior force&#8208;electric response compared to conventional 1D and 2D configurations. The enhancement mechanism of the ANF/CNF membrane is systematically investigated through experimental results and theoretical calculations. The optimized device has a sensitivity of 111 nA cm&#8722;2&#160;kPa&#8722;1, a response/recovery time of 63/68&#160;ms, and a stability of 45&#160;000 cycles. This study successfully overcomes the inherent performance limitations of traditional nanofluidic membranes, offering promising potential for applications across artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and smart wearable devices.

         <title>Ultrafast Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport Engineered by Nanoconfinement Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast ion transport behavior based on the nanoconfinement effect has been explored. Utilizing nanochannels of graphene oxide laminar membranes (GOLMs), the Li+ ionic conductivity exceeding 102 mS cm&#8722;1 is realized, one to three orders of magnitude higher than traditional liquid or solid lithium&#8208;ion electrolytes. These results inspire the development of ultrafast ion transport for efficient energy storage applications.








Abstract
Amid the burgeoning demand for electrochemical energy storage and neuromorphic computing, fast ion transport behavior has attracted widespread attention at both fundamental and practical levels. Here, based on the nanoconfined channel of graphene oxide laminar membranes (GOLMs), the lithium ionic conductivity typically exceeding 102 mS cm&#8722;1 is realized, one to three orders of magnitude higher than traditional liquid or solid lithium&#8208;ion electrolyte. Specifically, the nanoconfined lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6)&#8208;ethylene carbonate (EC)/ dimethyl carbonate (DMC) electrolyte demonstrates the ionic conductivity of 170 mS cm&#8722;1, outperforming the bulk counterpart by &#8776;16 fold. At the ultralow temperature of &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, the nanoconfined electrolyte also maintains a practically useful conductivity of 11 mS cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the in situ experimental and theoretical framework enables to attribute the enhanced ionic conductivity to the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer cations and anions distribution induced by high surface charge and nanoconfinement effects in GO nanochannels. More importantly, integrating such rapid lithium&#8208;ion transport nanochannel into the LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode significantly improves the high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycle performance of lithium batteries. These results exhibit the convention&#8208;breaking ionic conductivity of nanoconfined electrolytes, inspiring the development of ultrafast ion diffusion pathways based on 2D nanoconfined channels for efficient energy storage applications.

         <title>Transformation&#8208;Invariant Laplacian Metadevices Robust to Environmental Variation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the recently proposed transformation&#8208;invariant metamaterial, a DC cloak made of judiciously stacked copper/air multilayer is successfully constructed. It shows a robust cloaking performance even if the background conductivity varies from 22 to 859 kS&#160;m&#8722;1, which demonstrates significantly improved environment&#8208;immune properties compared with those of conventional cloaks, for example traditional TO cloak and bi&#8208;layer cloak.








Abstract
As one of the typical applications of metamaterials, the invisibility cloak has raised vast research interests. After many years&#8217; research efforts, the invisibility cloak has extended its applicability from optics and acoustics to electrostatics and thermal diffusion. One scientific challenge that has significantly restricted the practical application of the invisibility cloak is the strong background dependence, that is, all passive cloaking devices realized thus far are unable to resist variation in the background refractive index. To tackle such a challenge, the concept of transformation&#8208;invariant metamaterials (TIMs) is applied to static&#8208;field systems and shows that, for any physical fields governed by Laplace equation, judiciously designed TIMs can be used to realize invisibility cloaks robust to the environment variation. As an experimental proof, an ideal direct current (DC) cloak&#8208;is implemented based on TIMs and near&#8208;field measurement results demonstrate that such a cloak can successfully conceal a large&#8208;scale object when the background conductivity varies from 22 to 859 kS&#160;m&#8722;1. Moreover, the background&#8208;immune cloaking effect is observed under arbitrary electric sources. The approach proposed in this work can be also applied to static magnetics, thermal diffusion, and beyond, enabling robust isolation of the target from the external field in versatile application scenarios.

         <title>Extending Exciton Diffusion Length via an Organic&#8208;Metal Platinum Complex Additive for High&#8208;Performance Thick&#8208;Film Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8208;metal platinum complex (TTz&#8208;Pt) is synthesized and employed as a solid additive. Benefiting from the prolonged exciton diffusion length (LD) in the TTz&#8208;Pt&#8208;treated device, a champion PCE of 20.12% (certified as 19.54%) is obtained for 100 nm&#8208;thick D18:L8&#8208;BO:IDIC OSCs. Impressively, the 300 nm&#8208;thick D18:L8&#8208;BO:IDIC OSCs achieve an outstanding PCE of 18.84%, the record value for 300 nm&#8208;thick OSCs.








Abstract
The long exciton diffusion length (LD) plays an important role in promoting exciton dissociation, suppressing charge recombination, and improving the charge transport process, thereby improving the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially in thick&#8208;film OSCs. However, the limited LD hinders further improvement in device performance as the film thickness increases. Here, an organic&#8208;metal platinum complex, namely TTz&#8208;Pt, is synthesized and served as a solid additive into the D18&#8208;Cl:L8&#8208;BO system. The addition of TTz&#8208;Pt enhanced the crystallinity of blends, reduced energy disorder, and trap density, and decreased non&#8208;radiative recombination and exciton binding energy, which is conducive to prolonging the LD in the TTz&#8208;Pt&#8208;treated film, thereby facilitating the exciton dissociation and charge transport process along with inhibiting the charge recombination. Consequently, the TTz&#8208;Pt&#8208;treated D18:L8&#8208;BO:IDIC device (100&#160;nm) exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.12% (certified as 19.54%), one of the highest PCEs reported for OSCs to date. Remarkably, a record&#8208;breaking PCE of 18.84% is yielded for the active layer thickness of 300&#160;nm. Furthermore, the TTz&#8208;Pt exhibits superior universality in improving the performance of OSCs. This work provides a simple and universal approach to extending LD by introducing an organic&#8208;metal platinum complex as a solid additive to achieve highly efficient thick&#8208;film OSCs.

         <title>Constructing the Dirac Electronic Behavior Database of Under&#8208;Stress Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Broad Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing advanced technology to efficiently screen the Dirac materials in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is highly critical for achieving advanced photoelectric properties. This work reports the establishment of a comprehensive database including 90 types of TMDCs and investigates their response behaviors under external strains regarding the presence of Dirac cones and electronic structure evolutions, supplying information from electronic perspectives.








Abstract
Discovering and utilizing the unique optoelectronic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is of great significance for developing next&#8208;generation electronic devices. In particular, research on Dirac state modulations of TMDCs under external strains is lacking. To fill this research gap, it has established a comprehensive database of 90 types of TMDCs and their response behaviors under external strains have been systematically investigated regarding the presence of Dirac cones and electronic structure evolutions. Among all the conditions, 27.3% of the TMDCs are Dirac materials with three distinct types of Dirac cones, which are mainly attributed to the electron localizations induced by external strains. TMDCs based on tellurides with 1H phase favor the formation of Dirac cones under stresses, leading to metallic&#8208;like properties and ultra&#8208;fast charge transportation. Correlations among Dirac cones, energy, electronic properties, and lattice structures have been revealed, offering critical references for modulating the properties of well&#8208;known TMDCs. More importantly, it has confirmed that the phase transition points are not sufficient for the appearance of Dirac cones. This work provides critical guidance to facilitate the development of TMDCs&#8208;based superconducting and optoelectronic devices for broad applications.

         <title>Environmental Sustainability of Natural Biopolymer&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Lithium Ion Battery Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twenty&#8208;one biopolymer electrolytes including membrane&#8208;liquid electrolytes, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are synthesized to analyze their electrochemical properties and environmental impacts through life cycle assessment. This consistent and comparable study demonstrates the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes for batteries, guiding academia and industry in fundamental studies and applied implementation of sustainable bio&#8208;based polymers and biopolymer electrolytes.








Abstract
Biopolymer based electrolytes can overcome current performance limitations of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Biopolymers enable electrolytes with high ionic conductivities and wide electrochemical stability windows. While the biobased character of natural materials is claimed as an inherent advantage in meeting current environmental sustainability challenges, further research is required to quantify and compare their environmental impacts as electrolytes. The challenge is addressed by identifying the most promising biopolymer electrolytes for LIBs, measuring ionic conductivities and electrochemical stability windows, and quantifying environmental impacts using life cycle assessment. The environmental impacts of the cost to isolate cellulose derivatives, nanocelluloses, chitin/nanochitin, chitosan, lignin, agar, and silk are reported for climate change, acidification, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, human toxicity, and water use. Material criticality, circularity index, and material circularity indicator, emerging impact categories are prioritized to help integrate biopolymers into circular and sustainable materials. The electrochemical properties and environmental impacts of natural biopolymer membrane&#8208;liquid electrolyte pairs, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are quantified and benchmarked against conventional fossil&#8208;based electrolytes, providing consistent and comparable electrochemical properties of the most relevant biopolymer electrolytes fabricated so far. This study highlights the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes and identifies the most electrochemically competitive biopolymer electrolytes in LIBs.

         <title>Passive Isothermal Flexible Sensor Enabled by Smart Thermal&#8208;Regulating Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A passive isothermal flexible sensor enabled by radiative cooling and heat insulation for adapting dynamic thermal conditions is demonstrated. In summer, when solar radiation is high, PDRC prevails and achieves radiative cooling. Conversely, ambient temperature is low in winter, and the thermal insulation reduces heat loss. The prepared sensor can maintain the working temperature over a temperature range of 0&#8722;100&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Environmentally induced sensor temperature fluctuations can distort the outputs of a sensor, reducing their stability during long&#8208;term health monitoring. Here, a passive isothermal flexible sensor is proposed by using hierarchical cellulose aerogel (HCA) as the top tribonegative layer, which allows the sensor to adapt dynamic thermal environments through both radiative cooling and heat insulation. The radiative cooling effect can cool down the temperatures of a sensor in summer, while the hollow microfibers in HCA provide ultralow thermal conductivity to reduce internal heat loss in winter. The prepared passive isothermal sensor is capable of maintaining the rated working temperature over an extensive temperature range of 0&#8722;100&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating for gripping hot and cold objects. While monitoring human movements under direct sunlight, the temperature of a conventional sensor rose by 12.3&#160;&#176;C, whereas the sensor experienced an increase of only 0.3&#160;&#176;C. Therefore, this work presents a promising strategy for adapting to environments, enabling wearable electronics to function effectively in dynamic thermal conditions.

         <title>The sp Hybridization of Tin Single Atoms for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of dendrite&#8208;free Na anodes via the universal synthesis of the fourth main group single&#8208;atom materials (Sn, Ge, Pb SAs/G) with sp hybridization is demonstrated. The in situ observation and theoretical calculations essentially disclose that the 5s25p2
 electron configuration of Sn SAs/G surface enables the planar deposition mechanism of Na clusters, thereby suppressing the growth of dendrites.









Abstract
Restricting the growth of sodium (Na) dendrites at the atomic level is the premise to enable both the stability and safety of sodium metal batteries (SMBs). Here, the universal synthesis of the fourth main group element (Sn, Ge, Pb) as single metal atoms anchored on graphene (Sn, Ge, Pb SAs/G) with sp hybridization for dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anode is reported. The in situ real&#8208;time observation of Na growth on Sn SAs/G uncoils a kinetically uniform planar deposition at the atomic level for substantially suppressing the dendrite growth. The symmetrical Sn SAs/G&#8208;Na battery exhibits high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% for 200 cycles, long&#8208;term cyclability with 600&#160;h at 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and ultralow overpotential of 40&#160;mV at 8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Further, the full batteries Na3V2(PO4)3||Sn SAs/G&#8208;Na show unprecedented rate capability of 67 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 C and a capacity retention as high as 91% after 500 cycles. The theoretical calculations of Na deposition on different M SAs/G (M&#9552;Sn, Ni, Zn, Fe, Co) reveal that the 5s
25p
2 electron configuration of Sn SAs/G realizes the planar deposition mechanism of Na clusters along the graphene plane. Therefore, this work provides an atom&#8208;level accurate miniaturization strategy for constructing dendrite&#8208;free SMBs.

         <title>Bioinspired Liquid Pockets with Externally Induced Internal Microscale Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired liquid pockets material with an externally activated unit induces internal microscale to flow through the reversible transfer of interflowing fluid within interconnected pockets, enabling controlled internal flow and adaptive barrier functionality. This material exhibits a new pathway for regulating flow at responsive material interfaces, supporting applications such as sequential drug release, self&#8208;cleaning, antifouling, and anti&#8208;swelling.








Abstract
The gastric mucosal barrier, through its gastric pits, serves as a pathway for secretions, ensuring that mucus produced by the gastric glands is transferred to the gastric lumen, providing stable protection. Here a bioinspired liquid pockets material is shown, composed of a thermo&#8208;driven hydrogel that acts as an external activation unit to release interflowing liquid responsively, and porous matrices that serve as interconnected pockets to transfer it, enabling controlled internal flow and adaptive barrier functionality. Experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate the stability and regulatory mechanisms of these liquid pockets, based on the interconnected pockets between the external activation unit and internal fluid flow. It exhibits a new pathway for regulating microscale flow at responsive material interfaces, enabling applications from sequential drug release, self&#8208;cleaning, and antifouling to anti&#8208;swelling. These unique capabilities address long&#8208;standing challenges in microscale flow control, with potential impacts in diverse fields including microfluidics, drug delivery, medical devices, 3D printing, and beyond.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Perspective on Materials Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective discusses natural materials as inspiration for sustainable engineering designs and the processing of materials. First, circularity, longevity, parsimony, and activity are presented as essential material paradigms. The perspective then uses many examples of natural and technical materials to introduce principles such as oligo&#8208;materiality, multifunctionality, modularity, defect tolerance, remodeling, healing, adaptivity, as well as controlled disintegration.








Abstract
The article explores materials sustainability through a bio&#8208;inspired lens and discusses paradigms that can reshape the understanding of material synthesis, processing, and usage. It addresses various technological fields, from structural engineering to healthcare, and emphasizes natural material cycles as a blueprint for efficient recycling and reuse. The study shows that material functionality depends on both chemical composition and structural modifications, which emphasizes the role of material processing. The article identifies strategies such as mono&#8208;materiality and multifunctionality, and explores how responsivity, adaptivity, modularity, and cellularity can simplify material assembly and disassembly. Bioinspired strategies for reusing materials, defect tolerance, maintenance, remodeling, and healing may extend product lifespans. The principles of circularity, longevity, and parsimony are reconsidered in the context of &#8220;active materiality&#8221;, a dynamic bio&#8208;inspired paradigm. This concept expands the traditional focus of material science from structure&#8208;function relationships to include the development of materials capable of responding or adapting to external stimuli. Concrete examples demonstrate how bio&#8208;inspired strategies are being applied in engineering and technology to enhance the sustainability of materials. The article concludes by emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration as a key factor for developing a sustainable and resilient materials economy in harmony with nature's material cycles.

         <dc:description>
Nanosensor with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging capability is developed to explore the mechanism by which diabetes promoting breast cancer progression. Animal experiments demonstrate that diabetes causes elevated nitric oxide levels in the tumor microenvironment. RNA&#8208;seq results reveal that diabetes may promote tumor growth by weaking immune response, inhibiting apoptosis, and promoting the expression of carcinogens related to Nos2.








Abstract
Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common cause of cancer induced death worldwide. Current statistics has disclosed that the diabetic BC patients have significantly worse survival rate compared with nondiabetic BC patients. However, the specific mechanism is still being explored. Herein, a novel NIR&#8208;II nanosensor DNPS&#160;for nitric oxide (NO) with fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA)&#160;imaging capability is developed to explore the mechanism by which diabetes promoting breast cancer progression. In diabetic BC model, DNPS exhibits great advantages of low intrinsic background, high sensitivity, and deep tissue penetration and successfully confirmed the expression level of NO is higher than BC model, indicating that diabetes causes elevated nitric oxide levels in the tumor microenvironment. RNA&#8208;seq analysis results show&#160;that hyperglycemia caused by diabetes leads to weakened immune response and initiates the transcription and translation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene to produce NO. Besides, the increased expression of carcinogens related to Nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2), such as Spp1, Mmp11, and Kitl, causes breast cancer to develop more rapidly. Here, NIR&#8208;II imaging probe is applied first&#160;to study diabetes&#8208;related breast cancer and certain reference value is provided for subsequent research on the mechanism of diabetes promoting the progression of breast cancer.

         <title>Transforming Plastics to Single Atom Catalysts for Peroxymonosulfate Activation: Axial Chloride Coordination Intensified Electron Transfer Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalyst with atomically dispersed FeN4Cl sites (Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C) is produced from high&#8208;density polyethylene and applied in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation and water purification. Both experiments and density functional theory computations demonstrate that the axial incorporation of chloride fine&#8208;tunes the coordination environment of FeN4 sites and enhances PMS activation because of improved carbon substrate conductivity and modulated spin state.








Abstract
Transforming plastics into single&#8208;atom catalysts is a promising strategy for upcycling waste plastics into value&#8208;added functional materials. Herein, a graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalyst with atomically dispersed FeN4Cl sites (Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C) is produced from high&#8208;density polyethylene wastes via one&#8208;pot catalytic pyrolysis. The Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C catalyst exhibited much higher turnover frequency and surface area normalized activity (Kac) compared with the Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C catalyst without axial Cl modulation. Both experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computations demonstrated that the axial incorporation of chloride fine&#8208;tuned the coordination environment of FeN4 sites and enhanced peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation because of improved conductivity and modulated spin state. In situ, Raman, and infrared spectroscopic techniques revealed that PMS is activated by the Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C catalyst through an electron transfer process. The formation of a key PMS* intermediate at the Fe site effectively elevated the redox capacity of the catalyst surface to realize a fast degradation of diverse pollutants. The non&#8208;radical oxidation manner secures high selectivity toward target pollutants and high chemical utilization efficiency. A continuous operation in a column reactor also demonstrated the high efficiency and stability of the (Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C + PMS) system for practical water treatment.
