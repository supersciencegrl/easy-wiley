         <title>Directional Shunting of Photogenerated Carriers in POM@MOF for Promoting Nitrogen Adsorption and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 composite is prepared by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction, which realizes an effective photocatalyst for storing and relaying oxidation N2 by inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers under mild conditions. The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits the high N2 adsorption capacity (250.5&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1) and superior N2 oxidation performance to produce HNO3 (702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The efficient catalysis of nitrogen (N2) into high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing products plays a crucial role in the N economic cycle. However, weak N2 adsorption and invalid N2 activation remain two major bottlenecks in rate&#8208;determining steps, leading to low N2 fixation performance. Herein, an effective dual active sites photocatalyst of polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is highlighted via altering coordination microenvironment and inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers to facilitate N2/catalyst interaction and enhance oxidation performance. MOFs create more open unsaturated metal cluster sites with unoccupied d orbital possessing Lewis acidity to accept electrons from the 3&#963;g bonding orbital of N2 for storage by combining with POMs to replace bidentate linkers. POMs act as electron sponges donating electrons to MOFs, while the holes directional flow to POMs. The hole&#8208;rich POMs with strong oxidation capacity are easily involved in oxidizing adsorbed N2. Taking UiO&#8208;66 (C48H28O32Zr6) and Mo72Fe30 ([Mo72Fe30O252(CH3COO)12{Mo2O7(H2O)}2{H2Mo2O8(H2O)}(H2O)91]&#183;150H2O) as an example, Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 shows twofold enhanced adsorption of N2 (250.5&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) than UiO&#8208;66 (122.9&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1) at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1. And, the HNO3 yield of Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 is 702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;7&#160;times and 24 times higher than UiO&#8208;66 and Mo72Fe30. This work provides reliable value for the storage and relaying artificial N2 fixation.

         <title>Toward Chiral Lasing from All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Flexible Perovskite&#8208;Nanocrystal&#8211;Liquid&#8208;Crystal Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing membrane consisting of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) layers is demonstrated. Two CLCs layers with same helical structure act as reflectors to construct a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. The selective reflection of CLCs leads to polarization selectivity. The membrane device is highly flexible and all&#8208;solution&#8208;processable and exhibits a high dissymmetry factor of 1.4.








Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) coherent light sources are of great potential for various advanced optical applications spanning displays/imaging to data processing/encryption and quantum communication. Here, the first demonstration of CP amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing and flexible membrane device is reported. The membrane device consists of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs)&#160;layers sandwiched within a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (F&#8211;P) cavity architecture. The chiral liquid crystal cavity enables the generation of CP light from the device. The device is completely solution&#8208;processable and displays CP ASE with record dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 1.4, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher as compared with glum of CP luminescence of chiral ligand&#8208;capped colloidal PNCs. The device exhibits ultraflexibility as the ASE intensity remains unchanged after repeated 100 bending cycles and it is stable for more than 3 months with 80% of its original intensity. Furthermore, the ultraflexibility enables the generation of ASE from various objects of different geometric surfaces covered with the flexible perovskite membrane device. This work not only demonstrates the first CP ASE from a PNCs membrane with extremely high glum but also opens the door toward the fabrication of ultraflexible, extremely stable, and all solution&#8208;processable perovskite chiral laser devices.

         <title>Mimicking Antioxidases and Hyaluronan Synthase: A Zwitterionic Nanozyme for Photothermal Therapy of Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal dual&#8208;bionic nanozyme (MPMP), mimicking antioxidases and hyaluronan synthase, is developed for effective osteoarthritis (OA) therapy, which can produce heat, scavenge free radical and promote chondrogenesis even if under inflammatory conditions. This nanozyme regulates anabolic and catabolic processes simultaneously, thereby restoring joint homeostasis effectively and demonstrating an admirable photothermally therapeutic&#160; effect on OA.








Abstract
Restoring joint homeostasis is crucial for relieving osteoarthritis (OA). Current strategies are limited to unilateral efforts in joint lubrication, inhibition of inflammation, free radicals scavenging, and cartilage regeneration. Herein, by modifying molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with Mg2+&#8208;doped polydopamine and coating with polysulfobetaines, a dual&#8208;bionic photothermal nanozyme (MPMP) is constructed to mimic antioxidases/hyaluronan synthase for OA therapy. Photothermally enhanced lubrication lowers the coefficient of friction (0.028) in the early stage of OA treatment. The antioxidases&#8208;mimicking properties of MPMP nanozyme contribute to eliminating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) (over 90% of scavenging ratio for H2O2/&#183;OH/O&#183;2&#8211;/DPPH/ABTS+) and supplying O2. With NIR irradiation, the MPMP nanozyme triggers thermogenesis (upregulating HSP70 expression) and Mg2+ release, which promotes the chondrogenesis in inflammatory conditions by deactivating NF&#8208;&#954;B/IL&#8208;17 signaling pathways and enhancing MAPK signaling pathway. Benefiting from HSP70 and Mg2+, MPMP&#8208;NIR shows HAS&#8208;mimicking activity to increase the intracellular (twofold) and extracellular (3.12&#8208;fold) HA production. Therefore, MPMP&#8208;NIR demonstrates superior spatiotemporally therapeutic effect on OA in mice model, in terms of osteophytes (83.41% of reduction), OARSI scores (88.57% of reduction), and ACAN expression (2.70&#8208;fold of increment). Hence, insights into dual&#8208;bionic nanozymes can be a promising strategy for OA therapy or other inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

Infrared nanoimaging reveals propagating phonon polaritons on wafer&#8208;scale nanometer&#8208;thick hexagonal boron nitride grown by chemical vapor deposition. The material quality allows for the fabrication of phonon polariton nanoresonators with quality factors comparable to those fabricated from exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride, paving the way for wafer&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Polaritons in layered materials (LMs) are a promising platform to manipulate and control light at the nanometer scale. Thus, the observation of polaritons in wafer&#8208;scale LMs is critically important for the development of industrially relevant nanophotonics and optoelectronics applications. In this work, phonon polaritons (PhPs) in wafer&#8208;scale multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) grown by chemical vapor deposition are reported. By infrared nanoimaging, the PhPs are visualized, and PhP lifetimes of &#8776;0.6&#160;ps are measured, comparable to that of micromechanically exfoliated multilayer hBN. Further, PhP nanoresonators are demonstrated. Their quality factors of &#8776;50 are about 0.7 times that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices based on exfoliated hBN. These results can enable PhP&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopy (e.g., for gas sensing) and infrared photodetector applications.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Driven Tribo&#8208;Electrophoresis Enabled Human&#8211;Droplet Interaction in 3D Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel human&#8211;droplet interaction platform rooted in the TEP approach is demonstrated, eliminating the need for complex electrodes and external power sources. By employing a well&#8208;designed triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer, precise and flexible manipulation of droplets in 3D space is achieved through human motion, fostering enhanced synergy and flexibility between humans and droplets.








Abstract
Electronically controlled droplet manipulation has widespread applications in biochemistry, life sciences, and industry. However, current technologies such as electrowetting, electrostatics, and surface charge printing rely on complex electrode arrays and external power supplies, leading to inefficient manipulation. In light of these limitations, a novel method is proposed, which&#160;leverages tribo&#8208;electrophoresis (TEP) to pipette in an oil medium, thereby enabling human&#8211;droplet interactions to be constructed with greater efficiency. The approach involves the rational design of a triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer&#160;that generates an electric field to charge the droplet and improves the maneuverability of the charged droplet, including aligned/non&#8208;aligned pipetting and stable transport in the clamped state, which can be accomplished solely by hand motion. The TEP method not only provides droplets with freedom to move in three dimensions but also offers a feasibility case for chemical reactions in the liquid phase and non&#8208;invasive sample extraction. This breakthrough establishes a cornerstone for human&#8211;droplet interactions capitalized on triboelectric nanogenerators, opening new avenues for research in droplet manipulation.

         <title>UV&#8208;Curing&#8208;Enhanced Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy to enhance long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing is reported, by which amorphous organic LPL materials show broader application prospects.








Abstract
Amorphous organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence materials (OLPLMs) can realize simpler solution processing and large&#8208;area uniform luminescence, where the luminescent properties are significantly influenced by the rigid environment. However, research on utilizing the rigidity to promote long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) properties of amorphous OLPLMs is still relatively rare due to the lack of an unambiguous and effective strategy to construct the rigid environment. Here, a universal strategy is proposed to enhance the LPL performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing, which utilizes the rigid environment constructed by UV curing to promote the interaction between host and guest, thus inducing a generation of materials with highly efficient LPL performance. This solution&#8208;processable, large&#8208;area, and &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;realize&#8221; material fabrication strategy can make amorphous OLPLMs show broader application prospects in some fields, such as anti&#8208;counterfeiting, nondestructive detection, and pattern marking or indication.

         <title>Mid&#8208;Infrared Bipolar and Unipolar Linear Polarization Detections in Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Detecting and distinguishing light polarization states, one of the most basic elements of optical fields, have significant importance in both scientific studies and industry applications. Artificially fabricated structures, e.g., metasurfaces with anisotropic absorptions, have shown the capabilities of detecting polarization light and controlling polarization ratios (PRs). However, their operations mainly rely on resonant absorptions based on structural designs that are usually narrow band. Here, we demonstrate a mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) broadband polarization photodetector with high PRs and wavelength&#8208;dependent polarities using a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) anisotropic/isotropic Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 van der Waals (vdWs) heterostructure. It is shown that the photodetector exhibits high PRs of 48 and 34 at 4.6&#160;&#956;m and 11.0&#160;&#956;m wavelengths, respectively, and even a negative PR of &#8208;3.38 for 3.7&#160;&#956;m under the zero bias condition at room temperature. Such interesting results can be attributed to the superimposed effects of a photovoltaic (PV) mechanism in the Nb2GeTe4/MoS2 hetero&#8208;junction region and a bolometric mechanism in the MoS2 layer. Furthermore, the photodetector demonstrates its effectiveness in bipolar and unipolar polarization encoding communications and polarization imaging enabled by its unique and high PRs.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Configurable MXene&#8208;Based Thermoacoustic Loudspeakers with Tunable Sound Directivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Film&#8208;type shape&#8208;configurable speakers with tunable sound directivity are in high demand for wearable electronics. Flexible, thin thermoacoustic (TA) loudspeakers&#8212;which are free from bulky vibrating diaphragms&#8212;show promise in this regard. However, configuring thin TA loudspeakers into arbitrary shapes is challenging because of their low sound pressure level (SPL) under mechanical deformations and low conformability to other surfaces. By carefully controlling the heat&#8208;capacity&#8208;per&#8208;unit&#8208;area and thermal effusivity of an MXene conductor and substrates, respectively, we fabricated an ultrathin MXene&#8208;based TA loudspeaker exhibiting high SPL output (74.5&#160;dB at 15&#160;kHz) and stable sound performance for 14 days. Loudspeakers with the parylene substrate, whose thickness was less than the thermal penetration depth, generated bidirectional and deformation&#8208;independent sound in bent, twisted, cylindrical, and stretched&#8208;kirigami configurations. Furthermore, we constructed parabolic and spherical versions of ultrathin, large&#8208;area (20&#160;cm &#215; 20&#160;cm) MXene&#8208;based TA loudspeakers, which displayed sound&#8208;focusing and 3D omnidirectional&#8208;sound&#8208;generating attributes, respectively.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Cosmetic Contact Lenses for Ocular Surface Disease Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor Prussian blue family nanozymes with antioxidant abilities are embedded into cosmetic contact lenses to prevent ocular surface diseases, minimize potential safety risks, and protect corneas from external stimulation and underlying systemic diseases via reactive oxygen species scavenging.








Abstract
Efficiently balancing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by various factors on the ocular surface is a promising strategy for preventing the development of ocular surface diseases (OSDs). Nevertheless, the conventional topical administration of antioxidants is limited in efficacy due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and irreversible depletion, which impede their performance. To address this issue, contact lenses embedded with antioxidant nanozymes that can continuously scavenge ROS, thereby providing an excellent preventive effect against OSDs are developed. Specifically, Prussian blue family nanozymes are chosen based on their multiple antioxidant enzyme&#8208;like activities and excellent biocompatibility. The diverse range of colors made them promising candidates for the development of cosmetic contact lenses (CCLs) as a substitute for conventional pigments. The efficacy of nanozyme&#8208;CCLs is demonstrated in rabbits and rats exposed to a high risk of developing OSDs.

     alt="Nanozyme-Cosmetic Contact Lenses for Ocular Surface Disease Prevention"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multicolor Prussian blue family nanozymes with antioxidant abilities are embedded into cosmetic contact lenses to prevent ocular surface diseases, minimize potential safety risks, and protect corneas from external stimulation and underlying systemic diseases via reactive oxygen species scavenging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficiently balancing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by various factors on the ocular surface is a promising strategy for preventing the development of ocular surface diseases (OSDs). Nevertheless, the conventional topical administration of antioxidants is limited in efficacy due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and irreversible depletion, which impede their performance. To address this issue, contact lenses embedded with antioxidant nanozymes that can continuously scavenge ROS, thereby providing an excellent preventive effect against OSDs are developed. Specifically, Prussian blue family nanozymes are chosen based on their multiple antioxidant enzyme-like activities and excellent biocompatibility. The diverse range of colors made them promising candidates for the development of cosmetic contact lenses (CCLs) as a substitute for conventional pigments. The efficacy of nanozyme-CCLs is demonstrated in rabbits and rats exposed to a high risk of developing OSDs. These OSDs' prevention nanozyme-CCLs can pave the way for CCLs toward powerful wearable biomedical devices and provide novel strategies for the rational utilization of nanomaterials in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Grain Boundary Elimination via Recrystallization&#8208;Assisted Vapor Deposition for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapor deposition method in combination with a solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization technique is presented to fabricate high&#8208;quality larger&#8208;area perovskite film. Efficiency of 19.9% is achieved, which is among the highest values ever reported for minimodules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite.








Abstract
Vapor deposition is a promising technology for the mass production of perovskite solar cells. However, the efficiencies of solar cells and modules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskites are significantly lower than those fabricated using the solution method. Emerging evidence suggests that large defects are generated during vapor deposition owing to a specific top&#8208;down crystallization mechanism. Herein, a hybrid vapor deposition method combined with solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization for fabricating high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films with low defect densities is presented. It is demonstrated that an intermediate phase can be formed at the grain boundaries, which induces the secondary growth of small grains into large ones. Consequently, perovskite films with substantially reduced grain boundaries and defect densities are fabricated. Results of temperature&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;carrier dynamics show that the proposed method successfully suppresses all recombination reactions. Champion efficiencies of 21.9% for small&#8208;area (0.16 cm2) cells and 19.9% for large&#8208;area (10.0 cm2) solar modules under AM 1.5 G irradiation are achieved. Moreover, the modules exhibit high operational stability, i.e., they retain &gt;92% of their initial efficiencies after 200&#160;h of continuous operation.

         <title>Synergizing Spatial Confinement and Dual&#8208;Metal Catalysis to Boost Sulfur Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Fish&#8208;in&#8208;net&#8221; encapsulation of sulfur nanoparticles in an ordered metal&#8211;organic framework is reported as an efficient strategy for overcoming the sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This approach results in long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption, and decent multistep catalytic conversion, thereby significantly improving the interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics and sulfur conversion rate.








Abstract
Sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling reactions severely impede lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery operation; resolving these issues can enhance the capacity retention and cyclability of Li&#8211;S cells. Therefore, an effective strategy featuring core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Co/Ni bimetal&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/sulfur nanoparticles is reported herein for addressing these problems; this approach offers unprecedented spatial confinement and abundant catalytic sites by encapsulating sulfur within an ordered architecture. The protective shells exhibit long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption capability, and decent multistep catalytic conversion. Additionally, the delocalized electrons of the MOF endow the cathodes with superior electron/lithium&#8208;ion transfer ability. Via multiple physicochemical and theoretical analysis, the resulting synergistic interactions are proved to significantly promote interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, facilitate sulfur conversion dynamics, and inhibit shuttling. The assembled Li&#8211;S batteries deliver a stable, highly reversible capacity with marginal decay (0.075% per cycle) for 400 cycles at 0.2 C, a pouch&#8208;cell areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 200 cycles under a high sulfur loading, as well as remarkably improved pouch&#8208;cell performance.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Triads with Flexible Spacers: Deciphering Complex Photophysics for Targeted Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads are deciphered for practical use in materials science. In solution, fluorescent exciplexes are formed only for the short spacer (n = 4). Upon freezing, emissive static charge transfer (CT) complexes are formed for all spacer lengths. The molecular solids are stimuli&#8208;responsive, showing on/off fluorescence switching (n &gt; 4) or change of the emission color (n = 4).








Abstract
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads with varying flexible spacer lengths (n = 4&#8211;10 carbon atoms) are investigated in liquid and solid solution, as well as in crystals, by steady&#8208;state and transient fluorescence spectroscopy combined with computational studies. For the short spacer (n = 4) in a liquid solution, dynamic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state formation with subsequent, efficient exciplex emission is observed, effectively competing with quenching through electron transfer (eT) via a radical ion pair. In a solid solution, a fluorescent CT static complex is formed upon freezing for all spacer lengths. This allows the observations of a former seminal report on stimuli&#8208;responsive high&#8208;contrast fluorescence on/off switching in films of the triads to be reassigned (Adv. Mater. 2012, 24, 5487), now providing a holistic picture on varying spacer length. In fact, external stimuli of the film by modulating the geometry of the CT complex, which results in on/off fluorescence switching (for n &gt; 4) or in a change of the emission color (n = 4). The work thus demonstrates how in&#8208;depth analysis of complex photophysics can be put to practical use in materials science.

         <title>Highly&#8208;efficient Nitrogen&#8208;Fixing Microbial Hydrogel Device for Sustainable Solar Hydrogen Production</title>

Abstract
Conversion of sunlight and organic carbon substrates to sustainable energy sources through microbial metabolism has great potential for the renewable energy industry. Despite recent progress in microbial photosynthesis, the development of microbial platforms that warrant efficient and scalable fuel production remains in its infancy. Efficient transfer and retrieval of gaseous reactants and products to and from microbes are particular hurdles. Here, inspired by water lily leaves floating on water, we present a microbial device designed to operate at the air&#8208;water interface and facilitate concomitant supply of gaseous reactants, smooth capture of gaseous products, and efficient sunlight delivery. The floatable device carrying Rhodopseudomonas parapalustris, of which nitrogen fixation activity is firstly determined through this study, exhibits a hydrogen production rate of 104&#160;mmol/h&#8729;m2, which is 53 times higher than that of a conventional device placed at a depth of 2&#160;cm in the medium. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up device with an area of 144 cm2 generates hydrogen at a high rate of 1.52 L/h&#8729;m2. Efficient nitrogen fixation and hydrogen generation, low fabrication cost, and mechanical durability corroborate the potential of the floatable microbial device toward practical and sustainable solar energy conversion.

         <title>Technology and Integration Roadmap for Optoelectronic Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optoelectronic memristors (OMs) have emerged as a promising optoelectronic Neuromorphic computing paradigm, opening up new opportunities for neurosynaptic devices and optoelectronic systems. These OMs possess a range of desirable features including minimal crosstalk, high bandwidth, low power consumption, zero latency, and the ability to replicate crucial neurological functions such as vision and optical memory.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optoelectronic memristors (OMs) have emerged as a promising optoelectronic Neuromorphic computing paradigm, opening up new opportunities for neurosynaptic devices and optoelectronic systems. These OMs possess a range of desirable features including minimal crosstalk, high bandwidth, low power consumption, zero latency, and the ability to replicate crucial neurological functions such as vision and optical memory. By incorporating large-scale parallel synaptic structures, OMs are anticipated to greatly enhance high-performance and low-power in-memory computing, effectively overcoming the limitations of the von Neumann bottleneck. However, progress in this field necessitates a comprehensive understanding of suitable structures and techniques for integrating low-dimensional materials into optoelectronic integrated circuit platforms. This review aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the fundamental performance, mechanisms, design of structures, applications, and integration roadmap of optoelectronic synaptic memristors. By establishing connections between materials, multilayer optoelectronic memristor units, and monolithic optoelectronic integrated circuits, this review seeks to provide insights into emerging technologies and future prospects that are expected to drive innovation and widespread adoption in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Orderly Nanodendritic Nickel Substitute for Raney Nickel Catalyst Improving Alkali Water Electrolyser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of nonprecious metal catalysts to meet the activity&#8208;stability balance at industrial&#8208;grade large current densities remains a challenge toward practical alkali&#8208;water electrolysis. Here, we develop an orderly nanodendritic nickel (ND&#8208;Ni) catalyst that consists of ultrafine nanograins in chain&#8208;like&#160;conformation, which shows both excellent activity and robust stability for large&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, superior to currently&#8208;applied Raney nickel (R&#8208;Ni) catalyst in commercial alkali&#8208;water electrolyser (AWE). The ND&#8208;Ni catalyst featured by a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) interconnecting microporous structure endows with high specific surface area and excellent conductivity and hydrophilicity, which together afford superior charge/mass transport favorable to HER kinetics at high current densities. An actual AWE with ND&#8208;Ni catalyst demonstrates durable water splitting with 1.0&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.71&#160;V under industrial conditions and renders a record&#8208;low power consumption of 3.95&#160;kW h/Nm3 with an energy efficiency close to 90%. The hydrogen price per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) is calculated to be &#8764;0.78 US$, which is less than the target of US$2.0/GGE by 2026 from the U.S. Department of Energy. Our results suggest the feasibility of ND&#8208;Ni substitute for R&#8208;Ni catalyst in commercial AWE.

         <title>A Practical Approach Towards Highly Reproducible And High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Films Based on An Aging Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution processing of hybrid perovskite semiconductors is a highly promising approach for the fabrication of cost&#8208;effective electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, challenges with this approach lie in overcoming the controllability of the perovskite film morphology and the reproducibility of device efficiencies. Here, a facile and practical aging treatment (AT) strategy is reported to modulate the perovskite crystal growth to produce sufficiently high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films with improved homogeneity and full&#8208;coverage morphology. The resulting AT&#8208;films exhibit fewer defects, faster charge carrier transfer/extraction, and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination compared with reference. The AT&#8208;devices achieve a noticeable improvement in the reproducibility, operational stability, and photovoltaic performance of devices, with the average efficiency increased by 16%. It also demonstrates the feasibility and scalability of AT strategy in optimizing the film morphology and device performance for other perovskite components including MAPbI3, (MAPbBr3)15(FAPbI3)85, and Cs0.05(MAPbBr3)0.17(FAPbI3)0.83. This method opens an effective avenue to improve the quality of perovskite films and photovoltaic devices in a scalable and reproducible manner.

         <title>The Key Role of Molecular Packing in Luminescence Property: from Adjacent Molecules to Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The luminescence materials act as the key components in many functional devices, as well as the detection and imaging systems, which can be permeated in each aspect of modern life, and attract more and more attention for the creative technology and applications. In addition to the diverse properties of organic luminogens, the multiple molecular packing at aggregated states frequently offer new and/or exciting performance. However, there still lacks comprehensive analysis of molecular packing in these organic materials, resulting in an increased gap between molecular design and practical applications. In this review, from the basic knowledge of organic compounds as single molecules, to the discernable property of excimer, charge transfer (CT) complex or self&#8208;assembly systems by adjacent molecules, and finally to the opto&#8208;electronic performance of molecular aggregates, the relevant factors to the molecular packing and practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Designing Organic and Hybrid Surfaces and Devices with Initiated Chemical Vapor Deposition (iCVD)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The initiated Chemical Vapor Deposition (iCVD) technique is an all&#8208;dry method for designing organic and hybrid polymers. Unlike methods utilizing liquids or line&#8208;of&#8208;sight arrival, iCVD provides conformal surface modification over intricate geometries. Uniform, high&#8208;purity, and pinhole&#8208;free iCVD films can be grown with thicknesses ranging from &gt; 15&#160;&#956;m to &lt; 5&#160;nm. The mild conditions permit damage&#8208;free growth directly on to flexible substrates, 2D materials, and liquids. Novel iCVD polymer morphologies include nanostructured surfaces, nanoporosity, and shaped particles. The well&#8208;established fundamentals of iCVD facilitate the systematic design and optimization of polymers and copolymers. The functional groups provide fine tuning of surface energy, surface charge, and responsive behavior. Further reactions of the functional groups in the polymers can yield either surface modification, compositional gradients through the layer thickness, or complete chemical conversion of the bulk film. The iCVD polymers have been integrated into multilayer device structures as desired for applications in sensing, electronics, optics, electrochemical energy storage, and biotechnology. For these devices, hybrids offer higher values of refractive index and dielectric constant. Multivinyl monomers typically produce ultrasmooth and pinhole&#8208;free and mechanically deformable layers and robust interfaces which are especially promising for electronic skins and wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Recyclable and Robust Optical Nanoprobes with Engineered Enzymes for Sustainable Serodiagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recyclable fluorescence assays that can be stored at room temperature would greatly benefit biomedical diagnostics by bringing sustainability and cost&#8208;efficiency, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;care serodiagnostics in developing regions. Here, a general strategy is proposed to generate recyclable fluorescent probes by using engineered enzymes with enhanced thermo&#8208;/chemo&#8208;stability, which maintains an outstanding serodiagnostic performance (accuracy &gt;95%) after 10 times of recycling as well as after storage at elevated temperatures (37&#176;C for 10 days). With these three outstanding properties, recyclable fluorescent probes can be designed to detect various biomarkers of clinical importance by using different enzymes.

         <title>Berry Curvature Dipole Induced Giant Mid&#8208;Infrared Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in 2d Weyl Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to its inversion&#8208;broken triple helix structure and the nature of Weyl semiconductor, two&#8208;dimensional Tellurene (2D Te) is promising to possess a strong nonlinear optical response in the infrared region, which is rarely reported in 2D materials. Here, a giant nonlinear infrared response induced by large Berry curvature dipole (BCD) is demonstrated in the Weyl semiconductor 2D Te. Ultrahigh SHG response was acquired from 2D Te with a large second&#8208;order nonlinear optical susceptibility (&#967;(2)), which is up to 23.3 times higher than that of monolayer MoS2 in the range of 700&#8211;1500&#160;nm. Notably, distinct from other 2D nonlinear semiconductors, &#967;(2) of 2D Te increases extraordinarily with increasing wavelength and reaches up to 5.58&#160;nm/V at &#8764;2300&#160;nm, which is the best infrared performance among the reported 2D nonlinear materials. Large &#967;(2) of 2D Te also enables the high&#8208;intensity sum&#8208;frequency generation with an ultralow continuous&#8208;wave (CW) pump power. Theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional performance is attributed to the presence of large BCD located at the Weyl points of 2D Te. These results unravel a new linkage between Weyl semiconductor and strong optical nonlinear responses, rendering 2D Te a competitive candidate for highly efficient nonlinear 2D semiconductors in the infrared region.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its inversion-broken triple helix structure and the nature of Weyl semiconductor, two-dimensional Tellurene (2D Te) is promising to possess a strong nonlinear optical response in the infrared region, which is rarely reported in 2D materials. Here, a giant nonlinear infrared response induced by large Berry curvature dipole (BCD) is demonstrated in the Weyl semiconductor 2D Te. Ultrahigh SHG response was acquired from 2D Te with a large second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (&lt;i&gt;&#967;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;), which is up to 23.3 times higher than that of monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the range of 700&#8211;1500&#160;nm. Notably, distinct from other 2D nonlinear semiconductors, &lt;i&gt;&#967;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt; of 2D Te increases extraordinarily with increasing wavelength and reaches up to 5.58&#160;nm/V at &#8764;2300&#160;nm, which is the best infrared performance among the reported 2D nonlinear materials. Large &lt;i&gt;&#967;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt; of 2D Te also enables the high-intensity sum-frequency generation with an ultralow continuous-wave (CW) pump power. Theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional performance is attributed to the presence of large BCD located at the Weyl points of 2D Te. These results unravel a new linkage between Weyl semiconductor and strong optical nonlinear responses, rendering 2D Te a competitive candidate for highly efficient nonlinear 2D semiconductors in the infrared region.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multi&#8208;Material 3D and 4D Bioprinting of Heterogeneous Constructs for Tissue Engineering</title>

Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM), which is based on the principle of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer shaping and stacking of discrete materials, has shown significant benefits in the fabrication of complicated implants for tissue engineering (TE). However, many native tissues exhibit anisotropic heterogeneous constructs with diverse components and functions. Consequently, the replication of complicated biomimetic constructs using conventional AM processes based on a single material is challenging. Multi&#8208;material 3D and 4D bioprinting (with time as the fourth dimension) has emerged as a promising solution for constructing multifunctional implants with heterogeneous constructs that can mimic the host microenvironment better than single&#8208;material alternatives. Notably, 4D&#8208;printed multi&#8208;material implants with biomimetic heterogeneous architectures can provide a time&#8208;dependent programmable dynamic microenvironment that can promote cell activity and tissue regeneration in response to external stimuli. This paper first presents the typical design strategies of biomimetic heterogeneous constructs in TE applications. Subsequently, the latest processes in the multi&#8208;material 3D and 4D bioprinting of heterogeneous tissue constructs are discussed, along with their advantages and challenges. In particular, the potential of multi&#8208;material 4D bioprinting of smart multifunctional tissue constructs is highlighted. Furthermore, this review provides insights into how multi&#8208;material 3D and 4D bioprinting can facilitate the realization of next&#8208;generation TE applications.

         <title>A Bi&#8208;Co Corridor Construction Effectively Improving The Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction Towards Ammonia by Nearly 100%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Improving the selective ammonia production capacity of electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) at ambient conditions is critical to the future development and industrial application of electrosynthesis of ammonia. However, the reaction involves multi&#8208;proton and electron transfer as well as the desorption and underutilization of intermediates, posing a challenge to the selectivity of NO3RR. Here we modulated the electrodeposition site of Co by depositing Bi at the bottom of the catalyst, thus obtaining the Co+Bi@Cu NW catalyst with a Bi&#8208;Co corridor structure. In 50&#160;mM NO3&#8722;, Co+Bi@Cu NW exhibits a highest Faraday efficiency of &#8764;100% (99.51%), an ammonia yield rate of 1858.2 &#956;g&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;2 and high repeatability at &#8208;0.6&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, the change of NO2&#8722; concentration on the catalyst surface observed by in situ reflection absorption imaging and the intermediates of the NO3RR process detected by electrochemical in situ Raman spectroscopy together verified the NO2&#8722; trapping effect of the Bi&#8208;Co corridor structure. We believe that the measure of modulating the deposition site of Co by loading Bi element is an easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement general method for improving the selectivity of NH3 production as well as the corresponding scientific research and applications.

         <title>Identifying a Universal Activity Descriptor and a Unifying Mechanism Concept on Perovskite Oxides for Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal activity descriptor (orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy) is successfully extracted from various materials&#8217; physicochemical properties for both hydrogen&#8208;evolving and oxygen&#8208;evolving reactions in multiple electrolytes. Systematic experiments and computations reveal the life&#8208;cycle HER and OER mechanisms and identify the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory as a powerful mechanism analysis tool and foundation.








Abstract
Producing indispensable hydrogen and oxygen for social development via water electrolysis shows more prospects than other technologies. Although electrocatalysts have been explored for centuries, a universal activity descriptor for both hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) is not yet developed. Moreover, a unifying concept is not yet established to simultaneously understand HER/OER mechanisms. Here, the relationships between HER/OER activities in three common electrolytes and over ten representative material properties on 12 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based model oxides are rationally bridged through statistical methodologies. The orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy (&#916;) can serve as an ideal universal descriptor, where a neither too large nor too small &#916; (&#8776;1&#160;eV) with optimal electron&#8208;cloud density around Fermi level affords the best activities, fulfilling Sabatier's principle. Systematic experiments and computations unravel that pristine oxide with &#916; &#8776; 1&#160;eV possesses metal&#8208;like high&#8208;valence configurations and active lattice&#8208;oxygen sites to help adsorb key protons in HER and induce lattice&#8208;oxygen participation in the OER, respectively. After reactions, partially generated metals in the HER and high&#8208;valence hydroxides in the OER dominate proton adsorption and couple with pristine lattice&#8208;oxygen activation, respectively. These can be successfully rationalized by the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory. This work provides the foundation of rational material design and mechanism understanding for many potential applications.

         <title>Flash&#8208;Thermal Shock Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Toward High&#8208;Performance Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flash&#8208;thermal shock (FTS)&#8208;driven synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles on carbon nanofibers and other 2D materials is presented. In particular, the FTS method merits scalability (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm2), rapid synthesis (&gt;1800 &#160;&#176;C within 20 ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &gt;104 K&#160;s&#8722;1), and ambient air processing. To prove their practical utility, high electrocatalytic activities in the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions are demonstrated.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) provide unprecedented physicochemical properties over unary nanoparticles (NPs). According to the conventional alloying guideline (Hume&#8211;Rothery rule), however, only size&#8208;and&#8208;structure similar elements can be mixed, limiting the possible combinations of alloying elements. Recently, it has been reported that based on carbon thermal shocks (CTS) in a vacuum atmosphere at high temperature, ultrafast heating/cooling rates and high&#8208;entropy environment play a critical role in the synthesis of HEAs, ruling out the possibility of phase separation. Since the CTS requires conducting supports, the Joule&#8208;heating efficiencies rely on the carbon qualities, featuring difficulties in uniform heating along the large area. This work proposes a photo&#8208;thermal approach as an alternative and innovative synthetic method that is compatible with ambient air, large&#8208;area, remote process, and free of materials selection. Single flash irradiation on carbon nanofibers induced momentary high&#8208;temperature annealing (&gt;1800&#160;&#176;C within 20&#160;ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &gt;104 K&#160;s&#8722;1) to successfully decorate HEA NPs up to nine elements with excellent compatibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm2 of carbon nanofiber paper). To demonstrate their feasibility toward applications, senary HEA NPs (PtIrFeNiCoCe) are designed and screened, showing high activity (&#951;overall = 777&#160;mV) and excellent stability (&gt;5000 cycles) at the water splitting, including hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions.

         <title>Stabilizing Precursor Solution and Controlling Crystallization Kinetics Simultaneously for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

It is found that the TFFH additive can inhibit the oxidation of I&#8722;, eliminating I0, Pb0, and uncoordinated Pb2+ defects and control crystallization kinetics by the strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics mean the optimized solar cells achieve improved reproducibility and stability, and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux.








Abstract
The efficiency of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed; however, defects created by aging precursor solutions and during crystallization pose a significant barrier to the reproducibility and efficiency of solar cells. In this work, fluoro&#8208;N,N,N&#8243;,N&#8243;&#8208;tetramethylformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (F&#8208;(CH3)4CN2PF6, abbreviated as TFFH) is introduced to stabilize precursor solution and improve crystallization dynamics simultaneously for high&#8208;performance formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based perovskite indoor photovoltaics. The TFFH stabilizes the precursor solution by inhibiting oxidation of I&#8722; and reducing newly generated I0 to I&#8722;, and passivates undercoordinated Pb2+ by interacting with the Pb&#9472;I framework. Time&#8208;resolved optical diagnostics show prolonged perovskite crystallization dynamics and in situ defect passivation due to the presence of strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics guarantee larger perovskite grain sizes, better crystal orientation, fewer defects and more efficient charge extraction in PSCs. The optimized PSCs achieve improved reproducibility and better stability and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux, which is the highest efficiency among all indoor photovoltaics. It is anticipated that the concurrent stabilization of solutions and regulation of crystallization dynamics will emerge as a prevalent approach for enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of perovskite.

         <title>From Volumetric to Planar Multiplexing: Phase&#8208;Coded Metasurfaces without the Bragg Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexing metasurface based on orthogonal phase encoding is demonstrated to implement a near&#8208;field optical router. Bragg diffraction, which plays a vital role in traditional volume holography,is replaced by mode&#8208;matching surface waves, resulting in the realization of ultrathin metadevices. The method facilitates further development of an additional degree of freedom in the field of photonic multiplexing.








Abstract
Metasurfaces consisting of planar subwavelength structures with minimal thickness are appealing to emerging technologies such as integrated optics and photonic chips for their small footprint and compatibility with sophisticated planar nanofabrication techniques. However, reduced dimensionality due to the 2D nature of a metasurface poses challenges to the adaptation of a few useful methods that have found great success with conventional optics in 3D space. For instance, Bragg diffraction is the foundation of the well&#8208;established technique of phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in volume holography. It relies on interference among the scattered waves from multiple layers across the thickness of a sample. In this work, despite losing the dimension in thickness, a metasurface is devised to experimentally demonstrate phase&#8208;coded multiplexing by replacing free&#8208;space light with a surface wave in its output. The in&#8208;plane interference along the propagation of the surface wave resembles the Bragg diffraction, thus enabling phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in the 2D design. An example of code&#8208;based all&#8208;optical routing is also achieved by using a multiplexed metasurface, which can find applications in photonic data processing and communications.

         <title>Constructing Chiral Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional chiral covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (CityU&#8208;7 and CityU&#8208;8) have been developed for the detection of circularly polarized light, where both samples exhibited distinguishable photoresponse toward left&#8208;handed and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light (at 405&#160;nm).








Abstract
The use of chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as active elements in photodetectors to directly identify circularly polarized light (CPL) can meet the requirement of integration and miniaturization of the as&#8208;fabricated devices. Herein, the design and synthesis of two isoreticular chiral two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs (CityU&#8208;7 and CityU&#8208;8) by introducing photosensitive porphyrin&#8208;based amines (5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin) to enhance the optical absorption and chiral aldehyde linkage (2,5&#8208;bis((S/R))&#8208;2&#8208;methylbutoxy)terephthalaldehyde) to engender chirality for direct CPL detection &#160;are&#160; reported. Their crystalline structures &#160;were&#160; confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, and low&#8208;dose transition electron microscopy. Employing both chiral COFs as the active layers in photodetectors, left&#8208;handed circularly (LHC) and right&#8208;handed circularly (RHC) polarized light at 405&#160;nm can be well distinguishable with short response time, high responsivity, and satisfying detectivity. The study provides the first example on the design and synthesis of chiral COFs for direct detection of CPL.

         <title>Thermally Insulating and Moisture&#8208;Resilient Foams Based on Upcycled Aramid Nanofibers and Nanocellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Low&#8208;density foams and aerogels based on upcycled and bio&#8208;based nanofibers and additives are promising alternatives to fossil&#8208;based thermal insulation materials. We have prepared super&#8208;insulating foams from upcycled acid&#8208;treated aramid nanofibers (upANFA) obtained from Kevlar&#174; yarn and tempo&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofibers (CNF) from wood. The ice&#8208;templated hybrid upANFA/CNF&#8208;based foams with an upANFA content of up to 40&#160;wt.% displayed high thermal stability and a very low thermal conductivity of 18&#8211;23&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 perpendicular to the aligned nanofibrils over a wide relative humidity (RH) range of 20% to 80%. The thermal conductivity of the hybrid upANFA/CNF foams was found to decrease with increasing upANFA content (5&#8208;20&#160;wt.%). The super&#8208;insulating properties of the CNF&#8208;upANFA hybrid foams were related to the low density of the foams and the strong interfacial phonon scattering between the very thin and partially branched upANFA and CNF in the hybrid foam walls. Defibrillated nanofibers from textiles are not limited to Kevlar&#174;, and this study could hopefully inspire efforts to upcycle textile waste into high&#8208;performance products.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Ferromagnetic Liquid Crystal Elastomer with Programmed Dual&#8208;Anisotropy and Multi&#8208;Responsiveness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnetic liquid crystal elastomer (magLCE) ink whose nematic order and magnetization can be independently programmed to be anisotropic via a customized 3D&#8208;printing platform is reported. The 3D&#8208;printed magLCE provides designable multimodal shape morphing under different stimuli, which is promising for wireless soft robots and intelligent devices.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) and magnetic soft materials are promising active materials in many emerging fields, such as soft robotics. Despite the high demand for developing active materials that combine the advantages of LCE and magnetic actuation, the lack of independent programming of the LCE nematic order and magnetization in a single material still hinders the desired multi&#8208;responsiveness. In this study, a ferromagnetic LCE (magLCE) ink with nematic order and magnetization is developed that can be independently programmed to be anisotropic, referred to as &#8220;dual anisotropy&#8221;, via a customized 3D&#8208;printing platform. The magLCE ink is fabricated by dispersing ferromagnetic microparticles in the LCE matrix, and a 3D&#8208;printing platform is created by integrating a magnet with 3&#8208;DoF motion into an extrusion&#8208;based 3D printer. In addition to magnetic fields, magLCEs can also be actuated by heating sources (either environmental heating or photo&#8208;heating of the embedded ferromagnetic microparticles) with a high energy density and tunable actuation temperature. A programmed magLCE strip robot is demonstrated with enhanced adaptability to complex environments (different terrains, magnetic fields, and temperatures) using a multi&#8208;actuation strategy. The magLCE also has potential applications in mechanical memory, as demonstrated by the multistable mechanical metastructure array with remote writability and stable memory.

In this study, a ferromagnetic LCE (magLCE) ink with nematic order and magnetization is developed that can be independently programmed to be anisotropic, referred to as &#8220;dual anisotropy&#8221;, via a customized 3D-printing platform. The magLCE ink is fabricated by dispersing ferromagnetic microparticles in the LCE matrix, and a 3D-printing platform is created by integrating a magnet with 3-DoF motion into an extrusion-based 3D printer. In addition to magnetic fields, magLCEs can also be actuated by heating sources (either environmental heating or photo-heating of the embedded ferromagnetic microparticles) with a high energy density and tunable actuation temperature. A programmed magLCE strip robot is demonstrated with enhanced adaptability to complex environments (different terrains, magnetic fields, and temperatures) using a multi-actuation strategy. The magLCE also has potential applications in mechanical memory, as demonstrated by the multistable mechanical metastructure array with remote writability and stable memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Like Stretchable Nanocomposite Using Locally&#8208;Bundled Nanowires for Skin&#8208;Mountable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material strategy to fabricate a stretchable nanocomposite with metal&#8208;like conductivity and high stretchability is proposed. When the nanocomposite is solidified in the highly humid air, silver nanowires are locally&#8208;bundled, minimizing contact resistance. Treatment of dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol improves conductivity further to &#8776;120 000 S cm&#8722;1 while attaining high stretchability of &#8776;200% for skin&#8208;mountable devices.








Abstract
Stretchable conductive nanocomposites have been intensively studied for wearable bioelectronics. However, development of nanocomposites that simultaneously feature metal&#8208;like conductivity(&gt; 100 000 S cm&#8722;1) and high stretchability (&gt; 100%) for high&#8208;performance skin&#8208;mountable devices is still extremely challenging. Here&#160;a material strategy for such a nanocomposite is&#160;presented by using local bundling of silver nanowires stabilized with dual ligands (i.e., 1&#8208;propanethiols and 1&#8208;decanethiols). When the nanocomposite&#160;is&#160;solidified via solvent evaporation under a highly humid condition, the nanowires in the organic solution are bundled and stabilized. The resulting locally&#8208;bundled nanowires lower contact resistance while maintain their percolation network, leading to high conductivity. Dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol further boost up the conductivity. As a result, a nanocomposite with both high conductivity of &#8776;122,120 S cm&#8722;1 and high stretchability of &#8776;200% is obtained. Such superb electrical and mechanical properties are critical for various applications in skin&#8208;like electronics, and&#160;herein, a wearable thermo&#8208;stimulation device is demonstrated.

         <title>Regulating Exciton De&#8208;Trapping of Te4+&#8208;Doped Zero&#8208;Dimensional Scandium&#8208;Halide Perovskite for Fluorescence Thermometry with Record High Time&#8208;Resolved Thermal Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive fluorescence thermometer is developed by Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O engineering. The rapid de&#8208;trapping process of self&#8208;trapped excitons induced by the soft lattice results in a record high thermal sensitivity for the lifetime&#8208;based detection, reaching up to 27.36% K&#8722;1 at 325 K, with the temperature uncertainty below 0.1 K, enabling remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components.








Abstract
Fluorescence thermometry has been propelled to the forefront of scientific attention due to its high spatial resolution and remote non&#8208;invasive detection. However, recent generations of thermometers still suffer from limited thermal sensitivity (Sr) below 10% change per Kelvin. Herein, this work presents an ideal temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence material through Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O, in which isolated polyhedrons endow highly localized electronic structures, and the strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling facilitates the formation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). With rising temperature, the dramatic asymmetric expansion of the soft lattice induces increased defects, strong exciton&#8211;phonon coupling, and low thermal activation energy, which evokes a rapid de&#8208;trapping process of STEs, enabling several orders of magnitude changes in the fluorescence lifetime over a narrow temperature range. After regulating the de&#8208;trapping process with different Te4+ doping, a record&#8208;high Sr (27.36% K&#8722;1) of fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based detection is achieved at 325 K. The robust stability against multiple heating/cooling cycles and long&#8208;term measurements enables a low temperature uncertainty of 0.067 K. Further, the developed thermometers are demonstrated for the remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components. It is believed that this work constitutes a solid step towards building the next generation of ultrasensitive thermometers based on low&#8208;dimensional metal halides.

         <title>Inhibited Grain Growth Through Phase Transition Modulation Enables Excellent Mechanical Properties in Oxide Ceramic Nanofibers up to 1700&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase transition modulation strategy is proposed to prepare oxide ceramic nanofibers, which are featured by inhibited grain growth at high temperatures. As a result, a strikingly high average tensile strength of 1.02&#160;GPa is achieved at 1700&#160;&#176;C, laying a basis for developing advanced oxide ceramics for reliable thermal protection in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
Oxide ceramics are widely used as thermal protection materials due to their excellent structural properties and earth abundance. However, in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments (above 1500&#160;&#176;C), the explosive growth of grain size causes irreversible damage to the microstructure of oxide ceramics, thus exhibiting poor thermomechanical stability. This problem, which may lead to catastrophic accidents, remains a great challenge for oxide ceramic materials. Here, a novel strategy of phase transition modulation is proposed to control the grain growth at high temperatures in oxide ceramic nanofibers, realizing effective regulation of the crystalline forms as well as the size uniformity of primary grains, and thus suppressing the malignant growth of the grains. The resulting oxide ceramic nanofibers have excellent mechanical strength and flexibility, delivering an average tensile strength as high as 1.02&#160;GPa after being exposed to 1700&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min, and can withstand thousands of flexural cycles without obvious damage. This work may provide new insight into the development of advanced oxide ceramic materials that can serve in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments with long&#8208;term durability.

         <title>Universal Strategy of Efficient Intracellular Macromolecule Directional Delivery Using Photothermal Pump Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal pump patch is proposed as a universal structure for a highly efficient, non&#8208;destructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule directional delivery. It is based on poly(dimethyl siloxane) photothermal expansion&#8208;driven pore shrinkage, which directionally delivers macromolecules into the cell to improve intracellular delivery efficiency. It is also suitable for transdermal intracellular delivery and has broad potential in the fields of cell/gene therapy.








Abstract
The development of a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable universal delivery strategy of therapeutic macromolecules into desired cells and tissues is very challenging. Photothermal methods have advantages in intracellular delivery, particularly in in vivo manipulation. However, the inability of directional transmission of exogenous molecules limits their delivery efficiency. Here, a photothermal pump (PTP) patch with numerous &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; is reported. Under a laser, the cell membrane ruptures, while &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; shrink, resulting in a directional exogenous molecule delivery into cells for a high&#8208;efficient intracellular delivery. The PTP patches are considered a universal structure for a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule delivery. Under in vivo transdermal intracellular delivery conditions, the target genes are efficiently and noninvasively delivered into epidermal and dermal cells through the PTP patch and exosomes produced by the epidermal cells, respectively. The PTP patch provides a new strategy for a high&#8208;efficiency, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable macromolecule delivery.

         <title>Halide&#8208;Driven Synthetic Control of InSb Colloidal Quantum Dots Enables Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>

Abstract
In the III&#8208;V family of colloidal quantum dot (CQDs) semiconductors, InSb promises access to a wider range of infrared wavelengths compared to many light&#8208;sensing material candidates. However, achieving the necessary size, size&#8208;dispersity, and optical properties has been challenging. Here we investigate the synthetic challenges associated with InSb CQDs and find that uncontrolled reduction of the antimony precursor hampers the controlled growth of CQDs. To overcome this, we develop a synthetic strategy that combines non&#8208;pyrophoric precursors with zinc halide additives. Our experimental and computational studies show that zinc halide additives decelerate the reduction of the antimony precursor, facilitating the growth of more uniformly&#8208;sized CQDs. We also find that the halide choice provides additional control over the strength of this effect. The resultant CQDs exhibit well&#8208;defined excitonic transitions in spectral range of 1.26&#160;eV to 0.98&#160;eV, along with strong photoluminescence. By implementing a post&#8208;synthesis ligand exchange, we achieve colloidally stable inks enabling the fabrication of high&#8208;quality CQD films. We present the first demonstration of InSb CQD photodetectors reaching 75% external quantum efficiency (QE) at 1200&#160;nm, to our knowledge the highest SWIR QE reported among heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free infrared CQD&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Delayed Crystallization Kinetics Allowing High&#8208;Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Photovoltaics with Superior Up&#8208;Scaled Manufacturing</title>

Abstract
Though encouraging performance has been achieved in small&#8208;area organic photovoltaics (OPVs), reducing efficiency loss when evoluted to large&#8208;area modules is an important but unsolved issue. Considering that polymer materials show benefits in film&#8208;forming processability and mechanical robustness, a high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;polymer OPV module has been demonstrated in this work. First, a ternary blend consisting of two polymer donors, PM6 and PBQx&#8208;TCl, and one polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;IT, was developed, with which triplet state recombination was suppressed for a reduced energy loss, thus allowing a higher voltage; and donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility was compromised for enhanced charge transport, thus resulting improved photocurrent and fill factor, all these contributed to a champion efficiency of 19% for all&#8208;polymer OPVs. Second, the delayed crystallization kinetics from solution to film solidification was achieved that gives a longer operation time window for optimized blend morphology in large&#8208;area module, thus relieving the loss of fill factor and allowing a record efficiency of 16.26% on an up&#8208;scaled module with an area of 19.3 cm2. Besides, this all&#8208;polymer system also showed excellent mechanical stability. Our work demonstrates that all&#8208;polymer ternary systems are capable of solving the up&#8208;scaled manufacturing issue, thereby enabling high&#8208;efficiency OPV modules.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Promoted Ni&#8208;Based Layer Double Hydroxides with Enhanced Deprotonation Capability for Efficient Biomass Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ni&#8208;based hydroxides are promising electrocatalysts for biomass oxidation reactions, supplanting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to lower overpotentials while producing value&#8208;added chemicals. The identification and subsequent engineering of their catalytically active sites are essential to facilitate these anodic reactions. Herein, the proportional relationship between catalysts&#8217; deprotonation propensity and Faradic efficiency of 5&#8208;HMF&#8208;to&#8208;FDCA production (FEFDCA) is revealed by thorough DFT simulations and atomic&#8208;scale characterizations, including in&#8208;situ synchrotron diffraction and spectroscopy methods. The deprotonation capability of ultrathin layer&#8208;double hydroxides (UT&#8208;LDHs) is regulated by tuning the covalency of metal (M)&#8208;oxygen (O) motifs through defect site engineering and selection of M3+ co&#8208;chemistry. NiMn UT&#8208;LDHs show an ultrahigh FEFDCA of 99% at 1.37&#160;V versus RHE and retain a high FEFDCA of 92.7% in the OER&#8208;operating window at 1.52&#160;V, about 2x that of NiFe UT&#8208;LDHs (49.5%) at 1.52&#160;V. Ni&#8208;O and Mn&#8208;O motifs function as dual active sites for HMF electrooxidation, where the continuous deprotonation of Mn&#8208;OH sites plays a dominant role in achieving high selectivity while suppressing OER at high potentials. Our results showcase a universal concept of modulating competing anodic reactions in aqueous biomass electrolysis by electronically engineering the deprotonation behavior of metal hydroxides, anticipated to be translatable across various biomass substrates.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Voltage, High&#8208;Force Capacity Electroadhesive Clutch Based on Ionoelastomer Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electroadhesive devices with dielectric films can electrically program changes in stiffness and adhesion, but require hundreds of volts and are subject to failure by dielectric breakdown. Recent work on ionoelastomer heterojunctions has enabled reversible electroadhesion with low voltages, but these materials exhibit limited force capacities and high detachment forces. It is a grand challenge to engineer electroadhesives with large force capacities and programmable detachment at low voltages (&lt;10&#160;V). In this work, we synthesize tough ionoelastomer/metal mesh composites with low surface energies and controlled surface roughness to realize sub&#8208;ten&#8208;volt clutches that are small, strong, and easily detachable. Models based on fracture and contact mechanics explain how clutch compliance and surface texture affect force capacity and contact area, which we validate over different geometries and voltages. These ionoelastomer clutches outperform the best existing electroadhesive clutches by five&#8208;fold in force capacity per unit area (102 N/cm2), with a 40&#8208;fold reduction in operating voltage (&#177; 7.5&#160;V). Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our ionoelastomer clutches to resist bending moments in a finger wearable and as a reversible adhesive in an adjustable phone mount.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Enzyme Co&#8208;Expressed Nanomedicine for Anti&#8208;Metastasis Tumor Therapy by Up&#8208;regulating Cellular Oxidative Stress and Depleting Cholesterol</title>

Abstract
Tumor cells movement and migration are inseparable from the integrity of lipid rafts and the formation of lamellipodia, and lipid rafts are also a prerequisite for the formation of lamellipodia. Therefore, destroying the lipid rafts is an effective strategy to inhibit tumor metastasis. Herein, we developed a multi&#8208;enzyme co&#8208;expressed nanomedicine: cholesterol oxidase (CHO) loaded Co&#8208;PN3 single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Co&#8208;PN3 SA/CHO) that can up&#8208;regulate cellular oxidative stress, disrupt the integrity of lipid rafts, and inhibit lamellipodia formation to induce anti&#8208;metastasis tumor therapy. In this process, Co&#8208;PN3 SA can catalyze O2 and H2O2 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) via oxidase&#8208;like and Fenton&#8208;like properties. The doping of P atoms optimizes the adsorption process of the intermediate at the active site and enhances the ROS generation properties of nanomedicine. Meantime, O2 produced by catalase&#8208;like catalysis can combine with excess cholesterol to generate more H2O2 under CHO catalysis, achieving enhanced oxidative damage to tumor cells. Most importantly, cholesterol depletion in tumor cells also disrupts the integrity of lipid rafts and inhibits the formation of lamellipodia, greatly inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. This strategy by up&#8208;regulating cellular oxidative stress and depleting cellular cholesterol constructs a new idea for anti&#8208;metastasis&#8208;oriented cancer therapy strategies.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Anode&#8208;Free Batteries Enabled by Li Compensation Coupled Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilization of Li2S as a Li supplement and interfacial promoter facilitates efficient Li compensation coupled interface strengthening against irreversible Li loss, enabling a durable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free battery with long life, high energy, and remarkable safety.








Abstract
Initially, anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries present a promising power source that merges the high production feasibility of Li&#8208;ion batteries with the superb energy capabilities of Li&#8208;metal batteries. However, their application confronts formidable challenges of extremely short lifespan due to the inadequacy of zero&#8208;Li&#8208;excess cell configuration against irreversible Li loss. A Li compensation coupled interface engineering strategy is reported for realizing long&#8208;life quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free batteries. The Li2S is utilized as a sacrificial Li supplement to effectively counterbalance irreversible Li loss without damage to cell chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Utilization of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S as a Li supplement and interfacial promoter facilitates efficient Li compensation coupled interface strengthening against irreversible Li loss, enabling a durable quasi-solid-state anode-free battery with long life, high energy, and remarkable safety.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, anode-free Li metal batteries present a promising power source that merges the high production feasibility of Li-ion batteries with the superb energy capabilities of Li-metal batteries. However, their application confronts formidable challenges of extremely short lifespan due to the inadequacy of zero-Li-excess cell configuration against irreversible Li loss. A Li compensation coupled interface engineering strategy is reported for realizing long-life quasi-solid-state anode-free batteries. The Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is utilized as a sacrificial Li supplement to effectively counterbalance irreversible Li loss without damage to cell chemistry. Meanwhile, it demonstrates remarkable efficacy in establishing a robust yet slender inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid solid-state interphase for inhibiting cell degradation by dead and dendritic Li. This strategy enables quasi-solid-state anode-free batteries with a long lifespan of 500 cycles. The Ah-scale quasi-solid-state pouch cells, featuring a high-loading LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathode and lean gel polymer electrolyte, exhibit a high specific energy of 300&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This achievement translates into an improvement of 46% in gravimetric energy and 94% in volumetric energy compared to LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||graphite batteries while outperforming LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||Li-metal batteries by 22&#8211;47% in volumetric energy. Such quasi-solid-state anode-free cells also demonstrate good safety, showcasing remarkable resistance against nail penetration in ambient air without failure, smoke, or fire accidents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lipid&#8208;Centric Design of Plasma Membrane&#8208;Mimicking Nanocarriers for Targeted Chemotherapeutic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The plasma membranes (PM) of mammalian cells contain diverse lipids, proteins and carbohydrates that are important for systemic recognition and communication in health and disease. Cell membrane coating technology that imparts unique properties of natural plasma membranes to the surface of encapsulated nanoparticles is thus becoming a powerful platform for drug delivery, immunomodulation, and vaccination. However, current coating methods fail to take full advantage of the natural systems because they disrupt the complex and functionally essential features of PMs, most notably the chemical diversity and compositional differences of lipids in two leaflets of the PM. Herein, we report a new lipid coating approach in which the lipid composition is optimized through a combination of biomimetic and systematic variation approaches for the custom design of nanocarrier systems for precision drug delivery. Nanocarriers coated with the optimized lipids offer unique advantages in terms of bioavailability and the efficiency in tumor targeting, tumor penetration, cellular uptake, and drug release. This pilot study provides new insight into the rational design and optimization of nanocarriers for cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, and lays the foundation for further customization of cell membrane&#8208;mimicking nanocarriers through systematic incorporation of other components.

         <title>Architecture of Vanadium&#8208;Based MXene Dysregulating Tumor Redox Homeostasis for Amplified Nanozyme Catalytic/Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Taking the significance of the special microenvironment for tumor cell survival into account, disrupting tumor redox homeostasis is highly prospective for improving therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a multifunctional two&#8208;dimensional vanadium&#8208;based MXene nanoplatform, V4C3/atovaquone@bovine albumin (V4C3/ATO@BSA, abbreviated as VAB) has been elaborately constructed for ATO&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalytic/photothermal therapy. The redox homeostasis within the tumor cells has eventually been disrupted, showing a remarkable anti&#8208;tumor effect. The VAB nanoplatform with mixed vanadium valence states can induce a cascade of catalyzed reactions in the tumor microenvironment, generating plenty of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with effective glutathione consumption to amplify oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the stable and strong photothermal effect of VAB under near&#8208;infrared irradiation not only causes the necrosis of tumor cells but also improves its peroxidase&#8208;like activity. In addition, the release of ATO can effectively alleviate endogenous oxygen consumption to limit triphosadenine formation and inhibit mitochondrial respiration. As a result, the expression of heat shock proteins is effectively suppressed to overcome thermoresistance and the production of ROS can be further promoted due to mitochondrial injury. Moreover, VAB also presents high photoacoustic and photothermal imaging performances. In brief, the multifunctional nanoplatform can provide ATO&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalytic/photothermal therapy with broadening the biomedical applications of vanadium&#8208;based MXene.

         <dc:description>
A new insight into the cross&#8208;talk behavior between cathode and lithium&#8208;metal anode is presented by analyzing the non&#8208;uniform Li+ flux induced electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical failure. A forward&#8208;looking and overturning opinion on the thorny problem of lithium dendrites is that the initiation factor of lithium&#8208;dendrite growth is the reaction inhomogeneity of the cathode, which can be effectively solved by cathode modification.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries have been identified as a strategic research direction for the electric vehicle industry because of their promising high energy density and potential characteristic safety. However, the intrinsic mechanical properties of solid materials cause inevitable electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical failure of electrodes and electrolytes during charging and discharging; these failure mechanisms include lithium penetration and formation of cracks and voids, which pose a serious challenge for the long cycle life of solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Here, a short overview of the recent advances with a view to understand this challenge is provided. Furthermore, new insights into the cross&#8208;talk behavior between the cathode and lithium&#8208;metal anode are provided based on the non&#8208;uniform Li+ flux inducing interactional electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical failure. Furthermore, guidelines for designing stable solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries and research directions to figure out the interelectrode&#8208;talk&#8208;related electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical failure mechanism are presented, which can be significant for accelerating the development of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Ferroelectric Switching at Symmetry&#8208;Broken Interfaces by Local Control of Dislocations Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric stacking order domains are observed in marginally twisted WS2. Using a scanning tunnelling microscope, reversible, local control of the domain walls is demonstrated at room temperature, and their evolution is understood with a theoretical model.








Abstract
Semiconducting ferroelectric materials with low energy polarization switching offer a platform for next&#8208;generation electronics such as ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors. Recently discovered interfacial ferroelectricity in bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenide films provides an opportunity to combine the potential of semiconducting ferroelectrics with the design flexibility of 2D material devices. Here, local control of ferroelectric domains in a marginally twisted WS2 bilayer is demonstrated with a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature, and their observed reversible evolution is understood using a string&#8208;like model of the domain wall network (DWN). Two characteristic regimes of DWN evolution are identified: (i) elastic bending of partial screw dislocations separating smaller domains with twin stackings due to mutual sliding of monolayers at domain boundaries and (ii) merging of primary domain walls into perfect screw dislocations, which become the seeds for the recovery of the initial domain structure upon reversing electric field. These results open the possibility to achieve full control over atomically thin semiconducting ferroelectric domains using local electric fields, which is a critical step towards their technological use.

A composite architected mesoscale process (CAMP) process is reported to manufacture composites with a near&#8208;replica &#8220;green&#8208;to&#8208;brown&#8221; transformation, that features a low volume shrinking (9.98%) during &#8220;green&#8208;to&#8208;brown&#8221; transformation. The CAMP manufactures carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/epoxy with a CNTs loading of 25&#160;wt% exhibiting a longitudinal compressive strength of 381 &#177; 30&#160;MPa.








Abstract

         <title>Curved Nanographenes: Multiple Emission, Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence, and Non&#8208;Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual photophysics of a class of curved chiral nanographenes (CNG) consisting of a corannulene and a tert&#8208;butylhexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene is investigated by time&#8208;resolved and temperature&#8208;dependent spectroscopy. Dual fluorescence and dual phosphorescence are found, as well as non&#8208;Kasha emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in a narrow temperature range. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide detailed understanding of the experimental findings.








Abstract
The intriguing and rich photophysical properties of three curved nanographenes (CNG 6, 7, and 8) are investigated by time&#8208;resolved and temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. CNG 7 and 8 exhibit dual fluorescence, as well as dual phosphorescence at low temperature in the main PL bands. In addition, hot bands are detected in fluorescence as well as phosphorescence, and, in the narrow temperature range of 100&#8211;140 K, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with lifetimes on the millisecond time&#8208;scale is observed. These findings are rationalized by quantum&#8208;chemical simulations, which predict a single minimum of the S1 potential of CNG 6, but two S1 minima for CNG 7 and CNG 8, with considerable geometric reorganization between them, in agreement with the experimental findings. Additionally, a higher&#8208;lying S2 minimum close to S1 is optimized for the three CNG, from where emission is also possible due to thermal activation and, hence, non&#8208;Kasha behavior. The presence of higher&#8208;lying dark triplet states close to the S1 minima provides mechanistic evidence for the TADF phenomena observed. Non&#8208;radiative decay of the T1 state appears to be thermally activated with activation energies of roughly 100&#160;meV and leads to disappearance of phosphorescence and TADF at T&#160;&gt;&#160;140&#160;K.

         <title>Ultrathin Metal Film on Graphene for Percolation&#8208;Threshold&#8208;Limited Thermal Emissivity Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au atoms tend to form a thin, crystalline layer on graphene surfaces via van der Waals epitaxy, resulting in translucent, conductive films. Translucent yet reflective Au/graphene hybrids are invisible to the naked eye but can be clearly identified at IR wavelength. Au/graphene hybrids can be applied to a wide range of thermal management applications ranging from energy harvesting and storage to military applications.








Abstract
Translucent Au/graphene hybrid films are shown to be effective in reducing thermal emission from the underlying surfaces when the deposition thickness of Au is close to the percolation threshold. The critical Au deposition thickness for an abrupt change in emissivity is reduced from 15&#160;nm (Si substrate) to a percolation&#8208;threshold&#8208;limited thickness of 8.5&#160;nm (graphene/Si substrate) because of the chemical inertness of graphene leading to the deposited Au atoms forming a thin, crystalline layer. The effect of the graphene layer on the optical properties of the hybrid film is highlighted by a drastic increase in infrared absorptivity, whereas the visible absorptivity is marginally affected by the presence of a graphene layer. The level of thermal emission from the Au/graphene hybrid films with the percolation&#8208;threshold&#8208;limited Au thickness is stable even with high background temperatures of up to 300 &#176;C and mechanical strains of &#8776;4%. As an example of a thermal management application, an anti&#8208;counterfeiting device is demonstrated; thermal&#8208;camouflage&#8208;masked text fabricated with an Au/graphene hybrid film is discernible only using a thermographic camera. Ultrathin metal film assisted by a graphene layer will provide a facile platform for thermal management with semi&#8208;transparency, flexibility, and transferability to arbitrary surfaces.

         <title>Inducing Single Spin&#8208;Polarized Flat Bands in Monolayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several years of research have demonstrated that graphene is one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;gen electronics. In this regard, the capability of rendering it spin&#8208;polarized opens up the doors of the spintronic field. In this work, it is demonstrated that single spin&#8208;polarized bands are formed near the Fermi level by interfacing a graphene layer grown on a cobalt film with europium.








Abstract
Due to the fundamental and technological implications in driving the appearance of non&#8208;trivial, exotic topological spin textures and emerging symmetry&#8208;broken phases, flat electronic bands in 2D materials, including graphene, are nowadays a relevant topic in the field of spintronics. Here, via europium doping, single spin&#8208;polarized bands are generated in monolayer graphene supported by the Co(0001) surface. The doping is controlled by Eu positioning, allowing for the formation of a K&#175;$\bar{\mathrm{K}}$&#8208;valley localized single spin&#8208;polarized low&#8208;dispersive parabolic band close to the Fermi energy when Eu is on top, and of a &#960;* flat band with single spin&#160;character when Eu is intercalated underneath graphene. In the latter case, Eu also induces a bandgap opening at the Dirac point while the Eu 4f states act as a spin filter, splitting the &#960; band into two spin&#8208;polarized branches. The generation of flat bands with single spin character, as revealed by the spin&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, opens up new pathways toward the realization of spintronic devices exploiting such novel exotic electronic and magnetic states.

         <title>A Rapid Self&#8208;Pumping Organohydrogel Dressing with Hydrophilic Fractal Microchannels to Promote Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel with hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels by a dynamic floating&#8208;colliding&#8208;coalescing process is prepared, realizing &#8776;30 times enhancement in draining water than pure hydrogel. The rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing can accelerate burn wound healing by reducing dermal cavity (&#8776;42.5%), accelerating hair follicles (&#8776;13.5 times) and blood vessels (&#8776;6.6 times) regeneration.








Abstract
Burn wounds pose great challenges for conventional dressings because massive exudates oversecreted from swollen tissues and blisters seriously delay wound healing. Herein, a self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing with hydrophilic fractal microchannels is reported that can rapidly drain excessive exudates with &#8776;30 times enhancement in efficiency compared with the pure hydrogel, and effectively promote burn wound healing. A creaming&#8208;assistant emulsion interfacial polymerization approach is proposed to create the hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels in the self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel through a dynamic floating&#8208;colliding&#8208;coalescing process of organogel precursor droplets. In a murine burn wound model, the rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressings can markedly reduce dermal cavity by &#8776;42.5%, accelerate blood vessel regeneration by &#8776;6.6 times, and hair follicle regeneration by &#8776;13.5 times, compared with the commercial dressing (Tegaderm). This study paves an avenue for designing high&#8208;performance functional burn wound dressings.

     alt="A Rapid Self-Pumping Organohydrogel Dressing with Hydrophilic Fractal Microchannels to Promote Burn Wound Healing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rapid self-pumping organohydrogel with hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels by a dynamic floating-colliding-coalescing process is prepared, realizing &#8776;30 times enhancement in draining water than pure hydrogel. The rapid self-pumping organohydrogel dressing can accelerate burn wound healing by reducing dermal cavity (&#8776;42.5%), accelerating hair follicles (&#8776;13.5 times) and blood vessels (&#8776;6.6 times) regeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burn wounds pose great challenges for conventional dressings because massive exudates oversecreted from swollen tissues and blisters seriously delay wound healing. Herein, a self-pumping organohydrogel dressing with hydrophilic fractal microchannels is reported that can rapidly drain excessive exudates with &#8776;30 times enhancement in efficiency compared with the pure hydrogel, and effectively promote burn wound healing. A creaming-assistant emulsion interfacial polymerization approach is proposed to create the hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels in the self-pumping organohydrogel through a dynamic floating-colliding-coalescing process of organogel precursor droplets. In a murine burn wound model, the rapid self-pumping organohydrogel dressings can markedly reduce dermal cavity by &#8776;42.5%, accelerate blood vessel regeneration by &#8776;6.6 times, and hair follicle regeneration by &#8776;13.5 times, compared with the commercial dressing (Tegaderm). This study paves an avenue for designing high-performance functional burn wound dressings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bacteria&#8208;Derived Outer&#8208;Membrane Vesicles Hitchhike Neutrophils to Enhance Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoplatform based on bacteria&#8208;derived outer&#8208;membrane vesicle is developed for enhanced brain delivery of pioglitazone. It can be specifically recognized by neutrophils during blood circulation, subsequently hitchhiking on the neutrophils to cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier. The transcription factors Pou2f1 and Nrf1 of oligodendrocytes are identified for the first time to be involved in neural repair.








Abstract
The treatment of reperfusion injury after ischemic stroke remains unsatisfactory since the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) prevents most neuroprotective agents from entering the brain. Here, a strategy is proposed based on bacteria&#8208;derived outer&#8208;membrane vesicle (OMV) hitchhiking on the neutrophils for enhanced brain delivery of pioglitazone (PGZ) to treat ischemic stroke. By encapsulating PGZ into OMV, the resulting OMV@PGZ nanoparticles inherit the functions associated with the bacterial outer membrane, making them ideal decoys for neutrophil uptake. The results show that OMV@PGZ simultaneously inhibits the activation of nucleotide oligomerization&#8208;like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)&#160;inflammasomes and ferroptosis and reduces the reperfusion injury to exert a neuroprotective effect. Notably, the transcription factors Pou2f1 and Nrf1 of oligodendrocytes are identified for the first time to be involved in this process and promoted neural repair by single&#8208;nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA&#8208;seq).

         <title>Tunable Organic Active Neural Probe Enabling Near&#8208;Sensor Signal Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inkjet&#8208;printed organic voltage amplifier is monolithically integrated with organic electrochemical transistors and thin&#8208;film polymer resistors on a highly flexible substrate. The active neural probe records local field potentials in an experimental rat model of spontaneous and epileptiform activity with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This approach creates a new near&#8208;sensor processing paradigm in neural interface technology.








Abstract
Neural recording systems have significantly progressed to provide an advanced understanding and treatment for neurological diseases. Flexible transistor&#8208;based active neural probes exhibit great potential in electrophysiology applications due to their intrinsic amplification capability and tissue&#8208;compliant nature. However, most current active neural probes exhibit bulky back&#8208;end connectivity since the output is current, and the development of an integrated circuit for voltage output is crucial for near&#8208;sensor signal processing at the abiotic/biotic interface. Here, inkjet&#8208;printed organic voltage amplifiers are presented by monolithically integrating organic electrochemical transistors and thin&#8208;film polymer resistors on a single, highly flexible substrate for in vivo brain activity recording. Additive inkjet printing enables the seamless integration of multiple active and passive components on the somatosensory cortex, leading to significant noise reduction over the externally connected typical configuration. It also facilitates fine&#8208;tuning of the voltage amplification and frequency properties. The organic voltage amplifiers are validated as electrocorticography devices in a rat in vivo model, showing their ability to record local field potentials in an experimental model of spontaneous and epileptiform activity. These results bring organic active neural probes to the forefront in applications where efficient sensory data processing is performed at sensor endpoints.

         <title>Enhanced Hot&#8208;Phonon Bottleneck Effect on Slowing Hot Carrier Cooling in Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots with Alloyed A&#8208;Site</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controversies regarding the origins and mechanisms of A&#8208;site cation&#8208;dependent hot carrier relaxation dynamics are resolved by comparing the photogenerated carrier dynamics of 6 kinds of pure and mixed A&#8208;site cation halide perovskite quantum dots (i.e., FAPbI3, MAPbI3, CsPbI3, FA0.5MA0.5PbI3, FA0.5Cs0.5PbI3, MA0.5Cs0.5PbI3 PQDs) at various excitation intensities.








Abstract
A deep understanding of the effect of the A&#8208;site cation cross&#8208;exchange on the hot&#8208;carrier relaxation dynamics in perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) has profound implications on the further development of disruptive photovoltaic technologies. In this study, the hot carrier cooling kinetics of pure FAPbI3 (FA+, CH(NH2)2+),&#160;MAPbI3 (MA+, CH3NH3++), CsPbI3 (Cs+, Cesium) and alloyed FA0.5MA0.5PbI3, FA0.5Cs0.5PbI3, and MA0.5Cs0.5PbI3 QDs are investigated using ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The lifetimes of the initial fast cooling stage (&lt;1&#160;ps) of all the organic cation&#8208;containing PQDs are shorter than those of the CsPbI3 QDs, as verified by the electron&#8208;phonon coupling strength extracted from the temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra. The lifetimes of the slow cooling stage of the alloyed PQDs are longer under illumination greater than 1 sun, which is ascribed to the introduction of co&#8208;vibrational optical phonon modes in the alloyed PQDs. This facilitated efficient acoustic phonon upconversion and enhanced the hot&#8208;phonon bottleneck effect, as demonstrated by first&#8208;principles calculations.

         <title>Magnetically Actuated Fiber&#8208;Based Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D magnetic soft robots are demonstrated through a combination of photocurable magnetic elastomer design and fiber&#8208;based fabrication of helical actuators. Fiber&#8208;based robots are engineered for crawling and walking motion under unidirectional fields applied via stationary electromagnets. The versatile design and straightforward control pave the way for applications of magnetic fiber&#8208;based robots in spatially constrained environments.








Abstract
Broad adoption of magnetic soft robotics is hampered by the sophisticated field paradigms for their manipulation and the complexities in controlling multiple devices. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput fabrication of such devices across spatial scales remains challenging. Here, advances in fiber&#8208;based actuators and magnetic elastomer composites are leveraged to create 3D magnetic soft robots controlled by unidirectional fields. Thermally drawn elastomeric fibers are instrumented with a magnetic composite synthesized to withstand strains exceeding 600%. A combination of strain and magnetization engineering in these fibers enables programming of 3D robots capable of crawling or walking in magnetic fields orthogonal to the plane of motion. Magnetic robots act as cargo carriers, and multiple robots can be controlled simultaneously and in opposing directions using a single stationary electromagnet. The scalable approach to fabrication and control of magnetic soft robots invites their future applications in constrained environments where complex fields cannot be readily deployed.

         <title>Manipulation of Charge Dynamics for Efficient and Bright Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Chiral Ligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the charge dynamics through a novel chiral organic cation passivator and a ladder&#8208;like energy architecture, blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of 13.15%, a luminance of 8170&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and a record power efficiency of 18.42&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 with stable emissions, rendering that the performance is among the best blue PeLEDs.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) emerge as a promising class of optoelectronic devices for next&#8208;generation displays and lighting technology. However, the performance of blue PeLEDs lags far behind that of their green and red counterparts, including the unachieved trade&#8208;off between high efficiency and high luminance, severe efficiency roll&#8208;off, and unsatisfactory power efficiency. Here, a multi&#8208;functional chiral ligand of L&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride is strategically introduced into quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, which can effectively passivate defects, modulate the phase distribution, improve photoluminescence quantum yield, guarantee high&#8208;quality film morphology, and enhance charge transport. Furthermore, ladder&#8208;like hole transport layers are established, boosting charge injection and balance. The resultant sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs (the photoluminescence peak is 493&#160;nm and the electroluminescence peak is 497&#160;nm) exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 12.43% at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and a record power efficiency of 18.42&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1, rendering that the performance is among the best blue PeLEDs.

         <title>Molecular One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Qubit Systems with Very Long Coherence Times</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very long coherence times of up to 140 &#181;s are reported in perchlorotriphenylmethyl mono&#8208; and diradicals, strongly exceeding previous values. Furthermore, two&#8208;spin coherent manipulations are reported in the biradical systems, as a basic quantum gate operation. These results demonstrate the suitability of these compounds for molecular quantum architectures.








Abstract
General&#8208;purpose quantum computation and quantum simulation require multi&#8208;qubit architectures with precisely defined, robust interqubit interactions, coupled with local addressability. This is an unsolved challenge, primarily due to scalability issues. These issues often derive from poor control over interqubit interactions. Molecular systems are promising materials for the realization of large&#8208;scale quantum architectures, due to their high degree of positionability and the possibility to precisely tailor interqubit interactions. The simplest quantum architecture is the two&#8208;qubit system, with which quantum gate operations can be implemented. To be viable, a two&#8208;qubit system must possess long coherence times, the interqubit interaction must be well defined and the two qubits must also be addressable individually within the same quantum manipulation sequence. Here results are presented on the investigation of the spin dynamics of chlorinated triphenylmethyl organic radicals, in particular the perchlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical, a mono&#8208;functionalized PTM, and a biradical PTM dimer. Extraordinarily long ensemble coherence times up to 148 &#181;s are found at all temperatures below 100&#160;K. Two&#8208;qubit and, importantly, individual qubit addressability in the biradical system are demonstrated. These results underline the potential of molecular materials for the development of quantum architectures.

         <title>Robust PANI@MXene/GQDs&#8208;Based Fiber Fabric Electrodes via Microfluidic Wet&#8208;Fusing Spinning Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient microfluidic wet&#8208;fusing spinning chemistry (MWSC) method and in&#8208;situ growth process is developed to continuously fabricate high electrochemical performance and high mechanical strength MXene&#8208;based fiber fabrics (MFFs) with hierarchical architecture. This strategy has directive significance to the large&#8208;scale preparation of conductive fabric electrodes and provides a viable solution for the increasing demand of the portable microelectronic energy&#8208;storage devices.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) as a promising candidate material for batteries and supercapacitors has shown excellent electrochemical performance, but it is difficult to meet practical applications because of its poor morphology structure, low mechanical properties, and expensive process. Here, an applied and efficient method based on microfluidic wet&#8208;fusing spinning chemistry (MWSC) is proposed to construct hierarchical structure of MXene&#8208;based fiber fabrics (MFFs), allowing the availability of MFF electrodes with ultrastrong toughness, high conductivity, and easily machinable properties. First, a dot&#8208;sheet structure constructed by graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and MXene nanosheets with multianchor interaction in the microchannel of a microfluidic device enhances the mechanical strength of MXene fibers; next, the interfused fiber network structure of Ti3C2Tx/GQDs fabrics assembled by the MWSC process enhances the deformability of the whole fabrics; finally, the core&#8211;shell structure of PANI@Ti3C2Tx/GQDs architected by in&#8208;situ polymerization growth of polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers provides more ion&#8208;accessible pathways and sites for kinetic migration and ion accumulation. Through the morphology and microstructure design, this strategy has directive significance to the large&#8208;scale preparation of conductive fabric electrodes and provides a viable solution for simultaneously enhancing mechanical strength and electrochemical performance of conductive fabric electrodes.

         <title>2D Ferroionics: Conductive Switching Mechanisms and Transition Boundaries in Van der Waals Layered Material CuInP2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full 2D van der Waals heterostructure ferroelectric semimetal junction is fabricated to unravel the conductive mechanism of CuInP2S6, and a detailed phase diagram of the competing mechanisms and transition boundaries with temperature and an external electric field is presented. Based on this understanding, an artificial synapse with automatic gain control is also demonstrated.








Abstract
The recently unfolded ferroionic phenomena in 2D van der Waals (vdW) copper&#8211;indium&#8211;thiophosphate (CuInP2S6 or CIPS) have received widespread interest as they allow for dynamic control of conductive switching properties, which are appealing in the paradigm&#8208;shift computing. The intricate couplings between ferroelectric polarization and ionic conduction in 2D vdW CIPS facilitate the manipulation and dynamic control of conductive behaviors. However, the complex interplays and underlying mechanisms are not yet fully explored and understood. Here, by investigating polarization switching and ionic conduction in the temperature and applied electric field domains, it is discovered that the conducting mechanisms of CIPS can be divided into four distinctive states (or modes) with transitional boundaries, depending on the dynamics of Cu ions in the material. Further, it demonstrates that dynamically&#8208;tunable synaptic responsive behavior can be well implemented by governing the working&#8208;state transition. This research provides an in&#8208;depth, quantitative understanding of the complex phenomena of conductive switching in 2D vdW CIPS with coexisting ferroelectric order and ionic disorder. The developed insights in this work lay the ground for implementing high&#8208;performance, function&#8208;enriched devices for information processing, data storage, and neuromorphic computing based on the 2D ferroionic material systems.

         <title>Direct&#8208;Current Electrical Detection of Surface&#8208;Acoustic&#8208;Wave&#8208;Driven Ferromagnetic Resonance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrical detection technique is developed for the magneto&#8208;elastic effective field of surface acoustic wave (SAW), showing advantages of better integration compatibility and lower cost than traditional techniques like vector network analyzer. It is made possible by the direct current rectification effect of the SAW&#8208;driven ferromagnetic resonance, paving the way for designable spin acousto&#8208;electronic devices with convenient signal readout.








Abstract
Surface acoustic waves (SAW) provide a promising platform to study spin&#8208;phonon coupling, which can be achieved by SAW&#8208;driven ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) for efficient acoustic manipulation of spin. Although the magneto&#8208;elastic effective field model has achieved great success in describing SAW&#8208;driven FMR, the magnitude of the effective field acting on the magnetization induced by SAW still remains hard to access. Here, by integrating ferromagnetic stripes with SAW devices, direct&#8208;current detection for SAW&#8208;driven FMR based on electrical rectification is reported. By analyzing FMR rectified voltage, the effective fields are straightforwardly characterized and extracted, which exhibits&#160;the advantages of better integration compatibility and lower cost than traditional methods such as vector&#8208;network analyzer&#8208;based techniques. A large nonreciprocal rectified voltage is obtained, which is attributed to the coexistence of in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane effective fields. The effective fields can be modulated by controlling the longitudinal and shear strains within the films to achieve almost 100% nonreciprocity ratio, demonstrating the potential for electrical switches. Besides its fundamental significance, this finding provides a unique opportunity for a designable spin acousto&#8208;electronic device and its convenient signal readout.

         <title>Precision Covalent Organic Frameworks for Surface Nucleation Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanometer&#8208;thick amphiphobic coating using covalent organic frameworks is shown to suppress the nucleation of calcium carbonate and ice crystals through nanoconfinement. The fluorine&#8208;free coating features excellent transparency and resistance to high&#8208;speed jets of water and organic solvents.








Abstract
Unwanted accumulation of ice and lime scale crystals on surfaces is a long&#8208;standing challenge with major economic and sustainability implications. Passive inhibition of icing and scaling by liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces are often inadequate, susceptible to surface failure under harsh conditions, and unsuitable for long&#8208;term/real&#8208;life usages. Such surfaces often require a multiplicity of additional features such as optical transparency, robust impact resistance, and ability to prevent contamination from low surface energy liquids. Unfortunately, most promising advances have relied on using perfluoro compounds, which are bio&#8208;persistent and/or highly toxic. Here it is&#160;shown that organic, reticular mesoporous structures, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), may offer a solution. By exploiting simple and scalable synthesis of defect&#8208;free COFs and rational post&#8208;synthetic functionalization, nanocoatings with precision nanoporosity (morphology) are prepared that can inhibit nucleation at the molecular level without compromising the related contamination prevention and robustness. The results offer a simple strategy to exploit the nanoconfinement effect, which remarkably delays the nucleation of ice and scale formation on surfaces. Ice nucleation is suppressed down to &#8722;28&#160;&#176;C, scale formation is avoided for &gt;2&#160;weeks in supersaturated conditions, and jets of organic solvents impacting at Weber numbers &gt;105 are resisted with surfaces that also offer optical transparency (&gt;92%).

         <title>Meta&#8208;Aerogel Ion Motor for Nanofluid Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic meta&#8208;aerogel ion motors with actuatable &#8220;ion&#8208;express highways&#8221; are fabricated for blue energy harvesting. The nanofluidic meta&#8208;aerogels exhibit space&#8208;confined selective ion transport at the sub&#8208;nanometer level, which can produce an excellent output power density of over 30&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 on mixing the natural seawater and river water, and power the devices including the ship model and home&#8208;made maritime safety warning system.








Abstract
Osmotic power, also known as &#8220;blue energy&#8221;, is a vast, sustainable, and clean energy source that can be directly converted into electricity by nanofluidic membranes. However, the key technological bottleneck for large&#8208;scale osmotic electricity is that macroscopic&#8208;scale bulky membrane cannot synergistically satisfy the demands of high power density and low resistance without sacrificing scalability and mechanical robustness. Here, inspired by the anatomy and working principle of electric eels, which harness osmotic energy through embedded neuron&#8208;mediated fibril nanochannels with nanoconfined transport dynamics. Fibrous nanofluidic meta&#8208;aerogel ion motors, 3D&#8208;assembled from nanofluidic cable fibers with actuatable stimulation/transport &#8220;ion highways&#8221; are engineered. The meta&#8208;aerogel exhibits the integrated coupling effect of boosted ion propulsion and surface&#8208;charge&#8208;dominated selective ion transport. Driven by osmosis, the meta&#8208;aerogel ion motor can produce an unprecedented output power density of up to 30.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 under a 50&#8208;fold salinity gradient. Advancing ultra&#8208;selective ion transport in nanofluidic meta&#8208;aerogels may provide a promising roadmap for blue energy harvesting.

         <title>Quantitative Mapping of Chemical Defects at Charged Grain Boundaries in a Ferroelectric Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic properties and chemical composition at grain boundaries in ferroelectric ErMnO3 polycrystals are studied. Atom probe tomography shows that the chemical structure at grain boundaries is substantially different from the bulk, revealing the microscopic origin of their distinct electronic responses. The work demonstrates the benefit of quantitative atomic&#8208;scale measurements and additional opportunities for property engineering at polar oxide interfaces.








Abstract
Polar discontinuities, as well as compositional and structural changes at oxide interfaces can give rise to a large variety of electronic and ionic phenomena. In contrast to earlier work focused on domain walls and epitaxial systems, this work investigates the relation between polar discontinuities and the local chemistry at grain boundaries in polycrystalline ferroelectric ErMnO3. Using orientation mapping and scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques, the polycrystalline material is demonstrated to develop charged grain boundaries with enhanced electronic conductance. By performing atom probe tomography (APT) measurements, an enrichment of erbium and a depletion of oxygen at all grain boundaries are found. The observed compositional changes translate into a charge that exceeds possible polarization&#8208;driven effects, demonstrating that structural phenomena rather than electrostatics determine the local chemical composition and related changes in the electronic transport behavior. The study shows that the charged grain boundaries behave distinctly different from charged domain walls, giving additional opportunities for property engineering at polar oxide interfaces.

         <title>An Exciplex&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emission Pathway for Solution&#8208;State Electrochemiluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical generation of exciplex states improves the efficiency and robustness of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) in solution. Mesoporous TiO2 electrodes increase the contact area and further enhance ECL. A solution&#8208;state ECL device combining both principles reaches a high luminance of 3790&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and offers a 30&#8208;fold improvement in operational lifetime.








Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) allows the design of unique light&#8208;emitting devices that use organic semiconductors in a liquid or gel state, which allows for simpler and more sustainable device fabrication and facilitates unconventional device form&#8208;factors. Compared to solid&#8208;state organic LEDs, ECL devices (ECLDs) have attracted less attention due to their currently much lower performance. ECLD operation is typically based on an annihilation pathway that involves electron transfer between reduced and oxidized luminophore species; the intermediate radical ions produced during annihilation dramatically reduce device stability. Here, the effects of radical ions are mitigated by an exciplex formation pathway and a remarkable improvement in luminance, luminous efficacy, and operational lifetime is demonstrated. Electron donor and acceptor molecules are dissolved at high concentrations and recombined as an exciplex upon their oxidization/reduction. The exciplex then transfers its energy to a nearby dye, allowing the dye to emit light without undergoing oxidation/reduction. Furthermore, the application of a mesoporous TiO2 electrode increases the contact area and hence the number of molecules participating in ECL , thereby obtaining devices with a very high luminance of 3790&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a 30&#8208;fold improved operational lifetime. This study paves the way for the development of ECLDs into highly versatile light sources.

         <title>Inhalable Capsular Polysaccharide&#8208;Camouflaged Gallium&#8208;Polyphenol Nanoparticles Enhance Lung Cancer Chemotherapy by Depleting Local Lung Microbiota</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inhalable capsular polysaccharide (CP)&#8208;camouflaged gallium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic network (MON) is designed here to abrogate bacteria&#8208;induced drug resistance. In multiple lung cancer mice models, inhaled MON shows uniform biodistribution and long&#8208;term retention within lung tissues, and Ga3+ releases effectively disrupted bacterial iron respiration to deplete lung microbiota for enhanced lung cancer chemotherapy.








Abstract
Local lung microbiota is closely associated with lung tumorigenesis and therapeutic response. It is found that lung commensal microbes induce chemoresistance in lung cancer by directly inactivating therapeutic drugs via biotransformation. Accordingly, an inhalable microbial capsular polysaccharide (CP)&#8208;camouflaged gallium&#8208;polyphenol metal&#8211;organic network (MON) is designed to eliminate lung microbiota and thereby abrogate microbe&#8208;induced chemoresistance. As a substitute for iron uptake, Ga3+ released from MON acts as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; to disrupt bacterial iron respiration, effectively inactivating multiple microbes. Moreover, CP cloaks endow MON with reduced immune clearance by masquerading as normal host&#8208;tissue molecules, significantly increasing residence time in lung tissue for enhanced antimicrobial efficacy. In multiple lung cancer mice models, microbe&#8208;induced drug degradation is remarkably inhibited when drugs are delivered by antimicrobial MON. Tumor growth is sufficiently suppressed and mouse survival is prolonged. The&#160;work develops a novel microbiota&#8208;depleted nanostrategy to overcome chemoresistance in lung cancer by inhibiting local microbial inactivation of therapeutic drugs.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis and Excited&#8208;State Dynamics of Null Exciton&#8208;Coupled Diketopyrrolopyrroles Oligo&#8208;Grids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent diketopyrrolopyrrole dimer [2]Grid and trimer [3]Grid with cyclic rigid structures are synthesized via one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. They both display null exciton couplings and solvent&#8208;dependent excited&#8208;state dynamics. In toluene, they exhibit monomer&#8208;like photophysical properties. However, in benzonitrile, especially [2]Grid forms the symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state faster and more efficiently, which further recombines to generate the triplet excited state.








Abstract
Exciton coupling in molecular aggregates plays a vital role in impacting and fine&#8208;tuning optoelectronic materials and their efficiencies in devices. A versatile platform to decipher aggregation&#8208;property relationships is built around multichromophoric architectures. Here, a series of cyclic diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) oligomers featuring nanoscale gridarene structures and rigid bifluorenyl spacers are designed and synthesized via one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction. DPP dimer [2]Grid and trimer [3]Grid, which are cyclic rigid nanoarchitectures of rather different sizes, are further characterized via steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. They exhibit monomer&#8208;like spectroscopic signatures in the steady&#8208;state measurements, from which null exciton couplings are derived. Moreover, in an apolar solvent, high fluorescence quantum yields and excited&#8208;state dynamics that resembled DPP monomer are gathered. In a polar solvent, the localized singlet excited state on a single DPP dissociates into the adjacent null coupling DPP with charge transfer characteristics. This pathway facilitates the evolution of&#160;the symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state (SB&#8208;CS). Notable is the fact that the SB&#8208;CS of [2]Grid is, on one hand, in equilibrium with the singlet excited state and promotes, on the other hand, the formation of the triplet excited state with a yield of 32% via charge recombination.

         <title>Homogeneous Phase Distribution in Q&#8208;2D Perovskites via Co&#8208;Assembly of Spacer Cations for Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spacer cations are tailored by adjusting the chain length and steric hindrance, which is proved to systematically affect the assembling of low&#8208;n phase perovskite via in situ absorption measurement. Homogeneous phase distribution is achieved through incorporating TPMA+, which restricts the stacking of PEA+ and eliminates the nucleation of the low&#8208;n phase, achieving the highest EQE of 23.9% for green PeLED.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q&#8208;2D) perovskites are promising candidates to apply in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, delicate control on crystallization kinetics is needed to suppress severe phase segregation. Here, the crystallization kinetics of Q&#8208;2D perovskites are investigated via in situ absorbance spectroscopy and for the first time find the multiphase distribution is governed by the arrangement, rather than diffusion, of spacer cations at the nucleation stage, which associate with its assembling ability determined by molecular configuration. A &#8220;co&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy is conceived by combining co&#8208;cations with different configuration characteristics, where bulky cations disturb the assembling between slender cations and lead&#8211;bromide sheet, contributing to homogeneous emitting phase with effective passivation. Correspondingly, in the phenylethylammonium (PEA+)&#8208;based Q&#8208;2D perovskites (&lt;n&gt;&#160;=&#160;3), homogeneous phase distribution is achieved by incorporating co&#8208;cation triphenylmethaneammonium (TPMA+), the branching terminals of which suppress cations assembling into low&#8208;n phases and afford adequate cations as passivating ligands. Therefore, the champion external quantum efficiency of the LED device reaches 23.9%, which is among the highest performance of green Q&#8208;2D perovskite LEDs. This work reveals that the arrangement of spacer cations determines the crystallization kinetics in Q&#8208;2D perovskites, providing further guidance on the molecular design and phase modulation of Q&#8208;2D perovskites.

         <title>Structural Color Mixing in Microcapsules through Exclusive Crystallization of Binary and Ternary Colloids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photonic microcapsules with dual or triple stopbands are created by exclusively crystallizing binary or ternary colloids in double&#8208;emulsion droplets. The controlled depletion attraction induces homogeneous particle association to produce distinct crystalline grains, preventing glassy alloy formation. The resulting microcapsules exhibit highly&#8208;saturated mixed structural colors that can be controlled through the selection of particle sizes and mixing ratios.








Abstract
Colloidal crystals are designed as photonic microparticles for various applications. However, conventional microparticles generally have only one stopband from a single lattice constant, which restricts the range of colors and optical codes available. Here, photonic microcapsules are created that contain two or three distinct crystalline grains, resulting in dual or triple stopbands that offer a wider range of colors through structural color mixing. To produce distinct colloidal crystallites from binary or ternary colloidal mixtures, the interparticle interaction is manipulated using depletion forces in double&#8208;emulsion droplets. Aqueous dispersions of binary or ternary colloidal mixtures in the innermost droplet are gently concentrated in the presence of a depletant and salt by imposing hypertonic conditions. Different&#8208;sized particles crystallize into their own crystals rather than forming random glassy alloys to minimize free energy. The average size of the crystalline grains can be adjusted with osmotic pressure, and the relative ratio of distinct grains can be controlled with the mixing ratio of particles. The resulting microcapsules with small grains and high surface coverage are almost optically isotropic and exhibit highly&#8208;saturated mixed structural colors and multiple reflectance peaks. The mixed color and reflectance spectrum are controllable with the selection of particle sizes and mixing ratios.

         <title>A Deformable Additive on Defects Passivation and Phase Segregation Inhibition Enables the Efficiency of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells over 24%</title>

A deformable coumarin has been successfully employed to passivate anion/cation defects and release residual stress, endowing that phase segregation can be effectively inhibited. Moreover, the benefit of the larger grain size and less trap&#8208;assisted recombination, yielding an exceptional efficiency of over 24% for rigid inverted perovskite solar cells and an efficiency of over 23% for flexible inverted perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The defects and phase segregation in perovskite will significantly reduce the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a deformable coumarin is employed as a multifunctional additive for formamidinium&#8211;cesium (FA&#8208;Cs) perovskite. During the annealing process of perovskite, the partial decomposition of coumarin passivates the Pb2+, iodine, and organic cation defects. Additionally, coumarin can affect colloidal size distributions, resulting in relatively large grain size and good crystallinity of target perovskite film. Hence, the carrier extraction/transport can be promoted, trap&#8208;assisted recombination is reduced, and energy levels are optimized in target perovskite films. Furthermore, the coumarin treatment can significantly release residual stress. As a result, the champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 23.18% and 24.14% are obtained for Br&#8208;rich (FA0.88Cs0.12PbI2.64Br0.36) and Br&#8208;poor (FA0.96Cs0.04PbI2.8Br0.12) based devices, respectively. The flexible PSCs based on Br&#8208;poor perovskite exhibit an excellent PCE of 23.13%, one of the highest values for flexible PSCs reported to date. Due to the inhibition of phase segregation, the target devices exhibit excellent thermal and light stability. This work provides new insights into the additive engineering of passivating defects, stress relief, and inhibition of phase segregation of perovskite films, offering a reliable method to develop state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <title>Microscale Imaging of Thermal Conductivity Suppression at Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal conductivity imaging via frequency&#8208;domain thermoreflectance enables the detection of localized microscale suppression in thermal conductivity at the grain boundaries of thermoelectric SnTe. By employing a Gibbs excess approach, a thermal boundary resistance is extracted from the images, establishing a correlation between misorientation angle and thermal resistance. These findings demonstrate the capability of thermal imaging in extracting structure&#8211;property relationships.








Abstract
Grain&#8208;boundary engineering is an effective strategy to tune the thermal conductivity of materials, leading to improved performance in thermoelectric, thermal&#8208;barrier coatings, and thermal management applications. Despite the central importance to thermal transport, a clear understanding of how grain boundaries modulate the microscale heat flow is missing, owing to the scarcity of local investigations. Here, thermal imaging of individual grain boundaries is demonstrated in thermoelectric SnTe via spatially resolved frequency&#8208;domain thermoreflectance. Measurements with microscale resolution reveal local suppressions in thermal conductivity at grain boundaries. Also, the grain&#8208;boundary thermal resistance &#8211; extracted by employing a Gibbs excess approach &#8211; is found to be correlated with the grain&#8208;boundary misorientation angle. Extracting thermal properties, including thermal boundary resistances, from microscale imaging can provide comprehensive understanding of how microstructure affects heat transport, crucially impacting the materials design of high&#8208;performance thermal&#8208;management and energy&#8208;conversion devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Modulation with Covalent Organic Framework Enables Efficient and Durable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;interface modulation strategy is demonstrated using functional covalent organic frameworks to fabricate the high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells; a champion efficiency of 24.26% is obtained together with enhanced long&#8208;term stability due to released tensile stress, reduced trap state density, as well as enhanced resistance of humidity and ultraviolet irradiation.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;interface modulation including buried interface as well as the top surface has recently been proven to be crucial for obtaining high photovoltaic performance in lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, for the first time, the strategy of using functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely HS&#8208;COFs for dual&#8208;interface modulation, is reported to further understand its intrinsic mechanisms in optimizing the bottom and top surfaces. Specifically, the buried HS&#8208;COFs layer can enhance the resistance against ultraviolet radiation, and more importantly, release the tensile strain, which is beneficial for enhancing device stability and improving the order of perovskite crystal growth. Furthermore, the detailed characterization results reveal that the HS&#8208;COFs on the top surface can effectively passivate the surface defects and suppress non&#8208;radiation recombination, as well as optimize the crystallization and growth of the perovskite film. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the dual&#8208;interface modified devices deliver champion efficiencies of 24.26% and 21.30% for 0.0725 cm2 and 1 cm2&#8208;sized devices, respectively. Moreover, they retain 88% and 84% of their initial efficiencies after aging for 2000 h under the ambient conditions (25&#160;&#176;C, relative humidity: 35&#8211;45%) and a nitrogen atmosphere with heating at 65&#160;&#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Cancer Stem&#8208;Like Cells&#8208;Oriented Surface Self&#8208;Assembly to&#160;Conquer Radioresistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MMP&#8208;2 responsive peptide&#8208;based radiosensitizer is proposed to achieve deep tumor penetration and in situ self&#8208;assemble into functional nanofibers on the surface of hypoxic cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs), which finally induces the hypoxic CSC differentiation and boosts the radiotherapeutic efficiency. This strategy provides a general nanoplatform to conquer CSCs&#8208;mediated radioresistance.








Abstract
Cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs), capable of indefinite self&#8208;renewal and differentiation, are considered to be the root cause of tumor radiotherapy (RT) resistance. However, the CSCs&#8208;targeted therapy still remains to be a great challenge because they are commonly located in the deep tumor making drugs hard to approach, and their hypoxic and acidic niche can further aggravate radioresistance. Herein, based on the finding that hypoxic CSCs highly express carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) on the cell membrane, a CAIX&#8208;targeted induced in situ self&#8208;assembly system on the surface of CSC is reported to overcome hypoxic CSC&#8208;mediated radioresistance. Via the sequential processes of &#8220;monomer release&#8208;target accumulation&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly&#8221;, the constructed peptide&#8208;based drug delivery system (CA&#8208;Pt) exhibits the advantages of deep penetration, amplified CAIX inhibition, and enhanced cellular uptake, which greatly relieves the hypoxic and acidic microenvironment to promote the hypoxic CSC differentiation and combines with platinum to boost the RT&#8208;inducing DNA damage. In both lung cancer tumor mouse and zebrafish embryo models, CA&#8208;Pt treatment can effectively assist RT in suppressing tumor growth and preventing tumor invasion and metastasis. This study uses a surface&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy to differentiate hypoxic CSCs, which may provide a universal treatment strategy for overcoming tumor radioresistance.

         <title>Photoelectron &#8220;Bridge&#8221; in Van Der Waals Heterojunction for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals heterojunctions as photocatalysts by traditional wet chemical methods encounter the challengeof charge transfer, because of steric hindrance and barriers caused by a large interfacial spacing. Introducing phosphoric acid molecules at the heterojunction interface acts as an electron "bridge" to eliminate the interfacial potential difference and create a photoelectron transport channel to promote the photocatalytic reaction.








Abstract
Constructing Van der Waals heterojunction is a crucial strategy to achieve excellent photocatalytic activity. However, in most Van der Waals heterojunctions synthesized by ex situ assembly, electron transfer encounters huge hindrances at the interface between the two components due to the large spacing and potential barrier. Herein, a phosphate&#8208;bridged Van der Waals heterojunction of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/tungsten disulfide (WS2) bridged by phosphate (xCoPc&#8208;nPO4&#8722;&#8208;WS2) is designed and prepared by the traditional wet chemistry method. By introducing a small phosphate molecule into the interface of CoPc and WS2, creates an electron &#8220;bridge&#8221;, resulting in a compact combination and eliminating the space barrier. Therefore, the phosphate (PO4&#8722;) bridge can serve as an efficient electron transfer channel in heterojunction and can efficiently transmit photoelectrons from WS2 to CoPc under excited states. These excited photoelectrons are captured by the catalytic central Co2+ in CoPc and subsequently convert CO2 molecules into CO and CH4 products, achieving&#160;17&#8208;fold enhancement on the 3CoPc&#8208;0.6PO4&#8722;&#8208;WS2 sample compared to that of pure WS2. Introducing a small molecule &#8220;bridge&#8221; to create an electron transfer channel provides a new perspective in designing efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction into valuable products.

     alt="Photoelectron &#8220;Bridge&#8221; in Van Der Waals Heterojunction for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion Under Visible Light"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals heterojunctions as photocatalysts by traditional wet chemical methods encounter the challengeof charge transfer, because of steric hindrance and barriers caused by a large interfacial spacing. Introducing phosphoric acid molecules at the heterojunction interface acts as an electron "bridge" to eliminate the interfacial potential difference and create a photoelectron transport channel to promote the photocatalytic reaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing Van der Waals heterojunction is a crucial strategy to achieve excellent photocatalytic activity. However, in most Van der Waals heterojunctions synthesized by ex situ assembly, electron transfer encounters huge hindrances at the interface between the two components due to the large spacing and potential barrier. Herein, a phosphate-bridged Van der Waals heterojunction of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/tungsten disulfide (WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) bridged by phosphate (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;CoPc-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is designed and prepared by the traditional wet chemistry method. By introducing a small phosphate molecule into the interface of CoPc and WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, creates an electron &#8220;bridge&#8221;, resulting in a compact combination and eliminating the space barrier. Therefore, the phosphate (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) bridge can serve as an efficient electron transfer channel in heterojunction and can efficiently transmit photoelectrons from WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CoPc under excited states. These excited photoelectrons are captured by the catalytic central Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in CoPc and subsequently convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules into CO and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; products, achieving&#160;17-fold enhancement on the 3CoPc-0.6PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sample compared to that of pure WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Introducing a small molecule &#8220;bridge&#8221; to create an electron transfer channel provides a new perspective in designing efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction into valuable products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PdNi Biatomic Clusters from Metallene Unlock Record&#8208;Low Onset Dehydrogenation Temperature for Bulk&#8208;MgH2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented initial dehydrogenation temperature of bulk MgH2&#8208;PdNi is 422 K, which is lower than the most bulk MgH2&#8208;based composites. PdNi alloy clusters with suitable d&#8208;band centers are used as the main active sites, which together with Pd/Ni pure phase clusters and Pd/Ni single atoms in situ enhance the desorption/absorption process.








Abstract
Hydrogen storage has long been a priority on the renewable energy research agenda. Due to its high volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen density, MgH2 is a desirable candidate for solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage. However, its practical use is constrained by high thermal stability and sluggish kinetics. Here, PdNi bilayer metallenes are reported as catalysts for hydrogen storage of bulk&#8208;MgH2 near ambient temperature. Unprecedented 422 K beginning dehydrogenation temperature and up to 6.36&#160;wt.% reliable hydrogen storage capacity are achieved. Fast hydrogen desorption is also provided by the system (5.49&#160;wt.% in 1&#160;h, 523 K). The in situ generated PdNi alloy clusters with suitable d&#8208;band centers are identified as the main active sites during the de/re&#8208;hydrogenation process by aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy and theoretical simulations, while other active species including Pd/Ni pure phase clusters and Pd/Ni single atoms obtained via metallene ball milling, also enhance the reaction. These findings present fundamental insights into active species identification and rational design of highly efficient hydrogen storage materials.

         <title>In situ Electropolymerized 3D Microporous Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin Nanofilm for Highly Effective Molecular Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D microporous polymer nanofilms of cobalt(II)&#8208;porphyrin are directly and uniformly deposited on the cathode via thickness&#8208;controlled, green, and catalyst&#8208;free electropolymerization. The films exhibit high activity and durability in electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion mainly due to tightly adhered abundant active sites. This work provides an effective way to fabricate molecular catalysts on electrodes for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) based on molecular catalysts, for example, cobalt porphyrin, is promising to enhance the carbon cycle and mitigate current climate crisis. However, the electrocatalytic performance and accurate evaluations remain problems because of either the low loading amount or the low utilization rate of the electroactive CoN4 sites. Herein a monomer is synthesized, cobalt(II)&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(3,5&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)porphyrin (CoP), electropolymerized onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) networks, affording a molecular electrocatalyst of 3D microporous nanofilm (EP&#8208;CoP, 2&#8211;3&#160;nm thickness) with highly dispersed CoN4 sites. The new electrocatalyst shortens the electron transfer pathway, accelerates the redox kinetics of CoN4 sites, and improves the durability of the electrocatalytic CO2RR. From the intrinsic redox behavior of CoN4 sites, the effective utilization rate is obtained as 13.1%, much higher than that of the monomer assembled electrode (5.8%), and the durability is also promoted dramatically (&gt;40&#160;h) in H&#8208;type cells. In commercial flow cells, EP&#8208;CoP can achieve a faradic efficiency for CO (FECO) over 92% at an overpotential of 160&#160;mV. At a higher overpotential of 620&#160;mV, the working current density can reach 310&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a high FECO of 98.6%, representing the best performance for electrodeposited molecular porphyrin electrocatalysts.

         <title>Tailoring the Amphiphilic Structure of Zwitterionic AIE Photosensitizers to Boost Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A philosophy of balanced hydrophobicity&#8211;hydrophilicity is proposed to design aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers for promoting antitumor immunity. A membrane&#8208;targeted AIE photosensitizer called TPS&#8208;2 could induce cell death and membrane rupture by photodynamic therapy. Its aggregate size controllability promotes the release and delivery of antigens to boost in vivo antitumor immunity with only one dose of vaccination.








Abstract
Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) for thorough cancer treatment is hindered by the limited generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with short lifetime from photosensitizers, PDT&#8208;induced antitumor immune response remedies the defects. Previous studies show that inducing immunogenic cell deaths is an attractive approach to activate antitumor immunity, which confers a robust adjuvanticity to dying cancer cells. In this work, amphiphilic luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics (AIEgens) are rationally designed and synthesized. By modulating the hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;bridge and zwitterionic functional groups, these AIEgens exhibit tunable organelle specificity to lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane and enhance ROS generation ability. Notably, the membrane&#8208;targeting AIEgen namely TPS&#8208;2 induces cell death and membrane rupture via PDT to facilitate the release of antigens and activation of immune cells. Furthermore, the size&#8208;controlled TPS&#8208;2 nanoaggregates are found to serve as an adjuvant, promoting antigen accumulation and delivery to sufficiently boost the in vivo antitumor immunity by only one dose injection in a prophylactic tumor vaccination model. This work thus provides new insights into optimizing AIE photosensitizers via a hydrophobicity&#8211;hydrophilicity balance strategy for evoking an antitumor immunity and directly suppressing the distanced tumor. A single small&#8208;molecular system for PDT&#8208;stimulated antitumor immunity is envisioned.

         <title>Engineering Functionalized 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets with Fast Li+ Conduction for Advanced Solid Li&#160;Batteries</title>

Functionalized two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) sheets have been designed through molecular engineering to construct high&#8208;performance composite electrolytes, where the electron&#8208;donating effect of substituents in 2D&#8208;MOFs effectively limits the movement of ClO4&#8208; and promotes mechanical properties and ion migration numbers (0.36 up to 0.64) of poly(ethylene oxide), delivering largely enhanced electrochemical performance. 








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries can ensure high energy density and safety in lithium metal batteries, while polymer electrolytes are plagued by slow ion kinetics and low selective transport of Li+. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are proposed as emerging fillers for solid&#8208;state poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO) electrolytes, however, developing functionalized MOFs and understanding their roles on ion transfer has proven challenging.

&lt;p&gt;Functionalized two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic framework (MOF) sheets have been designed through molecular engineering to construct high-performance composite electrolytes, where the electron-donating effect of substituents in 2D-MOFs effectively limits the movement of ClO&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and promotes mechanical properties and ion migration numbers (0.36 up to 0.64) of poly(ethylene oxide), delivering largely enhanced electrochemical performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state batteries can ensure high energy density and safety in lithium metal batteries, while polymer electrolytes are plagued by slow ion kinetics and low selective transport of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are proposed as emerging fillers for solid-state poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO) electrolytes, however, developing functionalized MOFs and understanding their roles on ion transfer has proven challenging. Herein, combining computational and experimental results, the functional group regulation in MOFs can effectively change surficial charge distribution and limit anion movement is revealed, providing a potential solution to these issues. Specifically, functionalized 2D MOF sheets are designed through molecular engineering to construct high-performance composite electrolytes, where the electron-donating effect of substituents in 2D-MOFs effectively limits the movement of ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency of Low&#8208;Grade Heat Harvesting by Structural Vibration Entropy in Thermally Regenerative Electrochemical Cycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) is a promising energy harvesting system converting low&#8208;grade heat to usable electrochemical energy. In this work, the structural water molecules' influence is confirmed on the bond covalency. As a result, the small amount of water molecules induces strong A1g vibration which can enhance structural vibration, improving the performance of the TREC system.








Abstract
The majority of waste&#8208;heat energy exists in the form of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C), which is immensely difficult to convert into usable energy using conventional energy&#8208;harvesting systems. Thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles (TREC), which integrate battery and thermal&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting functionalities, are considered an attractive system for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. Herein, the role of structural vibration modes in enhancing the efficacy of TREC systems is investigated. How changes in bonding covalency, influenced by the number of structural water molecules, impact the vibration modes is analyzed. It is discovered that even small amounts of water molecules can induce the A1g stretching mode of cyanide ligands with strong structural vibration energy, which significantly contributes to a larger temperature coefficient (&#593;) in a TREC system. Leveraging these insights, a highly efficient TREC system using a sodium&#8208;ion&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte is designed and implemented. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of TREC systems, offering a deeper understanding of the intrinsic properties of Prussian Blue analogs regulated by structural vibration modes. These insights open up new possibilities for enhancing the energy&#8208;harvesting capabilities of TREC systems.

         <title>Extreme &#947;&#8208;Ray Radiation Tolerance of Spectrometer&#8208;Grade CsPbBr3 Perovskite Detectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How the new radiation detector material, CsPbBr3, holds up to high radiation doses often found in industrial settings and extreme radiation in space is evaluated. Remarkable stability is observed in detector performance after exposure to 1&#160;Mrad of Co&#8208;60 gamma radiation, with many devices still functional after being exposed to a 10&#160;Mrad dose over 3 days. Those that do not survive can still be refabricated into working detectors.








Abstract
The perovskite compound CsPbBr3 has recently been discovered as a promising room&#8208;temperature semiconductor radiation detector, offering an inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;manufacture alternative to the current benchmark material Cd1&#8722;xZnxTe (CZT). The performance of CsPbBr3 sensors is evaluated under harsh conditions, such as high radiation doses often found in industrial settings and extreme radiation in space. Results show minimal degradation in detector performance after exposure to 1&#160;Mrad of Co&#8208;60 gamma radiation, with no significant change to energy resolution or hole mobility and lifetime. Additionally, many of the devices are still functional after being exposed to a 10&#160;Mrad dose over 3 days, and those that do not survive can still be refabricated into working detectors. These results suggest that the failure mode in these devices is likely related to the interface between the electrode and material and their reaction, or the electrode itself and not the material itself. Overall, the study suggests that CsPbBr3 has high potential as a reliable and efficient radiation detector in various applications, including those involving extreme fluxes and energies of gamma&#8208;ray radiation.

         <title>A Stretchable Polymer Conductor Through the Mutual Plasticization Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stretchable and conductive thin film electrodes are prepared by combing PEDOT:PSS with a mutually plasticized polyrotaxane dopant. Harsh acid&#8208;treatment for conductivity enhancement is avoided, and good solvent tolerance and high optical transparency are realized. The transparent electrochromic display that can bear stretching up to 80% strain is further developed, demonstrating its promising application in next&#8208;generation optoelectronics.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable conductors play key roles in the dynamic interfacing of electronic devices with soft human tissues. However, it is difficult to simultaneously achieve high electrical conductivity and mechanical stretchability. Here, highly stretchable and conductive thin film electrodes are prepared by combining PEDOT:PSS and a mutually plasticized polymer dopant. Notably, harsh acid treatment for conductivity enhancement is avoided, and good solvent tolerance and high optical transparency are realized, all of which are essential to device fabrication. A transparent electrochromic display is further developed that can bear stretching up to 80% strain, demonstrating its promising application in next&#8208;generation optoelectronics.

         <title>Mn&#8208;Oxygen Compounds Coordinated Ruthenium Sites with Deprotonated and Low Oxophilic Microenvironments for Membrane Electrolyzer&#8208;Based H2&#8208;Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8208;oxygen compounds coordinated ruthenium sites (MOC&#8208;Ru) with deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments are created for modulating the adsorption&#8211;desorption of H* and OH*. Benefiting from the unique advantages of MOC, the MOC&#8208;Ru exhibits extremely low overpotential and ultralong stability in both acidic and alkaline hydrogen evolution. The MOC&#8208;Ru catalyst&#8208;equipped membrane electrolyzer displays outstanding activity and stability for continuous H2&#8208;production.








Abstract
Among the platinum&#8208;group metals, ruthenium (Ru), with a low water dissociation energy, is considered a promising alternative to substitute Pt for catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, optimizing the adsorption&#8211;desorption energies of H* and OH* intermediates on Ru catalytic sites is extremely desirable but remains challenging. Inspired by the natural catalytic characteristics of Mn&#8208;oxygen complex, this study reports to design Mn&#8208;oxygen compounds coordinated Ru sites (MOC&#8208;Ru) with deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments for modulating the adsorption&#8211;desorption of H* and OH* to promote HER kinetics. Benefiting from the unique advantages of MOC structures, including weakened H&#63743;OH bond at interface, electron donation ability, and deprotonation capability, the MOC&#8208;Ru exhibits extremely low overpotential and ultralong stability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations elucidate that the MOC can accelerate water dissociation kinetics and promote OH* desorption in alkaline conditions and trigger the long&#8208;range H* spillover for H2&#8208;release in acid conditions. The outstanding activity and stability of membrane electrolyzer display that the MOC&#8208;Ru catalyst holds great potential as cathode for H2&#8208;production. This study provides essential insights into the crucial roles of deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments in HER catalysis and offers a new pathway to create an efficient water&#8208;splitting cathode.

The outstanding activity and stability of membrane electrolyzer display that the MOC-Ru catalyst holds great potential as cathode for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-production. This study provides essential insights into the crucial roles of deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments in HER catalysis and offers a new pathway to create an efficient water-splitting cathode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unique Tridentate Coordination Tailored Solvation Sheath Toward Highly Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates bi/tridentate coordination by designing a single&#8208;solvent electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. A newly developed bis(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)methane solvent featuring multiple oxygen ligand sites enables more anions access the solvation sheath, facilitating stable interfacial chemistryand fast de&#8208;solvation kinetics. The electrolyte exhibits good compatibility with high&#8208;loading cathodes and limited Li metal anodes, as well as wide&#8208;temperature adaptability for practical applications.








Abstract
Electrolyte optimization by solvent molecule design is recognized as an effective approach for stabilizing lithium (Li) metal batteries. However, the coordination pattern of Li ions&#160;(Li+) with solvent molecules is sparsely considered. Here, an electrolyte design strategy is reported based on bi/tridentate chelation of Li+ and solvent to tune the solvation structure. As a proof of concept, a novel solvent with multi&#8208;oxygen coordination sites is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of an anion&#8208;aggregated solvation shell, enhancing the interfacial stability and de&#8208;solvation kinetics. As a result, the as&#8208;developed electrolyte exhibits ultra&#8208;stable cycling over 1400&#160;h in symmetric cells with 50&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thin Li foils. When paired with high&#8208;loading LiFePO4, full cells maintain 92% capacity over 500 cycles and deliver improved electrochemical performances over a wide temperature range from &#8722;10 to 60&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the concept is validated in a pouch cell (570&#160;mAh), achieving a capacity retention of 99.5% after 100 cycles. This brand&#8208;new insight on electrolyte engineering provides guidelines for practical high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

         <title>Flagella of Tumor&#8208;Targeting Bacteria Trigger Local Hemorrhage to Reprogram Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages for Improved Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor&#8208;specific and persistent hemorrhage is induced by flagella of tumor&#8208;targeting multiflagellate bacteria. The erythrophagocytosis of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) can increase intracellular heme accumulation. Artesunate forms a complex by specifically combining with heme to generate reactive oxygen species, which can enhance the pro&#8208;inflammatory polarization of TAMs and remodel tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment to improve antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) exhibit an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype and lead to failure of antitumor therapy. Infiltrated erythrocytes during hemorrhage are recognized as a promising strategy for polarizing TAMs. However, novel materials that precisely induce tumor hemorrhage without affecting normal coagulation still face challenges. Here, tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria (flhDC VNP) are genetically constructed to realize precise tumor hemorrhage. FlhDC VNP colonizes the tumor and overexpresses flagella during proliferation. The flagella promote the expression of tumor necrosis factor &#945;, which induces local tumor hemorrhage. Infiltrated erythrocytes during the hemorrhage temporarily polarize macrophages to the M1 subtype. In the presence of artesunate, this short&#8208;lived polarization is transformed into a sustained polarization because artesunate and heme form a complex that continuously produces reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the flagella of active tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria may open up new strategies for reprogramming TAMs and improving antitumor therapy.

         <title>Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett&#8208;Mediated Formation of Antibacterial Microneedles for Long&#8208;Term Transdermal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibacterial microneedles are developed via a simple strategy by depositing antibacterial nanoparticles of various shapes, sizes, and compositions onto microneedles for risk reduction of microneedle&#8208;induced skin infection with long&#8208;term transdermal administration. This functional nanoparticle coating strategy, which features controlled coating layers, uniform and high coverage, and simplicity of fabrication, provides a versatile platform for the expansion of microneedle applications.








Abstract
Microneedles (MNs) have become versatile platforms for minimally invasive transdermal drug delivery devices. However, there are concerns about MN&#8208;induced skin infections with long&#8208;term transdermal administration. Using the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett (LB) technique, a simple method for depositing antibacterial nanoparticles of various shapes, sizes, and compositions onto MNs is developed. This strategy has merits over conventional dip coating techniques, including controlled coating layers, uniform and high coverage, and a straightforward fabrication process. This provides MNs with a fast&#8208;acting and long&#8208;lasting antibacterial effect. This&#160;study demonstrates that antibacterial MNs achieve superior bacterial elimination in vitro and in vivo without sacrificing payload capacity, drug release, or mechanical strength. It is&#160;believed that such a functional nanoparticle coating technique offers a platform for the expansion of MNs function, especially in long&#8208;term transdermal drug delivery fields.

         <title>Bioinspired Luminescent HOF&#8208;Based Foam as Ultrafast and Ultrasensitive Pressure and Acoustic Bimodal Sensor for Human&#8211;Machine Interactive Object and Information Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent HOF&#8208;based foam is utilized as a pressure&#8208;acoustic bimodal sensor, which exhibits great sensitivity and a fast response time in pressure and sound sensing processes. The sensing mechanisms toward pressure and auditory are analyzed in detail by finite element simulation. The pressure&#8208;acoustic bimodal sensor is applied for object and word information recognition by human&#8211;machine interaction.








Abstract
Bionic sensors have extensively served smart robots, medical equipment, and flexible wearable devices. The luminescent pressure&#8208;acoustic bimodal sensor can be treated as a remarkable, multifunctional, integrated bionic device. Here, a blue&#8208;emitting hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;TTA) as luminogen combines with melamine foam (MF), generating the flexible and elastic HOF&#8208;TTA@MF (1 and 2) as a pressure&#8211;auditory bimodal sensor. In the luminescent pressure sensing process, 1 has excellent maximum sensitivity (132.02&#160;kPa&#8722;1), low minimum detection limit (0.0&#8239;1333&#160;Pa), fast response time (20&#160;ms), high precision and great recyclability. 2 as a luminescent auditory sensor exhibits the highest response to the 520&#160;Hz sound at 255&#8722;1453&#160;Hz. In the process of sensing sound at 520&#160;Hz, 2 possesses high sensitivity (1&#8239;648&#8239;441.3&#160;cps&#160;Pa&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2), low detection limit (0.36&#160;dB) and ultrafast response time (10&#160;ms) within 11.47&#8722;91.77&#160;dB. The sensing mechanisms toward pressure and auditory are analyzed in detail by finite element simulation. Furthermore, 1 and 2, as a human&#8211;machine interactive bimodal sensor, can recognize nine different objects and word information of &#8220;Health&#8221;, &#8220;Phone&#8221;, and &#8220;TongJi&#8221; with high accuracy and strong robustness. This work provides a facile fabricated method of luminescent HOF&#8208;based pressure&#8211;auditory bimodal sensors and endows them with new recognition functions and dimensions.

         <title>Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Printing of Anomalous Nernst Thermopile for Direct Sensing of Perpendicular Heat Flux</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel circuit design that counteracts the Seebeck effect has enabled the direct sensing of perpendicular heat flux using the anomalous Nernst effect thermopile. This allows for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing of flexible and practical thermoelectric devices, with advantages including mass production, large area coverage, and reduced cost. Its applications are expected to drive future advances in thermal management technology.








Abstract
The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) converts heat flux perpendicular to the plane into electricity, in sharp contrast with the Seebeck effect (SE), enabling mass production, large area, and flexibility of their devices through ordinary thin&#8208;film fabrication techniques. Heat flux sensors, one of the most promising applications of ANE, are powerful devices for evaluating heat flow and can lead to energy savings through efficient thermal management. In reality, however, SE caused by the in&#8208;plane heat flux is always superimposed on the measurement signal, making it difficult to evaluate the perpendicular heat flux. Here, ANE&#8208;type heat flux sensors that selectively detect a perpendicular heat flux are fabricated by adjusting the net Seebeck coefficient in their thermopile circuit with mass&#8208;producible roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll sputtering methods. The direct sensing of perpendicular heat flux using ANE&#8208;based flexible thermopiles, as well as their simple fabrication process, paves the way for the practical application of thin&#8208;film thermoelectric devices.

         <title>Defect Engineering of a High&#8208;Entropy Metallic Glass Surface for High&#8208;Performance Overall Water Splitting at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect engineering strategy is presented to construct nanoporous high&#8208;entropy metallic glass with nanocrystalline surface structure that contains lattice distortion and stacking faults to achieve ultralow overpotentials at ampere&#8208;level current density. It retains a long&#8208;term durability of 200&#160;h. The excellent performance is attributed to the defects for optimizing atomic configuration while the nanoporous architecture providing abundant active sites.








Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based electrocatalysts possess high water electrolysis activity and are essential components for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A major challenge, however, is how to break the cost&#8208;efficiency trade&#8208;off. Here, a novel defect engineering strategy is presented to construct a nanoporous (FeCoNiB0.75)97Pt3 (atomic %) high&#8208;entropy metallic glass (HEMG) with a nanocrystalline surface structure that contains large amounts of lattice distortion and stacking faults to achieve excellent electrocatalytic performance using only 3&#160;at% of Pt. The defect&#8208;rich HEMG achieves ultralow overpotentials at ampere&#8208;level current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for HER (104&#160;mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (301&#160;mV) under alkaline conditions, while retains a long&#8208;term durability exceeding 200&#160;h at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it only requires 81 and 122&#160;mV to drive the current densities of 1000 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for HER under acidic and neutral conditions, respectively. Modelling results reveal that lattice distortion and stacking fault defects help to optimize atomic configuration and modulate electronic interaction, while the surface nanoporous architecture provides abundant active sites, thus synergistically contributing to the reduced energy barrier for water electrolysis. This defect engineering approach combined with a HEMG design strategy is expected to be widely applicable for development of high&#8208;performance alloy catalysts.

         <title>Engineering the Structural Uniformity of Gel Polymer Electrolytes via Pattern&#8208;Guided Alignment for Durable, Safe Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin gel polymer electrolyte (P&#8208;PPL) with patterned structure and superior mechanical toughness (&#8776;613%) for durable and safe solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery is developed. The special patterned structure enables rapid ionic transfer kinetics and uniform Li+ flux. The solid&#8208;state LiFePO4||P&#8208;PPL||Li batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability, high rate capacity as well as high safety.








Abstract
Ultrathin and super&#8208;toughness gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are the key enabling technology for durable, safe, and high&#8208;energy density solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) but extremely challenging. However, GPEs with limited uniformity and continuity exhibit an uneven Li+ flux distribution, leading to nonuniform deposition. Herein, a fiber patterning strategy for developing and engineering ultrathin (16&#160;&#181;m) fibrous GPEs with high ionic conductivity (&#8776;0.4 mS cm&#8722;1) and superior mechanical toughness (&#8776;613%) for durable and safe SSLMBs is proposed. The special patterned structure provides fast Li+ transport channels and tailoring solvation structure of traditional LiPF6&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and uniform Li+ flux, and boosting stability against Li anodes, thus realizing ultralong Li plating/stripping in the symmetrical cell over 3000&#160;h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the SSLMBs with high LiFePO4 loading of 10.58&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 deliver ultralong stable cycling life over 1570 cycles at 1.0 C with 92.5% capacity retention and excellent rate capacity of 129.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 C with a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.2&#160;V (100% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge). Patterned GPEs systems are powerful strategies for producing durable and safe SSLMBs.

         <title>Dry&#8208;Transferable Photoresist Enabled Reliable Conformal Patterning for Ultrathin Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfabrication approach using synthesized high&#8208;resolution and environmentally friendly photoresists is demonstrated. This approach allows the transfer of photoresists onto various substrates to enable reliable conformal manufacturing of thin&#8208;film flexible electronics. Various exemplary demonstrations suggest the potential of this technology for many emerging applications, including flexible electronics, smart devices, bioelectronics, as well as human&#8208;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Photolithographic techniques, which are widely used in the silicon&#8208;based semiconductor industry, enable the manufacture of high&#8208;yield and high&#8208;resolution features at the micrometer and nanometer scales. However, conventional photolithographic processes cannot accommodate the micro/nanofabrication of flexible and stretchable electronics. In this study, a microfabrication approach that uses a synthesized, environmentally friendly, and dry&#8208;transferable photoresist to enable the reliable conformal manufacturing of thin&#8208;film electronics is reported, which is also compatible with the existing cleanroom processes. Photoresists with high&#8208;resolution, high&#8208;density, and multiscale patterns can be transferred onto various substrates in a defect&#8208;free and conformal&#8208;contact manner, thus enabling multiple wafer reuses. Theoretical studies are conducted to investigate the damage&#8208;free peel&#8208;off mechanism of the proposed approach. The in situ fabrication of various electrical components, including ultralight and ultrathin biopotential electrodes, has been demonstrated, which offer lower interfacial impedance, durability, and stability, and the components are applied to collect electromyography signals with superior signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) and quality. Additionally, an exemplary demonstration of a human&#8208;machine interface indicates the potential of these electrodes in many emerging applications, including healthcare, sensing, and artificial intelligence.

         <title>Boosting the Photoluminescence Efficiency of InAs Nanocrystals Synthesized with Aminoarsine via a ZnSe Thick&#8208;Shell Overgrowth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amino&#8208;As based synthesis of InAs@ZnSe core@shell nanocrystals with shell thickness up to seven monolayers is reported. The InAs@ZnSe nanocrystals exhibit photoluminescence quantum yields up to 70%, a record value for such system, thanks to an In&#63743;Zn&#63743;Se interlayer featuring a structure similar to that of In2ZnSe4, which dampens the strain between the InAs core and the ZnSe shell.








Abstract
InAs&#8208;based nanocrystals can enable restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) compliant optoelectronic devices, but their photoluminescence efficiency needs improvement.&#160;We&#160;report an optimized synthesis of InAs@ZnSe core@shell nanocrystals allowing to tune the ZnSe shell thickness up to seven mono&#8208;layers (ML) and to boost the emission, reaching a quantum yield of &#8776;70% at &#8776;900&#160;nm. It is demonstrated that a high quantum yield can be attained when the shell thickness is at least &#8776;3ML. Notably, the photoluminescence lifetimeshows only a minor variation as a function of shell thickness, whereas the Auger recombination time (a limiting aspect in technological applications when fast) slows down from 11 to 38&#160;ps when increasing the shell thickness from 1.5 to 7MLs. Chemical and structural analyses evidence that InAs@ZnSe nanocrystals do not exhibit any strain at the core&#8208;shell interface, likely due to the formation of an In&#63743;Zn&#63743;Se interlayer. This is supported by atomistic modeling, which indicates the interlayer as being composed of In, Zn, Se and cation vacancies, alike to the In2ZnSe4 crystal structure. The simulations reveal an electronic structure consistent with that of type&#8208;I heterostructures, in which localized trap states can be passivated by a thick shell (&gt;3ML) and excitons are confined in the core.

         <title>Aerosol&#8208;Jet&#8208;Printable Covalent Organic Framework Colloidal Inks and Temperature&#8208;Sensitive Nanocomposite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre&#8208;synthesized, solution&#8208;processable covalent organic framework (COF) colloidal ink is demonstrated that enables aerosol jet printing of COFs with micron&#8208;scale resolution. The ink formulation is also compatible with other colloidal nanomaterials, thus facilitating the integration of COFs into printable nanocomposite films with highly tunable properties such as strongly temperature&#8208;dependent electrical conductivity.








Abstract
With molecularly well&#8208;defined and tailorable 2D structures, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as leading material candidates for chemical sensing, storage, separation, and catalysis. In these contexts, the ability to directly and deterministically print COFs into arbitrary geometries will enable rapid optimization and deployment. However, previous attempts to print COFs have been restricted by low spatial resolution and/or post&#8208;deposition polymerization that limits the range of compatible COFs. Here, these limitations are overcome with a pre&#8208;synthesized, solution&#8208;processable colloidal ink that enables aerosol jet printing of COFs with micron&#8208;scale resolution. The ink formulation utilizes the low&#8208;volatility solvent benzonitrile, which is critical to obtaining homogeneous printed COF film morphologies. This ink formulation is also compatible with other colloidal nanomaterials, thus facilitating the integration of COFs into printable nanocomposite films. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, boronate&#8208;ester COFs are integrated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form printable COF&#8208;CNT nanocomposite films, in which the CNTs enhance charge transport and temperature sensing performance, ultimately resulting in high&#8208;sensitivity temperature sensors that show electrical conductivity variation by 4 orders of magnitude between room temperature and 300&#160;&#176;C. Overall, this work establishes a flexible platform for COF additive manufacturing that will accelerate the incorporation of COFs into technologically significant applications.

         <title>Chiral MOF Derived Wearable Logic Sensor for Intuitive Discrimination of Physiologically Active Enantiomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective wearable membrane sensor with dual colorimetric response to lactate enantiomers is developed. The sensor can intuitively index the exercise intensity via the dual colorimetric changes readable to naked eyes, and a chiral IMPLICATION logic gate can be further achieved for smart sensor design.








Abstract
Chiral sensors have attracted growing interest due to their application in health monitoring. However, rational design of wearable logic chiral sensors remains a great challenge. In this work, a dual responsive chiral sensor RT@CDMOF is prepared through in situ self&#8208;assembly of chiral &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic framework (CDMOF), rhodamine 6G hydrazide (RGH), and tetracyanovinylindane (TCN). The embedded RGH and TCN inherit the chirality of host CDMOF, producing dual changes both in fluorescence and reflectance. RT@CDMOF is explored as a dual channel sensor for chiral discrimination of lactate enantiomers. Comprehensive mechanistic studies reveal the chiral binding process, and carboxylate dissociation is confirmed by impedance and solid&#8208;state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). A flexible membrane sensor is successfully fabricated based on RT@CDMOF for wearable health monitoring. Practical evaluation confirms the potential of fabricated membrane sensor in point&#8208;of&#8208;care health monitoring by indexing the exercise intensity. Based on above, a chiral IMPLICATION logic unit can be successfully achieved, demonstrating the promising potential of RT@CDMOF in design and assembly of novel smart devices. This work may open a new avenue to the rational design of logic chiral sensors for wearable health monitoring applications.

         <title>Controllable Synthesis of 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 Lateral Heterostructures and Their Tunable Optoelectronic Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
2H&#8208;1T&#8242;&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 lateral heterostructures are grown by a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition method, and the optoelectronic properties of 2H&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2, 1T&#8242;&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2, and MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2&#8208;based heterostructures are thoroughly studied. Under 405&#8201;nm laser irradiation, 2H&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 exhibits a positive photoconductive effect, while 1T&#8242;&#8201;MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 shows a negative photoconductive effect. The optoelectronic response characteristics of MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2&#8208;based heterostructures can be modulated by gate voltage.








Abstract
Constructing heterostructures and doping are valid ways to improve the optoelectronic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and optimize the performance of TMDs&#8208;based photodetectors. Compared with transfer techniques, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has higher efficiency in preparing heterostructures. As for the one&#8208;step CVD growth of heterostructures, cross&#8208;contamination between the two materials may occur during the growth process, which may provide the possibility of one&#8208;step simultaneous realization of controllable doping and formation of alloy&#8208;based heterostructures by finely tuning the growth dynamics. Here, 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 alloy&#8208;to&#8208;alloy lateral heterostructures are synthesized through this one&#8208;step CVD growth method, utilizing the cross&#8208;contamination and different growth temperatures of the two alloys. Due to the doping of a small amount of Re atoms in 2H MoS2, 2H MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 has a high response rejection ratio in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (SBUV) region and exhibits a positive photoconductive (PPC) effect. While the 1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 formed by heavily doping Mo atoms into 1T' ReS2 will produce a negative photoconductivity (NPC) effect under UV laser irradiation. The optoelectronic property of 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2&#8208;based heterostructures can be modulated by gate voltage. These findings are expected to expand the functionality of traditional optoelectronic devices and have potential applications in optoelectronic logic devices.

As for the one-step CVD growth of heterostructures, cross-contamination between the two materials may occur during the growth process, which may provide the possibility of one-step simultaneous realization of controllable doping and formation of alloy-based heterostructures by finely tuning the growth dynamics. Here, 2H-1T&#8242; Mo&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Re&lt;sub&gt;(1-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; alloy-to-alloy lateral heterostructures are synthesized through this one-step CVD growth method, utilizing the cross-contamination and different growth temperatures of the two alloys. Due to the doping of a small amount of Re atoms in 2H MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 2H Mo&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Re&lt;sub&gt;(1-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a high response rejection ratio in the solar-blind ultraviolet (SBUV) region and exhibits a positive photoconductive (PPC) effect. While the 1T&#8242; Mo&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Re&lt;sub&gt;(1-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formed by heavily doping Mo atoms into 1T' ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will produce a negative photoconductivity (NPC) effect under UV laser irradiation. The optoelectronic property of 2H-1T&#8242; Mo&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Re&lt;sub&gt;(1-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based heterostructures can be modulated by gate voltage. These findings are expected to expand the functionality of traditional optoelectronic devices and have potential applications in optoelectronic logic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Doping Engineering to Modulate Lattice and Electronic Structure for Enhanced Piezocatalytic Therapy and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable, mesoporous, piezoelectric Mn&#8208;doped ZnO nanocluster is first constructed via a facile doping engineering strategy. The peizocatalytic performance of Mn&#8211;ZnO is significantly enhanced due to the generation of built&#8208;in electric field and oxygen vacancy by regulation of lattice space and electronic structure, thereby remarkably enhancing the ROS generation for piezocatalytic therapy and ferroptosis.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic therapy, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) under mechanical force, has garnered extensive attention for its use in cancer therapy owing to its deep tissue penetration depth and less O2&#8208;dependence. However, the piezocatalytic therapeutic efficiency is limited owing to the poor piezoresponse, low separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs, and complicated tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a biodegradable, porous Mn&#8208;doped ZnO (Mn&#8211;ZnO)&#160;nanocluster with enhanced piezoelectric effect is constructed via doping engineering. Mn&#8208;doping not only induces lattice distortion to increase polarization but also creates rich oxygen vacancies (OV) for suppressing the recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs, leading to high&#8208;efficiency generation of ROS under ultrasound irradiation. Moreover, Mn&#8208;doped ZnO shows TME&#8208;responsive multienzyme&#8208;mimicking activity&#160;and&#160;glutathione (GSH) depletion ability owing to the mixed valence of Mn (II/III), further aggravating oxidative stress. Density functional theory calculations show that Mn&#8208;doping can improve the piezocatalytic performance and enzyme activity of Mn&#8211;ZnO due to the presence of OV. Benefiting from the boosting of ROS generation and GSH depletion ability, Mn&#8211;ZnO can significantly accelerate the accumulation of lipid peroxide and inactivate glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to induce ferroptosis. The work may provide new guidance for exploring novel piezoelectric sonosensitizers for tumor therapy.

Monolayer Graphene
In article number 2301441, Matteo Jugovac, Paolo Perna, and co&#8208;workers experimentally discover the existence of a single spin&#8208;polarized flat band in monolayer graphene. The flat band is formed by controlling the doping level of graphene grown on a ferromagnetic cobalt film via europium intercalation. Due to the peculiar adsorption geometry at the interface, the experimental Fermi surfaces resemble Alhambra&#8208;style mosaics.

Core@shell Nanocrystals
In article number 2303621, Gabriele Saleh, Luca De Trizio, Liberato Manna, and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;emitting InAs@ZnSe core@shell nanocrystals with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). The high PLQY stems from the in situ formation of an In&#8211;Zn&#8211;Se interlayer which plays a key role in dampening the strain between the InAs core and the ZnSe shell.

         <title>Recent Progress in Colloidal Quantum Dot Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processable semiconducting quantum dots possess numerous fascinating properties sought for emerging thin&#8208;film thermoelectrics. Herein, key recent developments in colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) for thin&#8208;film thermoelectrics are discussed. The challenges and opportunities in developing efficient CQD&#8208;based thin&#8208;film thermoelectric generators operating near room temperature are highlighted.








Abstract
Semiconducting colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) represent an emerging class of thermoelectric materials for use in a wide range of future applications. CQDs combine solution processability at low temperatures with the potential for upscalable manufacturing via printing techniques. Moreover, due to their low dimensionality, CQDs exhibit quantum confinement and a high density of grain boundaries, which can be independently exploited to tune the Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity, respectively. This unique combination of attractive attributes makes CQDs very promising for application in emerging thermoelectric generator (TEG) technologies operating near room temperature. Herein, recent progress in CQDs for application in emerging thin&#8208;film thermoelectrics is reviewed. First,&#160;the fundamental concepts of thermoelectricity in nanostructured materials are outlined, followed by an overview of the popular synthetic methods used to produce CQDs with controllable sizes and shapes. Recent strides in CQD&#8208;based thermoelectrics are then discussed with emphasis on their application in thin&#8208;film TEGs. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives for further enhancing the performance of CQD&#8208;based thermoelectric materials for future applications are discussed.

         <title>Defect Engineering in Biomedical Sciences</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;engineering of nanomaterials has become a hot topic in recent years because of the resulting excellent physical and chemical properties. Importantly, the properties of nanomaterials can be improved by adjusting the type and concentration of defects. An overview about defect engineering in biomedical science is presented with a view to provide researchers with new ideas from the perspective of materials science.








Abstract
With the promotion of nanochemistry research, large numbers of nanomaterials have been applied in vivo to produce desirable cytotoxic substances in response to endogenous or exogenous stimuli for achieving disease&#8208;specific therapy. However, the performance of nanomaterials is a critical issue that is difficult to improve and optimize under biological conditions. Defect&#8208;engineered nanoparticles have become the most researched hot materials in biomedical applications recently due to their excellent physicochemical properties, such as optical properties and redox reaction capabilities. Importantly, the properties of nanomaterials can be easily adjusted by regulating the type and concentration of defects in the nanoparticles without requiring other complex designs. Therefore, this tutorial review focuses on biomedical defect engineering and briefly discusses defect classification, introduction strategies, and characterization techniques. Several representative defective nanomaterials are especially discussed in order to reveal the relationship between defects and properties. A series of disease treatment strategies based on defective engineered nanomaterials are summarized. By summarizing the design and application of defective engineered nanomaterials, a simple but effective methodology is provided for researchers to design and improve the therapeutic effects of nanomaterial&#8208;based therapeutic platforms from a materials science perspective.

         <title>Tuning the Coordination Environment of Carbon&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Doping with Multiple Heteroatoms and Their Applications in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulation of the coordination environment of carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) by doping multi&#8208;heteroatoms and its application in electrochemical reactions are systematically reviewed. The reaction mechanism and structure&#8211;activity relationship of carbon&#8208;based SACs are discussed by combining experimental results and theoretical calculations. Some suggestions are proposed regarding the challenges facing this strategy for the future development of carbon&#8208;based SACs.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are considered to be a perfect platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationship of different reactions due to the adjustability of their coordination environment. Multi&#8208;heteroatom doping has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for tuning the coordination environment of carbon&#8208;based SACs and enhancing catalytic performance in electrochemical reactions. Herein, recently developed strategies for multi&#8208;heteroatom doping, focusing on the regulation of single&#8208;atom active sites by heteroatoms in different coordination shells, are summarized. In addition, the correlation between the coordination environment and the catalytic activity of carbon&#8208;based SACs are investigated through representative experiments and theoretical calculations for various electrochemical reactions. Finally, concerning certain shortcomings of the current strategies of doping multi&#8208;heteroatoms, some suggestions are put forward to promote the development of carbon&#8208;based SACs in the field of electrocatalysis.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Carbonization &#8211; A Powerful Tool for Micro&#8208;Fabrication of Patterned Electronic Carbons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on fundamentals and potential applications: Laser&#8208;induced carbonization is a versatile tool for the direct fabrication of functional carbon patterns. By selection of precursors and process parameters, the properties of the laser&#8208;patterned carbons are tuned to meet the materials requirements for different applications like micro&#8208;energy storage, electrocatalysis, sensors, or antenna&#8208;related devices.








Abstract
Fabricating electronic devices from natural, renewable resources is a common goal in engineering and materials science. In this regard, carbon is of special significance due to its biocompatibility combined with electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability. In microelectronics, however, carbon's device application is often inhibited by tedious and expensive preparation processes and a lack of control over processing and material parameters. Laser&#8208;assisted carbonization is emerging as a tool for the precise and selective synthesis of functional carbon&#8208;based materials for flexible device applications. In contrast to conventional carbonization via in&#8208;furnace pyrolysis, laser&#8208;carbonization is induced photo&#8208;thermally and occurs on the time&#8208;scale of milliseconds. By careful selection of the precursors and process parameters, the properties of this so&#8208;called laser&#8208;patterned carbon (LP&#8208;C) such as porosity, surface polarity, functional groups, degree of graphitization, charge&#8208;carrier structure, etc. can be tuned. In this critical review, a common perspective is generated on laser&#8208;carbonization in the context of general carbonization strategies, fundamentals of laser&#8208;induced materials processing, and flexible electronic applications, like electrodes for sensors, electrocatalysts, energy storage, or antennas. An attempt is made to have equal emphasis on material processing and application aspects such that this emerging technology can be optimally positioned in the broader context of carbon&#8208;based microfabrication.

         <title>In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 38, September 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advances in the in situ transmission electron microscopy investigations on dynamic transformation and the corresponding morphological, structural, and chemical evolutions during the sodium storage process in the sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) including cathode materials, anode materials, and solid&#8208;electrolyte interface. This review aims to clarify the structure/composition&#8208;electrochemical performance relationship and to provide insights into the effective selection and rational design of advanced electrode materials for high&#8208;performance SIBs.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted tremendous attentions in recent years due to the abundance and wide distribution of Na resource on the earth. However, SIBs still face the critical issues of low energy density and unsatisfactory cyclic stability at present. The enhancement of electrochemical performance of SIBs depends on comprehensive and precise understanding of the underlying sodium storage mechanism. Although extensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations have been performed to reveal the sodium storage property and mechanism of SIBs, a dedicated review on the in situ TEM investigations of SIBs has not been reported. In this review, recent progress in the in situ TEM investigations on the morphological, structural, and chemical evolutions of cathode materials, anode materials, and solid&#8208;electrolyte interface during the sodium storage of SIBs is comprehensively summarized. The detailed relationship between structure/composition of electrode materials and electrochemical performance of SIBs has been clarified. This review aims to provide insights into the effective selection and rational design of advanced electrode materials for high&#8208;performance SIBs.

         <title>Microfluidic&#8208;Assembled Covalent Organic Frameworks@Ti3C2Tx MXene Vertical Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance electrochemical supercapacitor based on vertically structured covalent organic frameworks@Ti3C2Tx MXene fiber is developed via one&#8208;step microfluidic synthesis. Due to vertical ion transport channels, sufficient ion&#8208;accessible area, decreased ion adsorption energy, excellent pseudocapacitive activity, and strong interfacial electron migration, the supercapacitors exhibit large capacitance, high energy density, excellent cycling stability, and wearable applications.








Abstract
The delicate design of innovative and sophisticated fibers with vertical porous skeleton and eminent electrochemical activity to generate directional ionic pathways and good faradic charge accessibility is pivotal but challenging for realizing high&#8208;performance fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). Here, hierarchically ordered hybrid fiber combined vertical&#8208;aligned and conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene (VA&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) with interstratified electroactive covalent organic frameworks LZU1 (COF&#8208;LZU1) by one&#8208;step microfluidic synthesis is developed. Due to the incorporation of vertical channels, abundant redox active sites and large accessible surface area throughout the electrode, the VA&#8208;Ti3C2Tx@COF&#8208;LZU1 fibers express exceptional gravimetric capacitance of 787&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 in a three&#8208;electrode system. Additionally, the solid&#8208;state asymmetric FSCs deliver a prominent energy density of 27&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, capacitance of 398&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 and cycling life of 20&#160;000 cycles. The key to high energy storage ability originates from the decreased ions adsorption energy and ameliorative charge density distribution in vertically aligned and active hybrid fiber, accelerating ions transportation/accommodation and interfacial electrons transfer. Benefiting from excellent electrochemical performance, the FSCs offer sufficient energy supply to power watches, flags, and digital display tubes as well as be integrated with sensors to detect pulse signals, which opens a promising route for architecting advanced fiber toward the carbon neutrality market beyond energy&#8208;storage technology.

         <title>Ductile Oligomeric Acceptor&#8208;Modified Flexible Organic Solar Cells Show Excellent Mechanical Robustness and Near 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oligomeric acceptors with different flexible alkyl chains (DOY&#8208;C2, DOY&#8208;C4, and TOY&#8208;C4) are synthesized. When doped into D18:N3 system, outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.01% and 17.91% are achieved in rigid and flexible devices based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4, respectively. In addition, the mechanical properties of ternary films are also successfully improved due to form tie and entangled chain networks.








Abstract
High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness are key requirements for wearable applications of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, almost all highly efficient photoactive films comprising polymer donors (PD) and small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are mechanically brittle. In this study, highly efficient (PCE = 17.91%) and mechanically robust (crack&#8208;onset strain [COS] = 11.7%) flexible OSCs are fabricated by incorporating a ductile oligomeric acceptor (DOA) into the PD:SMA system, representing the most flexible OSCs to date. The photophysical, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties of D18:N3 with different DOAs are characterized. By introducing DOA DOY&#8208;C4 with a longer flexible alkyl linker and lower polymerization, the D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4&#8208;based flexible OSCs exhibit a significantly higher PCE (17.91%) and 50% higher COS (11.7%) than the D18:N3&#8208;based device (PCE = 17.06%, COS = 7.8%). The flexible OSCs based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4 retain 98% of the initial PCE after 2000 consecutive bending cycles, showing greater mechanical stability than the reference device (maintaining 89% of initial PCE). After careful investigation, it is hypothesized that the enhancement in mechanical properties is mainly due to the formation of tie chains or entanglement in the ternary blend films. These results demonstrate that DOAs have great potential for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;The oligomeric acceptors with different flexible alkyl chains (DOY-C2, DOY-C4, and TOY-C4) are synthesized. When doped into D18:N3 system, outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.01% and 17.91% are achieved in rigid and flexible devices based on D18:N3:DOY-C4, respectively. In addition, the mechanical properties of ternary films are also successfully improved due to form tie and entangled chain networks.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional Perovskite&#8208;Based Photodetector and Memristor for Visual Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor is designed, realizing visual perception and memory capacities. The dual&#8208;functional device exhibit excellent performance in both PD and memristor. Such a device provides new opportunities for the mimicry of human visual memory in future multifunctional application.








Abstract
The imitation of human visual memory demands the multifunctional integration of light sensors similar to the eyes, and image memory, similar to the brain. Although humans have already implemented electronic devices with visual memory functions, these devices require a combination of various components and logical circuits. However, the combination&#160;of visual perception and high&#8208;performance information storage capabilities into a single device to achieve visual memory remains challenging. In this study, inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor are designed to realize visual perception and memory capacities. As a PD, it realizes an ultrahigh self&#8208;powered responsivity of 276&#160;mA W&#8722;1, a high detectivity of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;Jones (530&#160;nm; light intensities, 2.34&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;100 (&#177;2&#160;V). As a memristor, an ultrahigh on/off ratio (&#8776;105), an ultralow power consumption of 3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;11&#160;W, a low setting voltage (0.15&#160;V), and a long retention time (&gt;7000&#160;s) are realized. Moreover, the dual&#8208;functional device has the capacity to perceive and remember light paths and store data with good cyclic stability. This device exhibits perceptual and cyclic erasable memory functions, which provides new opportunities for mimicking human visual memory in future multifunctional applications.

         <title>Dual Breaking of Molecular Orbitals and Spatial Symmetry in an Optically Controlled Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual breaking of molecular orbitals and spatial symmetry enables the optical control of two ferroelectric states between the closed&#8208;ring and open&#8208;ring forms of a photochromic organic ferroelectric, which is an unprecedented mechanism in ferroelectrics and brings a new paradigm for manipulating ferroelectric polarization. 








Abstract
As particles carry quantified energy, photon radiation enables orbital transitions of energy levels, leading to changes in the spin state of electrons. The resulting switchable structural bistability may bring a new paradigm for manipulating ferroelectric polarization. However, the studies on molecular orbital breaking in the ferroelectric field remain blank. Here, for the first time, a new mechanism of ferroelectrics&#8212;dual breaking of molecular orbitals and spatial symmetry, demonstrated in a photochromic organic crystal with light&#8208;induced polarization switching, is formally proposed. By alternating the ultraviolet/visible light irradiation, the states of electron spin and the radial distribution p atomic orbitals experience a change, showing a reversible switch from &#8220;shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder&#8221; form to a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; form. This reflects a reversible conversion between &#960; and &#963; bonds, which induces and couples with the variation of spatial symmetry. The intersection of spatial symmetry breaking and molecular orbital breaking in ferroelectrics present in this work will be more conducive to data encryption and anticounterfeiting.

         <title>Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction of (Fe,Ni)OOH via Defect Engineering for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis Under Industrial Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH catalyst is prepared through an energy&#8208;saving cation exchange method. It exhibits good catalytic durability and structural stability for large&#8208;scale alkaline water oxidation under industrial conditions. When coupled with NiMoN and assembled in an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, the large&#8208;area d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH&#8208;NiMoN pair shows outstanding overall water electrolysis performance.








Abstract
Developing non&#8208;precious catalysts with long&#8208;term catalytic durability and structural stability under industrial conditions is the key to practical alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis. Here, an energy&#8208;saving approach is proposed to synthesize defect&#8208;rich iron nickel oxyhydroxide for stability and efficiency toward the oxygen evolution reaction. Benefiting from in situ cation exchange, the nanosheet&#8208;nanoflake&#8208;structured catalyst is homogeneously embedded in, and tightly bonded to, its substrate, making it ultrastable at high current densities. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the introduction of Ni in FeOOH reduces the activation energy barrier for the catalytic reaction and that the purposely created oxygen defects not only ensure the exposure of active sites and maximize the effective catalyst surface but also modulate the local coordination environment and chemisorption properties of both Fe and Ni sites, thus lowering the energy barrier from *O to *OOH. Consequently, the optimized d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic activity with long&#8208;term durability under both laboratory and industrial conditions. The large&#8208;area d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH||NiMoN pair requires 1.795&#160;V to reach a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an absolute current of 12.5 A in an AEM electrolyzer for overall water electrolysis, showing great potential for industrial water electrolysis.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Bacteriochlorin Nanosheet as a Specific Pyroptosis Inducer for Robust Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin nanosheets as a specific pyroptosis inducer exhibit the ability to induce both Cu+&#8208;driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy to produce potent reactive oxygen species, leading to pyroptosis of primary tumors while promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell activation, thereby enhancing tumor immunogenicity for inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases with minimal systemic side effects.








Abstract
Pyroptosis is increasingly considered a new weathervane in cancer immune therapy. However, triggering specific pyroptotic tumor cell death while preserving normal cells still remains a major challenge. Herein, a brand&#8208;new pyroptosis inducer, copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin nanosheet (Cu&#8208;TBB), is designed. The synthesized Cu&#8208;TBB can&#160;be activated to an &#8220;on&#8221; state in the tumor microenvironment with glutathione (GSH) overexpression, leading to the release of Cu+ and TBB, respectively. Intriguingly, the released Cu+ can&#160;drive cascade reactions to produce O2&#8722;&#8226; and highly toxic &#183;OH in cells. Additionally, the released TBB can&#160;also generate O2&#8722;&#8226; and 1O2 upon 750&#160;nm laser irradiation. Encouragingly, both Cu+&#8208;driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy pathways result in potent pyroptosis along with dendritic cell maturation and T cell priming, thus simultaneously eliminating the primary tumors and inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases. Conclusively, the well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;TBB nanosheet is shown to trigger specific pyroptosis in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo, leading to enhanced tumor immunogenicity and antitumor efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects.

Encouragingly, both Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy pathways result in potent pyroptosis along with dendritic cell maturation and T cell priming, thus simultaneously eliminating the primary tumors and inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases. Conclusively, the well-designed Cu-TBB nanosheet is shown to trigger specific pyroptosis in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo, leading to enhanced tumor immunogenicity and antitumor efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Orally Administered Cascade Nanozyme for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Materials Project is used as a candidate database to establish a rational nine&#8208;tier high&#8208;throughput screening method for multifaceted therapeutic demands for IBD. Ni3S4 is selected as the best matching nanozyme, with 3.13&#8208; and 1.80&#8208;fold higher activity than natural superoxide dismutase and catalase, respectively, and its therapeutic effectiveness is demonstrated using in vitro and in vivo anti&#8208;inflammatory models.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects millions of individuals worldwide annually. Enteric reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in the physiology and pathology of IBD. Nanozymes hold great promise for the treatment of IBD because of their exceptional ability to regulate redox homeostasis during ROS&#8208;related inflammation. However, the rapid development of orally administered, acid&#8208;tolerant, antioxidant nanozymes for IBD therapy is challenging. Here, a nine&#8208;tier high&#8208;throughput screening strategy is established to address the multifaceted IBD treatment demands, including intrinsic stability, radioactivity, solubility, gut microbiome toxicity, biomimetic elements, intermediate frontier molecular orbitals, reaction energy barriers, negative charges, and acid tolerance. Ni3S4 is selected as the best matching material from 146&#160;323 candidates, which exhibits superoxide dismutase&#8208;catalase bienzyme&#8208;like activity and is 3.13&#8208; and 1.80&#8208;fold more active than natural enzymes. As demonstrated in a mouse model, Ni3S4 is stable in the gastrointestinal tract without toxicity and specifically targets the diseased colon to alleviate oxidative stress. RNA and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses show that Ni3S4 effectively inhibits the cellular pathways of pro&#8208;inflammatory factors and restores the gut microbiota. This study not develops a highly efficient orally administered cascade nanozyme for IBD therapy and offers a next&#8208;generation paradigm for the rational design of nanomedicine through data&#8208;driven approaches.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Lasing in Perovskite LEDs with an Integrated Distributed Feedback Resonator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;wave lasing in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator is achieved, showing a low threshold of 220&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. The LED can also work well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically pumping. The results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.








Abstract
Realization of electrically pumped laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processed semiconductors is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Metal halide perovskites have shown great potential toward this goal due to their&#160;excellent optoelectronic properties. Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) optically pumped lasing in a real electroluminescent device represents a key step to current&#8208;injection laser diodes, but it has not yet been realized. This is mainly due to the challenge of incorporating a resonant cavity into an efficient light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) able to sustain intensive carrier injection. Here, CW lasing is reported in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator, which shows a low lasing threshold of 220&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. Importantly, the LED works well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically pumping. The results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.

Abstract
Efficient blue phosphors remain a formidable challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To circumvent this obstacle, a series of Ir(III)&#8208;based carbene complexes bearing asymmetric di&#8208;N&#8208;aryl 6&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;2H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;b]pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene chelates, namely, f&#8208;ct6a&#8210;c, are synthesized, and their structures and photophysical properties are comprehensively investigated. Moreover, these emitters can undergo interconversion in refluxing 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene, catalyzed by a mixture of sodium acetate (NaOAc) and p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (TsOH&#183;H2O) without decomposition. All Ir(III) complexes present good photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL = 83&#8211;88%) with peak maximum (max.) at 443&#8211;452&#160;nm and narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM = 66&#8211;73&#160;nm). Among all the fabricated OLED devices, f&#8208;ct6b delivers a max. external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage CIEx,y coordinates of (0.14, 0.12), whereas the hyper&#8208;OLED device based on f&#8208;ct6a and 5H,9H,11H,15H&#8208;[1,4] benzazaborino [2,3,4&#8208;kl][1,4]benzazaborino[4&#8242;,3&#8242;,2&#8242;:4,5][1,4]benzazaborino[3,2&#8208;b]phenazaborine&#8208;7,13&#8208;diamine, N7,N7,N13,N13,5,9,11,15&#8208;octaphenyl (&#957;&#8208;DABNA) exhibits max.

         <title>Evidence of Nodal Superconductivity in Monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 with Hidden Order Fluctuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>Unconventional, nodal superconductors appear in many strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy&#8208;fermion systems. However, nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have not yet been reported. The scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on 1H&#8208;TaS2 demonstrate nodal superconductivity in a van der Waals monolayer, providing a building block for van der Waals heterostructures exploiting unconventional superconducting states.








Abstract
Unconventional superconductors represent one of the fundamental directions in modern quantum materials research. In particular, nodal superconductors are known to appear naturally in strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy&#8208;fermion systems. Van der Waals materials hosting superconducting states are well known, yet nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have remained elusive. Here, using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) experiments, it is shown that pristine monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 realizes a nodal superconducting state.

     alt="Evidence of Nodal Superconductivity in Monolayer 1H-TaS2 with Hidden Order Fluctuations"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unconventional, nodal superconductors appear in many strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy-fermion systems. However, nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have not yet been reported. The scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on 1H-TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrate nodal superconductivity in a van der Waals monolayer, providing a building block for van der Waals heterostructures exploiting unconventional superconducting states.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unconventional superconductors represent one of the fundamental directions in modern quantum materials research. In particular, nodal superconductors are known to appear naturally in strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy-fermion systems. Van der Waals materials hosting superconducting states are well known, yet nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have remained elusive. Here, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) experiments, it is shown that pristine monolayer 1H-TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; realizes a nodal superconducting state. Non-magnetic disorder drives the nodal superconducting state to a conventional gapped s-wave state. Furthermore, many-body excitations emerge close to the gap edge, signalling a potential unconventional pairing mechanism. The results demonstrate the emergence of nodal superconductivity in a van der Waals monolayer, providing a building block for van der Waals heterostructures exploiting unconventional superconducting&#160;states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Imaging Light&#8208;Induced Migration of Dislocations in Halide Perovskites with 3d Nanoscale Strain Mapping</title>

Abstract
In recent years, halide perovskite materials have been used to make high performance solar cell and light&#8208;emitting devices. However, material defects still limit device performance and stability. Here, we use synchrotron&#8208;based Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging to visualise nanoscale strain fields, such as those local to defects, in halide perovskite microcrystals. We find significant strain heterogeneity within MAPbBr3 (MA = CH3NH3+) crystals in spite of their high optoelectronic quality, and identify both &#12296;100&#12297; and &#12296;110&#12297; edge dislocations through analysis of their local strain fields. By imaging these defects and strain fields in situ under continuous illumination, we uncover dramatic light&#8208;induced dislocation migration across hundreds of nanometers. Further, by selectively studying crystals that are damaged by the X&#8208;ray beam, we correlate large dislocation densities and increased nanoscale strains with material degradation and substantially altered optoelectronic properties assessed using photoluminescence microscopy measurements. Our results demonstrate the dynamic nature of extended defects and strain in halide perovskites, which will have important consequences for device performance and operational stability.

         <title>A Bionic Skin for Health Management: Excellent Breathability, In Situ Sensing, and Big Data Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, an intelligent bionic skin patch for health management is developed by integrating bionic structures, nano&#8208;welding technology, and flexible circuit design. The smart breathable membrane closely resembles human skin, exhibiting excellent air/moisture permeability, one&#8208;side sweat&#8208;wicking properties, multifunctional sensing functions, and big data analysis.








Abstract
Developing an intelligent wearable system is of great significance to human health management. An ideal health&#8208;monitoring patch should possess key characteristics such as high air permeability, moisture&#8208;wicking function, high sensitivity, and a comfortable user experience. However, such a patch that encompasses all these functions is rarely reported. Herein, an intelligent bionic skin patch for health management is developed by integrating bionic structures, nano&#8208;welding technology, flexible circuit design, multifunctional sensing functions, and big data analysis using advanced electrospinning technology. By controlling the preparation of nanofibers and constructing bionic secondary structures, the resulting nanofiber membrane closely resembles human skin, exhibiting excellent air/moisture permeability, and one&#8208;side sweat&#8208;wicking properties. Additionally, the bionic patch is endowed with a high&#8208;precision signal acquisition capabilities for sweat metabolites, including glucose, lactic acid, and pH; skin temperature, skin impedance, and electromyographic signals can be precisely measured through the in situ sensing electrodes and flexible circuit design. The achieved intelligent bionic skin patch holds great potential for applications in health management systems and rehabilitation engineering management. The design of the smart bionic patch not only provides high practical value for health management but also has great theoretical value for the development of the new generation of wearable electronic devices.

         <title>Reversed Electron Transfer in Dual Single Atom Catalyst for Boosted Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis of Au/Co dual single atom (DSA) loaded CdS for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. A reversed electron transfer mechanism is confirmed for this Au/Co DSA that leads to localized electrons around Co, and delocalized electrons from Au. This boosts electron transfer and CO2 adsorption/activation/reduction leading to a highly significant increase in reduction.








Abstract
Photogenerated charge localization on material surfaces significantly affects photocatalytic performance, especially for multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction. Dual single atom (DSA) catalysts with flexibly designed reactive sites have received significant research attention for CO2 photoreduction. However, the charge transfer mechanism in DSA catalysts remains poorly understood. Here, for the first time, a reversed electron transfer mechanism on Au and Co DSA catalysts is reported. In situ characterizations confirm that for CdS nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with Co or Au single atoms, photogenerated electrons are localized around the single atom of Co or Au. In DSA catalysts, however, electrons are delocalized from Au and accumulate around Co atoms. Importantly, combined advanced spectroscopic findings and theoretical computation evidence that this reversed electron transfer in Au/Co DSA boosts charge redistribution and activation of CO2 molecules, leading to highly significantly increased photocatalytic CO2 reduction, for example, Au/Co DSA loaded CdS exhibits, respectively, &#8776;2800% and 700% greater yields for CO and CH4 compared with that for CdS alone. Reversed electron transfer in DSA can be used for practical design for charge redistribution and to boost photoreduction of CO2. Findings will be of benefit to researchers and manufacturers in DSA&#8208;loaded catalysts for the generation of solar fuels.

         <title>Virus&#8208;Based Pyroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first observation of heat&#8208;induced electrical potential generation and detection of a virus is demonstrated. Bio&#8208;pyroelectricity is manifested by the unfolding of &#945;&#8208;helical protein structure and can be tuned by genetic engineering. This biopyroelectrics introduce novel opportunities to detect various viral particles and facilitate the development of novel biomaterials for future applications in biosensors and bioelectric materials.








Abstract
The first observation of heat&#8208;induced electrical potential generation on a virus and its detection through pyroelectricity are presented. Specifically, the authors investigate the pyroelectric properties of the M13 phage, which possesses inherent dipole structures derived from the noncentrosymmetric arrangement of the major coat protein (pVIII) with an &#945;&#8208;helical conformation. Unidirectional polarization of the phage is achieved through genetic engineering of the tail protein (pIII) and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly techniques. By modifying the pVIII proteins with varying numbers of glutamate residues, the structure&#8208;dependent tunable pyroelectric properties of the phage are explored. The most polarized phage exhibits a pyroelectric coefficient of 0.13 &#181;C m&#8722;2 &#176;C&#8722;1. Computational modeling and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy analysis confirm that the unfolding of &#945;&#8208;helices within the pVIII proteins leads to changes in phage polarization upon heating. Moreover, the phage is genetically modified to enable its pyroelectric function in diverse chemical environments. This phage&#8208;based approach not only provides valuable insights into bio&#8208;pyroelectricity but also opens up new opportunities for the detection of various viral particles. Furthermore, it holds great potential for the development of novel biomaterials for future applications in biosensors and bioelectric materials.

         <title>Liquids with High Compressibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional liquids are barely compressible. However, here, a simple strategy is presented to increase the compressibility of aqueous liquids by dispersing into them small particles of porous materials with empty hydrophobic pores. The total compression is due to compression of the interparticle water phase in addition to water&#160;being forced into the pores, and the resulting compressibility is up to 20 times that of conventional liquids.








Abstract
Compressibility is a fundamental property of all materials. For fluids, that is, gases and liquids, compressibility forms the basis of technologies such as pneumatics and hydraulics and determines basic phenomena such as the propagation of sound and shock waves. In contrast to gases, liquids are almost incompressible. If the compressibility of liquids could be increased and controlled, new applications in hydraulics and shock absorption could result. Here, it is shown that dispersing hydrophobic porous particles into water gives aqueous suspensions with much greater compressibilities than any normal liquids such as water (specifically, up to 20 times greater over certain pressure ranges). The increased compressibility results from water molecules being forced into the hydrophobic pores of the particles under applied pressure. The degree of compression can be controlled by varying the amount of porous particles added. Also, the pressure range of compression can be reduced by adding methanol or increased by adding salt. In all cases, the liquids expand back to their original volume when the applied pressure is released. The approach shown here is simple and economical and could potentially be scaled up to give large amounts of highly compressible liquids.

However, here, a simple strategy is presented to increase the compressibility of aqueous liquids by dispersing into them small particles of porous materials with empty hydrophobic pores. The total compression is due to compression of the interparticle water phase in addition to water&#160;being forced into the pores, and the resulting compressibility is up to 20 times that of conventional liquids.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compressibility is a fundamental property of all materials. For fluids, that is, gases and liquids, compressibility forms the basis of technologies such as pneumatics and hydraulics and determines basic phenomena such as the propagation of sound and shock waves. In contrast to gases, liquids are almost incompressible. If the compressibility of liquids could be increased and controlled, new applications in hydraulics and shock absorption could result. Here, it is shown that dispersing hydrophobic porous particles into water gives aqueous suspensions with much greater compressibilities than any normal liquids such as water (specifically, up to 20 times greater over certain pressure ranges). The increased compressibility results from water molecules being forced into the hydrophobic pores of the particles under applied pressure. The degree of compression can be controlled by varying the amount of porous particles added. Also, the pressure range of compression can be reduced by adding methanol or increased by adding salt. In all cases, the liquids expand back to their original volume when the applied pressure is released. The approach shown here is simple and economical and could potentially be scaled up to give large amounts of highly compressible liquids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intermediates Regulation via Electron&#8208;deficient Cu Sites for Selective Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroreduction</title>

Abstract
NH3 (NH3), known as one of fundamental raw materials for manufacturing commodities such as chemical fertilizers, dyes, ammunitions, pharmaceuticals, and textiles, exhibits a high hydrogen storage capacity of &#8764;17.75%. Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3RR) to valuable ammonia at ambient conditions is a promising strategy to facilitate the artificial nitrogen cycle. Herein, copper&#8208;doped cobalt selenide nanosheets with selenium vacancies are reported as a robust and high&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst for the reduction of nitrate to ammonia, exhibiting a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of &#8764;93.5% and an ammonia yield rate of 2360&#160;&#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.60&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The in situ spectroscopic and theoretical study demonstrate that the incorporation of Cu dopants and Se vacancies into cobalt selenide efficiently enhances the electron transfer from Cu to Co atoms via the bridging Se atoms, forming the electron&#8208;deficient structure at Cu sites to accelerate NO3&#8722; dissociation and stabilize the *NO2 intermediates, eventually achieving selective catalysis in the entire NO3RR process to produce ammonia efficiently.

Abstract
Inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (IASSSBs) are emerged as promising candidates to replace commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to their potential advantages, such as abundant raw materials, robust safety, low price, high&#8208;energy density, favorable reliability and stability. Inorganic sodium solid electrolytes (ISSEs) are an indispensable component of IASSSBs, gaining significant attention. Herein, this review begins by discussing the fundamentals of ISSEs, including their ionic conductivity, mechanical property, chemical and electrochemical stabilities. It then presents the crystal structures of advanced ISSEs (e.g., &#946;/&#946;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;alumina, NASICON, sulfides, complex hydride and halide electrolytes) and the related issues, along with corresponding modification strategies. The review also outlines effective approaches for forming intimate interfaces between ISSEs and working electrodes. Finally, current challenges and critical perspectives for the potential developments and possible directions to improve interfacial contacts for future practical applications of ISSEs are highlighted. This comprehensive review aims to advance the understanding and development of next&#8208;generation rechargeable IASSSBs.

         <title>Stabilizing The Deep Sodiation Process in Layered Sodium Manganese Cathodes by Anchoring Boron Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advanced high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are inseparable from cathode materials with high specific capacities. Layered manganese&#8208;rich oxides (NaxMnO2, 0.6 &#8804; x &#8804;1) are promising cathode materials owing to their ease of intercalation and extraction of a considerable amount of sodium ions. However, lattice interactions, especially electrostatic repulsive forces and anisotropic stresses, are usually caused by deep desodiatin/sodiation process, resulting in intragranular cracks and capacity degradation in SIBs. Here, we introduced boron ions into the layered structure to build up B&#8211;O&#8211;Mn bonds. The regulated electronic structure in Na0.637B0.038MnO2 (B&#8208;NMO) materials inhibited the deformation of MnO6 octahedra, which finally achieved a gentle structural transition during the deep sodiation process. B&#8208;NMO electrode exhibits a high capacity (141 mAh g&#8211;1) at 1C with a capacity retention of 81% after 100 cycles. Therefore, anchoring boron to manganese&#8208;rich materials inhibits the detrimental structural evolution of deep sodiation and can be used to obtain excellent cathode materials for SIBs.

         <title>A Functional Janus Ag Nanowires/Bacterial Cellulose Separator for High&#8208;Performance Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode Under Harsh Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) offer promising prospects for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their inherent abundance and safety features. However, the growth of zinc dendrites remains a primary obstacle to the practical industrialization of AZIBs, especially under harsh conditions of high current densities and elevated temperatures. To address this issue, we developed a Janus separator with an exceptionally ultrathin thickness of 29&#160;&#956;m. This Janus separator features the bacterial cellulose (BC) layer on one side and Ag nanowires/bacterial cellulose (AgNWs/BC) layer on the other side. The high zincophilic property and excellent electric/thermal conductivity of AgNWs make them ideal for serving as an ion pump to accelerate Zn2+ transport in the electrolyte, resulting in the greatly improved Zn2+ conductivity, the deposition of homogeneous Zn nuclei, and dendrite&#8208;free Zn. Consequently, the Zn||Zn symmetrical cells with the Janus separator exhibit a stable cycle life of over 1000 hours under 80&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and sustain over 600 hours at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under 50&#176;C. Furthermore, the Janus separator enables excellent cycling stability in AZIBs, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion capacitors (AZICs), and scaled&#8208;up flexible soft&#8208;packaged batteries. Our study demonstrates the potential of functional separators in promoting the application of aqueous zinc batteries, particularly under harsh conditions.

         <title>A Universal Cross&#8208;Synthetic Strategy for Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm Metal&#8208;based Composites with Excellent Ion Storage Kinetics</title>

Abstract
The sub&#8208;10&#160;nm metal&#8208;based nanomaterials (SMNs) show great potential for the electrochemical energy storage field. However, their ion storage capacity and stability suffer from severe agglomeration and interface problems. Herein, we report a universal strategy to synthesize a wide range of SMNs (e.g., metal, nitride, oxide, and sulfides) embedded in free&#8208;standing carbon (SMN/FC&#8208;F) composite electrodes by crossing the interfacial confinement of NaCl self&#8208;assembly with the thermal&#8208;mechanical coupling of powder metallurgy. The pressure&#8208;enhanced NaCl self&#8208;assembly interfacial confinement is greatly beneficial to preventing SMN agglomeration and promoting SMNs embedded in FC&#8208;F which originate from the welding of carbon nanosheets. They are confirmed via a series of advanced characterizations including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, with theoretical computations. Benefiting from the unique structure, SMNs/FC&#8208;F delivers ultrafast and stable ion&#8208;storage kinetics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the MoS2/FC&#8208;F shows excellent ion storage kinetics and superior long&#8208;term cycling performance for ion storage (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)2O2F/C//MoS2/FC&#8208;F sodium&#8208;ion batteries exhibit a high reversible capacity of 185 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 with a decay rate of 0.05% per cycle.). This work provides a new opportunity to design and fabricate promising SMN&#8208;based free&#8208;standing working electrodes for electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications.

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite quantum dot (PQD) emerges as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation solar cells owing to its remarkable optoelectronic properties and solution processability. However, the optoelectronic properties of PQDs suffer from severe degradation with the storage due to the dynamically binding ligands, predominantly affecting photovoltaic applications. Herein, an in&#8208;situ defect healing treatment is reported to effectively rejuvenate the aged PQDs. Systematically experimental studies and theoretical calculations are performed to fundamentally understand the causes leading to the recovered optoelectronic properties of aged PQDs. The results reveal that the I3&#8722; anions produced from the tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylammonium iodide and iodine could strongly anchor on the surface matrix defects of aged PQDs, substantially diminishing the nonradiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, the defect healing treatment could also renovate the morphology of aged PQDs and thus improve the stacking orientation of PQD solids, substantially ameliorating the charge carrier transport within the PQD solids. Consequently, by using the defect healing treatment, PQD solar cell (PQDSC) yields a high efficiency of up to 15.88%, which is comparable with the PQDSCs fabricated using fresh PQDs. Meanwhile, the stability of PQDSCs fabricated using the rejuvenated PQDs is also largely improved.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Framework with Highly Accessible Aniline&#8208;Fused Quinonoid Units Affords Efficient Proton Charge Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Owing to their intrinsic safety and sustainability, aqueous proton batteries have emerged as promising energy devices. Nevertheless, the corrosion or dissolution of electrode materials in AICDic electrolytes must be addressed before practical applications. In this study, we developed a cathode material based on a redox&#8208;active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD&#8208;COF) featuring inherently regular open porous channels and excellent stability. Benefiting from its superhydrophilicity, intrinsic high proton conductivity, excellent redox reversibility of enriched aniline&#8208;fused&#8208;quinonoid units, and the insolubility of the rigid framework skeleton, TPAD&#8208;COF cathode delivers a high capacity of 126 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, paired with long&#8208;term cycling stability with capacity retention of 84% after 5,000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. Comprehensive ex&#8208;situ spectroscopic studies correlated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that both the &#8211;NH&#8211; and C = O groups of the aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units exhibited prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, the assembled punch battery consisting of a TPAD&#8208;COF//anthraquinone (AQ) all&#8208;organic system delivers a discharge capacity of 115 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 130 cycles, implying the potential applications of TPAD&#8208;COF cathode in aqueous proton batteries. This study provides a new perspective on the design of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries with long&#8208;term cycling performance and high capacity.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Polyionic Hydrogels Enable Dendrites&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries with Fast Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel electrolyte is developed to realize cycle&#8208;stable Zn&#8208;I2 batteries with fast kinetics. Polyanionic hydrogel with high zincophilicity uniformizes Zn2+ flux and retards polyiodides/SO42&#8211; transport, leading to a dendrite&#8208;free and corrosion&#8208;free Zn anode. Iodophilic polycationic hydrogel alleviates the shuttling of polyiodides and boosts the reaction kinetics at hydrogel/carbon interface for iodine species.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries (ZIB) are regarded as a promising energy storage candidate. However, soluble polyiodide shuttling and rampant Zn dendrite growth hamper its commercial implementation. Herein, a hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel is designed as the electrolyte for ZIBs. On the cathode side, iodophilic polycationic hydrogel (PCH) effectively alleviates the shuttle effect and facilitates the redox kinetics of iodine species. Meanwhile, polyanionic hydrogel (PAH) toward Zn metal anode uniformizes Zn2+ flux and prevents surface corrosion by electrostatic repulsion of polyiodides. Consequently, the Zn symmetric cells with PAH electrolyte demonstrate remarkable cycling stability over 3000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (1 mAh cm&#8211;2) and 800&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (5 mAh cm&#8211;2). Moreover, the Zn&#8208;I2 full cells with PAH&#8208;PCH hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel electrolyte deliver a low&#8208;capacity decay of 0.008 &#8240; per cycle during 18&#160;000 cycles at 8 C. This work sheds light on hydrogel electrolytes design for long&#8208;life conversion&#8208;type aqueous batteries.

         <title>Bifacial and Semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 Solar Cells for Single&#8208;Junction and Tandem Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells exhibit exceptional bifaciality of 0.86 and satisfactory long&#8208;wavelength transmittance exceeding 60%, highly suitable for initial real&#8208;world applications that leverage their ability to effectively absorb tilted incident illumination and enhance performance by exploiting albedo. Furthermore, their compatibility with silicon solar cells enables their integration in tandem applications, unlocking further potential for promoted efficiency.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film solar cells are expected to play a significant role in the space industry, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), indoor applications, and tandem solar cells, where bifaciality and semitransparency are highly desired. Sb2(S,Se)3 has emerged as a promising new photovoltaic (PV) material for its high absorption coefficient, tunable bandgap, and nontoxic and earth&#8208;abundant constituents. However, high&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells exclusively employ monofacial architectures, leaving a considerable gap toward large&#8208;scale application in aforementioned fields. Here, a bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell and its extended application in tandem solar cells are reported. The transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and the ultrathin inner n&#8211;i&#8211;p structure provide high long&#8208;wavelength transmittance. Despite the MnS/ITO Schottky junction, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.41% and 6.36% are achieved with front and rear illumination, respectively, contributing to a great bifaciality of 0.86. Consequently, the reported device gains great enhancement in PV performance by exploiting albedo of surroundings and shows exceptional capability in absorbing tilt incident light. Moreover, an&#160;Sb2(S,Se)3/Si tandem solar cell with a PCE of 11.66% is achieved in preliminary trials. These exciting findings imply that bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells possess tremendous potential in practical applications based on their unique characteristics.

         <title>Colossal Optical Anisotropy from Atomic&#8208;Scale Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle atomic&#8208;scale structural modulations of a crystal can dramatically change its optical properties. Single&#8208;crystal plates of modulated quasi&#8208;1D chalcogenide Sr9/8TiS3 are shown to have a record in&#8208;plane birefringence &#916;n = ne &#8722; no = 2.1 (ne = 4.5,&#8197;no = 2.4) within a broad transparent window in the mid&#8208; to far&#8208;infrared. Structural modulation will be a new tool in realizing materials with large degrees of optical and optoelectronic anisotropy.








Abstract
Materials with large birefringence (&#916;n, where n is the refractive index) are sought after for polarization control (e.g., in wave plates, polarizing beam splitters, etc.), nonlinear optics, micromanipulation, and as a platform for unconventional light&#8211;matter coupling, such as hyperbolic phonon polaritons. Layered 2D&#160;materials can feature some of the largest optical anisotropy; however, their use in most optical systems is limited because their optical axis is out of the plane of the layers and the layers are weakly attached. This work demonstrates that a bulk crystal with subtle periodic modulations in its structure&#8212;Sr9/8TiS3&#8212;is transparent and positive&#8208;uniaxial, with extraordinary index ne = 4.5 and ordinary index no = 2.4 in the mid&#8208; to far&#8208;infrared. The excess Sr, compared to stoichiometric SrTiS3, results in the formation of TiS6 trigonal&#8208;prismatic units that break the chains of face&#8208;sharing TiS6 octahedra in SrTiS3 into periodic blocks of five TiS6 octahedral units. The additional electrons introduced by the excess Sr form highly oriented electron clouds, which selectively boost the extraordinary index ne and result in record birefringence (&#916;n &gt; 2.1 with low loss). The connection between subtle structural modulations and large changes in refractive index suggests new categories of anisotropic materials and also tunable optical materials with large refractive&#8208;index modulation.

     alt="Colossal Optical Anisotropy from Atomic-Scale Modulations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtle atomic-scale structural modulations of a crystal can dramatically change its optical properties. Single-crystal plates of modulated quasi-1D chalcogenide Sr&lt;sub&gt;9/8&lt;/sub&gt;TiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are shown to have a record in-plane birefringence &#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; &#8722; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.1 (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.5,&#8197;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.4) within a broad transparent window in the mid- to far-infrared. Structural modulation will be a new tool in realizing materials with large degrees of optical and optoelectronic anisotropy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials with large birefringence (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the refractive index) are sought after for polarization control (e.g., in wave plates, polarizing beam splitters, etc.), nonlinear optics, micromanipulation, and as a platform for unconventional light&#8211;matter coupling, such as hyperbolic phonon polaritons. Layered 2D&#160;materials can feature some of the largest optical anisotropy; however, their use in most optical systems is limited because their optical axis is out of the plane of the layers and the layers are weakly attached. This work demonstrates that a bulk crystal with subtle periodic modulations in its structure&#8212;Sr&lt;sub&gt;9/8&lt;/sub&gt;TiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8212;is transparent and positive-uniaxial, with extraordinary index &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.5 and ordinary index &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.4 in the mid- to far-infrared. The excess Sr, compared to stoichiometric SrTiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, results in the formation of TiS&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; trigonal-prismatic units that break the chains of face-sharing TiS&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra in SrTiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into periodic blocks of five TiS&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedral units. The additional electrons introduced by the excess Sr form highly oriented electron clouds, which selectively boost the extraordinary index &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; and result in record birefringence (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 2.1 with low loss). The connection between subtle structural modulations and large changes in refractive index suggests new categories of anisotropic materials and also tunable optical materials with large refractive-index modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structurally&#8208;Distorted RuIr&#8208;Based Nanoframes for Long&#8208;Duration Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally&#8208;distorted CdRu2IrOx nanoframes with twisted Ru&#8722;O, Ir&#8722;O, and Ru&#8211;M (M = Ru, Ir) are successfully constructed via cation exchange and sequential thermal treatment, which can be used as ultra&#8208;active and ultra&#8208;stable acidic OER catalyst due to the strong synergy between Ru and Ir.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), yet the electrocatalysts still suffer from the disadvantages of low activity and poor stability in acidic conditions. Here, a new class of CdRu2IrOx nanoframes with distorted structure for acidic OER is successfully fabricated. Impressively, CdRu2IrOx displays an ultralow overpotential of 189&#160;mV and an ultralong stability of 1500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 toward OER in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Moreover, a PEMWE using the distorted CdRu2IrOx can be steadily operated at 0.1 A cm&#8315;2 for 90&#160;h. Microstructural analyses and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) demonstrate that the synergy between Ru and Ir in CdRu2IrOx induces the distortion of Ru&#8722;O, Ir&#8722;O, and Ru&#8722;M (M = Ru, Ir) bonds. In situ XAS indicates that the applied potential leads to the deformation octahedral structure of RuOx/IrOx and the formation of stable Ru5+ species for OER. Theoretical calculations also reveal that the distorted structures can reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;limiting step during OER. This work provides an efficient strategy for constructing structural distortion to achieve significant enhancement on the activity and stability of OER catalysts.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Touch Device with Two Terminals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the integration of resistor and capacitor elements with material composition gradients, 3D touch detection is enabled with only two terminal electrodes. Unlike conventional crossbar arrays, this approach provides full 3D input capability without being limited by wiring complexity. The measurement system represents a groundbreaking approach to simplifying the input device architecture to achieve large&#8208;area high resolution.








Abstract
A crossbar array is an essential element that determines the operating position and simplifies the structure of devices. However, in the crossbar array, wiring numerous electrodes to address many positions poses significant challenges. In this study, a method is proposed that utilizes only two electrodes to determine multiple positions. The method significantly simplifies the wiring and device fabrication process. Instead of defining the node location of the crossbar, it is experimentally demonstrated that the x&#8211;y&#8211;z coordinates can be determined from i) the resistance change as a function of distance, ii) the resistance variation influenced by the electrode composition, and iii) capacitance fluctuation resulting from changes in the dielectric thickness. By employing two&#8208;terminal transparent electrodes, a fully functional 3D touch device is successfully fabricated, introducing a groundbreaking approach to simplify input device architectures.

         <title>Hemoperfusion Adsorbents for Removal of Common Toxins in Liver and Kidney Failure: Recent Progress, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liver and kidney failure leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxin, and creatinine in the blood and tissues, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins by extracorporeal system. Carbon materials, zeolites, MXenes, polymer materials, composite materials, porous materials, etc. have been developed as hemoperfusion adsorbents to remove common toxins in liver and kidney failure and to treat liver and kidney failure.








Abstract
Liver and kidney failure can lead to extensive accumulation of toxic metabolites in the blood and tissues, such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins from the blood and treat liver and kidney failure. However, the adsorption efficiency and safety of traditional hemoperfusion adsorbents are not ideal. Thus, it is urgent to develop adsorbents with good blood compatibility, as well as high adsorption and strong selective capacities, to fulfill the clinical needs. In recent years, new hemoperfusion adsorbents with improved adsorption performance and good blood compatibility have been developed. This review classifies and summarizes the recent research progress in hemoperfusion adsorbents for common blood toxins (bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea) produced by liver and kidney failure. The composition and structure of various toxin adsorbents, toxin adsorption performance, biocompatibility, blood safety, and the adsorption mechanisms of toxins are discussed. Based on a summary of recent studies, feasible strategies have been explored for designing and preparing hemoperfusion adsorbents to fulfill future development requirements. The trends and clinical application prospects of various toxin adsorbents are also discussed.

A comprehensive overview of the emerging perovskite&#8208;solar&#8208;cell&#8208;based photo&#8208;electrochemical device, including the configuration design, key parameters, working principle, integration strategies, electrode materials, and their performance evaluations, is highlighted. The existing challenges and future perspectives are provided for the ongoing research in this promising field.








Abstract
Metal halide hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received considerable attention over the past decade owing to their potential for low&#8208;cost, solution&#8208;processable, earth&#8208;abundant, and high&#8208;performance superiority, increasing power conversion efficiencies of up to 25.7%. Solar energy conversion into electricity is highly efficient and sustainable, but direct utilization, storage, and poor energy diversity are difficult to achieve, resulting in a potential waste of resources. Considering its convenience and feasibility, converting solar energy into chemical fuels is regarded as a promising pathway for boosting energy diversity and expanding its utilization. In addition, the energy conversion&#8211;storage integrated system can efficiently sequentially capture, convert, and store energy in electrochemical energy storage devices. However, a comprehensive overview focusing on PSC&#8208;self&#8208;driven integrated devices with a discussion of their development and limitations remains lacking. Here, focus is on the development of representative configurations of emerging PSC&#8208;based photo&#8208;electrochemical devices including self&#8208;charging power packs, unassisted solar water splitting/CO2 reduction. The advanced progresses in this field, including configuration design, key parameters, working principles, integration strategies, electrode materials, and their performance evaluations are also summarized. Finally, scientific challenges and future perspectives for ongoing research in this field are presented.

         <title>Self&#8208;Construction of Efficient Interfaces Ensures High&#8208;Performance Direct Ammonia Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;structured NiFe and NiCu&#8208;decorated interfaces on the anode surface via the attachment of the reduced Sr2Fe1.35Mo0.45Cu0.2O6&#8722;&#948; anode catalytic layer onto the Ni&#8208;BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3&#8722;&#948; anode can dramatically enhance the catalytic activity for NH3 decomposition and durability of direct ammonia protonic ceramic fuel cells.








Abstract
Direct ammonia protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) are highly efficient energy conversion devices since ammonia as a carbon&#8208;neutral hydrogen&#8208;rich carrier shows great potential for storage and long&#8208;distance transportation when compared with hydrogen fuel. However, traditional Ni&#8208;based anodes readily suffer from severe structural destruction and dramatic deactivation after long&#8208;time exposure to ammonia. Here a Sr2Fe1.35Mo0.45Cu0.2O6&#8722;&#948; (SFMC) anode catalytic layer (ACL) painted onto a Ni&#8208;BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3&#8722;&#948; (BZCYYb) anode with enhanced catalytic activity and durability toward the direct utilization of ammonia is reported. A tubular Ni&#8208;BZCYYb anode&#8208;supported cells with the SFMC ACL show excellent peak power densities of 1.77 W cm&#8722;2 in wet H2 (3% H2O) and 1.02 W cm&#8722;2 in NH3 at 650 &#176;C. A relatively stable operation of the cells is obtained at 650 &#176;C for 200 h in ammonia fuel. Such achieved improvements in the activity and durability are attributed to the self&#8208;constructed interfaces with the phases of NiCu or/and NiFe for efficient NH3 decomposition, resulting in a strong NH3 adsorption strength of the SFMC, as confirmed by NH3 thermal conversion and NH3&#8208;temperature programmed desorption. This research offers a valuable strategy of applying an internal catalytic layer for highly active and durable ammonia PCFCs.

         <title>Non&#8208;Pore Dependent and MMP&#8208;9 Responsive Gelatin/Silk Fibroin Composite Microparticles as Universal Delivery Platform for Inhaled Treatment of Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GSC with adjusted particle sizes is fabricated through the microphase separation of gelatin (Gel) /silk fibroin (SF) systems and following desolvation process. This work specifically selects GSC with a diameter of 3 &#181;m as carriers for various drugs including small molecule chemotherapeutics, large protein drugs, and nucleic acid drugs for noninvasive aerosol inhalation therapy for lung cancer.








Abstract
Developing a drug delivery platform that possesses universal drug loading capacity to meet various requirements of cancer treatment is a challenging yet interesting task. Herein, a self&#8208;assembled gelatin/silk fibroin composite (GSC) particle based drug delivery system is developed via microphase separation followed by desolvation process. Thanks to its preassembled microphase stage, this GSC system is suitable for varying types of drugs. The desolvation process fix drugs inside GSC rapidly and densify the GSC structure, thereby achieving efficient drug loading and providing comprehensive protection for loaded drugs. Actually, the size of this brand&#8208;new non&#8208;pore dependent drug delivery system can be easily adjusted from 100&#160;nm to 20&#160;&#181;m to fit different scenarios. This work selects GSC with 3&#160;&#181;m diameter as the universal inhaled drug delivery platform, which shows an excellent transmucosal penetration and lung retention ability. Additionally, the MMP&#8208;9 sensitive degradation property of GSC enhances the targeted efficiency of drugs and reduces side effects. Intestinally, GSC can self&#8208;amplify the regulation of innate immunity to reverse the cancerous microenvironment into an antitumor niche, significantly improving the therapeutic effect of drugs. This study of GSC universal drug platform provides a new direction to develop the next&#8208;generation of drug delivery system for lung cancer.

         <title>Ultrafast and Controlled Capturing, Loading, and Release of Extracellular Vesicles by a Portable Microstructured Electrochemical Fluidic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A portable device that offers an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip approach, capable of separating extracellular vesicles directly from biological fluids in a simple and efficient manner, while also allowing their subsequent manipulation, is reported. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by all living cells and are found in body fluids. They exert numerous physiological and pathological functions and serve as cargo shuttles. Due to their safety and inherent bioactivity, they have emerged as versatile therapeutic agents, biomarkers, and potential drug carriers. Despite the growing interest in EVs, current progress in this field is, in part, limited by relatively inefficient isolation techniques. Conventional methods are indeed slow, laborious, require specialized laboratory equipment, and may result in low yield and purity. This work describes an electrochemically controlled &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; device enabling capturing, loading, and releasing of EVs. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes. It rapidly isolates EVs with a high level of purity from various biofluids. As a proof of principle, the device is applied to isolate EVs from skin wounds of healthy and diabetic mice. Strikingly, it is found that EVs from healing wounds of diabetic mice are enriched in mitochondrial proteins compared to those of healthy mice. Additionally, the device improves the loading protocol of EVs with polyplexes, and may therefore find applications in nucleic acid delivery. Overall, the electrochemical device can greatly facilitate the development of EVs&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Illuminating the Brain: Advances and Perspectives in Optoelectronics for Neural Activity Monitoring and Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the recent advances in implantable optoelectronics for neural activity monitoring and modulation is provided. Combining optical and electrical modes in a unitary neural network interface has gained momentum in recent years, and controlling the spatial coverage of illumination, designing light&#8208;activated modulators, and developing wireless light delivery and data transmission are crucial for maximizing the use of optical neuromodulation.








Abstract
Optogenetic modulation of brain neural activity that combines optical and electrical modes in a unitary neural system has recently gained robust momentum. Controlling illumination spatial coverage, designing light&#8208;activated modulators, and developing wireless light delivery and data transmission are crucial for maximizing the use of optical neuromodulation. To this end, biocompatible electrodes with enhanced optoelectrical performance, device integration for multiplexed addressing, wireless transmission, and multimodal operation in soft systems have been developed. This review provides an outlook for uniformly illuminating large brain areas while spatiotemporally imaging the neural responses upon optoelectrical stimulation with little artifacts. Representative concepts and important breakthroughs, such as head&#8208;mounted illumination, multiple implanted optical fibers, and micro&#8208;light&#8208;delivery devices, are discussed. Examples of techniques that incorporate electrophysiological monitoring and optoelectrical stimulation are presented. Challenges and perspectives are posed for further research efforts toward high&#8208;density optoelectrical neural interface modulation, with the potential for nonpharmacological neurological disease treatments and wireless optoelectrical stimulation.

         <title>Stabilization of Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with a 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson Passivating Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CsPbI3 perovskites suffers fast transfer to non&#8208;perovskite phase, especially exposed to humidity. Using 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)ethylamine cation to construct a Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D phase that covers the 3D inorganic perovskite surface, the obtained 2D/3D perovskite films exhibit excellent humidity resistance and higher temperature stability, resulting in improved efficiency and operational stability in solar cells.








Abstract
Inorganic metal halide perovskites such as CsPbI3 are promising for high&#8208;performance, reproducible, and robust solar cells. However, inorganic perovskites are sensitive to humidity, which causes the transformation from the black phase to the yellow &#948;, non&#8208;perovskite phase. Such phase instability has been a significant challenge to long&#8208;term operational stability. Here, a surface dimensionality reduction strategy is reported, using 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)ethylamine cation to construct a Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D phase that covers the surface of the 3D inorganic perovskite structure.

&lt;p&gt;CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskites suffers fast transfer to non-perovskite phase, especially exposed to humidity. Using 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethylamine cation to construct a Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D phase that covers the 3D inorganic perovskite surface, the obtained 2D/3D perovskite films exhibit excellent humidity resistance and higher temperature stability, resulting in improved efficiency and operational stability in solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inorganic metal halide perovskites such as CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are promising for high-performance, reproducible, and robust solar cells. However, inorganic perovskites are sensitive to humidity, which causes the transformation from the black phase to the yellow &#948;, non-perovskite phase. Such phase instability has been a significant challenge to long-term operational stability. Here, a surface dimensionality reduction strategy is reported, using 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethylamine cation to construct a Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D phase that covers the surface of the 3D inorganic perovskite structure. The Dion&#8211;Jacobson layer mainly grows at the grain boundaries of the perovskite, effectively passivating surface defects and providing favourable interfacial charge transfer.

&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.197&#160;eV. It retains 83% of its initial PCE after 1260&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under 1.2 sun illumination. The work demonstrates an effective way for stabilizing efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox Triggers Guest Release and Uptake Across a Series of Azopyridine&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Capsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active azo groups are introduced in replacement of imine bonds that have been previously utilized to construct metal&#8211;organic capsules, endowing the capsules with reversible redox behaviors that can release guests upon reduction and re&#8208;capsulate them through oxidation. Since azo groups can attach to various ligand cores, this can potentially be a general approach to realize guest release and uptake via redox.








Abstract
Precise control over guest release and recapture using external stimuli is a valuable goal, potentially enabling new modes of chemical purification. Including redox moieties within the ligand cores of molecular capsules to trigger the release and uptake of guests has proved effective, but this technique is limited to certain capsules and guests. Herein, the construction of a series of novel metal&#8211;organic capsules from ditopic, tritopic, and tetratopic ligands is demonstrated, all of which contain redox&#8208;active azo groups coordinated to FeII centers. Compared to their iminopyridine&#8208;based analogs, this new class of azopyridine&#8208;based capsules possesses larger cavities, capable of encapsulating more voluminous guests. Upon reduction of the capsules, their guests are released and may then be re&#8208;encapsulated when the capsules are regenerated by oxidation. Since the redox centers are on the ligand arms, they are modular and can be attached to a variety of ligand cores to afford varying and predictable architectures. This method thus shows promise as a generalized approach for designing redox&#8208;controlled guest release and uptake systems.

         <title>Intrinsic Ferromagnetic Semiconductors with High Saturation Magnetization from Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of ferromagnetic semiconductor is obtained by exploiting the perovskite structure. The obtained (4ampy)CuCl4 exhibits a remarkably saturated magnetization up to 18.56 emu g&#8722;1, which is one of the highest&#8208;ever&#8208;reported values for organic/inorganic hybrid intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors.








Abstract
Ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMS) enable simultaneous control of both charge and spin transport of charge carriers, and they have emerged as a class of highly desirable but rare materials for applications in spin field&#8208;effect transistors and quantum computing. Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites with high compositional adjustability and structural versatility can offer unique benefits in the design of FMS but has not been fully explored. Here, a series of molecular FMSs based on the 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite structure, namely (2ampy)CuCl4, (3ampy)CuCl4, and (4ampy)CuCl4, is demonstrated, which exhibits high saturation magnetization, dramatic temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity change, and tunable ferromagnetic resonance. Magnetic measurements reveal a high saturation magnetization up to 18.56 emu g&#8722;1 for (4ampy)CuCl4, which is one of the highest value among reported hybrid FMSs to date. Conductivity studies of the three FMSs demonstrate that the smaller adjacent octahedron distance in the 2D layer results in higher conductivity. Systematic ferromagnetic resonance investigation shows that the gyromagnetic ratio and Landau factor values are strongly dependent on the types of organic cations used. This work demonstrates that 2D hybrid perovskite materials can simultaneously possess both tunable long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering and semiconductivity, providing a straightforward strategy for designing and synthesizing high&#8208;performance intrinsic FMSs.

         <title>Conversion of Surface Residual Alkali to Solid Electrolyte to Enable Na&#8208;Ion Full Cells with Robust Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NaMgPO4 is used to modify the interface of the O3&#8208;NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 (NCMT) to reduce surface residual alkali and improve cycle performance. The excellent interface facilitates the transport of Na+ and reduces the dissolution of transition metals (TMs). A high discharge capacity of 157.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and a superior stability under the 4.3 V cutoff voltage are obtained successfully in assembled full cells.








Abstract
The deposition of volatilized Na+ on the surface of the cathode during sintering results in the formation of surface residual alkali (NaOH/Na2CO3NaHCO3) in layered cathode materials, leading to serious interfacial reactions and performance degradation. This phenomenon is particularly evident in O3&#8208;NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 (NCMT). In this study, a strategy is proposed to transform waste into treasure by converting residual alkali into a solid electrolyte. Mg(CH3COO)2 and H3PO4 are reacted with surface residual alkali to generate the solid electrolyte NaMgPO4 on the surface of NCMT, which can be labeled as NaMgPO4@NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2&#8208;X (NMP@NCMT&#8208;X, where X indicates the different amounts of Mg2+ and PO43&#8722;). NaMgPO4 acts as a special ionic conductivity channel on the surface to improve the kinetics of the electrode reactions, remarkably improving the rate capability of the modified cathode at a high current density in the half&#8208;cell. Additionally, NMP@NCMT&#8208;2 enables a reversible phase transition from the P3 to OP2 phase in the charge&#8211;discharge process above 4.2&#160;V and achieves a high specific capacity of 157.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and outstanding capacity retention in the full cell. The strategy can effectively and reliably stabilize the interface and improve the performance of layered cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs).

         <title>Rational Design of N&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Coated Cobalt Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient and Durable Photothermal CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Co nanoparticles, derived from two&#8208;step pyrolysis of ZIF&#8208;67 precursor, exhibit highly efficient and durable catalytic performance for photothermal hydrogenation of CO2. As verified by experimental observations and theoretical simulations, such a simple N&#8208;doped carbon coating strategy can effectively promote the desorption of CO and activation of CO2 and H2 molecules due to the strong photothermal effect.








Abstract
Photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is an appealing approach to alleviate energy and environmental concerns. However, it still relies on the development of earth&#8208;abundant, efficient, and durable catalysts. Here, the design of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Co nanoparticles (NPs), as a photothermal catalyst, synthesized through a two&#8208;step pyrolysis of Co&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 precursor, is reported. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and stability for photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to CO with a 0.75&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 CO production rate under the full spectrum of light illumination. The high activity and durability of these Co NPs are mainly attributed to the synergy of the attuned size of Co NPs, the thickness of carbon layers, and the N doping species. Impressively, the experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations show that such a simple N&#8208;doped carbon coating strategy can effectively facilitate the desorption of generated CO and activation of reactants due to the strong photothermal effect. This work provides a simple and efficient route for the preparation of highly active and durable nonprecious metal catalysts for promising photothermal catalytic reactions.

As verified by experimental observations and theoretical simulations, such a simple N-doped carbon coating strategy can effectively promote the desorption of CO and activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules due to the strong photothermal effect.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photothermal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to high-value-added chemicals and fuels is an appealing approach to alleviate energy and environmental concerns. However, it still relies on the development of earth-abundant, efficient, and durable catalysts. Here, the design of N-doped carbon-coated Co nanoparticles (NPs), as a photothermal catalyst, synthesized through a two-step pyrolysis of Co-based ZIF-67 precursor, is reported. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and stability for photothermal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to CO with a 0.75&#160;mol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; CO production rate under the full spectrum of light illumination. The high activity and durability of these Co NPs are mainly attributed to the synergy of the attuned size of Co NPs, the thickness of carbon layers, and the N doping species. Impressively, the experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations show that such a simple N-doped carbon coating strategy can effectively facilitate the desorption of generated CO and activation of reactants due to the strong photothermal effect. This work provides a simple and efficient route for the preparation of highly active and durable nonprecious metal catalysts for promising photothermal catalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Elimination of Defects via Controlled Perovskite Crystallization Dynamics for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that a hydrogen&#8208;sulfate&#8208;based ionic liquid additive enables the phase&#8208;conversion pathway of precursors &#8594; solvated intermediates &#8594; &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, which results in the self&#8208;elimination of defects during crystallization. The improved perovskite crystallization dynamics finally endow&#160;solar cells with high efficiencies of 25.14% at 300 K and 26.12% at 240 K. 








Abstract
Understanding and controlling crystallization is crucial for high&#8208;quality perovskite films and efficient solar cells. Herein, the&#160;issue of defects in formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) formation is addressed, focusing on the role of intermediates. A comprehensive picture of structural and carrier evolution during crystallization is demonstrated using in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Three crystallization stages are identified: precursors to the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 intermediate, then to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, where defects spontaneously emerge. A hydrogen&#8208;sulfate&#8208;based ionic liquid additive is found to enable the phase&#8208;conversion pathway of precursors &#8594; solvated intermediates &#8594; &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, during which the spontaneous generation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 can be effectively circumvented. This additive extends the initial growth kinetics and facilitates solvent&#8211;FA+ ion exchange, which results in the self&#8208;elimination of defects during crystallization. Therefore, the improved crystallization dynamics lead to larger grain sizes and fewer defects within thin films. Ultimately, the improved perovskite crystallization dynamics enable&#160;high&#8208;performance solar cells,&#160;achieving impressive efficiencies of 25.14%&#160;at 300&#160;K and 26.12% at 240&#160;K. This breakthrough might open up a new era of application for the emerging perovskite photovoltaic technology to low&#8208;temperature environments such as near&#8208;space and polar regions.

         <title>Anions Regulation Engineering Enables a Highly Reversible and Dendrite&#8208;Free Nickel&#8208;Metal Anode with Ultrahigh Capacities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel as a transition metal has excellent electrochemical properties, which is expected to be one of the attractive metal anodes in aqueous batteries. In this work, nickel&#8208;metal batteries by the design of an anion&#8208;regulation electrolyte achieve reversible nickel plating/stripping with an ultrahigh capacity of 1000&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and long cycle life of 15&#160;000&#160;times.








Abstract
The development of safe and high&#8208;energy metal anodes represents a crucial research direction. Here, the achievement of highly reversible, dendrite&#8208;free transition metal anodes with ultrahigh capacities by regulating aqueous electrolytes is reported. Using nickel (Ni) as a model, theoretical and experimental evidence demonstrating the beneficial role of chloride ions in inhibiting and disrupting the nickel hydroxide passivation layer on the Ni electrode is provided. As a result, Ni anodes with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 1000&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 (volumetric capacity of &#8776;6000&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3), and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% on a carbon substrate, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal electrodes by approximately two orders of magnitude, are realized. Furthermore, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a series of full cells based on the Ni anode is&#160;developed. The designed Ni&#8211;MnO2 full battery exhibits a long lifespan of 2000 cycles, while the Ni&#8211;PbO2 full battery achieves a high areal capacity of 200&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The findings of this study are important for enlightening a new arena toward the advancement of dendrite&#8208;free Ni&#8208;metal anodes with ultrahigh capacities and long cycle life for various energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Covert Scattering Control in Metamaterials with Non&#8208;Locally Encoded Hidden Symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Symmetries and tunability are of fundamental importance in wave scattering control, but symmetries are often obvious upon visual inspection which constitutes a significant vulnerability of metamaterial wave devices to reverse&#8208;engineering risks. Here, it is theoretically and experimentally shown that a symmetry in the reduced basis of the &#8220;primary meta&#8208;atoms&#8221; that are directly connected to the outside world is sufficient; meanwhile, a suitable topology of non&#8208;local interactions between them, mediated by the internal &#8220;secondary&#8221; meta&#8208;atoms, can hide the symmetry from sight in the canonical basis. Covert symmetry&#8208;based scattering control in a cable&#8208;network metamaterial featuring a hidden parity (P$\mathcal {P}$) symmetry in combination with hidden&#8208;P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry&#8208;preserving and hidden&#8208;P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking tuning mechanisms is experimentally demonstrated. Physical&#8208;layer security in wired communications is achieved, using the domain&#8208;wise hidden P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry as shared secret between the sender and the legitimate receiver. Within the approximation of negligible absorption, the first tuning of a complex scattering metamaterial without mirror symmetry to feature exceptional points (EPs) of PT$\mathcal {PT}$&#8208;symmetric reflectionless states, as well as quasi&#8208;bound states in the continuum, is reported. These results are reproduced in metamaterials involving non&#8208;reciprocal interactions between meta&#8208;atoms, including the first observation of reflectionless EPs in a non&#8208;reciprocal&#160;system.

         <title>Bistable spin&#8208;crossover nanoparticles for molecular electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The field of spin&#8208;crossover complexes is rapidly evolving from the study of the spin transition phenomenon to its exploitation in molecular electronics. Such spin transition is gradual in a single&#8208;molecule, while in bulk it can be abrupt, showing sometimes thermal hysteresis and thus a memory effect. A convenient way to keep this bistability while reducing the size of the spin&#8208;crossover material is to process it as nanoparticles. Here, we review the most recent advances in the chemical design of these nanoparticles and their integration into electronic devices, paying particular attention to optimizing the switching ratio. Then, we focus on integrating spin&#8208;crossover nanoparticles over 2D materials to improve the endurance, performance, and detection of the spin state in these hybrid devices.

         <title>Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products at Cusio3/Cuo Derived Interfaces In Ordered Pores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 conversion to value&#8208;added multicarbon (C2+) chemicals holds promise for reducing CO2 emissions and advancing carbon neutrality. However, achieving both high conversion rate and selectivity remains challenging due to the limited active sites on catalysts for carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) coupling. Herein, porous CuO is coated with amorphous CuSiO3 (p&#8208;CuSiO3/CuO) to maximize the active interface sites, enabling efficient CO2 reduction to C2+ products. Significantly, the p&#8208;CuSiO3/CuO catalyst exhibits impressive C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.8% in an H&#8208;cell at &#8208;1.2&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1&#160;M KHCO3 and remarkable C2H4 and C2+ FEs of 82.0% and 91.7% in a flow cell at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;M KOH. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the active interfaces facilitate CO2 activation and lower the formation energy of the key intermediate *OCCOH, thus promoting CO2 conversion to C2+. This work provides a rational design for steering the active sites toward C2+ products.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to value-added multicarbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) chemicals holds promise for reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and advancing carbon neutrality. However, achieving both high conversion rate and selectivity remains challenging due to the limited active sites on catalysts for carbon-carbon (C-C) coupling. Herein, porous CuO is coated with amorphous CuSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (p-CuSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CuO) to maximize the active interface sites, enabling efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products. Significantly, the p-CuSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CuO catalyst exhibits impressive C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.8% in an H-cell at -1.2&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1&#160;M KHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and remarkable C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; FEs of 82.0% and 91.7% in a flow cell at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1&#160;M KOH.

         <title>Plasticizer&#8208;induced Enhancement of Mesoscale Dissymmetry in Thin Films of Chiral Polymers with Variable Chain Length</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Conjugated polymers with chiral side chains are of interest in areas including chiral photonics, optoelectronics, and chemical and biological sensing. However, the low dissymmetry factors of most neat polymer thin films have limited their practical application. Here, we demonstrate a robust method to increase the absorption dissymmetry factor in a poly&#8208;fluorene&#8208;thiophene (PF8TS series) system by varying molecular weight and introducing an achiral plasticizer, polyethylene monoalcohol (PEM&#8208;OH). Extending chain length within the optimal range and adding this long&#8208;chain alcohol significantly enhanced the chiroptical properties of spin&#8208;coated and annealed thin films. Mueller matrix ellipsometric analysis showed good agreement with the steady&#8208;state transmission measurements confirming a strong chiral response (circular dichroism and circular birefringence), ruling out linear dichroism, birefringence, and specific reflection effects. Solid&#8208;state NMR studies of annealed hybrid chiral polymer systems showed enhancement of signals associated with aromatic &#960;&#8208;stacked backbone and the ordered side&#8208;chain conformations. Further studies using Raman spectrometry, X&#8208;ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, atomic force microscopy, and polarized optical microscopy indicate that PEM&#8208;OH facilitates mesoscopic crystal domain ordering upon annealing. This provides new insights into routes for tuning optical activity in conjugated polymers.

Abstract
Nanozymes, next&#8208;generation enzyme&#8208;mimicking nanomaterials, have entered an era of rational design; among them, Co&#8208;based nanozymes have emerged as captivating players over times. Co&#8208;based nanozymes were developed and have garnered significant attention over the past five years. Their extraordinary properties, including regulatable enzymatic activity, stability, and multifunctionality stemming from magnetic properties, photothermal conversion effects, cavitation effects, and relaxation efficiency, have made Co&#8208;based nanozymes a rising star. This review presents the first comprehensive profiling of the Co&#8208;based nanozymes in the chemistry, biology, and environmental sciences. The review begins by scrutinizing the various synthetic methods employed for Co&#8208;based nanozyme fabrication, such as template and sol&#8208;gel methods, highlighting their distinctive merits from a chemical standpoint. Furthermore, we provide a detailed exploration of their wide&#8208;ranging applications in biosensing and biomedical therapeutics, as well as their contributions to environmental monitoring and remediation. Notably, drawing inspiration from state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques such as omics, a comprehensive analysis of Co&#8208;based nanozymes is undertaken, employing analogous statistical methodologies to provide valuable guidance. To conclude, we present a comprehensive outlook on the challenges and prospects for Co&#8208;based nanozymes, spanning from microscopic physicochemical mechanisms to macroscopic clinical translational applications.

         <title>Easy&#8208;To&#8208;Wear Auxetic SMA Knot&#8208;Architecture for Spatiotemporal and Multimodal Haptic Feedbacks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Wearable haptic interfaces prioritize user comfort, but also value the ability to provide diverse feedback patterns for immersive interactions with the virtual or augmented reality. Here, to provide both comfort and diverse tactile feedback, the easy&#8208;to&#8208;wear and multimodal wearable haptic auxetic fabric (WHAF) is prepared by knotting shape memory alloy (SMA) wires into an auxetic&#8208;structured fabric. This unique meta&#8208;design allows the WHAF to completely expand and contract in 3D, providing superior size&#8208;fitting and shape&#8208;fitting capabilities. Additionally, a micro&#8208;scale thin layer of Parylene is coated on the surface to create electrically separated zones within the WHAF, featuring zone&#8208;specified actuation for conveying diverse spatiotemporal information to users with using the WHAF alone. Depending on the body part it is worn on, the WHAF conveys either cutaneous or kinesthetic feedback, thus, working as a multimodal wearable haptic interface. As a result, when worn on the forearm, the WHAF intuitively provided spatiotemporal information to users during hands&#8208;free navigation and teleoperation in virtual reality, and when worn on the elbow, the WHAF guided users to reach the desired elbow flexion, like a personal exercise advisor.

         <title>Oral Nanomedicine: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Compared to injection administration, oral administration is free of discomfort, wound infection and complications and has a higher compliance rate for patients with diverse diseases. However, oral administration reduces the bioavailability of medicines, especially biologics (e.g., peptides, proteins, and antibodies), due to harsh gastrointestinal biological barriers. In this context, the development and prosperity of nanotechnology have helped improve the bioactivity and oral availability of oral medicine. On this basis, we first discussed the biological barriers to oral administration, and then reviewed oral nanomedicine based on organic and inorganic nanomaterials and their biomedical applications in diverse diseases. Finally, we put forward the challenges and potential opportunities in the future development of oral nanomedicine, which may provide a vital reference for the eventual clinical transformation and standardized production of oral nanomedicine.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Perception of Object's Deformability with Multiple Deformation Attributes Utilizing Biomimetic Mechanoreceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The perception of object's deformability in unstructured interactions relies on both kinesthetic and cutaneous cues to adapt the uncertainties of an object. However, the existing tactile sensors cannot provide adequate cutaneous cues to self&#8208;adaptively estimate the material softness, especially in non&#8208;standard contact scenarios where the interacting object deviates from the assumption of an elastic half&#8208;infinite body. This paper proposes an innovative design of a tactile sensor that integrates the capabilities of two slow&#8208;adapting mechanoreceptors within a soft medium, allowing self&#8208;decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at specific locations within the contact interface. By leveraging these localized cutaneous cues, the sensor can accurately and self&#8208;adaptively measure the material softness of an object, accommodating variations in thicknesses and applied forces. Furthermore, when combined with a kinesthetic cue from the robot, the sensor can enhance tactile expression by the synergy of two relevant deformation attributes, including material softness and compliance. We demonstrate that the biomimetic fusion of tactile information can fully comprehend the deformability of an object, hence facilitating robotic decision&#8208;making and dexterous manipulation.

Abstract
Self&#8208;Destructive Polymers (SDPs) are defined as a class of smart polymers that autonomously degrade upon experiencing an external trigger, such as a chemical cue or optical excitation. Because SDPs release the materials trapped inside the network upon degradation, they have potential applications in drug delivery and analytical sensing. However, to the best of our knowledge, SDPs that respond to external mechanical forces have not been reported, as it is fundamentally challenging to create mechano&#8208;sensitivity in general and especially so for force levels below those required for classical force&#8208;induced bond scission. To address this challenge, we describe the development of force&#8208;triggered SDPs comprised of DNA crosslinked hydrogels doped with nucleases. Externally&#8208;applied piconewton forces selectively expose enzymatic cleavage sites within the DNA crosslinks, resulting in rapid polymer self&#8208;degradation. We describe the synthesis, chemical and mechanical characterization of DNA crosslinked hydrogels, as well as the kinetics of force&#8208;triggered hydrolysis. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we also demonstrate force&#8208;triggered and time&#8208;dependent rheological changes in the polymer as well as encapsulated nanoparticle release. Finally, we show that the kinetics of self&#8208;destruction can be tuned as a function of nuclease concentration, incubation time, and the thermodynamic stability of DNA crosslinkers.

Because SDPs release the materials trapped inside the network upon degradation, they have potential applications in drug delivery and analytical sensing. However, to the best of our knowledge, SDPs that respond to external mechanical forces have not been reported, as it is fundamentally challenging to create mechano-sensitivity in general and especially so for force levels below those required for classical force-induced bond scission. To address this challenge, we describe the development of force-triggered SDPs comprised of DNA crosslinked hydrogels doped with nucleases. Externally-applied piconewton forces selectively expose enzymatic cleavage sites within the DNA crosslinks, resulting in rapid polymer self-degradation. We describe the synthesis, chemical and mechanical characterization of DNA crosslinked hydrogels, as well as the kinetics of force-triggered hydrolysis.

         <title>Partial Chemicalization of Nanoscale Metals: An Intra&#8208;Material Transformative Approach for the Synthesis of Functional Colloidal Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Nanoheterostructures</title>

Abstract
Heterostructuring colloidal nanocrystals into multicomponent modular constructs, where domains of distinct metal and semiconductor phases are interconnected through bonding interfaces, is a consolidated approach to advanced breeds of solution&#8208;processable hybrid nanomaterials capable to express richly tunable and even entirely novel physical&#8208;chemical properties and functionalities. To meet the challenges posed by the wet&#8208;chemical synthesis of metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures, and to overcome some intrinsic limitations of available protocols, innovative transformative routes, based on the paradigm of partial chemicalization, have recently been devised within the framework of the standard seeded&#8208;growth scheme. These techniques involve regiospecific replacement reactions on preformed nanocrystal substrates, thus holding great synthetic potential for programmable configurational diversification. This Review article illustrates achievements so far made in the elaboration of metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures with tailored arrangements of their component modules by means of conversion pathways that leverage on spatially controlled partial chemicalization of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic seeds. Advantages and limitations of these approaches are discussed within the context of the most plausible mechanisms underlying the evolution of the nanoheterostructures in liquid media. Representative physical&#8208;chemical properties and applications of chemicalization&#8208;derived metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures are emphasized. Finally, prospects for developments in the field are outlined.

         <title>Halide Perovskites and their Derivatives for Efficient, High&#8208;Resolution Direct Radiation Detection: Design Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The past decade has witnessed the rapid rise in performance of optoelectronic devices based on lead&#8208;halide perovskites (LHPs). The large mobility&#8208;lifetime products and defect tolerance of these materials, essential for optoelectronics, also make them well&#8208;suited for radiation detectors, especially given the heavy elements present, which is essential for strong X&#8208;ray and &#947;&#8208;ray attenuation. Over the past decade, LHP thick films, wafers and single crystals have given rise to direct radiation detectors that have outperformed incumbent technologies in terms of sensitivity (reported values up to 3.5&#215;106 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2), limit of detection (directly measured values down to 1.5 nGyair s&#8722;1), along with competitive energy and imaging resolution at room temperature. At the same time, lead&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;inspired materials (e.g., methylammonium bismuth iodide), which have underperformed in solar cells, have recently matched and, in some areas (e.g., in polarization stability), surpassed the performance of LHP detectors. These advances open up opportunities to achieve devices for safer medical imaging, as well as more effective non&#8208;invasive analysis for security, nuclear safety or product inspection. Herein, we discuss the principles behind the rapid rises in performance of LHP and perovskite&#8208;inspired material detectors, and how their properties and performance link with critical applications in non&#8208;invasive diagnostics. We discuss the key strategies to engineer the performance of these materials, and the important challenges to overcome to commercialize these new technologies.

         <title>Multifunctional PtCuTe Nanosheets with Strong Ros Scavenging And ROS&#8208;independent Antibacterial Properties Promote Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanozymes, as one of the most efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging biomaterials, are receiving wide attention in promoting diabetic wound healing. Despite recent attempts at improving the catalytic efficiency of Pt&#8208;based nanozymes, (e.g., PtCu, one of the best systems), they still display quite limited ROS scavenging capacity and ROS&#8208;dependent antibacterial effects on bacteria or immunocytes, which leads to uncontrolled and poor diabetic wound healing. Hence, we report a new class of multifunctional PtCuTe nanosheets with excellent catalytic, ROS&#8208;independent antibacterial, pro&#8208;angiogenic, anti&#8208;inflammatory and immuno&#8208;modulatory properties for boosting the diabetic wound healing. We demonstrate that the PtCuTe nanosheets show stronger ROS scavenging capacity and better antibacterial effects than PtCu. We also revealed that the PtCuTe can enhance vascular tube formation, stimulate macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype and improve fibroblast mobility, outperforming conventional PtCu. Moreover, PtCuTe promotes crosstalk between different cell types to form a positive feedback loop. Consequently, PtCuTe stimulated a pro&#8208;regenerative environment with relevant cell populations to ensure normal tissue repair. Utilizing a diabetic mouse model, we demonstrated that PtCuTe significantly facilitated the regeneration of highly vascularized skin, with the percentage of wound closure being over 90% on the 8th day, which is the best among the reported comparable multifunctional biomaterials.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticles Amplifying STING Signaling Pathway for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Insufficient activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway and profoundly immunosuppressive microenvironment largely limits the effect of cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we exploited tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (PMM NPs) that simultaneously harness STING and Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4) to augment STING activation via TLR4&#8208;mediated nuclear factor&#8208;kappa B signaling pathway stimulation, leading to the increased secretion of type I interferons (i.e., 4.0&#8208;fold enhancement of IFN&#8208;&#946;) and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines to promote a specific T cell immune response. Moreover, PMM NPs relieved the immunosuppression of the TME by decreasing the percentage of Tregs, and polarizing M2 macrophages to the M1 type, thus creating an immune&#8208;supportive TME to unleash a cascade adaptive immune response. Combined with an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, synergistic efficacy was achieved in both inflamed colorectal cancer and non&#8208;inflamed metastatic breast tumor models. Moreover, rechallenging tumor&#8208;free animals with hypotonic cells induced complete tumor rejection, indicating the generation of systemic antitumor memory. These TME&#8208;responsive nanoparticles may open a new avenue to achieve the spatiotemporal orchestration of STING activation, providing a promising clinical candidate for next&#8208;generation cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>How Photogenerated I2 Induces I&#8208;rich Phase Formation in Lead Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bandgap tunability of lead mixed halide perovskites (LMHPs) is a crucial characteristic for versatile optoelectronic applications. Nevertheless, LMHPs show the formation of iodide&#8208;rich (I&#8208;rich) phase under illumination, which destabilizes the semiconductor bandgap and impedes their exploitation. Here, we show how I2, photogenerated upon charge carrier trapping at iodine interstitials in LMHPs, can promote the formation of I&#8208;rich phase. I2 can react with bromide (Br&#8722;) in the perovskite to form a trihalide ion I2Br&#8722; (I&#948;&#8722;&#8208;I&#948;+&#8208;Br&#948;&#8722;), whose negatively charged iodide (I&#948;&#8722;) can further exchange with another lattice Br&#8722; to form the I&#8208;rich phase. Importantly, we observe that the effectiveness of the process is dependent on the overall stability of the crystalline perovskite structure. Therefore, the bandgap instability in LMHPs is governed by two factors, i.e., the density of native defects leading to I2 production and the Br&#8722; binding strength within the crystalline unit. Eventually, our study provides rules for the design of chemical composition in LMHPs to reach their full potential for optoelectronic devices.

Therefore, the bandgap instability in LMHPs is governed by two factors, i.e., the density of native defects leading to I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and the Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; binding strength within the crystalline unit. Eventually, our study provides rules for the design of chemical composition in LMHPs to reach their full potential for optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Phosphorescent Dye Sensitized Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with 37% External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Exciton harvesting is of paramount importance for quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). Direct exciton harvesting by quantum dots (QDs) emitting layer suffers from poor hole injection due to the low conduction bands and valence bands of QDs, leading to unbalanced electron&#8208;hole injection and recombination. To address this issue, here we report an exciton sensitizing approach, where excitons form on a phosphorescent dye doped layer which then transfer their energies to adjacent QDs layer for photon emission. Due to the very efficient exciton formation and energy transfer processes, higher device performance could be achieved. To demonstrate the above strategy, red QLEDs with a phosphorescent dye Iridium (III) bis (2 &#8211; methyldibenzo &#8211; [f, h] quinoxaline) (acetylacetonate), Ir(MDQ)2(acac) doped hole transporting layer were fabricated and studied. At a doping concentration of 10&#160;wt.%, the best device achieves record high current efficiency, power efficiency and external quantum efficiency of 37.3&#160;cd A&#8722;1, 41.0&#160;lm W&#8722;1 and 37.0%, respectively. Simultaneously, the efficiency roll&#8208;off characteristic was greatly improved that 35.0% EQE can be well remained at high luminance level of 450 000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Moreover, the devices also exhibit good stability and reproducibility.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Silica Anode Achieving Intrinsic Zero&#8208;Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Si&#8208;based anodes have large intrinsic volume expansion, which hinders their practicality and commercialisation. To address this challenge, the design principle of intrinsic zero&#8208;strain anodes (&#9312; large intracrystalline cavities and &#9313; strong bonds) is proposed, and silica with large intracrystalline cavities (SLIC) established by strong Si&#8211;O bonds ([SiO4] coordinate structures) is obtained and acts as an anode, achieving the intrinsic zero&#8208;strain feature first in silicon&#8208;based anodes. The phase structure of SLIC is maintained and the [SiO4] coordinate structure merely shows slight disorder during cycling. The feature stems from lithiation taking place by the solid&#8208;solution insertion reaction rather than the conventional conversion/alloying addition reactions, because the solid&#8208;solution insertion reaction for the SLIC has the lowest change in the Gibbs free energy. The SLIC anode demonstrates excellent cycling stability and high initial Coulombic efficiency (&#8764;85%). Moreover, owing to the low working voltage (&#8764;0.28&#160;V) and relatively high specific capacity, the SLIC anode presents the highest gravimetric energy density among reported zero&#8208;/quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain anodes and high volumetric energy density (around twice as much as graphite). The universality of the designing principle is also validated. Our work provides design guidelines for zero&#8208;strain anodes in next&#8208;generation batteries.

         <title>Tailoring Enantiomeric Chiral Channels in Metal&#8208;Peptide Networks: A Novel Foldamer&#8208;Based Approach for Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Designing chiral channels in organic frameworks presents an ongoing challenge due to the intricate control of size, shape, and functionality required. A novel approach is presented, which crafts enantiomeric chiral channels in metal&#8208;peptide networks (MPNs) by integrating short foldamer ligands with CuI clusters. The MPN structure serves as a 3D blueprint for host&#8208;guest chemistry, fostering modular substitution to refine chiral channel properties at the atomic scale. Incorporating hydrogen bond networks augments guest molecule interactions with the channel surface. This approach expedites enantiomer discrimination in racemic mixtures and incites adaptable guest molecules to take on specific axially chiral conformations. Distinct from traditional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and conventional reticular architectures, this foldamer&#8208;based methodology provides a predictable and customizable host&#8208;guest interaction system within a 3D topology. This innovation sets the stage for multifunctional materials that merge host&#8208;guest interaction systems with metal&#8208;complex properties, opening up potential applications in catalysis, sensing, and drug delivery.

         <title>Antibacterial Fusobacterium Nucleatum&#8208;Mimicking Nanomedicine to Selectively Eliminate Tumor&#8208;colonized Bacteria And Enhance Immunotherapy Against Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Clinical evidence has indicated that tumor&#8208;colonizing bacteria would be closely related to the tumor development and therapeutic responses. Selectively eliminating bacteria within tumors may be an attractive approach to enhance cancer treatment without additional side effects. Herein, we found that owing to the high affinity between the membrane protein Fap&#8208;2 on Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and D&#8208;galactose&#8208;&#946; (1&#8208;3)&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine (Gal&#8208;GalNAc) overexpressed on colorectal tumor cells, F. nucleatum would colonize in colorectal tumors, as evidenced by both clinical samples and animal tumor models. Notably, F. nucleatum colonized in colorectal tumors would lead to immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, greatly reducing their responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Inspired by this finding, we designed a F. nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine by fusing F. nucleatum cytoplasmic membrane (FM) with Colistin loaded liposomes to achieve selectively killing tumor&#8208;colonizing F. nucleatum without affecting gut microbes. As the results, the therapeutic responses of F. nucleatum&#8208;colonized tumors to ICB therapies could be successfully restored, as demonstrated in F. nucleatum&#8208;infected subcutaneous CT&#8208;26 tumor model, chemical&#8208;induced spontaneous colorectal cancer models and MC&#8208;38 tumor model. In summary, our work presented a F. nucleatum&#8208;Mimicking nanomedicine which could selectively eliminate tumor&#8208;colonized bacteria, promising for enhancing the responses of cancer immunotherapy against F. nucleatum&#8208;colonized colorectal cancer.

         <title>Aqueous&#8208;Based Inorganic Colloidal Halide Perovskites Customizing Liquid Scintillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Compared to solid scintillators and organic liquid scintillators, aqueous&#8208;based liquid scintillators (AbLS) have more superiority in highly flexible scalability, yet are now limited by their low light yield (&#8764;100 photons/MeV). Here, we synthesize aqueous&#8208;based inorganic colloidal halide perovskites with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of three primary color luminescence up to 88.1% (red), 96% (green), 81.8% (blue), respectively, and fabricate a new generation of colloidal perovskite&#8208;mediated aqueous&#8208;based liquid scintillator (PAbLS) with light yield increased in comparison with commercial scintillator AbLS. We expound on the excellent PLQY and colloidal dispersion of halide perovskites benefits from PEG modification, which ensures the vacancy inhibition and formation of defect&#8208;free surfaces in an aqueous solution. Moreover, their high luminescent emission can be maintained for 100 days at low temperatures, and such modification also promises the heat&#8208;to&#8208;cold customization of operating temperature even in ice below 0&#176;C. Finally, depending on the light yield of around 3058 and 8037 photons/MeV at room temperature and low temperature, PAbLS with shape/size scalability exhibit their robust radiation hardness (dose rate as high as 23 mGy/s) and conceptual application potential in high&#8208;energy ray radiation detection from every angle of 360 degrees.

Abstract
Microfluidics, with its remarkable capacity to manipulate fluids and droplets at the microscale, has emerged as a powerful platform in numerous fields. In contrast to conventional closed microchannel microfluidic systems, free&#8208;boundary microfluidic manufacturing (FBMM) processes continuous precursor fluids into jets or droplets in a relatively spacious environment. FBMM is highly regarded for its superior flexibility, stability, economy, usability, and versatility in the manufacturing of advanced materials and architectures. In this review, a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in FBMM is provided, encompassing technical principles, advanced material manufacturing, and their applications. FBMM is categorized based on the foundational mechanisms, primarily comprising hydrodynamics, interface effects, acoustics, and electrohydrodynamic. The processes and mechanisms of fluid manipulation are thoroughly discussed. Additionally, the manufacturing of advanced materials in various dimensions ranging from zero&#8208;dimensional to three&#8208;dimensional, as well as their diverse applications in material science, biomedical engineering, and engineering are presented. Finally, current progress is summarized and future challenges are prospected. Overall, this review highlights the significant potential of FBMM as a powerful tool for advanced materials manufacturing and its wide&#8208;ranging applications.

         <title>Unravelling Twin Topotactic/Nontopotactic Reactive TiSe2 Cathodes for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Titanium selenide (TiSe2), a model transition metal chalcogenide material, typically relies on topotactic ion intercalation/deintercalation to achieve stable ion storage with minimal disruption of the transport pathways but has restricted capacity (&lt;130 mAh g&#8722;1). Developing novel energy storage mechanisms beyond conventional intercalation to break capacity limits in TiSe2 cathodes is essential yet challenging. Herein, we revisited the ion storage properties of TiSe2 and unraveled an unusual thermodynamically stable twin topotactic/nontopotactic Cu2+ accommodation mechanism for aqueous batteries. In&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex&#8208;situ microscopy jointly demonstrated that topotactic intercalation sustained the ion transport framework, nontopotactic conversion involved localized multielectron reactions, and these two parallel reactions were miraculously intertwined in nanoscale space. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical results suggested that the twin&#8208;reaction mechanism significantly improved the electron transfer ability, and the reserved intercalated TiSe2 structure anchored the reduced titanium monomers with high&#8208;affinity and promoted efficient charge transfer to synergistically enhance the capacity and reversibility. Consequently, TiSe2 nanoflake cathodes delivered a never&#8208;before&#8208;achieved capacity of 275.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1, 93.5% capacity retention over 1000 cycles, and endow hybrid batteries (TiSe2&#8208;Cu||Zn) with a stable energy supply of 181.34&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 2339.81&#160;W kg&#8722;1, offering a promising model for aqueous ion storage.

         <title>Self&#8208;rolled&#8208;up Ultrathin Single&#8208;Crystalline Silicon Nanomembranes for On&#8208;Chip Tubular Polarization Photodetectors</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Freestanding single&#8208;crystalline nanomembranes and their assembly have broad application potential in photodetectors for integrated chips. However, the release and self&#8208;assembly process of single&#8208;crystalline semiconductor nanomembranes still remains great challenges in on&#8208;chip processing and functional integration, and photodetectors based on nanomembrane always suffer from limited absorption of nanoscale thickness. Here, we employ a non&#8208;destructive releasing and rolling process to prepare tubular photodetectors based on freestanding single&#8208;crystalline Si nanomembranes. Spontaneous release and self&#8208;assembly are achieved by residual strain introduced by lattice mismatch at the epitaxial interface of Si and Ge, and the intrinsic stress and strain distributions in self&#8208;rolled&#8208;up Si nanomembranes are analyzed experimentally and computationally. The advantages of light trapping and wide&#8208;angle optical coupling are realized by tubular geometry. Our Si microtube device achieves reliable Ohmic contact and exhibits a photoresponsivity of over 330&#160;mA/W, a response time of 370 &#956;s, and a light incident detection angle range of over 120&#176;. Furthermore, the microtubular structure shows a distinct polarization angle&#8208;dependent light absorption, with a dichroic ratio of 1.24 achieved at 940&#160;nm. The proposed Si&#8208;based microtubes provide new possibilities for the construction of multifunctional chips for integrated circuit ecosystems in More than Moore era.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Spatial Confinement in Immune Cell Recruitment and Regeneration of Skin Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are injectable granular materials comprised of micron sized hydrogel particles (microgels). The diameter of these microgels directly determines the size of the interconnected void space between particles where infiltrating or encapsulated cells reside. This tunable porosity allows us to use MAP scaffolds to study the impact of spatial confinement (SC) on both cellular behaviors and the host response to biomaterials. Despite previous studies showing that pore size and SC influence cellular phenotypes, including mitigating the macrophage inflammatory response, there is still a gap in knowledge regarding how SC within a biomaterial modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. Thus, we studied the immune cell profile within confined and unconfined biomaterials using small (40&#160;&#956;m), medium (70&#160;&#956;m), and large (130&#160;&#956;m) diameter spherical microgels, respectively. We discovered that MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels promoted a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.

         <title>Reversible Multi&#8208;Electron Redox Chemistry in NASICON&#8208;Type Cathode Toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density And Long&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>

Abstract
Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type cathodes (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3) have attracted extensive attention due to their open and robust framework, fast Na+ mobility and superior thermal stability. To commercialize sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON&#8208;type cathodes. Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by Fe substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realize the high&#8208;voltage multi&#8208;electron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2 mAh g&#8722;1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10,000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+ and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic&#8208;migration energy barrier and ideal Na+ diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher&#8208;valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;duration cycling lifespan (3000 stable cycles at 50C), along with material&#8208;level energy density up to 304&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. The present work can provide new perspectives to accelerate the commercialization of SIBs.

Abstract
The chemical, physical and biological effects of chiral nanomaterials have inspired general interest and demonstrated the important advantages in fundamental science. Here, we fabricated chiral iron oxide supraparticles (Fe3O4 SPs) modified by chiral penicillamine (Pen) molecules with a g&#8208;factor of approximately 2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 at 415&#160;nm, these SPs acted as a high&#8208;quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent. Therein, the transverse relaxation efficiency and T2&#8208;MRI results demonstrated the chiral Fe3O4 SPs had a r2 relaxivity of 157.39 &#177; 2.34 mM&#8722;1&#183;S&#8722;1 for D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs and 136.21 &#177; 1.26 mM&#8722;1&#183;S&#8722;1 for L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs due to the enhanced electronic transition dipole moment for D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs compared with L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs. The in vivo MRI results showed that D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs exhibited a two&#8208;fold lower contrast ratio than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs, which enhanced targeted enrichment in tumor tissue, such as prostate cancer, melanoma, and brain glioma tumor. Notably, it w as found that D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs had a 7.7&#8208;fold higher affinity for the tumor cell surface receptor cluster&#8208;of&#8208;differentiation 47 (CD47) than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs. These findings uncovered that chiral Fe3O4 SPs act as a highly effective MRI contrast agent for targeting and imaging broad tumors, thus accelerating the practical application of chiral nanomaterials and deepening the understanding of chirality in the biological and non&#8208;biological environments.

         <title>Buried&#8208;Interface Engineering of Conformal 2D/3D Perovskite Heterojunction for Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a hybrid two&#8208;step deposition method, prepared robust 2D perovskites with cross&#8208;linkable ligands underneath 3D perovskite enable the formation of a conformal 2D/3D heterostructure at the buried interface. Owing to the influence of the heterojunction on crystallization and interfacial modulation, perovskite&#8211;silicon tandem solar cells based on industrially fully textured silicon achieve an efficiency of 29.8% (certified 28.4%).








Abstract
Exploring strategies to control the crystallization and modulate interfacial properties for high&#8208;quality perovskite film on industry&#8208;relevant textured crystalline silicon solar cells is highly valued in the perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaics community. The formation of a 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction is widely employed to passivate defects and suppress ion migration in the film surface of perovskite solar cells. However, realizing solution&#8208;processed heterostructures at the buried interface faces solvent incompatibilities with the challenge of underlying&#8208;layer disruption, and texture incompatibilities with the challenge of uneven coverage. Here, a hybrid two&#8208;step deposition method is used to prepare robust 2D perovskites with cross&#8208;linkable ligands underneath the 3D perovskite. This structurally coherent interlayer benefits by way of preferred crystal growth of strain&#8208;free and uniform upper perovskite, inhibits interfacial defect&#8208;induced instability and recombination, and promotes charge&#8208;carrier extraction with ideal energy&#8208;level alignment. The broad applicability of the bottom&#8208;contact heterostructure for different textured substrates with conformal coverage and various precursor solutions with intact properties free of erosion are&#160;demonstrated. With this buried interface engineering strategy, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem cells, based on industrially textured Czochralski (CZ) silicon, achieve a certified efficiency of 28.4% (1.0 cm2), while retaining 89% of the initial PCE after over 1000 h operation.

         <title>Over 18% Efficiency Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 300&#160;nm Thick Active Layer Enabled by An Oligomeric Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency thickness&#8208;insensitive organic solar cells (OSCs) is crucially important for the mass production of solar panels. However, increasing the active layer thickness usually induces a substantial loss in effcicency. We herein adopt a ternary strategy to break this dilemma, in which an oligomer DY&#8208;TF was incorporated into PM6:L8&#8208;BO system as a guest component. The S&#183;&#183;&#183;F intramolecular noncovalent interactions in the backbone endows DY&#8208;TF with a high planarity. Upon the addition of DY&#8208;TF, the crystallinity of the blend is effectively improved, leading to increased charge carrier mobility, which is highly desirable in the fabrication of thick&#8208;film devices. As a result, a thin&#8208;film PM6:L8&#8208;BO:DY&#8208;TF based device (110&#160;nm) shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.13%. Impressively, when the active layer thickness increases to 300&#160;nm, an efficiency of 18.23% (certified as 17.8%) is achieved, representing the highest efficiency reported for 300&#8208;nm&#8208;thick OSCs thus far. Additionally, a blade&#8208;coated thick device (300&#160;nm) delivers a promising PCE of 17.38%. This work brings new insights into the construction of efficient OSCs with high thickness tolerance, showing great potential for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing of large&#8208;area solar cells.

         <title>Conducting Polymer Coatings Prepared by Mixed Emulsions are Highly Conductive and Stable in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An aqueous emulsion of conducting polymer is commonly applied on a substrate to form a coating after drying. The coating, however, disintegrates in water. This paper reports a coating prepared using a mixture of two emulsions: an aqueous emulsion of conducting polymer, and an aqueous emulsion of hydrophobic and rubbery chains copolymerized with silane coupling agents. When applied on a substrate and dried, particles of the mixed emulsion merge into a continuous film. While the conducting polymer forms percolated nanocrystals, the silane groups crosslink the rubbery chains and interlink the rubbery chains to the substrate. The percolated nanocrystals make the coating highly conductive. The covalent network of hydrophobic polymer chains stabilizes the coating in water. The high conductivity and stability in water may enable broad applications.

An innovative nanofibrous hydrogel (nf&#8208;gel) constructed with constituent polymer nanofibers is proposed and fabricated using a two&#8208;step solvent&#8208;exchange method including an essential nonsolvent&#8208;quenching step. These nf&#8208;gels show remarkably enhanced mechanical properties and swelling resistance compared to their molecular counterparts. Particularly, they are isotropic, distinctly different from conventional fiber reinforced hydrogels.. .








Abstract
Nanofibrous hydrogels are pervasive in load&#8208;bearing soft tissues, which are believed to be key to their extraordinary mechanical properties. Enlighted by this phenomenon, a novel reinforcing strategy for polymeric hydrogels is proposed, where polymer segments in the hydrogels are induced to form nanofibers in&#160;situ by bolstering their controllable aggregation at the nanoscale level. Poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels are chosen to demonstrate the virtue of this strategy. A nonsolvent&#8208;quenching step is introduced into the conventional solvent&#8208;exchange hydrogel preparation approach, which readily promotes the formation of nanofibrous hydrogels in the following solvent&#8208;tempering process. The resultant nanofibrous hydrogels demonstrate significantly improved mechanical properties and swelling resistance, compared to the conventional solvent&#8208;exchange hydrogels with identical compositions. This work validates the hypothesis that bundling polymer chains to form nanofibers can lead to nanofibrous hydrogels with remarkably enhanced mechanical performances, which may open a new horizon for single&#8208;component hydrogel reinforcement.

         <title>In Situ Li&#8208;Plating Diagnosis for Fast&#8208;Charging Li&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Relaxation&#8208;Time Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective indicator of Li&#8208;plating onset is urgently needed to investigate the safety window of Li&#8208;ion batteries. This work demonstrates that the relaxation time constant of the charge&#8208;transfer process is promising for determining Li&#8208;plating onset. A relaxation&#8208;time detection method is proposed, allowing in situ diagnosis of the Li&#8208;plating behavior in fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The Li&#8208;plating behavior of Li&#8208;ion batteries under fast&#8208;charging conditions is elusive due to a lack of reliable indicators of the Li&#8208;plating onset. In this work, the relaxation time constant of the charge&#8208;transfer process (&#964;CT) is proposed to be promising for the determination of Li&#8208;plating onset. A novel pulse/relaxation test method enables rapid access to the &#964;CT of the graphite anode during battery operation, applicable to both half and full batteries. The diagnosis of Li plating at varying temperatures and charging rates enriches the cognition of Li&#8208;plating behaviors. Li plating at low temperatures and high charging rates can be avoided because of the battery voltage limitations. Nevertheless, after the onset, severe Li plating evolves rapidly under harsh charging conditions, while the Li&#8208;plating process under benign charging conditions is accompanied by a simultaneous Li&#8208;intercalation process. The quantitative estimates indicate that Li plating at high temperatures/high charging rates leads to more irreversible capacity losses. This facile method with rational scientific principles can provide inspiration for exploring the safe boundaries of Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Understanding Effects of Alkyl Side&#8208;Chain Density on Polaron Formation Via Electrochemical Doping in Thiophene Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small modification of side&#8208;chain density in thiophene&#8208;based conjugated polymers affects the polaron formation via electrochemical doping. In situ monitoring of polaron formation allows identification of its dependence on molecular structures. Understanding of the polaron formation mechanism is important for molecular design rules and its impact on electrical properties.








Abstract
Polarons exist when charges are injected into organic semiconductors due to their strong coupling with the lattice phonons, significantly affecting electronic charge&#8208;transport properties. Understanding the formation and (de)localization of polarons is therefore critical for further developing organic semiconductors as a future electronics platform. However, there are very few studies reported in this area. In particular, there is no direct in situ monitoring of polaron formation and identification of its dependence on molecular structure and impact on electrical properties, limiting further advancement in organic electronics. Herein, how a minor modification of side&#8208;chain density in thiophene&#8208;based conjugated polymers affects the polaron formation via electrochemical doping, changing the polymers&#8217; electrical response to the surrounding dielectric environment for gas sensing, is demonstrated. It is found that the reduction in side&#8208;chain density results in a multistep polaron formation, leading to an initial formation of localized polarons in thiophene units without side chains. Reduced side&#8208;chain density also allows the formation of a high density of polarons with fewer polymer structural changes. More numerous but more localized polarons generate a stronger analyte response but without the selectivity between polar and non&#8208;polar solvents, which is different from the more delocalized polarons that show clear selectivity. The results provide important molecular understanding and design rules for the polaron formation and its impact on electrical properties.

         <title>Protonated Organic Semiconductors: Origin of Water&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Trap Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism of bias&#8208;stress&#8208;induced trap generation in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) is unveiled. The combined spectroscopic method proposes the trap generation from the protonation of low&#8208;bandgap polymers. This concept can be applied to promote the development of highly stable OFETs under bias stress and related application devices.








Abstract
Despite dramatic improvements in the electronic characteristics of organic semiconductors, the low operational stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) hinders their direct use in practical applications. Although the literature contains numerous reports on the effects of water on the operational stability of OFETs, the underlying mechanisms of trap generation induced by water remain unclear. Here, a protonation&#8208;induced trap generation of organic semiconductors is proposed as a possible origin of the operational instability in organic field&#8208;effect transistors. Spectroscopic and electronic investigation techniques combined with simulations reveal that the direct protonation of organic semiconductors by water during operation may be responsible for the trap generation induced by bias stress; this phenomenon is independent of the trap generation at an insulator surface. In addition, the same feature occurred in small&#8208;bandgap polymers with fused thiophene rings irrespective of their crystalline ordering, implying the generality of protonation induced trap generation in various polymer semiconductors with a small bandgap. The finding of the trap&#8208;generation process provides new perspectives for achieving greater operational stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>All&#8208;Optical Data Processing with Photon&#8208;Avalanching Nanocrystalline Photonic Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly nonlinear, photoexcitation intensity&#8208;dependent luminescence and residual energy storage in photon&#8208;avalanching inorganic Tm3+&#8208;doped fluoride nanoparticles mimic the behavior of biological synapses. These properties enable all&#8208;optical information processing such as multiple inputs and weighted all&#8208;or&#8208;none response, short memory storage, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, coincidence detection from multiple inputs, and complex 2D image data feature extraction.








Abstract
Data processing and storage in electronic devices are typically performed as a sequence of elementary binary operations. Alternative approaches, such as neuromorphic or reservoir computing, are rapidly gaining interest where data processing is relatively slow, but can be performed in a more comprehensive way or massively in parallel, like in neuronal circuits. Here, time&#8208;domain all&#8208;optical information processing capabilities of photon&#8208;avalanching (PA) nanoparticles at room temperature are discovered. Demonstrated functionality resembles properties found in neuronal synapses, such as: paired&#8208;pulse facilitation and short&#8208;term internal memory, in situ plasticity, multiple inputs processing, and all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing threshold response. The PA&#8208;memory&#8208;like behavior shows capability of machine&#8208;learning&#8208;algorithm&#8208;free feature extraction and further recognition of 2D patterns with simple 2 input artificial neural network. Additionally, high nonlinearity of luminescence intensity in response to photoexcitation mimics and enhances spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity that is coherent in nature with the way a sound source is localized in animal neuronal circuits. Not only are yet unexplored fundamental properties of photon&#8208;avalanche luminescence kinetics studied, but this approach, combined with recent achievements in photonics, light confinement and guiding, promises all&#8208;optical data processing, control, adaptive responsivity, and storage on photonic chips.

         <title>An and Logic Gate for Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#8208;Guided Ferroptosis Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To improve the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) efficiency and ferroptosis therapy efficacy of exceedingly small magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IO, &lt; 5&#160;nm) for tumors via enhancing the sensitivity of tumor microenvironment (TME) responsiveness, inspired by molecular logic gates, we designed and constructed a self&#8208;assembled IO with a AND logic gate function. Typically, cystamine (CA) was conjugated onto the end of poly(2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;ethanol methacrylate) (PMEMA) to generate PMEMA&#8208;CA. The PMEMA&#8208;CA was grafted onto the surface of brequinar (BQR)&#8208;loaded IO to form IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA. The self&#8208;assembled IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA (SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA) was obtained due to the hydrophobicity of PMEMA. The carbon&#8208;sulfur single bond of PMEMA&#8208;CA can be oxidized by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TME to thio&#8208;oxygen double bond, resulting in the conversion from being hydrophobic to hydrophilic. The disulfide bond of PMEMA&#8208;CA can be broken by the glutathione (GSH) in TME, leading to the shedding of PMEMA from the IO surface. Under the dual actions of ROS and GSH in TME (i.e., AND logic gate), SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA can be disassembled to release IO, Fe2+/3+, and BQR. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrate the AND logic gate function and mechanism, the high T1 MRI performance and exceptional ferroptosis therapy efficacy for tumors, and the excellent biosafety of SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA.

         <title>Covalently Functionalized Nanopores for Highly Selective Separation of Monovalent Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biological ion channels possess prominent ion transport performances attributed to their critical chemical groups across the continuous nanoscale filters. However, it is still a challenge to imitate these sophisticated performances in artificial nanoscale systems. Herein, this work develops the strategy to fabricate functionalized graphene nanopores in pioneer based on the synergistic regulation of the pore size and chemical properties of atomically thin confined structure through decoupling etching combined with in&#8208;situ covalent modification. The modified graphene nanopores possess asymmetric ion transport behaviors and efficient monovalent metal ions sieving (K+/Li+ selectivity &#8764; 48.6). Meanwhile, it also allows preferential transport for cations, the resulting membranes exhibit a K+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 76 and a H+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 59.3. The synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions imposing a higher energy barrier for Cl&#8722; or Li+ to across nanopores lead to ultra&#8208;selective H+ or K+ transport. Further, the functionalized graphene nanopores generate a power density of 25.3&#160;W m&#8722;2 and a conversion efficiency of 33.9%, showing potential application prospects in energy conversion. The theoretical studies quantitatively match well with the experimental results. The feasible preparation of functionalized graphene nanopores paves the way toward direct investigation on ion transport mechanism and advanced design in devices.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Droplets Parameters Monitoring in a Microfluidic Chip via Liquid&#8208;Solid Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The monitoring of micro&#8208;droplets parameters is significant to the development of droplet microfluidics. However, existing monitoring methods have drawbacks such as high cost, interference with droplet movement, and even the potential for cross&#8208;contamination. Herein, a micro&#8208;droplets monitoring method (MDMM) based on liquid&#8208;solid triboelectric nanogenerator (LS&#8208;TENG) is proposed, which can realize non&#8208;invasive and self&#8208;powered monitoring of micro&#8208;droplets in a microfluidic chip. The droplet frequency is monitored by voltage pulse frequency and a mathematical model is established to monitor the droplet length and velocity. Furthermore, we construct a micro&#8208;droplets sensor (MDS) based on the MDMM to carry out the experiment. The coefficients of determination (R2) of the fitting curves of the micro&#8208;droplets frequency, length, and velocity monitoring are 0.998, 0.997, and 0.995, respectively. To prove the universal applicability of the MDMM, the micro&#8208;droplets generated by different liquid media and channel structures are monitored. Eventually, a micro&#8208;droplets monitoring system is built, which can realize the counting of micro&#8208;droplets and the monitoring of droplet frequency and length. This work provides a novel approach for monitoring micro&#8208;droplets parameters, which holds the potential to advance developments in the field of microfluidics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanoregulator to Mitigate Dynamic Immune Evasion of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The advance of immunotherapy has shifted the paradigm of cancer management in clinic. Nevertheless, a considerable subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients marginally responds to current immunotherapy due to the occurrence of dynamic immune evasion arising from the intrinsic and therapeutic stress. In this investigation, we identified the pivotal role of pancreatic cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast (CAF)&#8208;induced fibrosis and tumor cell&#8208;mediated T&#8208;cell exhaustion in driving the dynamic immune evasion. Building upon this discovery, we herein engineered a novel peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC)&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator for mitigating dynamic immune evasion of PDAC. The resulting nanoregulator could perform two&#8208;stage morphology transformation from spherical micelle to nanofiber, and subsequently from nanofiber to spherical nanoparticles. Such kind nanostructure design could facilitate differentialized delivery of CAF inhibitor in the extracellular matrix for intervening CAF&#8208;mediated tumor fibrosis, and indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 inhibitor to tumor cells for relieving IDO1&#8208;kynurenine axis&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell exhaustion. Antitumor study with the self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator elicited persistent antitumor immunity and remarkable antitumor performance in both Panc02 and KPC tumor models in vivo. Taken together, the PDC&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator might provide a novel avenue for enhanced PDAC immunotherapy.

         <dc:description>
Two distinct requirements of various nanomaterials, including from a single semiconductor or with van der Waals heterostructures, are summarized, including where strain must be avoided, such as solutions to produce strain&#8208;insensitive devices, and where strain is required, such as pressure&#8208;sensitive outcomes.








Abstract
2D materials with dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces and atomically thin layers have been shown to be capable of being incorporated into flexible electronic devices. The electronic and optical properties of 2D materials can be tuned or controlled in other ways by using the intriguing strain engineering method. The latest and encouraging techniques in regard to creating flexible 2D nanoelectronics are condensed in this review. These techniques have the potential to be used in a wider range of applications in the near and long term. It is possible to use ultrathin 2D materials (graphene, BP, WTe2, VSe2 etc.) and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) in order to enable the electrical behavior of the devices to be studied. A category of materials is produced on smaller scales by exfoliating bulk materials, whereas chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and epitaxial growth are employed on larger scales. This overview highlights two distinct requirements, which include from a single semiconductor or with van der Waals heterostructures of various nanomaterials. They include where strain must be avoided and where it is required, such as solutions to produce strain&#8208;insensitive devices, and such as pressure&#8208;sensitive outcomes, respectively. Finally, points&#8208;of&#8208;view about the current difficulties and possibilities in regard to using 2D materials in flexible electronics are provided.

         <title>A Memristors&#8208;Based Dendritic Neuron&#160;for High&#8208;Efficiency Spatial&#8208;Temporal Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the microscopic dynamics in biological system, a dynamic memristor as an artificial dendrite and a Mott memristor as a spike&#8208;firing soma are integrated to construct a dendritic neuron for high&#8208;efficiency spatial&#8208;temporal information processing. Furthermore, a bio&#8208;plausible dendritic neural network is hardware implemented to demonstrate human&#8208;motion recognition, showing nearly 20% improvement in accuracy and 1000&#215;&#160;higher powerefficiency than a&#160;graphics processing unit.








Abstract
Diverse microscopic ionic dynamics help mediate the ability of a biological neural network to handle complex tasks with low energy consumption. Thus, rich internal ionic dynamics in memristors based on transition metal oxide are expected to provide a unique and useful platform for implementing energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the microscopic dynamics in biological system, a dynamic memristor as an artificial dendrite and a Mott memristor as a spike-firing soma are integrated to construct a dendritic neuron for high-efficiency spatial-temporal information processing. Furthermore, a bio-plausible dendritic neural network is hardware implemented to demonstrate human-motion recognition, showing nearly 20% improvement in accuracy and 1000&#215;&#160;higher powerefficiency than a&#160;graphics processing unit.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diverse microscopic ionic dynamics help mediate the ability of a biological neural network to handle complex tasks with low energy consumption. Thus, rich internal ionic dynamics in memristors based on transition metal oxide are expected to provide a unique and useful platform for implementing energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. To this end, a titanium oxide (TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)-based interface-type dynamic memristor and an niobium oxide (NbO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)-based Mott memristor are integrated as an artificial dendrite and spike-firing soma, respectively, to construct a dendritic neuron unit for realizing high-efficiency spatial-temporal information processing. Further, a dendritic neural network is hardware-implemented for spatial-temporal information processing to highlight the computational advantages achieved by incorporating dendritic functions in the network. Human motion recognition is demonstrated using the Nanyang Technological University-Red Green Blue&#160;(NTU-RGB) dataset as a benchmark spatial-temporal task; it shows a nearly 20% improvement in accuracy for the memristors-based hardware incorporating dendrites and a 1000&#215; advantage in power efficiency compared to that of the graphics processing unit (GPU). The dendritic neuron developed in this study can be considered a critical building block for implementing more bio-plausible neural networks that can manage complex spatial-temporal tasks with high efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The paradigm of in&#8208;sensor computing integrates computing functions into sensory networks, exhibiting high speed, energy efficiency, and computation throughout. The hardware implementation of in&#8208;sensor computing paradigm at the device and array levels, and their integration technology are discussed, and perspectives on future development of in&#8208;sensor computing are provided.








Abstract
The number of sensor nodes in the Internet of Things is growing rapidly, leading to a large volume of data generated at sensory terminals. Frequent data transfer between the sensors and computing units causes severe limitations on the system performance in terms of energy efficiency, speed, and security. To efficiently process a substantial amount of sensory data, a novel computation paradigm that can integrate computing functions into sensor networks should be developed. The in&#8208;sensor computing paradigm reduces data transfer and also decreases the high computing complexity by processing data locally. Here, the hardware implementation of the in&#8208;sensor computing paradigm at the device and array levels is discussed. The physical mechanisms that lead to unique sensory response characteristics and their corresponding computing functions are illustrated. In particular, bioinspired device characteristics enable the implementation of the functionalities of neuromorphic computation. The integration technology is also discussed and the perspective on the future development of in&#8208;sensor computing is provided.

         <title>Probabilistic Neural Computing with Stochastic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modern computing assumes that materials, devices, and circuits will be operated in a fully deterministic manner, providing predictable and reliable outputs, with any desired random behavior re&#8208;introduced in software. This perspective describes how the integration of tunable stochastic devices into neuromorphic computing architectures can allow future microelectronics to enable more efficient probabilistic computing calculations for scientific computing and artificial&#8208;intelligence applications.








Abstract
The brain has effectively proven a powerful inspiration for the development of computing architectures in which processing is tightly integrated with memory, communication is event&#8208;driven, and analog computation can be performed at scale. These neuromorphic systems increasingly show an ability to improve the efficiency and speed of scientific computing and artificial intelligence applications. Herein, it is proposed that the brain's ubiquitous stochasticity represents an additional source of inspiration for expanding the reach of neuromorphic computing to probabilistic applications. To date, many efforts exploring probabilistic computing have focused primarily on one scale of the microelectronics stack, such as implementing probabilistic algorithms on deterministic hardware or developing probabilistic devices and circuits with the expectation that they will be leveraged by eventual probabilistic architectures. A co&#8208;design vision is described by which large numbers of devices, such as magnetic tunnel junctions and tunnel diodes, can be operated in a stochastic regime and incorporated into a scalable neuromorphic architecture that can impact a number of probabilistic computing applications, such as Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian neural networks. Finally, a framework is presented to categorize increasingly advanced hardware&#8208;based probabilistic computing technologies.

         <dc:description>
Unlike two&#8208;terminal memristors, electrochemical random access memory (ECRAM) tunes conductance through ion injection into the channel through a solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The history of ECRAM, the recent progress in devices spanning organic, inorganic, and 2D materials, circuits, architectures, the challenging fundamental questions, and how ECRAM could be harnessed to realize a new paradigm for low power neuromorphic computing are reviewed.








Abstract
Non&#8208;von&#8208;Neumann computing using neuromorphic systems based on two&#8208;terminal resistive nonvolatile memory elements has emerged as a promising approach, but its full potential has not been realized due to the lack of materials and devices with the appropriate attributes. Unlike memristors, which require large write currents to drive phase transformations or filament growth, electrochemical random access memory (ECRAM) decouples the &#8220;write&#8221; and &#8220;read&#8221; operations using a &#8220;gate&#8221; electrode to tune the conductance state through charge&#8208;transfer reactions, and every electron transferred through the external circuit in ECRAM corresponds to the migration of &#8776;1 ion used to store analogue information. Like static dopants in traditional semiconductors, electrochemically inserted ions modulate the conductivity by locally perturbing a host's electronic structure; however, ECRAM does so in a dynamic and reversible manner. The resulting change in conductance can span orders of magnitude, from gradual increments needed for analog elements, to large, abrupt changes for dynamically reconfigurable adaptive architectures. In this in&#8208;depth perspective, the history of ECRAM, the recent progress in devices spanning organic, inorganic, and 2D materials, circuits, architectures, the rich portfolio of challenging, fundamental questions, and how ECRAM can be harnessed to realize a new paradigm for low&#8208;power neuromorphic computing are discussed.

         <title>Energy and Space Efficient Parallel Adder Using Molecular Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The largest functional crossbars incorporating molecular materials to date are fabricated, in which all the memristors are consistent, robust, and reliable. An 8&#8208;bit serial and 4&#8208;bit parallel adders are experimentally demonstrated. For performance benchmarking, a 32&#8208;bit adder with 268&#160;million inputs is simulated that outperformed a multicore complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) platform.








Abstract
A breakthrough in in&#8208;memory computing technologies hinges on the development of appropriate material platforms that can overcome their existing limitations, such as larger than optimal footprint and multiple serial computational steps, with potential accumulation of errors. Using a molecular switching element with multiple non&#8208;monotonic and deterministic transitions, the device count and the number of computational steps can be substantially reduced. With molecular materials, however, the realization of a reliable and robust platform is&#160;an unattained goal for decades. Here, crossbar arrays with up to 64 molecular memristors are fabricated to experimentally demonstrate 8&#8208;bit serial and 4&#8208;bit parallel adders&#160;that operate for thousands of measurement cycles with an estimated error probability of 10&#8722;16. For performance benchmarking, a 32&#8208;bit parallel adder is designed and simulated with 268&#160;million inputs including contributions from the peripheral circuitry showing a 47&#215; higher energy efficiency, 93&#215; faster operation, and 9% of the footprint, leading to 4390 times improved energy&#8211;delay product compared to a special purpose complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;based multicore adder.

         <title>Mechanism and Impact of Bipolar Current Voltage Asymmetry in Computational Phase&#8208;Change Memory</title>

         <dc:description>
Nonvolatile memristive memory devices are emerging computational blocks for brain&#8208;inspired and in&#8208;memory computing. Using examples of phase&#8208;change memory, it is shown that there is a previously overlooked non&#8208;ideality of the bias&#8208;polarity&#8208;dependent current flow that can impact the numerical computational precision achievable for useful matrix&#8208;vector multiplication operations.








Abstract
Nanoscale resistive memory devices are being explored for neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing. However, non&#8208;ideal device characteristics of read noise and resistance drift pose significant challenges to the achievable computational precision. Here, it is shown that there is an additional non&#8208;ideality that can impact computational precision, namely the bias&#8208;polarity&#8208;dependent current flow. Using phase&#8208;change memory (PCM) as a model system, it is shown that this &#8220;current&#8211;voltage&#8221; non&#8208;ideality arises both from the material and geometrical properties of the devices. Further, we&#160;discuss the detrimental effects of such bipolar asymmetry on in&#8208;memory matrix&#8208;vector multiply (MVM) operations and provide a scheme to compensate for&#160;it.

         <title>Neuromorphic Photonic Memory Devices Using Ultrafast, Non&#8208;Volatile Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated photonic memory based on a novel phase&#8208;change material&#8212;namely, Sc0.2Sb2Te3 (SST)&#8212;showing distinct optical contrast between two stable phases, amorphous and crystalline states is reported. Using an optical pulse as fast as 2 ns, information can be written and erased in the photonic memory. This ultrafast photonic memory has enormous application potential in photonic computing and neuromorphic computing applications.








Abstract
The search for ultrafast photonic memory devices is inspired by the ever&#8208;increasing number of cloud&#8208;computing, supercomputing, and artificial&#8208;intelligence applications, together with the unique advantages of signal processing in the optical domain such as high speed, large bandwidth, and low energy consumption. By embracing silicon photonics with chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), non&#8208;volatile integrated photonic memory is developed with promising potential in photonic integrated circuits and nanophotonic applications. While conventional PCMs suffer from slow crystallization speed, scandium&#8208;doped antimony telluride (SST) has been recently developed for ultrafast phase&#8208;change random&#8208;access memory applications. An ultrafast non&#8208;volatile photonic memory based on an SST thin film with a 2 ns write/erase speed is demonstrated, which is the fastest write/erase speed ever reported in integrated phase&#8208;change photonic devices. SST&#8208;based photonic memories exhibit multilevel capabilities and good stability at room temperature. By mapping the memory level to the biological synapse weight, an artificial neural network based on photonic memory devices is successfully established for image classification. Additionally, a reflective nanodisplay application using SST with optoelectronic modulation capabilities is demonstrated. Both the optical and electrical changes in SST during the phase transition and the fast&#8208;switching speed demonstrate their potential for use in photonic computing, neuromorphic computing, nanophotonics, and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Many&#8208;Body Molecular Interactions in a Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By maneuvering the supramolecular dynamics in a molecular memristor, a wide variation of functionalities starting from diode and passing between nonvolatile and volatile, unipolar and bipolar memristors with sharp and gradual transitions within a single circuit element is captured. A mathematical design space evolves thereof that can enable almost all possible characteristic variations, desirable in neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
Electronic transitions in molecular&#8208;circuit elements hinge on complex interactions between molecules and ions, offering a multidimensional parameter space to embed, access, and optimize material functionalities for target&#8208;specific applications. This opportunity is not cultivated in molecular memristors because their low&#8208;temperature charge transport, which is a route to decipher molecular many&#8208;body interactions, is unexplored. To address this, robust, temperature&#8208;resilient molecular memristors based on a Ru complex of an azo aromatic ligand are designed, and current&#8211;voltage sweep measurements from room temperature down to 2 K with different cooling protocols are performed. By freezing out or activating different components of supramolecular dynamics, the local Coulombic interactions between the molecules and counterions that affect the electronic transport can be controlled. Operating conditions are designed where functionalities spanning bipolar, unipolar, nonvolatile, and volatile memristors with sharp as well as gradual analog transitions are captured within a single device. A mathematical design space evolves, thereof comprising 36 tuneable parameters in which all possible steady&#8208;state functional variations in a memristor characteristic can be attainable. This enables a deterministic design route to engineer neuromorphic devices with unprecedented control over the transformation characteristics governing their functional flexibility and tunability.

         <title>Diffusive Memristors with Uniform and Tunable Relaxation Time for Spike Generation in Event&#8208;Based Pattern Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusive memristors with highly uniform and widely tunable relaxation time are demonstrated. The dynamic relaxation behavior of such diffusive memristors is used as exponential decay kernels to implement the hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm for high&#8208;accuracy event&#8208;based pattern recognition.








Abstract
A diffusive memristor is a promising building block for brain&#8208;inspired computing hardware. However, the randomness in the device relaxation dynamics limits the wide&#8208;range adoption of diffusive memristors in large arrays. In this work, the device stack is engineered to achieve a much&#8208;improved uniformity in the relaxation time (standard deviation &#963; reduced from &#8776;12 to &#8776;0.32&#160;ms). The memristor is further connected with a resistor or a capacitor and the relaxation time is tuned between 1.13 &#181;s and 1.25&#160;ms, ranging from three orders of magnitude. The hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm, to utilize the tunable and uniform relaxation behavior for spike generation, is implemented. An accuracy of 77.3% is achieved in recognizing moving objects in the neuromorphic MNIST (N&#8208;MNIST) dataset. The work paves the way for building emerging neuromorphic computing hardware systems with ultralow power consumption.

         <title>One&#8208;Phototransistor&#8211;One&#8208;Memristor Array with High&#8208;Linearity Light&#8208;Tunable Weight for Optic Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;phototransistor&#8211;one&#8208;memristor array is proposed that works as an artificial optic neural network for image recognition. The device shows highly&#160;linear, light&#8208;tunable conductance weight during the online training process of the optic artificial neural network and yields a recognition accuracy of 99.33% after only ten training epochs, indicating the potential in highly efficient optic neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The recent advances in optic neuromorphic devices have led to a subsequent rise in use for construction of energy&#8208;efficient artificial&#8208;vision systems. The widespread use can be attributed to their ability to capture, store, and process visual information from the environment. The primary limitations of existing optic neuromorphic devices include nonlinear weight updates, cross&#8208;talk issues, and silicon process incompatibility. In this study, a highly&#160;linear, light&#8208;tunable, cross&#8208;talk&#8208;free, and silicon&#8208;compatible one&#8208;phototransistor&#8211;one&#8208;memristor (1PT1R) optic memristor is experimentally demonstrated for the implementation of an optic artificial neural network (OANN). For optic image recognition in the experiment, an OANN is constructed using a 16&#160;&#215;&#160;3 1PT1R memristor array, and it is trained on an online platform. The model yields an accuracy of 99.3% after only ten training epochs. The 1PT1R memristor, which shows good performance, demonstrates its ability as an excellent hardware solution for highly efficient optic neuromorphic and edge computing.

         <title>An Aqueous Analog MAC Machine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 16 &#215; 16 array of ionic transistors that electrochemically functions in aqueous quinone solution is reported. It executes analog multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations, a computing modality hotly pursued for low&#8208;power artificial neural networks. This demonstrates the use of ions in the aqueous milieu for analog computing is a step toward developing a more complex bioinspired information processing platforms.








Abstract
Using ions in aqueous milieu for signal processing, like in biological circuits, may potentially lead to a bioinspired information processing platform. Studies, however, have focused on individual ionic diodes and transistors rather than circuits comprising many such devices. Here a 16&#160;&#215;&#160;16 array of new ionic transistors is developed in an aqueous quinone solution. Each transistor features a concentric ring electrode pair with a disk electrode at the center. The electrochemistry of these electrodes in the solution provides the basis for the transistor operation. The ring pair electrochemically tunes the local electrolytic concentration to modulate the disk's Faradaic reaction rate. Thus, the disk current as a Faradaic reaction to the disk voltage is gated by the ring pair. The 16&#160;&#215;&#160;16 array of these transistors performs analog multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations, a computing modality hotly pursued for low&#8208;power artificial neural networks. This exploits the transistor's operating regime where the disk current is a multiplication of the disk voltage and a weight parameter tuned by the ring pair gating. Such disk currents from multiple transistors are summated in a global reference electrode to complete a MAC task. This ionic circuit demonstrating analog computing is a step toward sophisticated aqueous ionics.

         <title>Reservoir Computing with Charge&#8208;Trap Memory Based on a MoS2 Channel for Neuromorphic Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a&#160;charge&#8208;trap memory (CTM) based on MoS2 where the memory operation arises thanks to electron trapping/detrapping at interface states. The CTM device displays synaptic potentiation/depression induced by pulses applied to the gate or drain terminal with excellent linearity. The synaptic characteristics are used in a reservoir computing system for visual pattern recognition, which makes MoS2&#8208;based CT emerge as one of the most promising technologies&#160;for neuromorphic engineering.








Abstract
Novel memory devices are essential for developing low power, fast, and accurate in&#8208;memory computing and neuromorphic engineering concepts that can compete with the conventional complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (CMOS) digital processors. 2D semiconductors provide a novel platform for advanced semiconductors with atomic thickness, low&#8208;current operation, and capability of 3D integration. This work presents a charge&#8208;trap memory (CTM) device with a MoS2 channel where memory operation arises, thanks to electron trapping/detrapping at interface states. Transistor operation, memory characteristics, and synaptic potentiation/depression for neuromorphic applications are demonstrated. The CTM device shows outstanding linearity of the potentiation by applied drain pulses of equal amplitude. Finally, pattern recognition is demonstrated by reservoir computing where the input pattern is applied as a stimulation of the MoS2&#8208;based CTMs, while the output current after stimulation is processed by a feedforward readout network. The good accuracy, the low current operation, and the robustness to input random bit flip makes the CTM device a promising technology for future high&#8208;density neuromorphic computing concepts.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Thermal Characterization of Dynamical VO2 Memristors via Local Activity Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compact model connecting measurable material properties and device dimensions to circuit behavior of locally active memristors is presented, thus enabling rapid screening of neuromorphic materials for desired applications.








Abstract
Translating the surging interest in neuromorphic electronic components, such as those based on nonlinearities near Mott transitions, into large&#8208;scale commercial deployment faces steep challenges in the current lack of means to identify and design key material parameters. These issues are exemplified by the difficulties in connecting measurable material properties to device behavior via circuit element models. Here, the principle of local activity is used to build a model of VO2/SiN Mott threshold switches by sequentially accounting for constraints from a minimal set of quasistatic and dynamic electrical and high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution thermal data obtained via in situ thermoreflectance mapping. By combining independent data sets for devices with varying dimensions, the model is distilled to measurable material properties, and device scaling laws are established. The model can accurately predict electrical and thermal conductivities and capacitances and locally active dynamics (especially persistent spiking self&#8208;oscillations). The systematic procedure by which this model is developed has been a missing link in predictively connecting neuromorphic device behavior with their underlying material properties, and should enable rapid screening of material candidates before employing expensive manufacturing processes and testing procedures.

         <title>Memristive Field&#8208;Programmable Analog Arrays for Analog Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) is the analog counterpart of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). FPAA can be used to quickly prototyping analog circuit designs and greatly enhance analog computing development. A memristor based FPAA (memFPAA) has been demonstrated in this work with memristive devices and arrays serving as multiple core analog components, ranging from programmable analog resistors, routing networks, and analog vector&#8208;matrix multipliers.








Abstract
The increasing interests in analog computing nowadays call for multipurpose analog computing platforms with reconfigurability. The advancement of analog computing, enabled by novel electronic elements like memristors, has shown its potential to sustain the exponential growth of computing demand in the new era of analog data deluge. Here, a platform of a memristive field&#8208;programmable analog array (memFPAA) is experimentally demonstrated with memristive devices serving as a variety of core analog elements and CMOS components as peripheral circuits. The memFPAA is reconfigured to implement a first&#8208;order band pass filter, an audio equalizer, and an acoustic mixed frequency classifier, as application examples. The memFPAA, featured with programmable analog memristors, memristive routing networks, and memristive vector&#8208;matrix multipliers, opens opportunities for fast prototyping analog designs as well as efficient analog applications in signal processing and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Tunable Intervalence Charge Transfer in Ruthenium Prussian Blue Analog Enables Stable and Efficient Biocompatible Artificial Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyanide&#8208;linked ruthenium coordination framework undergoes a 10&#160;000&#8208;fold change in electronic conductivity in response to electrochemical charging or redox reaction with dopamine, enabling battery&#8208;transistor synaptic nonvolatile memory devices that switch via electrical impulses or dopamine reaction. (Electro)chemically tunable mixed valence states dictate the degree of electron delocalization.








Abstract
Emerging concepts for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and brain&#8208;computer interfacing inspire new research avenues aimed at understanding the relationship between oxidation state and conductivity in unexplored materials. This report expands the materials playground for neuromorphic devices to include a mixed valence inorganic 3D coordination framework, a ruthenium Prussian blue analog (RuPBA), for flexible and biocompatible artificial synapses that reversibly switch conductance by more than four orders of magnitude based on electrochemically tunable oxidation state. The electrochemically tunable degree of mixed valency and electronic coupling between N&#8208;coordinated Ru sites controls the carrier concentration and mobility, as supported by density functional theory computations and application of electron transfer theory to in situ spectroscopy of intervalence charge transfer. Retention of programmed states is improved by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to extensively studied organic polymers, thus reducing the frequency, complexity, and energy costs associated with error correction schemes. This report demonstrates dopamine&#8208;mediated plasticity of RuPBA synapses and biocompatibility of RuPBA with neuronal cells, evoking prospective application for brain&#8208;computer interfacing.

Retention of programmed states is improved by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to extensively studied organic polymers, thus reducing the frequency, complexity, and energy costs associated with error correction schemes. This report demonstrates dopamine-mediated plasticity of RuPBA synapses and biocompatibility of RuPBA with neuronal cells, evoking prospective application for brain-computer interfacing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Neuromorphic Computing
Programmable analog memories based on emerging materials enable neuromorphic circuits capable of growing like biological intelligent systems. In the near future, such neuromorphic circuits implemented with nonvolatile static memories are expected to be able to accelerate machine&#8208;learning algorithms with much improved energy efficiency and throughput over traditional digital systems. In the long run, these neuromorphic circuits implemented with dynamic memristors may eventually realize mortal computers.

Probabilistic Neuromorphic Computing
Unlike modern computers that are engineered to be fully deterministic, the brain leverages stochasticity at immense scales to achieve energy&#8208;efficient intelligence. In article number 2204569, Shashank Misra, James B. Aimone, and co&#8208;workers describe how the incorporation of materials and devices that exhibit stochastic behaviors into brain&#8208;inspired circuits can enable neuromorphic systems that natively perform probabilistic computations.

Designing artificial neurons and synapses with on demand properties is considered crucial for the development of new&#8208;type hardware for the future neuromorphic computing. This review discusses the common electrochemical fundamentals between biological and redox&#8208;based memristive cells and the ways to control and tune the device functionalities. Examples on recent achievements in the array implementation of these systems are provided.








Abstract
Artificial neurons and synapses are considered essential for the progress of the future brain&#8208;inspired computing, based on beyond von Neumann architectures. Here, a discussion on the common electrochemical fundamentals of biological and artificial cells is provided, focusing on their similarities with the redox&#8208;based memristive devices. The driving forces behind the functionalities and the ways to control them by an electrochemical&#8208;materials approach are presented. Factors such as the chemical symmetry of the electrodes, doping of the solid electrolyte, concentration gradients, and excess surface energy are discussed as essential to understand, predict, and design artificial neurons and synapses. A variety of two&#8208; and three&#8208;terminal memristive devices and memristive architectures are presented and their application for solving various problems is shown. The work provides an overview of the current understandings on the complex processes of neural signal generation and transmission in both biological and artificial cells and presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications, including signal transmission between biological and artificial cells. This example is showcasing the possibility for creating bioelectronic interfaces and integrating artificial circuits in biological systems. Prospectives and challenges of the modern technology toward low&#8208;power, high&#8208;information&#8208;density circuits are highlighted.

         <title>Complex Oxides for Brain&#8208;Inspired Computing: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computers inspired by the brain offer the exciting prospect of energy efficiency. Complex oxides can serve as building blocks for brain&#8208;inspired computing owing to their adaptive electronic structure and high sensitivity to environmental stimuli.








Abstract
The fields of brain&#8208;inspired computing, robotics, and, more broadly, artificial intelligence (AI) seek to implement knowledge gleaned from the natural world into human&#8208;designed electronics and machines. In this review, the opportunities presented by complex oxides, a class of electronic ceramic materials whose properties can be elegantly tuned by doping, electron interactions, and a variety of external stimuli near room temperature, are discussed. The review begins with a discussion of natural intelligence at the elementary level in the nervous system, followed by collective intelligence and learning at the animal colony level mediated by social interactions. An important aspect highlighted is the vast spatial and temporal scales involved in learning and memory. The focus then turns to collective phenomena, such as metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transitions (MITs), ferroelectricity, and related examples, to highlight recent demonstrations of artificial neurons, synapses, and circuits and their learning. First&#8208;principles theoretical treatments of the electronic structure, and in situ synchrotron spectroscopy of operating devices are then discussed. The implementation of the experimental characteristics into neural networks and algorithm design is then revewed. Finally, outstanding materials challenges that require a microscopic understanding of the physical mechanisms, which will be essential for advancing the frontiers of neuromorphic computing, are highlighted.

         <title>Compute in&#8208;Memory with Non&#8208;Volatile Elements for Neural Networks: A Review from a Co&#8208;Design Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep learning drives an increasing demand on compute resources. A key operation, matrix&#8208;vector&#8208;multiplication, can potentially be accelerated using cross&#8208;bar interconnects with nodal non&#8208;volatile memory. However, its application today is limited by the properties of the memory elements. Taking a co&#8208;design view, this review addresses the interdependencies of materials and architecture for such cross&#8208;bar hardware for training and inference.








Abstract
Deep learning has&#160;become ubiquitous, touching daily lives across the globe. Today, traditional computer architectures are stressed to their limits in efficiently executing the growing complexity of data and models. Compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM) can potentially play an important role in developing efficient hardware solutions that reduce data movement from compute&#8208;unit to memory, known as the von Neumann bottleneck. At its heart is a cross&#8208;bar architecture with nodal non&#8208;volatile&#8208;memory elements that performs an analog multiply&#8208;and&#8208;accumulate operation, enabling the matrix&#8208;vector&#8208;multiplications repeatedly used in all neural network workloads. The memory materials can significantly influence final system&#8208;level characteristics and chip performance, including speed, power, and classification accuracy. With an over&#8208;arching co&#8208;design viewpoint, this review assesses the use of cross&#8208;bar based CIM for neural networks, connecting the material properties and the associated design constraints and demands to application, architecture, and performance. Both digital and analog memory are considered, assessing the status for training and inference, and providing metrics for the collective set of properties non&#8208;volatile memory materials will need to demonstrate for a successful CIM technology.

         <title>Artificial Neuronal Devices Based on Emerging Materials: Neuronal Dynamics and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the latest research progress on artificial neuronal devices based on emerging volatile switching materials. The neuronal dynamics demonstrated in these devices, the hardware implementation of various artificial neural networks, and their potentials in computational and sensing applications are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Artificial neuronal devices are critical building blocks of neuromorphic computing systems and currently the subject of intense research motivated by application needs from new computing technology and more realistic brain emulation. Researchers have proposed a range of device concepts that can mimic neuronal dynamics and functions. Although the switching physics and device structures of these artificial neurons are largely different, their behaviors can be described by several neuron models in a more unified manner. In this paper, the reports of artificial neuronal devices based on emerging volatile switching materials are reviewed from the perspective of the demonstrated neuron models, with a focus on the neuronal functions implemented in these devices and the exploitation of these functions for computational and sensing applications. Furthermore, the neuroscience inspirations and engineering methods to enrich the neuronal dynamics that remain to be implemented in artificial neuronal devices and networks toward realizing the full functionalities of biological neurons are discussed.

The current state of thermal management of neuromorphic computing technology is described and the challenges and opportunities of energy efficient implementation of neuromorphic devices are addressed. The fundamental features of the brain's thermal regulation and their further physical implementation are discussed. It is believed that the underlined importance of thermal management of neuromorphic computing technology will guide researchers in this field.








Abstract
Machine learning has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, often referred to as an &#8220;artificial intelligence revolution.&#8221; Biological systems inspire the fundamental approach for this new computing paradigm: using neural networks to classify large amounts of data into sorting categories. Current machine&#8208;learning schemes implement simulated neurons and synapses on standard computers based on a von Neumann architecture. This approach is inefficient in energy consumption, and thermal management, motivating the search for hardware&#8208;based systems that imitate the brain. Here, the present state of thermal management of neuromorphic computing technology and the challenges and opportunities of the energy&#8208;efficient implementation of neuromorphic devices are considered. The main features of brain&#8208;inspired computing and quantum materials for implementing neuromorphic devices are briefly described, the brain criticality and resistive switching&#8208;based neuromorphic devices are discussed, the energy and electrical considerations for spiking&#8208;based computation are presented, the fundamental features of the brain's thermal regulation are addressed, the physical mechanisms for thermal management and thermoelectric control of materials and neuromorphic devices are analyzed, and challenges and new avenues for implementing energy&#8208;efficient computing are described.

         <title>Electrochemical Ionic Synapses: Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical ionic synapses (EISs) are programmable resistors whose conductivity is controlled deterministically by electrochemical charge insertion. Their repeatable conductance modulation and low energy consumption render them promising for enabling analog deep learning architectures with uncompromised accuracy and superior energy efficiency. Here, we&#160;present the progress on EIS devices in the field, a physical model to provide guidelines for targeted material properties, and strategies for further advancing these devices.








Abstract
Artificial neural networks based on crossbar arrays of analog programmable resistors can address the high energy challenge of conventional hardware in artificial intelligence applications. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art two&#8208;terminal resistive switching devices based on conductive filament formation suffer from high variability and poor controllability. Electrochemical ionic synapses are three&#8208;terminal devices that operate by electrochemical and dynamic insertion/extraction of ions that control the electronic conductivity of a channel in a single solid&#8208;solution phase. They are promising candidates for programmable resistors in crossbar arrays because they have shown uniform and deterministic control of electronic conductivity based on ion doping, with very low energy consumption. Here, the desirable specifications of these programmable resistors are presented. Then, an overview of the current progress of devices based on Li+, O2&#8722;, and H+ ions and material systems is provided. Achieving nanosecond speed, low operation voltage (&#8776;1&#160;V), low energy consumption, with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor compatibility all simultaneously remains a challenge. Toward this goal, a physical model of the device is constructed to provide guidelines for the desired material properties to overcome the remaining challenges. Finally, an outlook is provided, including strategies to advance materials toward the desirable properties and the future opportunities for electrochemical ionic synapses.

         <title>Optical Memory, Switching, and Neuromorphic Functionality in Metal Halide Perovskite Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically addressable neuromorphic devices and systems are proposed as alternatives for next&#8208;generation visual perception applications. This review covers recent progress toward memory and neuromorphic functionality in metal halide perovskite materials and devices where photons are used as a critical degree of freedom for switching, memory, and neuromorphic functionality.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite based materials have emerged over the past few decades as remarkable solution&#8208;processable optoelectronic materials with many intriguing properties and potential applications. These emerging materials have recently been considered for their promise in low&#8208;energy memory and information processing applications. In particular, their large optical cross&#8208;sections, high photoconductance contrast, large carrier&#8208;diffusion lengths, and mixed electronic/ionic transport mechanisms are attractive for enabling memory elements and neuromorphic devices that are written and/or read in the optical domain. Here, recent progress toward memory and neuromorphic functionality in metal halide perovskite materials and devices where photons are used as a critical degree of freedom for switching, memory, and neuromorphic functionality is reviewed.

         <title>From Ferroelectric Material Optimization to Neuromorphic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric materials combine a voltage driven switching mechanism with nonvolatility making them promising for nonvolatile devices. Here the material basics and the three different memory devices are described as a starting point for an in&#8208;depth discussion of the current status of implementing ferroelectric devices for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Due to the voltage driven switching at low voltages combined with nonvolatility of the achieved polarization state, ferroelectric materials have a unique potential for low power nonvolatile electronic devices. The competitivity of such devices is hindered by compatibility issues of well&#8208;known ferroelectrics with established semiconductor technology. The discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide changed this situation. The natural application of nonvolatile devices is as a memory cell. Nonvolatile memory devices also built the basis for other applications like in&#8208;memory or neuromorphic computing. Three different basic ferroelectric devices can be constructed: ferroelectric capacitors, ferroelectric field effect transistors and ferroelectric tunneling junctions. In this article first the material science of the ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide will be summarized with a special focus on tailoring the switching characteristics towards different applications.The current status of nonvolatile ferroelectric memories then lays the ground for looking into applications like in&#8208;memory computing. Finally, a special focus will be given to showcase how the basic building blocks of spiking neural networks, the neuron and the synapse, can be realized and how they can be combined to realize neuromorphic computing systems. A summary, comparison with other technologies like resistive switching devices and an outlook completes the paper.

         <title>Harnessing the Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition of VO2 in Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
VO2 manifests a remarkable metal&#8211;insulator transition that affords the nonlinear, dynamical response needed to emulate the function of biological neurons and synapses. Neuromorphic function is tunable through site&#8208;selective modification, stress, tuning of interfaces, and modification of external circuit elements. Strategies for modulating transformation characteristics are reviewed and inverse design approaches across decades of length and time scales are outlined.








Abstract
Future&#8208;generation neuromorphic computing seeks to overcome the limitations of von Neumann architectures by colocating logic and memory functions, thereby emulating the function of neurons and synapses in the human brain. Despite remarkable demonstrations of high&#8208;fidelity neuronal emulation, the predictive design of neuromorphic circuits starting from knowledge of material transformations remains challenging. VO2 is an attractive candidate since it manifests a near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature, discontinuous, and hysteretic metal&#8211;insulator transition. The transition provides a nonlinear dynamical response to input signals, as needed to construct neuronal circuit elements. Strategies for tuning the transformation characteristics of VO2 based on modification of material properties, interfacial structure, and field couplings, are discussed. Dynamical modulation of transformation characteristics through in situ processing is discussed as a means of imbuing synaptic function. Mechanistic understanding of site&#8208;selective modification; external, epitaxial, and chemical strain; defect dynamics; and interfacial field coupling in modifying local atomistic structure, the implications therein for electronic structure, and ultimately, the tuning of transformation characteristics, is emphasized. Opportunities are highlighted for inverse design and for using design principles related to thermodynamics and kinetics of electronic transitions learned from VO2 to inform the design of new Mott materials, as well as to go beyond energy&#8208;efficient computation to manifest intelligence.

         <title>Spotlight on Luminescence Thermometry: Basics, Challenges, and Cutting&#8208;Edge Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest emerging trends of luminescence (nano)thermometry are reviewed from a perspective that has not been considered so far. The theoretical framework covering ratiometric and lifetime&#8208;based luminescent thermometers, recommendable standardization practices, reliability, and reproducibility, as well as the advancing use of algorithms for thermal readout improvement are discussed. These backgrounds are complemented by cutting&#8208;edge applications, current challenges, and future directions.








Abstract
Luminescence (nano)thermometry is a remote sensing technique that relies on the temperature dependency of the luminescence features (e.g., bandshape, peak energy or intensity, and excited state lifetimes and risetimes) of a phosphor to measure temperature. This technique provides precise thermal readouts with superior spatial resolution in short acquisition times. Although luminescence thermometry is just starting to become a more mature subject, it exhibits enormous potential in several areas, e.g., optoelectronics, photonics, micro&#8208; and nanofluidics, and nanomedicine. This work reviews the latest trends in the field, including the establishment of a comprehensive theoretical background and standardized practices. The reliability, repeatability, and reproducibility of the technique are also discussed, along with the use of multiparametric analysis and artificial&#8208;intelligence algorithms to enhance thermal readouts. In addition, examples are provided to underscore the challenges that luminescence thermometry faces, alongside the need for a continuous search and design of new materials, experimental techniques, and analysis procedures to improve the competitiveness, accessibility, and popularity of the technology

         <title>Narrowband Organic Afterglow via Phosphorescence F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband organic afterglow materials are achieved via a phosphorescence F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer process by the combination of the long&#8208;lived phosphorescence donor and narrowband emission feature of the fluorescence acceptor. The resulting materials exhibit high color purity and multicolor narrowband afterglow, demonstrating potential in high&#8208;resolution afterglow displays and instant information identification.








Abstract
Achieving multicolor organic afterglow materials with narrowband emission and high color purity is important in various optoelectronic fields but remains a great challenge. Here, an efficient strategy is presented to obtain narrowband organic afterglow materials via F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from long&#8208;lived phosphorescence donors to narrowband fluorescence acceptors in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix. The resulting materials exhibit narrowband emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) as small as 23&#160;nm and the longest lifetime of 721.22&#160;ms. Meanwhile, by pairing the appropriate donors and acceptors, multicolor and high color purity afterglow ranging from green to red with the maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 67.1% are achieved. Moreover, given their long luminescence lifetime, high color purity, and flexibility, the potential applications are demonstrated in high&#8208;resolution afterglow displays and dynamic and quick information identification in low&#8208;light conditions. This work provides a facile approach for developing multicolor and narrowband afterglow materials as well as expands the features of organic afterglow.

         <title>Achieving Superior Tensile Performance in Individual Metal&#8722;Organic Framework Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystal tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework nanobelts are found to exhibit unprecedented mechanical properties beyond theoretical limits and the origins of these mechanical properties are revealed by simulations.








Abstract
Rapid advances in the engineering application prospects of metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) materials necessitate an urgent in&#8208;depth understanding of their mechanical properties. This work demonstrates unprecedented recoverable elastic deformation of Ni&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrins (Ni&#8208;TCPP) MOF nanobelts with a tensile strain as high as 14%, and a projected yield strength&#8208;to&#8208;Young's modulus ratio exceeding the theoretical limit (&#8776;10%) for crystalline materials. Based on first&#8208;principles simulations, the observed behavior of MOF crystal can be attributed to the mechanical deformation induced conformation transition and the formation of helical configuration of dislocations under high stresses, arising from their organic ligand building blocks in the crystal structures. The investigations of the mechanical properties along with electromechanical properties demonstrate that MOF materials have exciting application potential for biomechanics integrated systems, flexible electronics, and nanoelectromechanical devices.

         <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrolyte&#8208;Gated Transistor Immunosensor with Highly Selective Multiparametric Detection of Anti&#8208;Drug Antibodies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor immunosensor based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO&#8208;EGT) for the detection of anti&#8208;drug antibodies (ATIs) against the drug Infliximab is reported. The multiparametric analysis of the immunosensor response, with a theoretical limit of detection of 10 am, allows for the discrimination between ATIs and interfering agents.








Abstract
The advent of immunotherapies with biological drugs has revolutionized the treatment of cancers and auto&#8208;immune diseases. However, in some patients, the production of anti&#8208;drug antibodies (ADAs) hampers the drug efficacy. The concentration of ADAs is typically in the range of 1&#8211;10 pm; hence their immunodetection is challenging. ADAs toward Infliximab (IFX), a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other auto&#8208;immune diseases, are focussed. An ambipolar electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor (EGT) immunosensor is reported based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) channel and IFX bound to the gate electrode as the specific probe. The rGO&#8208;EGTs are easy to fabricate and exhibit low voltage operations (&#8804; 0.3&#160;V), a robust response within 15&#160;min, and ultra&#8208;high sensitivity (10 am limit of detection). A multiparametric analysis of the whole rGO&#8208;EGT transfer curves based on the type&#8208;I generalized extreme value distribution is proposed. It is demonstrated that it allows to selectively quantify ADAs also in the co&#8208;presence of its antagonist tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;), the natural circulating target of IFX.

         <title>Diatomite&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt&#8208;Doped MoS2/Carbon Composites to Boost Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diatomite&#8208;templated synthetic strategy to prepare SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C toward high&#8208;performance sodium storage is developed. Because of the hierarchical structure, high conductivity, and abundant active sites, SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity, high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. The sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200.








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrodes for energy conversion/storage because of the layered structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency. However, the integration of such two type materials and the relevant sodium storage applications remain daunting challenges. Here, an ingenious diatomite&#8208;templated synthetic strategy is designed to fabricate single&#8208;atom cobalt&#8208;doped MoS2/carbon (SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C) composites toward the high&#8208;performance sodium storage. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure, high electron/sodium&#8208;ion conductivity, and abundant active sites, the obtained SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity (&#8776;604.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. Particularly, the sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200. The internal sodium storage mechanism is clarified with the aid of density functional theory calculations and in situ experimental characterizations. This work not only represents a substantial leap in terms of synthesizing SACs on 2D TMDCs but also provides a crucial step toward the practical sodium&#8208;ion battery applications.

         <dc:description>
A facile and universal method for synthesizing nano&#8208;heterojunctions (NHJs) with well&#8208;controlled structure is reported. Dumbbell&#8208;shaped TeSe NHJs effectively facilitate radiotherapy by directly damaging tumor cells and shaping the tumor immuno&#8208;microenvironment, which endows&#160;combination treatment with great abscopal effects to combat distant tumor progression.








Abstract
Facilely synthesized nanoradiosensitizers with well&#8208;controlled structure and multifunctionality are greatly desired to address the challenges of cancer radiotherapy. In this work, a universal method is developed for synthesizing chalcogen&#8208;based TeSe nano&#8208;heterojunctions (NHJs) with rod&#8208;, spindle&#8208;, or dumbbell&#8208;like morphologies by engineering the surfactant and added selenite. Interestingly, dumbbell&#8208;shaped TeSe NHJs (TeSe NDs) as chaperone exhibit better radio&#8208;sensitizing activities than the other two nanostructural shapes. Meanwhile, TeSe NDs can serve as cytotoxic chemodrugs that degrade to highly toxic metabolites in acidic environment and deplete GSH within tumor to facilitate radiotherapy. More importantly, the combination of TeSe NDs with radiotherapy significantly decreases regulatory T cells and M2&#8208;phenotype tumor&#8208;associated macrophage infiltrations within tumors to reshape the immunosuppressive microenvironment and induce robust T lymphocytes&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, resulting in great abscopal effects on combating distant tumor progression. This study provides a universal method for preparing NHJ with well&#8208;controlled structure and developing nanoradiosensitizers to overcome the clinical challenges of cancer radiotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;A facile and universal method for synthesizing nano-heterojunctions (NHJs) with well-controlled structure is reported. Dumbbell-shaped TeSe NHJs effectively facilitate radiotherapy by directly damaging tumor cells and shaping the tumor immuno-microenvironment, which endows&#160;combination treatment with great abscopal effects to combat distant tumor progression.

         <title>Acid and Hypoxia Tandem&#8208;Activatable Deep Near&#8208;Infrared Nanoprobe for Two&#8208;Step Signal Amplification and Early Detection of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorescent nanoprobe comprised of oxygen&#8208;sensitive deep near&#8208;infrared (dNIR)&#8208;emitting phosphorescence cores and acid&#8208;cleavable polyethene glycol (PEG) shells, that is ultrasensitive to tumor acidity and hypoxia. This tandem&#8208;activatable probe design specifically amplifies tumor signals and enables early tumor detection, the signal in deep NIR region promoting contrast and resolution of hypoxia imaging as well.








Abstract
The early detection of cancers can significantly change outcomes even with existing treatments. However, ~50% of cancers still cannot be detected until they reach an advanced stage, highlighting the great challenges in the early detection. Here, an ultrasensitive deep near&#8208;infrared (dNIR) nanoprobe that is successively responsive to tumor acidity and hypoxia is reported. It is demonstrated that the new nanoprobe specifically detects tumor hypoxia microenvironment based on deep NIR imaging in ten different types of tumor models using cancer cell lines and patient&#8208;tissue derived xenograft tumors. By combining the acidity and hypoxia specific two&#8208;step signal amplification with a deep NIR detection, the reported nanoprobe enables the ultrasensitive visualization of hundreds of tumor cells or small tumors with a size of 260&#160;&#181;m in whole&#8208;body imaging or 115&#160;&#181;m metastatic lesions in lung imaging. As a result, it reveals that tumor hypoxia can occur as early as the lesions contain only several hundred cancer cells.

         <title>Biomimetic Spun Silk Ionotronic Fibers for Intelligent Discrimination of Motions and Tactile Stimuli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by liquid crystal spinning of animal silks, the highly stretchable, tough, and resilient spun silk ionotronic fibers are prepared by dry spinning with nematic silk microfibril dope solution. They are further incorporated into core&#8211;shell triboelectric nanogenerator fibers to sort and recognize objects made of different materials.








Abstract
Innovation in the ionotronics field has significantly accelerated the development of ultraflexible devices and machines. However, it is still challenging to develop efficient ionotronic&#8208;based fibers with necessary stretchability, resilience, and conductivity due to inherent conflict in producing spinning dopes with both high polymer and ion concentrations and low viscosities. Inspired by the liquid crystalline spinning of animal silk, this study circumvents the inherent tradeoff in other spinning methods by dry spinning a nematic silk microfibril dope solution. The liquid crystalline texture allows the spinning dope to flow through the spinneret and form free&#8208;standing fibers under minimal external forces. The resultant silk&#8208;sourced ionotronic fibers (SSIFs) are highly stretchable, tough, resilient, and fatigue&#8208;resistant. These mechanical advantages ensure a rapid and recoverable electromechanical response of SSIFs to kinematic deformations. Further, the incorporation of SSIFs into core&#8211;shell triboelectric nanogenerator fibers provides outstanding stable and sensitive triboelectric response to precisely and sensitively perceive small pressures. Moreover, by implementing a combination of machine learning and Internet of Things techniques, the SSIFs can sort objects made of different materials. With these structural, processing, performance, and functional merits, the SSIFs prepared herein are expected to be applied in human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Hydrogel Electrolyte for All&#8208;Flexible Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolytes are systematically explored, revealing the critical roles of the salt and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. The optimal hydrogel electrolytes endow the Zn metal anode with a superior cycling lifespan and demonstrate great potential in wearable electronics with all flexible features.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes are widely explored in Zn metal batteries for application in wearable electronics. While extensive studies have been conducted on optimizing the chemical structure and boosting the tensile elasticity, the mechanical stability of the hydrogel under repeated deformation is largely overlooked, leading to unsatisfactory performance at large cycling capacity. This work systematically analyzes the compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolyte, revealing the critical roles of the salt and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. It shows that, on the premise of homogeneous Zn deposition, an improved anti&#8208;fatigue property is essential to achieve high&#8208;capacity Zn metal anodes. The optimal Zn(ClO4)2&#8208;polyacrylamide/chitosan hydrogel electrolyte (C&#8208;PAMCS) exhibits an unprecedented lifespan of 1500&#160;h for Zn//Zn cells at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. The potential application of C&#8208;PAMCS is exemplified in all&#8208;flexible Zn&#8208;ion batteries enabled by a flexible current collector consisting of a Ag nanowires embedded elastomer. This study provides the rationale under hydrogel electrolyte engineering toward advanced Zn&#8208;ion battereis and the application in flexible devices.

         <title>A Smart DNA&#8208;Based Nanosystem Containing Ribosome&#8208;Regulating&#160;siRNA for Enhanced mRNA Transfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem with an siRNA&#8208;mediated regulation pathway that upregulates mRNA translation and enhances mRNA transfection is reported. The DNA&#8208;based nanosystem disassembles and releases siRNA and mRNA in response to intracellular stimuli and promotes ribosome biogenesis through intracellular glutathione depletion, which facilitates the mRNA delivery in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection is the prerequisite for the application of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics. In hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells, such as macrophages, the effective transfection of mRNA remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, a smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem is reported containing ribosome biogenesis&#8208;promoting siRNA, realizing efficient mRNA transfection in macrophages. Four monomers are copolymerized to form a nanoframework (NF), including N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) as the skeleton and acrydite&#8208;DNA as the initiator to trigger the cascade assembly of DNA hairpins (H1&#8208;polyT and H2&#8208;siRNA). By virtue of the phase transition characteristic of polymeric NIPAM, below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST, &#8776;34&#160;&#176;C), the NF swells to expose polyT sequences to hybridize with the polyA tail of mRNA. Above the LCST, the NF deswells to encapsulate mRNA. The disulfide bond in the NF responds to glutathione, triggering the disassembly of the nanosystem; the siRNA and mRNA are released in response to triphosadenine and RNase H. The siRNA down&#8208;regulates the expression of heat shock protein 27, which up&#8208;regulates the expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. The nanosystem shows satisfactory mRNA transfection and translation efficiency in a mouse model. It is envisioned that the DNA&#8208;based nanosystem will provide a promising carrier to deliver mRNA in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells and promote the development of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Epitaxial Growth of Two&#8208;dimensional Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals toward High&#8208;Performance Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anchored crystal&#8208;seed epitaxial growth method is developed to effectively suppress the multiple nucleation behavior of the molecules and enhance the 2D growth of organic crystals. In consequence, wafer&#8208;scale few&#8208;layer organic single crystals are successfully fabricated on the viscous liquid substrate. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on the crystal exhibit high device performance with excellent uniformity.








Abstract
The success of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronics and optoelectronics relies heavily on the capability to fabricate semiconductor single&#8208;crystal wafers. However, the conventional epitaxial growth strategy for inorganic wafers is invalid for growing organic semiconductor single crystals due to the lack of lattice&#8208;matched epitaxial substrates and intricate nucleation behaviors, severely impeding the advancement of organic single&#8208;crystal electronics. Here, an anchored crystal&#8208;seed epitaxial growth method for wafer&#8208;scale growth of 2D organic semiconductor single crystals is developed for the first time. The crystal seed is firmly anchored on the viscous liquid surface, ensuring the steady epitaxial growth of organic single crystals from the crystal seed. The atomically flat liquid surface effectively eliminates the disturbance from substrate defects and greatly enhances the 2D growth of organic crystals. Using this approach, a wafer&#8208;scale few&#8208;layer bis(triethylsilythynyl)&#8208;anthradithphene (Dif&#8208;TES&#8208;ADT) single crystal is formed, yielding a breakthrough for organic field&#8208;effect transistors with a high reliable mobility up to 8.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an ultralow mobility variable coefficient of 8.9%. This work opens a new avenue to fabricate organic single&#8208;crystal wafers for high&#8208;performance organic electronics.

         <title>Boosting the Performance of Organic Photodetectors with a Solution&#8208;Processed Integration Circuit toward Ubiquitous Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed integration circuit consisting of an organic field&#8208;effect transistor with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency, an organic photoconductor, and an organic resistor is proposed to dramatically boost the photoresponse signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, enabling the accurate extraction of physiological information from the photoplethysmographic waveforms, which can promote the development of ubiquitous health monitoring.








Abstract
Organic photodetectors, as an emerging wearable photoplethysmographic (PPG) technology, offer exciting opportunities for next&#8208;generation photonic healthcare electronics. However, the mutual restraints among photoresponse, structure complexity, and fabrication cost have intrinsically limited the development of organic photodetectors for ubiquitous health monitoring in daily activities. Here, an effective route to dramatically boost the performance of organic photodetectors with a solution&#8208;processed integration circuit for health monitoring application is reported. Through creating an ideal metal&#8211;semiconductor junction interface that minimizes the trap states within the device, solution&#8208;printed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are achieved with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency of 37.1 S A&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical thermionic limit. Consequently, monolithic integration of the OFET with an organic photoconductor enables the remarkable amplification of photoresponse signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by more than four orders of magnitude from 5.5 to 4.6 &#215; 105, which is able to meet the demand for accurately extracting physiological information from the PPG waveforms. This work offers an effective and versatile approach to greatly enhance the photodetector performance, promising to revolutionize health monitoring technologies.

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Encoding Hydrogels With DNA to Control Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the synthesis and photopatterning of hydrogels with multiple, discrete DNA domains, single&#8208;micron resolution spatial control is achieved over chemical composition and function. DNA's sequence specificity is used to reversibly tether DNA and direct protein attachment in patterned domains. Importantly, it is shown that reporter cells preferentially activate in regions of patterned hydrogels containing biomolecular signals.








Abstract
Patterning biomolecules in synthetic hydrogels offers routes to visualize and learn how spatially&#8208;encoded cues modulate cell behavior (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis). However, investigating the role of multiple, spatially defined biochemical cues within a single hydrogel matrix remains challenging because of the limited number of orthogonal bioconjugation reactions available for patterning. Herein, a method to pattern multiple oligonucleotide sequences in hydrogels using thiol&#8208;yne photochemistry is introduced. Rapid hydrogel photopatterning of hydrogels with micron resolution DNA features (&#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m) and control over DNA density are achieved over centimeter&#8208;scale areas using mask&#8208;free digital photolithography. Sequence&#8208;specific DNA interactions are then used to reversibly tether biomolecules to patterned regions, demonstrating chemical control over individual patterned domains. Last, localized cell signaling is shown using patterned protein&#8211;DNA conjugates to selectively activate cells on patterned areas. Overall, this work introduces a synthetic method to achieve multiplexed micron resolution patterns of biomolecules onto hydrogel scaffolds, providing a platform to study complex spatially&#8208;encoded cellular signaling environments.

         <title>Less&#8208;Suture Vascular Anastomosis: Development of Alternative Protocols with Multifunctional Self&#8208;Wrapping, Transparent, Adhesive, and Elastic Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adhesive, hemostatic, transparent, and elastic films are developed in this study to be used in &#8220;less&#8208;suture anastomosis&#8221; for blood vessels. It extensively decreases the number of sutures for vascular anastomosis and overall surgical time to a life&#8208;saving level in both normal and coagulopathy animal models.








Abstract
Blood vessel anastomosis by suture is a life&#8208;saving, yet time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive operation. While suture&#8208;less alternatives utilizing clips or related devices are developed to address these shortcomings, suture anastomosis is still overwhelmingly used in most cases. In this study, practical &#8220;less&#8208;suture&#8221; strategies are proposed, rather than ideal &#8220;suture&#8208;less&#8221; methods, to reflect real&#8208;world clinical situations. In the case of rat artery (d = 0.64&#160;mm) anastomosis, the less&#8208;suture anastomosis involves the application of thin, adhesive, transparent, and self&#8208;wrapping films to the site. This surprisingly reduces the number of stitches required from ten (without films) to four (with films), saving 27&#160;min of operating time per vessel. Furthermore, the decreased number of stitches largely alleviates fibrosis&#8208;mediated wall&#8208;thickening. Thus, a less&#8208;suture strategy is particularly useful for anastomosis of multiple vessels in emergency conditions and small&#8208;diameter vessels.

         <title>In Situ Activation of Snap&#8208;Through Instability in Multi&#8208;Response Metamaterials through Multistable Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contact&#8208;induced topological transformation is leveraged to introduce a highly versatile multistable metamaterial capable of switching its mechanical response post fabrication. The authors demonstrate how the in&#8208;situ activation and deactivation of snap&#8208;through instability enable to generate non&#8208;volatile mechanical logic operations and to reprogram energy dissipation.








Abstract
Snap&#8208;through instability has been widely leveraged in metamaterials to attain non&#8208;monotonic responses for a specific subset of applications where conventional monotonic materials fail to perform. In the remaining more plentiful set of ordinary applications, snap&#8208;through instability is harmful, and current snapping metamaterials become inadequate because their capacity to snap cannot be suppressed post&#8208;fabrication. Here, a class of topology&#8208;transformable metamaterials is introduced to enable in situ activation and deactivation of the snapping capacity, providing a remarkable level of versatility in switching between responses from monotonic to monostable and bistable snap&#8208;through. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments are combined to unveil the role played by contact in the topological transformation capable of increasing the geometry incompatibility and confinement stiffness of selected architectural members.

     alt="In Situ Activation of Snap-Through Instability in Multi-Response Metamaterials through Multistable Topological Transformation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact-induced topological transformation is leveraged to introduce a highly versatile multistable metamaterial capable of switching its mechanical response post fabrication. The authors demonstrate how the in-situ activation and deactivation of snap-through instability enable to generate non-volatile mechanical logic operations and to reprogram energy dissipation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snap-through instability has been widely leveraged in metamaterials to attain non-monotonic responses for a specific subset of applications where conventional monotonic materials fail to perform. In the remaining more plentiful set of ordinary applications, snap-through instability is harmful, and current snapping metamaterials become inadequate because their capacity to snap cannot be suppressed post-fabrication. Here, a class of topology-transformable metamaterials is introduced to enable in situ activation and deactivation of the snapping capacity, providing a remarkable level of versatility in switching between responses from monotonic to monostable and bistable snap-through. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments are combined to unveil the role played by contact in the topological transformation capable of increasing the geometry incompatibility and confinement stiffness of selected architectural members. The strategy here presented for post-fabrication reprogrammability of matter and on-the-fly response switching paves the way to multifunctionality for application in multiple sectors from mechanical logic gates, and adjustable energy dissipators, to in situ adaptable sport&#160;equipment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeted Reprogramming of Vitamin B3 Metabolism as a Nanotherapeutic Strategy towards Chemoresistant Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) maintain cancer stem cell stemness and promote immunosuppression, leading to chemoresistance and immune escape. Gemini&#8208;like nanoparticles are designed for two&#8208;pronged CAF reprogramming and cancer cell elimination. CAF&#8208;targeting nanoparticles transform CAFs into quiescent fibroblasts via a cascade of Vitamin B3 metabolic reprogramming and chromatin remodeling and thereby rehabilitate chemosensitivity and immune activation in chemoresistant breast, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote cancer stem cell (CSC)&#8208;mediated chemoresistance and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, direct depletion of CAFs may increase cancer invasiveness and metastasis. As a generalized strategy against chemoresistant cancers, Gemini&#8208;like homotypic targeting nanoparticles (NPs) are designed for two&#8208;pronged CAF transformation and cancer cell elimination. The CAF&#8208;targeted NPs couple vitamin B3 metabolic reprogramming to epigenetic modulation of secreted pro&#8208;stemness and immunosuppressive factors, thereby diminishing CSC and suppressive immune cell populations to enhance cancer cell drug susceptibility and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. In mouse models of breast, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers that are resistant to their respective first&#8208;line chemotherapeutics, a single dose of hydrogel co&#8208;delivering the Gemini&#8208;like NPs can rehabilitate chemosensitivity, induce immune activation, and achieve tumor regression. Moreover, it stimulates robust T cell memory for long&#8208;term protection against tumor rechallenge. This study thus represents an innovative approach with broad applicability for overcoming cancer chemoresistance.

         <title>Tailored Lattice Compressive Strain of Pt&#8208;Skins by the L12&#8208;Pt3M Intermetallic Core for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong confinement effect induced by modulated pores of a&#8208;NPC effectively ensures the ultrasmall size of Pt&#8208;based intermetallics and enhances the durability of the catalyst. The strain of Pt skins imposed by intermetallic cores is tailored to optimize the adsorption properties of the catalyst for intermediates of oxygen reduction reaction, resulting in highly effective and durable oxygen reduction.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and unsatisfactory durability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts are severely hindering the commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, the lattice compressive strain of Pt&#8208;skins imposed by Pt&#8208;based intermetallic cores is tailored for highly effective ORR through the confinement effect of the activated nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon (a&#8208;NPC). The modulated pores of a&#8208;NPC not only promote Pt&#8208;based intermetallics with ultrasmall size (average size of &lt;4&#160;nm), but also efficiently stabilizes intermetallic nanoparticles&#160;and sufficient exposure of active sites during the ORR process. The optimized catalyst (L12&#8208;Pt3Co@ML&#8208;Pt/NPC10) achieves excellent mass activity (1.72 A mgPt&#8722;1) and specific activity (3.49&#160;mA cmPt&#8722;2), which are 11&#8208; and 15&#8208;fold that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Besides, owing to the confinement effect of a&#8208;NPC and protection of Pt&#8208;skins, L12&#8208;Pt3Co@ML&#8208;Pt/NPC10 retains 98.1% mass activity after 30&#160;000 cycles, and even 95% for 100&#160;000 cycles, while Pt/C retains only 51.2% for 30&#160;000 cycles. Rationalized by density functional theory, compared with other metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, and Zn), L12&#8208;Pt3Co closer to the top of &#8220;volcano&#8221; induces a more suitable compressive strain and electronic structure on Pt&#8208;skin, leading to an optimal oxygen adsorption energy and a remarkable ORR performance.

         <title>Induction of Metabolic Reprogramming in Kidney by Singlet Diradical Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible nanoparticles are assembled from a diphenyl&#8208;substituted biolympicenylidene compound with a singlet diradical ground state. It is found that such nanoparticles can induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids by promoting fatty acid degradation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation under redox homeostasis with an increased level of glutathione.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic compounds with an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical ground state, namely singlet diradicals, have recently gained attention in the fields of organic electronics, photovoltaics, and spintronics owing to their unique electronic structures and properties. Notably, singlet diradicals exhibit tunable redox amphoterism, which makes them excellent redox&#8208;active materials for biomedical applications. However, the safety and therapeutic efficacy of singlet diradicals in biological systems have not yet been explored. Herein, the study presents a newly designed singlet diradical nanomaterial, diphenyl&#8208;substituted biolympicenylidene (BO&#8208;Ph), exhibiting low cytotoxicity in vitro, non&#8208;significant acute nephrotoxicity in vivo, and the ability to induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids. Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal that the metabolism of BO&#8208;Ph stimulates glutathione (GSH) synthesis and fatty acid degradation, increases the levels of intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and carnitine cycles, and eventually boosts oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) under redox homeostasis. Benefits of BO&#8208;Ph&#8208;induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids include enhancing cellular antioxidant capacity and promoting mitochondrial function. The results of this study can facilitate the application of singlet diradical materials in the treatment of clinical conditions induced by mitochondrial abnormalities in kidney.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Dielectric&#8208;Constant Atomic Layers of Amorphous Carbon Nitride Topologically Derived from MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are produced via topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. The resultant a&#8208;CN layers possess a low density of 0.55 g cm&#8722;3 and a high sp3 C level of 35.7%. As a result, a very low dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz is achieved for the 310&#8208;nm&#8208;thickness a&#8208;CN film with a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant materials such as silicon dioxide serving as interconnect insulators in current integrated circuit face a great challenge due to their relatively high dielectric constant of &#8776;4, twice that of the recommended value by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, causing severe parasitic capacitance and associated response delay. Here, novel atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are prepared via a topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. Remarkably, the assembled a&#8208;CN film exhibits an ultralow dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz, much lower than the previously reported dielectric materials such as amorphous carbon (2.2) and fluorinated&#8208;doped SiO2 (3.6), ascribed to the low density of 0.55&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and high sp3 C level of 35.7%. Moreover, the a&#8208;CN film has a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV&#160;cm&#8722;1, showing great potential in integrated circuit application.

&lt;/i&gt; C level of 35.7%. Moreover, the a-CN film has a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, showing great potential in integrated circuit application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unique Chirality Selection in Neural Cells for D&#8208;Matrix Enabling Specific Manipulation of Cell Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The D&#8208;matrix chirality enhances cell density, viability, proliferation, and survival of neural cells by attenuating the interaction between cytoskeleton proteins and matrixes, subsequently activating JNK and p38/MAPK signaling pathways, while the proliferation and adhesion of non&#8208;neural cells are promoted on the L&#8208;matrix, which provides a specific method to universally manipulate neural cell behaviors with chiral biomaterial systems.








Abstract
Manipulating neural cell behaviors is a critical issue to various therapies for neurological diseases and damages, where matrix chirality has long been overlooked despite the proven adhesion and proliferation improvement of multiple non&#8208;neural cells by L&#8208;matrixes. Here, it is reported that the D&#8208;matrix chirality specifically enhances cell density, viability, proliferation, and survival in four different types of neural cells, contrasting its inhibition in non&#8208;neural cells. This universal impact on neural cells is defined as &#8220;chirality selection for D&#8208;matrix&#8221; and is achieved through the activation of JNK and p38/MAPK signaling pathways by the cellular tension relaxation resulting from the weak interaction between D&#8208;matrix and cytoskeleton proteins, particularly actin. Also, D&#8208;matrix promotes sciatic nerve repair effectively, both with or without non&#8208;neural stem cell implantation, by improving the population, function, and myelination of autologous Schwann cells. D&#8208;matrix chirality, as a simple, safe, and effective microenvironment cue to specifically and universally manipulate neural cell behaviors, holds extensive application potential in addressing neurological issues such as nerve regeneration, neurodegenerative disease treatment, neural tumor targeting, and neurodevelopment.

         <title>A Recyclable Standalone Microporous Layer with Interpenetrating Network for Sustainable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotubes interpenetrating network is employed to prepare a standalone microporous layer (standalone MPL) with high strength and gas permeability. The high&#8208;performance standalone MPL can greatly extend the service lifetime of gas diffusion layers and reduce the costs of recovering catalyst coated membranes. Therefore, the standalone MPL is promising to significantly improve the sustainability of fuel cells.








Abstract
The commercialization of fuel cells inevitably brings recycling problems. Therefore, achieving high recyclability of fuel cells is particularly important for their sustainable development. In this work, a recyclable standalone microporous layer (standalone MPL) with interpenetrating network that can significantly enhance the recyclability and sustainability of fuel cells is prepared. The interpenetrating network enables the standalone MPL to have high strength (17.7&#160;MPa), gas permeability (1.55&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;13&#160;m2), and fuel&#8208;cell performance (peak power density 1.35&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2), providing the basic guarantee for its application in high&#8208;performance and highly recyclable fuel cells. Additionally, the standalone MPL is highly adaptable to various gas&#8208;diffusion backings (GDBs), providing high possibility to select highly recyclable GDBs. Outstandingly, anode standalone MPLs and GDBs can be easily detached from the spent membrane electrode assembly (MEA). This not only saves &gt;90 vol% solvent in the recovery of the catalyst&#8208;coated membrane (CCM), but also extends the service life of the GDBs and the anode standalone MPL at least 138 times (2 760 000&#160;h assuming 20 000&#160;h of CCM) comparing to CCM. Therefore, the standalone MPL significantly enhances the recyclability and sustainability of fuel cells and is promising to be an indispensable component in the next&#8208;generation fuel cells.

         <title>Fabrication of Single&#8208;Crystalline CoCrFeNi Thin Films by DC Magnetron Sputtering: A Route to Surface Studies of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The epitaxial growth of the high&#8208;entropy alloy CoCrFeNi on MgO(100) by DC magnetron sputtering is demonstrated. The surface reconstruction and electronic band structure of the CoCrFeNi(100) surface is investigated by low&#8208;energy electron diffraction and angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, demonstrating the potential of epitaxial films for fundamental studies of low&#8208;index HEA surfaces.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with their almost limitless number of possible compositions have raised widespread attention in material science. Next to wear and corrosion resistive coatings, their application as tunable electrocatalysts has recently moved into the focus. On the other hand, fundamental properties of HEA surfaces like atomic and electronic structure, surface segregation and diffusion as well as adsorption on HEA surfaces are barely explored. The lack of research is caused by the limited availability of single&#8208;crystalline samples. In the present work, the epitaxial growth of face centered cubic (fcc) CoCrFeNi films on MgO(100) is reported. Their characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrates that the layers with a homogeneous and close to equimolar elemental composition are oriented in [100] direction and aligned with the substrate to which they form an abrupt interface. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low&#8208;energy electron diffraction (LEED), and angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy are employed to study chemical composition and atomic and electronic structure of CoCrFeNi(100). It is demonstrated that epitaxially grown HEA films have the potential to fill the sample gap, allowing for fundamental studies of properties of and processes on well&#8208;defined HEA surfaces over the full compositional&#160;space.

         <title>Flowthrough Capture of Microplastics through Polyphenol&#8208;Mediated Interfacial Interactions on Wood Sawdust</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, highly efficient, and bio&#8208;based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) are developed based on wood sawdust support for the removal of nano&#8208;/microplastics from water. Due to the unique advantage of phenolic&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;molecular interactions, bioCap is capable of capturing a broad spectrum of nano&#8208;/microplastics with various types (six types), surface charges (anionic, cationic, and neutral), and shapes (spherical and irregular).








Abstract
Nano&#8208;/microplastics accumulate in aquatic bodies and raise increasing threats to ecosystems and human health. The limitation of existing water cleanup strategies, especially in the context of nano&#8208;/microplastics, primarily arises from their complexity (morphological, compositional, and dimensional). Here, highly efficient and bio&#8208;based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) are reported to remove a broad spectrum of nano&#8208;/microplastics from water: polyethylene terephthalate (anionic, irregular shape), polyethylene (net neutral, irregular shape), polystyrene (anionic and cationic, spherical shape), and other anionic and spherical shaped particles (polymethyl methacrylate, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride). Highly efficient bioCap systems that adsorb the ubiquitous particles released from beverage bags are demonstrated. As evidence of removal from drinking water, the in vivo biodistribution of nano&#8208;/microplastics is profiled, confirming a significant reduction of particle accumulation in main organs. The unique advantage of phenolic&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;molecular interactions is employed in sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and facile strategies based on wood sawdust support for the removal of challenging nano&#8208;/microplastics pollutions.

         <title>Printable High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable FAPbBr3 Perovskite Solar Cells for Multifunctional Building&#8208;Integrated Photovoltaics</title>

         <dc:description>
An in situ intermediate phase transition&#8208;controlled blade&#8208;coating method for FAPbBr3 perovskite solar cells is introduced, which obtains a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.86% based on hole transport layer&#8208;free structures of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Semitransparent devices are fabricated and obtain high PCE of 8.61% at average visible light transmittance (AVT) =&#160;45% and PCE of 5.55% at AVT&#160;=&#160;53% for small devices and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules, respectively.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show great promise for next&#8208;generation building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications because of their abundance of raw materials, adjustable transparency, and cost&#8208;effective printable processing. Owing to the complex perovskite nucleation and growth control, the fabrication of large&#8208;area perovskite films for high&#8208;performance printed PSCs is still under active investigation. Herein, the study proposes an intermediate&#8208;phase&#8208;transition&#8208;assisted one&#8208;step blade coating for an intrinsic transparent formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) perovskite film. The intermediate complex optimizes the crystal growth path of FAPbBr3, resulting in a large&#8208;area, homogeneous, and dense absorber film. A champion efficiency of 10.86% with high open&#8208;circuit voltage up to 1.57&#160;V is obtained with a simplified device architecture of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency after aging at 75&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h in ambient air, and 96% after maximum power point tracking for 500&#160;h. The printed semitransparent PSCs, with average visible light transmittance over 45%, demonstrate high efficiencies for both small devices (8.6%) and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules (5.55%). Finally, the ability to customize the color, transparency, and thermal insulation properties of FAPbBr3 PSCs makes them high prospects as multifunctional BIPVs.

         <title>Efficient Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with Highly Specific and Durable Targeted Ta2C Modified with Chondroitin Sulfate (TACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
TACS keeps stable in gastrointestinal tract and targets the inflammatory lesions efficiently and accurately. TACS has specific CT imaging for IBD and alleviates the five major pathological features of IBD including alleviating oxidative stress, inhibiting apoptosis, anti&#8208;inflammation, restoring barrier function, and modulating the gut microbiome.








Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive localization of lesions and specific targeted therapy are still the main challenges for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ta, as a medical metal element, has been widely used in the treatment of different diseases because of its excellent physicochemical properties but is still far from being explored in IBD. Here, Ta2C modified with chondroitin sulfate (CS) (TACS) is evaluated as a highly targeted therapy nanomedicine for IBD. Specifically, TACS is modified with dual targeting CS functions due to IBD lesion&#8208;specific positive charges and high expression of CD44 receptors. Thanks to the acid stability, sensitive CT imaging function, and strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination ability, oral TACS can accurately locate and delineate IBD lesions through non&#8208;invasive CT imaging, and specifically targeted treat IBD effectively because high levels of ROS are a central factor in the progression of IBD. As expected, TACS has much better imaging and therapeutic effects than clinical CT contrast agent and first&#8208;line drug 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid, respectively. The mechanism of TACS treatment mainly involves protection of mitochondria, elimination of oxidative stress, inhibiting macrophage M1 polarization, protection of intestinal barrier, and restoration of intestinal flora balance. Collectively, this work provides unprecedented opportunities for oral nanomedicines to targeted therapy of IBD.

         <title>Surface Electronic Structure Engineering of Manganese Bismuth Tellurides Guided by Micro&#8208;Focused Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoemission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dramatic modifications of the surface electronic structures of the magnetic topological insulator compounds MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 are directly visualized using micro&#8208;focused angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. A general method to achieve a minimal dispersion with topological bands close to the Fermi energy is demonstrated across the compounds.








Abstract
Modification of the electronic structure of quantum matter by ad atom deposition allows for directed fundamental design of electronic and magnetic properties. This concept is utilized in the present study in order to tune the surface electronic structure of magnetic topological insulators based on MnBi2Te4. The topological bands of these systems are typically strongly electron&#8208;doped and hybridized with a manifold of surface states that place the salient topological states out of reach of electron transport and practical applications. In this study, micro&#8208;focused angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) provides direct access to the termination&#8208;dependent dispersion of MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 during in situ deposition of rubidium atoms. The resulting band structure changes are found to be highly complex, encompassing coverage&#8208;dependent ambipolar doping effects, removal of surface state hybridization, and the collapse of a surface state band gap. In addition, doping&#8208;dependent band bending is found to give rise to tunable quantum well states. This wide range of observed electronic structure modifications can provide new ways to exploit the topological states and the rich surface electronic structures of manganese bismuth&#160;tellurides.

A single&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte is developed by confining the anions between two ring&#8208;shaped cyclodextrins to allow Zn2+ transfer along the outside of the rings. It delivers a large Zn2+ transference number of 0.923 and exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.2% after 3500 cycles in flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries at 5 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with high capacity and long cycle stability are essential for wearable electronic devices. Hydrogel electrolytes have been developed to provide ion&#8208;transfer channels while maintaining the integrity of ZIBs under mechanical strain. However, hydrogel matrices are typically swollen with aqueous salt solutions to increase ionic conductivity, which can hinder intimate contact with electrodes and reduce mechanical properties. To address this, a single&#8208;Zn&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (SIHE) is developed by integrating polyacrylamide network and pseudo&#8208;polyrotaxane structure. The SIHE exhibits a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.923 and a high ionic conductivity of 22.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Symmetric batteries with SIHE demonstrate stable Zn plating/stripping performance for over 160 h, with a homogenous and smooth Zn deposition layer. Full cells with La&#8208;V2O5 cathodes exhibit a high capacity of 439 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and excellent capacity retention of 90.2% after 3500 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, the flexible ZIBs display stable electrochemical performance under harsh conditions, such as bending, cutting, puncturing, and soaking. This work provides a simple design strategy for single&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolytes, which could pave the way for long&#8208;life aqueous batteries.

Bright deep&#8208;red fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) with an ultra&#8208;narrow FWHM of 21 nm and a high quantum yield of 52% are prepared by readily available green plants. High color&#8208;purity deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these CDs are demonstrated for the first time with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307) by using an exciplex host.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (DR&#8208;LEDs, &gt;660&#160;nm) with high color&#8208;purity and narrow&#8208;bandwidth emission are promising for full&#8208;color displays and solid&#8208;state lighting applications. Currently, the DR&#8208;LEDs are mainly based on conventional emitters such as organic materials and heavy&#8208;metal based quantum dots (QDs) and perovskites. However, the organic materials always suffer from the complicated synthesis, inferior color purity with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) more than&#8201;40&#8201;nm, and the QDs and perovskites still suffer from serious problems related to toxicity. Herein, this work reports the synthesis of efficient and high color&#8208;purity deep&#8208;red carbon dots (CDs) with a record narrow FWHM of 21&#160;nm and a high quantum yield of more than 50% from readily available green plants. Moreover, an exciplex host is further established using a polymer and small molecular blend, which has been shown to be an efficient strategy for producing high color&#8208;purity monochrome emission from deep&#8208;red CDs via F&#246;rster energy transfer (FET). The deep&#8208;red CD&#8208;LEDs display high color&#8208;purity with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307). To the best of the knowledge, this is the first report of high color&#8208;purity CD&#8208;LEDs in the deep&#8208;red region, opening the door for the application of CDs in the development of high&#8208;resolution light&#8208;emitting display technologies.

         <title>Ultralow Tip&#8208;Force Driven Sizable&#8208;Area Domain Manipulation through Transverse Flexoelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to activate the transverse flexoelectricity with a widely influenced range through the flexural suspended films. Sizable&#8208;area (2500 times larger than the tip&#8208;surface contact area) domain switching is successfully realized in hundreds of nanometer&#8208;thick (up to 550 nm) van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6, driving by a single&#8208;point ultralow tip&#8208;force with the surface intact.








Abstract
Deterministic control of ferroelectric domain is critical in the ferroelectric functional electronics. Ferroelectric polarization can be manipulated mechanically with a nano&#8208;tip through flexoelectricity. However, it usually occurs in a very localized area in ultrathin films, with possible permanent surface damage caused by a large tip&#8208;force. Here it is demonstrated that the deliberate engineering of transverse flexoelectricity offers a powerful tool for improving the mechanical domain switching. Sizable&#8208;area domain switching under an ultralow tip&#8208;force can be realized in suspended van der Waals ferroelectrics with the surface intact, due to the enhanced transverse flexoelectric field. The film thickness range for domain switching in suspended ferroelectrics is significantly improved by an order of magnitude to hundreds of nanometers, being far beyond the limited range of the substrate&#8208;supported ones. The experimental results and phase&#8208;field simulations further reveal the crucial role of the transverse flexoelectricity in the domain manipulation. This large&#8208;scale mechanical manipulation of ferroelectric domain provides opportunities for the flexoelectricity&#8208;based domain controls in emerging low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectrics and related devices.

         <title>Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Nanoparticles by a Step&#8208;Alloying Strategy as a Superior Multifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step&#8208;alloying strategy is developed to prepare a series of high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticle (HEA&#8208;NP) systems that contain many strongly immiscible element pairs, including Bi&#8211;W with the highest &#916;Hmix of 45&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1. This strategy further expands the spectrum of possible metal alloys, which is significant for the broad compositional space and future data&#8208;driven material discovery.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticles (HEA&#8208;NPs) have attracted great attention because of their unique complex compositions and tailorable properties. Further expanding the compositional space is of great significance for enriching the material library. Here, a step&#8208;alloying strategy is developed to synthesis HEA&#8208;NPs containing a range of strongly repellent elements (e.g., Bi&#8211;W) by using the rich&#8208;Pt cores formed during the first liquid phase reaction as the seed of the second thermal diffusion. Remarkably, the representative HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) with up to 14 elements exhibits extremely excellent multifunctional electrocatalytic performance for pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Briefly, HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) only requires the ultralow overpotentials of 11 and 18&#160;mV to deliver 10&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits ultralong durability for 400 and 264&#160;h under 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4 and 1&#160;m KOH, respectively, which surpasses most advanced pH&#8208;universal HER catalysts. Moreover, HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) also exhibits an impressive peak current density of 12.6&#8201;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt in 1&#160;m KOH&#160;+&#160;1&#160;m MeOH and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#160;V (vs RHE.) in 0.1&#160;m KOH. The work further expands the spectrum of possible metal alloys, which is important for the broad compositional space and future data&#8208;driven material discovery.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Intercalation Dominated Ferromagnetism of van der Waals Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe intercalation on the interstitial sites in high Curie temperature (Tc) Fe3GeTe2 may be responsible for the local antiferromagnetic coupling that gives rise to the exchange bias effect, and that the interlayer exchange paths greatly contribute to the enhancement of Tc.








Abstract
Fe3GeTe2 have proven to be of greatly intrigue. However, the underlying mechanism behind the varying Curie temperature (Tc) values remains a puzzle. This study explores the atomic structure of Fe3GeTe2 crystals exhibiting Tc values of 160, 210, and 230 K. The elemental mapping reveals a Fe&#8208;intercalation on the interstitial sites within the van der Waals gap of the high&#8208;Tc (210 and 230 K) samples, which are observed to have an exchange bias effect by electrical transport measurements, while Fe intercalation or the bias effect is absent in the low&#8208;Tc (160 K) samples. First&#8208;principles calculations further suggest that the Fe&#8208;intercalation layer may be responsible for the local antiferromagnetic coupling that gives rise to the exchange bias effect, and that the interlayer exchange paths greatly contribute to the enhancement of Tc. This discovery of the Fe&#8208;intercalation layer elucidates the mechanism behind the hidden antiferromagnetic ordering that underlies the enhancement of Tc in Fe3GeTe2.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Based on Knitting Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators are additively manufactured from LCE fibers by knitting technology. The obtained knitted LCE actuators with diverse 3D geometry can be rationally designed and perform programmed deformability. The knitted LCE actuators can be fully recycled, and its functionality can be further extended by threading and stitching. This study introduces a new avenue for the fabrication of LCE actuators.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) exhibits large and reversible deformability originating from the alignment of liquid crystal mesogens. Additive manufacturing provides high controllability in the alignment and shaping process of LCE actuators. However, it still remains a challenge to customize LCE actuators with both diverse 3D deformability and recyclability. In this study, a new strategy is developed to exploit knitting technique to additively manufacture LCE actuators. The obtained LCE actuators are fabric&#8208;structured with designed geometry and deformability. By accurately adjusting the parameters of the knitting patterns as modules, diverse geometry is pixel&#8208;wise designed, and complex 3D deformations including bending, twisting, and folding are quantitatively controlled. In addition, the fabric&#8208;structured LCE actuators can be threaded, stitched, and reknitted to achieve advanced geometry, integrated multi&#8208;functions and efficient recyclability. This approach allows the fabrication of versatile LCE actuators with potential applications in smart textiles and soft robots.

         <title>Toughening CO2&#8208;Derived Copolymer Elastomers Through Ionomer Networking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation and properties of CO2&#8208;derived block polymer thermoplastic elastomers and ionomers, with Na(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II) and Al(III) (&lt;1&#160;wt% metal), are reported. The materials show wide operating temperatures, &gt;50&#8208;fold higher Young's modulus and 21&#8208;times greater tensile strength than unfunctionalized materials, high elastic recovery, and creep&#8208;resistance, and are recyclable.








Abstract
Utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) to make polycarbonates through the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of CO2 and epoxides valorizes and recycles CO2 and reduces pollution in polymer manufacturing. Recent developments in catalysis provide access to polycarbonates with well&#8208;defined structures and allow for copolymerization with biomass&#8208;derived monomers; however, the resulting material properties are underinvestigated. Here, new types of CO2&#8208;derived thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are described together with a generally applicable method to augment tensile mechanical strength and Young's modulus without requiring material re&#8208;design. These TPEs combine high glass transition temperature (Tg) amorphous blocks comprising CO2&#8208;derived poly(carbonates) (A&#8208;block), with low Tg poly(&#949;&#8208;decalactone), from castor oil, (B&#8208;block) in ABA structures. The poly(carbonate) blocks are selectively functionalized with metal&#8208;carboxylates where the metals are Na(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II) and Al(III). The colorless polymers, featuring &lt;1&#160;wt% metal, show tunable thermal (Tg), and mechanical (elongation at break, elasticity, creep&#8208;resistance) properties. The best elastomers show &gt;50&#8208;fold higher Young's modulus and 21&#8208;times greater tensile strength, without compromise to elastic recovery, compared with the starting block polymers. They have wide operating temperatures (&#8722;20 to 200&#160;&#176;C), high creep&#8208;resistance and yet remain recyclable. In the future, these materials may substitute high&#8208;volume petrochemical elastomers and be utilized in high&#8208;growth fields like medicine, robotics, and electronics.

         <title>Interfacial Passivation Enormously Enhances Electroluminescence of Triphenylphosphine Cu4I4 Cube</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes based on mono&#8208;dentate ligands with high luminance and efficiencies are realized through a non&#8208;doped bilayer structure of [TPP]4Cu4I4|TmPyPB, in which pyridine&#8208;capped TmPyPB effectively passivates surface defects of [TPP]4Cu4I4 layer to prevent interfacial charge trapping and suppressing exciton nonradiation, resulting in &#8776;200 and 23 folds increased luminance and external quantum efficiency, respectively.








Abstract
Defect is one of the key factors limiting optoelectronic performances of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid systems. Although high&#8208;efficiency bidentate ligands based electroluminescent (EL) clusters reported, until present, only few EL clusters based on monodentate ligands are realized since their structural instability induces more surface/interface defects. Herein, this bottleneck is first overcome in virtue of interfacial passivation by electron transporting layers (ETL). Through using TmPyPB with meta&#8208;linked pyridines as ETL, photoluminescent (PL) and EL quantum efficiencies of the simplest monophosphine Cu4I4 cube [TPP]4Cu4I4 are greatly improved by &#8776;2 and 23 folds, respectively, as well as &#8776;200 folds increased luminance, corresponding to a huge leap from nearly unlighted (&lt;20 nits) to highly bright (&gt;3000 nits). The passivation effect of TmPyPB on surface defects of cluster layer is embodied as preventing interfacial charge trapping and suppressing exciton nonradiation.

         <title>4D Visualization of a Nonthermal Coherent Magnon in a Laser Heated Lattice by an X&#8208;ray Free Electron Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond time&#8208;resolved resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment using an X&#8208;ray free electron laser visualizes a light&#8208;induced coherent magnon in a multiferroic. The magnon trajectory in time and 3D space unveils the photomagnetic coupling largely enhanced by above&#8208;bandgap photoexcitation, distinguished from a laser&#8208;heated magnetic behavior. This energy&#8208;efficient photoexcitation process suggests the potential for a novel photomagnetic control of ferroelectricity in multiferroics.








Abstract
Ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic phenomena is an exciting achievement of mankind, expanding one's horizon of knowledge toward the functional nonequilibrium states. The dynamics acting on an extremely short timescale push the detection limits that reveal fascinating light&#8211;matter interactions for nonthermal creation of effective magnetic fields. While some cases are benchmarked by emergent transient behaviors, otherwise identifying the nonthermal effects remains challenging. Here, a femtosecond time&#8208;resolved resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment is introduced, which uses an X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser (XFEL) to distinguish between the effective field and the photoinduced thermal effect. It is observed that a multiferroic Y&#8208;type hexaferrite exhibits magnetic Bragg peak intensity oscillations manifesting entangled antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) Fourier components of a coherent AFM magnon. The magnon trajectory constructed in 3D space and time domains is decisive to evince ultrafast field formation preceding the lattice thermalization. A remarkable impact of photoexcitation across the electronic bandgap is directly unraveled, amplifying the photomagnetic coupling that is one of the highest among AFM dielectrics. Leveraging the above&#8208;bandgap photoexcitation, this energy&#8208;efficient optical process further suggests a novel photomagnetic control of ferroelectricity in multiferroics.

Robust and air&#8208;stable molecular tunnel junctions with a sub&#8208;5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based thin film as the tunneling barrier are accessible, which anchors to the electrode surface via a Au&#63743;C bond and shows promising applications in molecular electronics and plasmonics.








Abstract
In miniaturized electronic and optoelectronic circuits, molecular tunnel junctions have attracted enormous research interest due to their small footprint, low power consumption, and rich molecular functions. However, the most popular building blocks used in contemporary molecular tunnel junctions are thiol molecules, which attach to electrode surfaces via a metal&#8208;thiolate (M&#63743;S) bond, showing low stability and usually quick degradation within several days. To pave the way for more widely applicable and stable molecular tunnel junctions, there is a need to develop new molecular anchoring groups. Here, this work&#160;demonstrates robust and air&#8208;stable molecular tunnel junctions with a sub&#8208;5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based thin film as the tunneling barrier, which anchors to the electrode surface via a Au&#63743;C bond. The bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular tunnel junctions exhibit high thermal stability against heating up to 200 &#176;C and long storage lifetime over 5 months in an ambient environment. Both electrical and optical performance of these bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular junctions are&#160;characterized systematically, showing similar behaviors to thiol&#8208;based junctions as well as largely improved emission stability. This research highlights the excellent performance of bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular tunnel junctions, which could&#160;be useful for applications in molecular electronics and plasmonics.

         <title>Crystallinity and Phase Control in Formamidinium&#8208;Based Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D Perovskite via Seed&#8208;Induced Growth for Efficient Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a seed&#8208;induced growth approach employing MAPbCl3 and BDAPbI4 in the deposition of FA&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskite films. This method yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films as the seeds serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA&#8208;based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &#948; phaseand mitigating random phases. As a result, the optimized device delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%.








Abstract
2D perovskites based on Formamidinium (FA) hold the potential for excellent stability and a broad absorption range, making them attractive materials for solar cells. However, FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites produced via one&#8208;step processing exhibit poor crystallinity and random quasi&#8208;quantum wells (QWs), leading to subpar photovoltaic performance. In this study, a seed&#8208;induced growth approach is introduced employing MAPbCl3 and BDAPbI4 in the deposition of FA&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskite films. This method yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films as the seeds preferentially precipitate and serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA&#8208;based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &#948; phase. Moreover, the epitaxial growth facilitated by uniformly dispersed seeds results in simultaneous crystallization from top to bottom, efficiently mitigating random phases (n = 2, 3, 4&#8230;) induced by the diffusion of organic cations and, in turn, minimizing energy loss. The impact of seed&#8208;induced growth on the crystallization and phase distribution of FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites is systematically investigated. As a result, the optimized FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cell delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%, accompanied by a remarkable fill factor of 0.823. Additionally, the unencapsulated device demonstrates exceptional stability, maintaining 98% of its initial efficiency after 1344 h of storage.

         <title>Planar Spin Glass with Topologically&#160;Protected Mazes in the Liquid Crystal Targeting for Reconfigurable Micro Security Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deterministic and non&#8208;deterministic properties of a topologically&#160;protected maze in the&#160;chiral liquid crystal (LC) resulting from microscopic order and macroscopic disorder accomplish a security system that serves as advanced artificial fingerprints. This system enables facile authentication through deep&#8208;learning technology and can reconstruct information through the phase transition of LCs.








Abstract
The planar spin glass pattern is widely known for its inherent randomness, resulting from the geometrical frustration. As such, developing physical unclonable functions (PUFs)&#8212;which operate with device randomness&#8212;with planar spin glass patterns is a promising candidate for an advanced security systems in the upcoming digitalized society. Despite their inherent randomness, traditional magnetic spin glass patterns pose considerable obstacles in detection, making it challenging to achieve authentication in security systems. This necessitates the development of facilely observable mimetic patterns with similar randomness to overcome these challenges. Here, a straightforward approach is introduced using a topologically&#160;protected maze pattern in the chiral liquid crystals (LCs). This maze exhibits a comparable level of randomness to magnetic spin glass and can be reliably identified through the combination of optical microscopy with machine learning&#8208;based object detection techniques. The &#8220;information&#8221; embedded in the maze can be reconstructed through thermal phase transitions of the LCs in tens of seconds. Furthermore, incorporating various elements can enhance the optical PUF, resulting in a multi&#8208;factor security medium. It is expected that this security medium, based on microscopically controlled and macroscopically uncontrolled topologically&#160;protected structures, may be utilized as a next&#8208;generation security system.

         <title>A Personalized Cancer Vaccine that Induces Synergistic Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autologous extracellular nanovesicle vaccine derived from alpha&#8208;galactosylceramide&#8208;conjugated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells directly activates both innate immune cells and AML&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells without having to define tumor antigens. It induces strong antitumor immune memory and synergizes with chemotherapy to prevent relapse in hosts with AML. Thus, it can be developed as a platform for personalized vaccines in humans.








Abstract
To demonstrate potent efficacy, a cancer vaccine needs to activate both innate and adaptive immune cells. Personalized cancer vaccine strategies often require the identification of patient&#8208;specific neoantigens; however, the clonal and mutational heterogeneity of cancer cells presents inherent challenges. Here, extracellular nanovesicles derived from alpha&#8208;galactosylceramide&#8208;conjugated autologous acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC) are presented as a personalized therapeutic vaccine that activates both innate and adaptive immune responses, bypassing the need to identify patient&#8208;specific neoantigens. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination directly engages with and activates both invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and leukemia&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in mice with AML, thereby promoting long&#8208;term anti&#8208;leukemic immune memory. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC sufficiently serves as an antigen&#8208;presenting platform that can directly activate antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells even in the absence of dendritic cells, thereby demonstrating a multifaceted cellular mechanism of immune activation. Moreover, ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination results in a significantly lower AML burden and higher percentage of leukemia&#8208;free survivors among cytarabine&#8208;treated hosts with AML. Human AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs activate iNKT cells in both healthy individuals and patients with AML regardless of responsiveness to conventional therapies. Together, autologous AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs may be a promising personalized therapeutic vaccine that efficiently establishes AML&#8208;specific long&#8208;term immunity without requiring the identification of neoantigens.

Photo&#8208; and thermostable anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are designed using a photopatternable conjugated polymer with thermal&#8208;annealing&#8208;promoted interchain stacking. To prepare anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, the polymer is irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, and thermally annealed under a photonic stamp. This strategy generates a highly secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with dual patterns, which is stable to sunlight and heat over 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Photoresponsive polymers can be conveniently used to fabricate anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials through photopatterning. However, an unsolved problem is that ambient light and heat can damage anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns on photoresponsive polymers. Herein, photo&#8208; and thermostable anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are developed by photopatterning and thermal annealing of a photoresponsive conjugated polymer (MC&#8208;Azo). MC&#8208;Azo contains alternating azobenzene and fluorene units in the polymer backbone. To prepare an anti&#8208;counterfeiting material, an MC&#8208;Azo film is irradiated with polarized blue light through a photomask, and then thermally annealed under the pressure of a photonic stamp. This strategy generates a highly secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with dual patterns, which is stable to sunlight and heat over 200&#160;&#176;C. A key for the stability is that thermal annealing promotes interchain stacking, which converts photoresponsive MC&#8208;Azo to a photostable material. Another key for the stability is that the conjugated structure endows MC&#8208;Azo with desirable thermal properties. This study shows that the design of photopatternable conjugated polymers with thermal&#8208;annealing&#8208;promoted interchain stacking provides a new strategy for the development of highly stable and secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Bandgap Engineering in Nanoribbons of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective bandgap modulation of water&#8208;adsorbed zigzag&#8208;oriented hexagonal boron nitride nanoribbons (zBNNRs) is reported. A water layer adsorbed at the edges creates a huge transverse potential and then greatly reduces its bandgap. The conductance of &#8776;8 nm&#8208;wide zBNNRs with adsorbates of water can be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via electrical field modulation at room temperature.








Abstract
Different from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheets, the bandgap of hBN nanoribbons (BNNRs) can be changed by spatial/electrostatic confinement. It is predicted that a transverse electric field can narrow the bandgap and even cause an insulator&#8211;metal transition in BNNRs. However, experimentally introducing an overhigh electric field across the BNNR remains challenging. Here, it is&#160;theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that water adsorption greatly reduces the bandgap of zigzag&#8208;oriented BNNRs (zBNNRs). Ab initio calculations show that water molecules can be favorably assembled within the trench between two adjacent BNNRs to form a polar ice layer, which induces a transverse equivalent electric field of over 2&#160;V&#160;nm&#8722;1 accounting for the bandgap reduction. Field&#8208;effect transistors are&#160;successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of water&#8208;adsorbed zBNNRs can&#160;be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via modulation of the equivalent electrical field at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements are&#160;taken to determine the optical bandgaps of zBNNRs with water adsorption. The zBNNR with increased width can exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17&#160;eV. This study offers fundamental insights into new routes toward realizing electronic/optoelectronic devices and circuits based on hexagonal boron nitride.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Derived Bismuth with I&#8722; and Cs+ Dual Modification for High&#8208;Efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Electrosynthesis and Al&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>

Hexagonal Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanocrystals are prepared via a hot&#8208;injection method, and under cathodic potentials, are converted to Bi nanocrystals with the dual modification of I&#8722; and Cs+ on surface. The resultant catalyst exhibits great performances for CO2 reduction reaction to formate in both the H&#8208;cell and flow cell, and when used as the cathode catalyst for Al&#8208;CO2 batteries, enable simultaneous CO2 valorization and power generation.








Abstract
Bi&#8208;based materials are one of the most promising candidates for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate; however, the majority of them still suffer from low current density and stability that essentially constrain their potential applications at the industrial scale. Surface modification represents an effective approach to modulate the electrode microenvironment and the relative binding strength of key intermediates. Herein, it is&#160;demonstrated that the surface comodification with halides and alkali metal ions from the conversion of Bi&#8208;based halide perovskite nanocrystals is a viable strategy to boost the CO2RR performance of Bi for formate electrosynthesis. Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals are prepared by a hot&#8208;injection method. The as&#8208;prepared products feature well&#8208;defined hexagonal shape and uniform size distribution. When used as the precatalyst, Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals are converted to Cs+ and I&#8722; comodified Bi. The resultant catalyst exhibits high formate Faradaic efficiency close to 100%, and remarkable partial current density up to 44&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in an H&#8208;cell and up to 276&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Moreover, Cs3Bi2I9 is used as the cathode catalyst and paired with an Al anode in an Al&#8208;CO2 battery for simultaneous CO2 valorization and power generation.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Phase&#8208;Transition Entropy into Electrochemical Thermopower and the Peltier Effect</title>

A thermoresponsive polymer having a redox&#8208;active moiety, poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;acrylamide ethyl)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;n&#8208;propylviologen) (PNV), is applied to the electrolyte of thermocell and electrochemical Peltier effect. By undergoing a coil&#8211;globule phase transition, the polymer exhibits a significant entropy change, resulting in a drastic increase in the Seebeck coefficient (Se) of the thermocell.








Abstract
A thermocell generates thermopower from a temperature difference (&#916;T) between two electrodes. The converse process of thermocells is an electrochemical Peltier effect, which creates a &#916;T on the electrodes by applying an external current. The Seebeck coefficient (Se) of the electrochemical system is proportional to the entropy change of the redox reaction; therefore, a redox system having a significant entropy change is expected to increase the Se. In this study, a thermoresponsive polymer having a redox&#8208;active moiety, poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;acrylamide ethyl)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;n&#8208;propylviologen) (PNV), is used as the redox species of a thermocell. PNV2+ dication undergoes the coil&#8211;globule phase transition upon the reduction to PNV+ cation radical, and a large entropy change is introduced because water molecules are freed from the polymer chains. The Se of PNV thermocell drastically increased to +2.1&#160;mV K&#8722;1 at the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNV. The entropy change calculated from the increment of Se agrees with the value evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, the electrochemical Peltier effect is observed when the device temperature is increased above the LCST. This study shows that the large entropy change associated with the coil&#8211;globule phase transition can be used in electrochemical thermal management and refrigeration technologies.

         <title>Biofilm Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembly Nanoreactors for All&#8208;Stage Biofilm Associated Infection through Bacterial Cuproptosis&#8208;like Death and Macrophage Re&#8208;Rousing</title>

Biofilm microenvironment responsive self&#8208;assembly copper&#8208;doped polyoxometalate nanoreactors are proposed for all&#8208;stage biofilm&#8208;associated infections through bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death and macrophage re&#8208;rousing.








Abstract
Bacterial biofilm&#8208;associated infections (BAIs) are the leading cause of prosthetic implant failure. The dense biofilm structure prevents antibiotic penetration, while the highly acidic and H2O2&#8208;rich biofilm microenvironment (BME) dampens the immunological response of antimicrobial macrophages. Conventional treatments that fail to consistently suppress escaping planktonic bacteria from biofilm result in refractory recolonization, allowing BAIs to persist. Herein, a BME&#8208;responsive copper&#8208;doped polyoxometalate clusters (Cu&#8208;POM) combination with mild photothermal therapy (PTT) and macrophage immune re&#8208;rousing for BAI eradication at all stages is proposed. The self&#8208;assembly of Cu&#8208;POM in BME converts endogenous H2O2 to toxic &#183;OH through chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and generates a mild PTT effect to induce bacterial metabolic exuberance, resulting in loosening the membrane structure of the bacteria, enhancing copper transporter activity and increasing intracellular Cu&#8208;POM flux. Metabolomics reveals that intracellular Cu&#8208;POM overload restricts the TCA cycle and peroxide accumulation, promoting bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death. CDT re&#8208;rousing macrophages scavenge planktonic bacteria escaping biofilm disintegration through enhanced chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Overall, BME&#8208;responsive Cu&#8208;POM promotes bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death via metabolic interference, while also re&#8208;rousing macrophage immune response for further planktonic bacteria elimination, resulting in all&#8208;stage BAI clearance and providing a new reference for future clinical application.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Negative Resistance Switching of Conductive Fibers with Adjustable Sensitivity for Wearable Healthcare Monitoring Systems with Near&#8208;Zero Standby Power</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A negatively responsive switch&#8208;type (NRS) fiber strain&#8208;sensor with an extremely high negative gauge factor that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. This NRS fiber strain&#8208;sensor can be used to implement an ultralow&#8208;power healthcare monitoring system that transmits biological signals by only operating with an abnormally functioning body or when strain is applied.








Abstract
Recently, one of the primary concerns in e&#8208;textile&#8208;based healthcare monitoring systems for chronic illness patients has been reducing wasted power consumption, as the system should be always&#8208;on to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics. However, the general conductive fibers, a major component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive gauge&#8208;factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, a twisted conductive&#8208;fiber&#8208;based negatively responsive switch&#8208;type (NRS) strain&#8208;sensor with an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio &#8776; 3.9&#160;&#215; 108) that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the fiber through selective ultraviolet&#8208;irradiation treatment. Owing to this technology, the NRS strain&#8208;sensors can allow for effective regulation of the mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior durability for over 5000 stretching cycles. For further practical demonstrations, three healthcare monitoring systems (E&#8208;fitness pants, smart&#8208;masks, and posture correction T&#8208;shirts) with near&#8208;zero standby power are also developed, which opens up advancements in electronic textiles by expanding the utilization range of fiber strain&#8208;sensors.

         <title>A Programmable Actuator as Synthetic Earthworm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;responsive actuator with notable deformation, rapid response, and heavy workload is prepared via a swelling&#8208;photopolymerizing method. Its bending deformation under humidity change can be programmed to mimic the burrowing activities of earthworms, opening a new avenue to expand stimuli&#8208;responsive and degradable polymer materials in the areas associated with agricultural considerations.








Abstract
Natural earthworm with the ability to loosen soils that favors sustainable agriculture has inspired worldwide interest in the design of intelligent actuators. Given the inability to carry heavy loads and uncontrolled deformation, the vast majority of actuators can only perform simple tasks by bending, contraction, or elongation. Herein, a degradable actuator with the ability to deform in desired ways is presented, which successfully mimics the burrowing activities of earthworms to loosen soils with increased soil porosity by digging, grabbing, and lifting the soil when it receives rains. Such a scarifying actuator is made of degradable cellulose acetate and uncrosslinked polyacrylamide via the swelling&#8208;photopolymerizing method. The water absorption of polyacrylamide in moisture conditions causes rapid and remarkable bending. Such mechanical bending can be controlled in specific areas of the cellulose acetate film if polyacrylamide is polymerized in a patterned way, so as to generate complicated deformations of the whole cellulose acetate. Patterning polyacrylamide within cellulose acetate is achieved based on reversible surface protection by means of pen writing, rather than the traditional masking techniques. The water&#8208;induced deformation of programmable cellulose&#8208;based actuators is well preserved in soil, which is appropriate for promoting rain diffusion as well as root breath.

         <title>Photocontrollable Elongation Actuation of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Films with Well&#8208;Defined Crease Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocontrollable elongation actuation with large strain can be achieved in flexible polydomain liquid crystal elastomers by programing the crease structures in a well&#8208;defined order to couple the weak actuation forces generated in the creases.








Abstract
Although liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have demonstrated various applications in artificial muscles and soft robotics, their inherent flexibility and orientation&#8208;dependent forces limit their functions. For instance, LCEs can sustain a high actuation force when they contract but cannot elongate to drive loads with large displacements. In this study, it is demonstrated that photocontrollable elongation actuation with a large strain can be achieved in polydomain LCEs by programming the crease structures in a well&#8208;defined order to couple the actuation forces. Efficient photoactuation without overheating&#8208;induced damage to the materials is favored, based on the well&#8208;designed photosensitive molecular switch crosslinker via the synergy of photochemical and photothermal effects. The LCE actuator can jack up heavy loads, elongate freely, and contract back to manipulate distant objects. Theoretical analysis based on a finite element simulation of the deformation energy during the actuation process reveals a trade&#8208;off between the abilities of jacking&#8208;up and withstanding load. More importantly, this study simplifies the design of a single material with functions inherent only in other soft robotic devices based on the assembly of multiple&#160;modules, thus providing a design strategy for surpassing instinctive properties of conventional soft materials to expand the functions of soft robotics.

         <title>Shaping Synthetic Multicellular and Complex Multimaterial Tissues via Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing of Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of extrusion&#8208;based and volumetric bioprinting, with microgels as platform materials, provides the possibility to create complex structures on a cm3&#8208;scale in a fast and accurate manner. By leveraging the versatility of this platform, it is possible to introduce multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cellular features in user defined&#8208;architectures.








Abstract
In living tissues, cells express their functions following complex signals from their surrounding microenvironment. Capturing both hierarchical architectures at the micro&#8208; and macroscale, and anisotropic cell patterning remains a major challenge in bioprinting, and a bottleneck toward creating physiologically&#8208;relevant models. Addressing this limitation, a novel technique is introduced, termed Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing (EmVP), converging extrusion&#8208;bioprinting and layer&#8208;less, ultra&#8208;fast volumetric bioprinting, allowing spatially pattern multiple inks/cell types. Light&#8208;responsive microgels are developed for the first time as bioresins (&#181;Resins) for light&#8208;based volumetric bioprinting, providing a microporous environment permissive for cell homing and self&#8208;organization.

&lt;p&gt;The convergence of extrusion-based and volumetric bioprinting, with microgels as platform materials, provides the possibility to create complex structures on a cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-scale in a fast and accurate manner. By leveraging the versatility of this platform, it is possible to introduce multi-material and multi-cellular features in user defined-architectures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In living tissues, cells express their functions following complex signals from their surrounding microenvironment. Capturing both hierarchical architectures at the micro- and macroscale, and anisotropic cell patterning remains a major challenge in bioprinting, and a bottleneck toward creating physiologically-relevant models. Addressing this limitation, a novel technique is introduced, termed Embedded Extrusion-Volumetric Printing (EmVP), converging extrusion-bioprinting and layer-less, ultra-fast volumetric bioprinting, allowing spatially pattern multiple inks/cell types. Light-responsive microgels are developed for the first time as bioresins (&#181;Resins) for light-based volumetric bioprinting, providing a microporous environment permissive for cell homing and self-organization. Tuning the mechanical and optical properties of gelatin-based microparticles enables their use as support bath for suspended extrusion printing, in which features containing high cell densities can be easily introduced. &#181;Resins can be sculpted within seconds with tomographic light projections into centimeter-scale, granular hydrogel-based, convoluted constructs. Interstitial microvoids enhanced differentiation of multiple stem/progenitor cells (vascular, mesenchymal, neural), otherwise not possible with conventional bulk hydrogels. As proof-of-concept, EmVP is applied to create complex synthetic biology-inspired intercellular communication models, where adipocyte differentiation is regulated by optogenetic-engineered pancreatic cells.

         <title>Enabling Highly Efficient and Thermal&#8208;Stable Polymer Solar Cells through Semi&#8208;Alloy Acceptors Composed of a Hinge&#8208;Like Dimer: A Versatile Doping Protocol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hinge&#8208;like dimer acceptor DT19 is designed and synthesized as a special third component. This dimer&#8208;doping ternary strategy exhibits excellent generality in synergistically improving device efficiency and thermal stability of relevant host systems.








Abstract
The simultaneous improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and thermal stability is a critical scientific challenge in advancing the commercial applications of polymer solar cells. To address this challenge, a dumbbell&#8208;shaped dimeric acceptor, DT19, is successfully designed and synthesized. It is incorporated as a third component into the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9 system. This ternary strategy demonstrates a synergistic enhancement of the PCE and thermal stability of the host binary system. In particular, the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9:DT19 system maintains a PCE of over 90% even after heating at 120&#160;&#176;C for 200&#160;h. Additionally, the dimer&#8208;doping ternary strategy exhibits excellent generality for the other four Y&#8208;series systems and outperforms ternary systems containing alloy&#8208;like acceptors in terms of thermal stability. It is because DT19, with its hinge&#8208;like structure, can form a semi&#8208;alloy acceptor with the host acceptor, leading to strong interchain entanglement with the polymer donor, thus overcoming phase separation and excessive aggregation under thermal stress. This new type of dimeric material, which can synergistically enhance the device efficiency and thermal stability of active layers, presents promising application prospects.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Kinetics on Perovskite Oxides via Oxygen Vacancies for Low&#8208;Temperature and Knittable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction kinetics of a perovskite oxide is significantly promoted by a facile metal&#8211;vacancy strategy. The newly developed vacancy&#8208;rich porous perovskite nanofibers exhibit comparable activities to the commercial Pt/C and even surpass it under low temperature. The developed catalyst can drive knittable fibrous&#8208;type and sandwich&#8208;type zinc&#8211;air batteries under low temperature of &#8722;40 &#176;C with impressive performance.








Abstract
High kinetics oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts under low temperature are critical and highly desired for temperature&#8208;tolerant energy conversion and storage devices, but remain insufficiently investigated. Herein, oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich porous perovskite oxide (CaMnO3) nanofibers coated with reduced graphene oxide coating (V&#8208;CMO/rGO) are developed as the air electrode catalyst for low&#8208;temperature and knittable Zn&#8211;air batteries. V&#8208;CMO/rGO exhibits top&#8208;level ORR activity among perovskite oxides and shows impressive kinetics under low temperature. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the synergistic effect between metal atoms and oxygen vacancies, as well as the accelerated kinetics and enhanced electric conductivity and mass transfer over the rGO coated nanofiber 3D network contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity. The desorption of ORR intermediate is promoted by the regulated electron filling. The V&#8208;CMO/rGO drives knittable and flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries under a low temperature of &#8722;40 &#176;C with high peak power density of 56 mW cm&#8722;2 and long cycle life of over 80 h. This study provides insight of kinetically active catalyst and facilitates the ZABs application in harsh environment.

         <title>Modulating Zinc Metal Reversibility by Confined Antifluctuator Film for Durable and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the designed Zn anode antifluctuator that well integrates conductivity, buffering, mechanical strength, and anti&#8208;corrosion characteristics, the symmetric and full cell both deliver super&#8208;high cycling performance and enable the realization of the integration with electrochemical neuromorphic inorganic device as artificial neural networks, and the integrated device achieves excellent linearity and handwritten digit recognition rate.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn ion batteries are promising systems due to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and non&#8208;toxicity, and the Zn corrosion and dendrite growth will cause the poor reversibility of Zn anode. Herein, the porous Zn@C solid, hollow, and yolk&#8211;shell microsphere films are developed as Zn anode antifluctuator (ZAAF). The prepared yolk&#8211;shell microspheres (Zn@C yolk&#8211;shell microsphere [ZCYSM]) film with superior buffering can effectively restrict the deposition of Zn metal in its interior and inhibit the volume expansion during plating/stripping process, thus modulating the Zn2+ flux and enabling stable Zn cycling. As a proof of concept, the ZCYSM@Zn symmetric cells achieve the excellent cyclic stability over 4000&#160;h and cumulative plated capacity of 4&#160;Ah cm&#8722;2&#160;at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Concomitantly, the suppressed corrosion reactions and dendrite&#8208;free ZAAF significantly improve the durability of full cells (coupled to CaV6O16&#183;3H2O). Additionally, durable pouch cell and electrochemical neuromorphic inorganic device (ENIDe) are integrated to simulate neural network, providing a strategy for extreme interconnectivity comparable to the human brain.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Anionic Structure Activated Co&#63743;S Bonds Promote Oxygen Electrocatalytic Activity for High&#8208;Efficiency Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the bifunctional performance of hetero&#8208;anionic structure for oxygen electrocatalysis, CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts are constructed and afford excellent catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The superior performance of the CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts is attributed to the unique S modulation of the main body electronic structure, Co&#63743;S bond provides fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.








Abstract
The electronic structure of transition metal complexes can be modulated by replacing partial ion of complexes to obtain tuned intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity. However, the anion&#8208;modulated transition metal complexes ORR activity of is still unsatisfactory, and the construction of hetero&#8208;anionic structure remains challenging. Herein, an atomic doping strategy is presented to prepare the CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 (CCSO/NC&#8208;2) as electrocatalysts, the structrual characterization results favorably demonstrate the partial substitution of S atoms for O in CCSO/NC&#8208;2, which shows excellent catalytic performance and durability for OER and ORR in 0.1&#160;m KOH. In addition, the catalyst assembled Zinc&#8211;air battery with an open circuit potential of 1.43&#160;V maintains performance after 300&#160;h of cyclic stability. Theoretical calculations and differential charges illustrate that S doping optimizes the reaction kinetics and promotes electron redistribution. The superior performance of CCSO/NC&#8208;2 catalysis is mainly due to its unique S modulation of the electronic structure of the main body. The introduction of S promotes Co&#63743;O covalency and constructs a fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.

However, the anion-modulated transition metal complexes ORR activity of is still unsatisfactory, and the construction of hetero-anionic structure remains challenging. Herein, an atomic doping strategy is presented to prepare the CuCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4-x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NC-2 (CCSO/NC-2) as electrocatalysts, the structrual characterization results favorably demonstrate the partial substitution of S atoms for O in CCSO/NC-2, which shows excellent catalytic performance and durability for OER and ORR in 0.1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH. In addition, the catalyst assembled Zinc&#8211;air battery with an open circuit potential of 1.43&#160;V maintains performance after 300&#160;h of cyclic stability. Theoretical calculations and differential charges illustrate that S doping optimizes the reaction kinetics and promotes electron redistribution. The superior performance of CCSO/NC-2 catalysis is mainly due to its unique S modulation of the electronic structure of the main body. The introduction of S promotes Co&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O covalency and constructs a fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Bandgap Modulation
In article number 2303198, Weida Hu, Zhuhua Zhang, Haomin Wang, and co&#8208;workers report effective bandgap modulation in zigzag&#8208;oriented hexagonal boron nitride nanoribbons (zBNNRs) via water adsorption. The water layer adsorbed along the edges is believed to create a huge transverse potential and then greatly reduces the bandgap. The conductance of &#8776;8 nm&#8208;wide zBNNRs can be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via gating at room temperature.

Multifunctional Mechanical Metamaterials
The accordion can deliver a diverse range of melodies contingent upon the sequence of keys and bellows movement activated by the performer. In article number 2301109, Lei Wu and Damiano Pasini introduce a multifunctional mechanical metamaterial whose building block resembles the individual keys and bellows of an accordion. By activating the high&#8208;energy stable state of selected building blocks, the metamaterial can exhibit reprogrammable mechanical instabilities that can be engaged for accomplishing logical operations and tunable mechanical hysteresis in multifunctional devices.

Bioresins
Light&#8208;responsive microgels enable combination of embedded extrusion and volumetric bioprinting. In article number 2301673, Riccardo Levato and co&#8208;workers report the development of granular bioresins as a suspension bath for printing multiple cell types. Within seconds, the bath is shaped into complex 3D constructs with micro&#8208;to&#8208;macro, multiscale porosity, upon tomographic light exposure, building advanced models of cell&#8211;cell communication relevant for pancreatic metabolism.

Oxygen Electrocatalysis
To investigate the bifunctional performance of heterogeneous anionic structures for oxygen electrocatalysis, CuCo2O4&#8722;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts, which exhibit excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR), are designed by Ting Ouyang, Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2303488. The superior catalytic performance of CuCo2O4&#8722;xSx/NC&#8208;2 is attributed to the unique S modulation of the main body electronic structure, Co&#8211;S bonds&#8208;constructed fast electron&#8208;transport channels, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active&#8208;site Co to the reaction intermediates.

Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Recycling
Sustainability suggests that the resources used for lithium&#8208;ion batteries are finite, and should be used conservatively and wisely. In article 2203218, Zhongwei Chen and co&#8208;workers outline and evaluate current direct cathode regeneration methods for industrialized battery recycling, which is anticipated as a flexible guide for closed&#8208;loop lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling with the aims of high efficiency, high safety, high environmental benefit, high economic return, and high sustainability.

Topologically Protected Structures
In article number 2303077, S. Joon Kwon, Dong Ki Yoon, and co&#8208;workers present a cutting&#8208;edge security system based on liquid crystal structures. These structures exhibit highly unpredictable pathways akin to the randomness observed in planar spin glasses. The cover image suggests that the randomness of cholesteric fingers and the erratic movements of people running freely in a maze are inherently unpredictable.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Materials for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the latest achievements of liquid crystal materials applied in biomedical fields are summarized. The basic concepts and components of liquid crystals and the functional materials derived from them are introduced. After that, their ongoing and foreseeable biomedical applications are discussed. 








Abstract
Liquid crystal is a state of matter being intermediate between solid and liquid. Liquid crystal materials exhibit both orientational order and fluidity. While liquid crystals have long been highly recognized in the display industry, in recent decades, liquid crystals provide new opportunities into the cross&#8208;field of material science and biomedicine due to their biocompatibility, multifunctionality, and responsiveness. In this review, the latest achievements of liquid crystal materials applied in biomedical fields are summarized. The start is made by introducing the basic concepts of liquid crystals, and then shifting to the components of liquid crystals as well as functional materials derived therefrom. After that, the ongoing and foreseeable applications of liquid crystal materials in the biomedical field with emphasis put on several cutting&#8208;edge aspects, including drug delivery, bioimaging, tissue engineering, implantable devices, biosensing, and wearable devices are discussed. It is hoped that this review will stimulate ingenious ideas for the future generation of liquid crystal&#8208;based drug development, artificial implants, disease diagnosis, health status monitoring, and beyond.

         <title>Enabling Future Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Direct Cathode Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct cathode regeneration methods are summarized to highlight the technical challenges, current status, supply chain, carbon footprints, and possible solutions for closed&#8208;loop battery recycling. The environmental, economic, and political benefits of the direct cathode regeneration methods are also considered, and a reference recycling route with available automated recycling technology is proposed and minimizes the costs.








Abstract
The rapid proliferation of electric vehicles equipped with lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) presents serious waste management challenges and environmental hazards for recyclers after scrap. Closed&#8208;loop recycling contributes to the sustainable development of batteries and plays an important role in mitigating raw material shortages and supply chain risks. Herein, current direct cathode regeneration methods for industrialized recycling are outlined and evaluated. Different regeneration methods for spent cathode materials are summarized, which provide a new perspective for realizing closed&#8208;loop recycling of LIBs. A reference recycling route for retrofitting existing cathode production lines is proposed and minimizes the costs. In addition to promoting the industrialization of direct cathode recycling, the environmental, economic, and political benefits of battery recycling are also highlighted.

         <title>Does Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolyte Subdue Issues of Zn Batteries?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to wide electrochemical stability window, water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes (WISEs) are attracting considerable interest. WISEs display distinctive physical and electrochemical properties compared to conventional electrolyte that makes them a promising electrolyte to be used in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZnBs). This review provides overview about issues in ZnBs, a historical, basic, thermodynamic, and kinetic overview about WISEs and finally discusses their use in ZnBs.









Abstract
Zn&#8208;metal batteries (ZnBs) are safe and sustainable because of their operability in aqueous electrolytes, abundance of Zn, and recyclability. However, the thermodynamic instability of Zn metal in aqueous electrolytes is a major bottleneck for its commercialization. As such, Zn deposition (Zn2+ &#8594; Zn(s)) is continuously accompanied by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (2H+ &#8594; H2) and dendritic growth that further accentuate the HER. Consequently, the local pH around the Zn electrode increases and promotes the formation of inactive and/or poorly conductive Zn passivation species (Zn + 2H2O &#8594; Zn(OH)2 + H2) on the Zn. This aggravates the consumption of Zn and electrolyte and degrades the performance of ZnB. To propel HER beyond its thermodynamic potential (0&#160;V vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at pH 0), the concept of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8208;electrolyte (WISE) has been employed in ZnBs. Since the publication of the first article on WISE for ZnB in 2016, this research area has progressed continuously. Here, an overview and discussion on this promising research direction for accelerating the maturity of ZnBs is provided. The review briefly describes the current issues with conventional aqueous electrolyte in ZnBs, including a historic overview and basic understanding of WISE. Furthermore, the application scenarios of WISE in ZnBs are detailed, with the description of various key mechanisms (e.g., side reactions, Zn electrodeposition, anions or cations intercalation in metal oxide or graphite, and ion transport at low temperature).

Recovering critical resources from surface water, groundwater, and wastewater sources can offer a sustainable path toward securing their supply chains. This work reviews the materials that are developed for membranes, sorbents, catalysts, electrodes, and interfacial solar steam generators that demonstrate promise for applications in critical resource recovery.








Abstract
Population growth, urbanization, and decarbonization efforts are collectively straining the supply of limited resources that are necessary to produce batteries, electronics, chemicals, fertilizers, and other important products. Securing the supply chains of these critical resources via the development of separation technologies for their recovery represents a major global challenge to ensure stability and security. Surface water, groundwater, and wastewater are emerging as potential new sources to bolster these supply chains. Recently, a variety of material&#8208;based technologies have been developed and employed for separations and resource recovery in water. Judicious selection and design of these materials to tune their properties for targeting specific solutes is central to realizing the potential of water as a source for critical resources. Here, the materials that are developed for membranes, sorbents, catalysts, electrodes, and interfacial solar steam generators that demonstrate promise for applications in critical resource recovery are reviewed. In addition, a critical perspective is offered on the grand challenges and key research directions that need to be addressed to improve their practical viability.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Anchored Curved Carbon Surface for Efficient CO2 Electro&#8208;Reduction with Nearly 100% CO Selectivity and Industrially&#8208;Relevant Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Ni&#8208;N4 sites on curved carbon surfaces possess a lower energy barrier for *COOH formation, which benefits the CO2 reduction reaction. Accordingly, porous carbon with atomic Ni&#8208;N4 sites and a rich curved surface is developed and exhibits nearly 100 % selectivity for CO formation under a high current density of 400 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Although single metal atoms on porous carbons (PCs) are widely used in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, these systems have long relied on flat graphene&#8208;based models, which are far beyond reality because of abundant curved structures in PCs; the effect of curved surfaces has long been ignored. In addition, the selectivity generally decreases under high current density, which severely limits practical application. Herein, theoretical calculations reveal that a single&#8208;Ni&#8208;atom on a curved surface can simultaneously enhance the total density of states around Fermi level and decrease the energy barrier for *COOH formation, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. This work reports a rational molten salt approach for preparing PCs with ultra&#8208;high specific surface area of up to 2635 m2 g&#8722;1. As determined by cutting&#8208;edge techniques, a single Ni atom on a curved carbon surface is obtained and used as a catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction. The CO selectivity reaches up to 99.8% under industrial&#8208;level current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PC&#8208;based catalysts. This work not only offers a new method for the rational synthesis of single atom catalysts with strained geometry to host rich active sites, but also provides in&#8208;depth insights for the origin of catalytic activity of curved structure&#8208;enriched PC&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Photostable Cascade&#8208;Activatable Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly on a Cancer Cell Membrane for High&#8208;Performance Identification of Human Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system can construct a polypeptide&#8208;based nanofiber structure in situ on a cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term stable imaging of bladder cancer. The targeted peptide can specifically react with the reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) to form TRAP, which exhibits enhanced hydrophobicity simultaneously aggregating into nanofibers. The nanofibers can achieve accurate tumor recognition and enable high&#8208;performance stable imaging, retaining the high signal/noise ratio.








Abstract
Missed or residual tumor burden results in high risk for bladder cancer relapse. However, existing fluorescent probes cannot meet the clinical needs because of inevitable photobleaching properties. Performance can be improved by maintaining intensive and sustained fluorescence signals via resistance to intraoperative saline flushing and intrinsic fluorescent decay, providing surgeons with sufficiently clear and high&#8208;contrast surgical fields, avoiding residual tumors or missed diagnosis. This study designs and synthesizes a photostable cascade&#8208;activatable peptide, a target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system, which can construct polypeptide&#8208;based nanofibers in situ on the cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term and stable imaging of bladder cancer. The probe has two parts: a target peptide (TP) targets CD44v6 to recognize bladder cancer cells, and a reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) is introduced, which effectively reacts with the TP via a click reaction to enhance the hydrophobicity of the whole molecule, assembling into nanofibers and further nanonetworks. Accordingly, probe retention on the cell membrane is prolonged, and photostability is significantly improved. Finally, the TRAP system is successfully employed in the high&#8208;performance identification of human bladder cancer in ex vivo bladder tumor tissues. This cascade&#8208;activatable peptide molecular probe based on the TRAP system enables efficient and stable imaging of bladder cancer.

         <title>A Computationally Assisted Approach for Designing Wearable Biosensors toward Non&#8208;Invasive Personalized Molecular Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated computational framework named QuantumDock is developed for universal molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) development toward a variety of wearable biosensing applications. QuantumDock employs molecular docking and density functional theory to probe the molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules, optimizing the selectivity of the MIP biosensor for the wearable analysis of a wide range of biomarkers. (e.g., phenylalanine).








Abstract
Wearable sweat sensors have the potential to revolutionize precision medicine as they can non&#8208;invasively collect molecular information closely associated with an individual's health status. However, the majority of clinically relevant biomarkers cannot be continuously detected in situ using existing wearable approaches. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are a promising candidate to address this challenge but haven't yet gained widespread use due to their complex design and optimization process yielding variable selectivity. Here, QuantumDock is introduced, an automated computational framework for universal MIP development toward wearable applications. QuantumDock utilizes density functional theory to probe molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules to optimize selectivity, a fundamentally limiting factor for MIP development toward wearable sensing. A molecular docking approach is employed to explore a wide range of known and unknown monomers, and to identify the optimal monomer/cross&#8208;linker choice for subsequent MIP fabrication. Using an essential amino acid phenylalanine as the exemplar, experimental validation of QuantumDock is performed successfully using solution&#8208;synthesized MIP nanoparticles coupled with ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy. Moreover, a QuantumDock&#8208;optimized graphene&#8208;based wearable device is designed that can perform autonomous sweat induction, sampling, and sensing. For the first time, wearable non&#8208;invasive phenylalanine monitoring is demonstrated in human subjects toward personalized healthcare applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Doping in Ordered and Disordered Domains of Organic Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel organic bioelectronic technologies rely on the efficient electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers. In this work, it is investigated how the doping process can be controlled by the co&#8208;existence of ordered and disordered domains in polymeric films. It is shown that both domains are doped trough different mechanisms and extents, and that optimal conductivity can be achieved by modulating film order.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers are increasingly used as organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors in electrochemical applications for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and energy harvesting. The design of efficient electrochemical devices relies on large modulations of the polymer conductivity, fast doping/dedoping kinetics, and high ionic uptake. In this work, structure&#8211;property relations are established and control of these parameters by the co&#8208;existence of order and disorder in the phase morphology is demonstrated. Using in&#160;situ time&#8208;resolved spectroelectrochemistry, resonant Raman, and terahertz (THz) conductivity measurements, the electrochemical doping in the different morphological domains of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is investigated. The main finding is that bipolarons are found preferentially in disordered polymer regions, where they are formed faster and are thermodynamically more favored. On the other hand, polarons show a preference for ordered domains, leading to drastically different bipolaron/polaron ratios and doping/dedoping dynamics in the distinct regions. A significant enhancement of the electronic conductivity is evident when bipolarons start forming in the disordered regions, while the presence of bipolarons in the ordered regions is detrimental for transport. This study provides significant advances in the understanding of the impact of morphology on the electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers and the induced increase in conductivity.

         <title>In Situ Covalent Reinforcement of a Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Polymer Enables Biomimetic, Tough, and Fibrous Hydrogels and Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating fibrillar yet tough synthetic hydrogel and bioink remains highly desired. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils; herein, a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) based synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is reported for creating a tough hydrogel and bioink. The bioink enables 3D bioprinting of hMSCs spheroids and supports cartilage&#8208;like tissue formation within the hydrogel.








Abstract
Synthetic hydrogels often lack the load&#8208;bearing capacity and mechanical properties of native biopolymers found in tissue, such as cartilage. In natural tissues, toughness is often imparted via the combination of fibrous noncovalent self&#8208;assembly with key covalent bond formation. This controlled combination of supramolecular and covalent interactions remains difficult to engineer, yet can provide a clear strategy for advanced biomaterials. Here, a synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is investigated for creating a tough hydrogel that embodies the hierarchical fibrous architecture of the extracellular matrix (ECM). A benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) hydrogelator is developed with synthetically addressable norbornene handles that self&#8208;assembles to form a and viscoelastic hydrogel. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils, the mechanical properties are reinforced by covalent intra&#8208; and interfiber cross&#8208;links. At over 90% water, the hydrogels withstand up to 550% tensile strain, 90% compressive strain, and dissipated energy with recoverable hysteresis. The hydrogels are shear&#8208;thinning, can be 3D bioprinted with good shape fidelity, and can be toughened via&#160;covalent cross&#8208;linking. These materials enable the bioprinting of human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) spheroids and subsequent differentiation into chondrogenic tissue. Collectively, these findings highlight the power of covalent reinforcement&#160;of supramolecular fibers, offering a strategy for the bottom&#8208;up design of dynamic, yet tough, hydrogels and bioinks.

         <title>Tumor Eradication by Boron Neutron Capture Therapy with 10B&#8208;enriched Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanoparticles Grafted with Poly(Glycerol)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm 10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG) are developed as a boron nanocarrier for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Benefiting from the small particle size and high stealth efficiency, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles efficiently accumulate in CT26 tumors with a high intratumor 10B concentration of 8.8%ID&#160;g&#8722;1 or 102.1&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1, resulting in significant tumor shrinkage by BNCT alone.








Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has emerged as a treatment modality with high precision and efficacy of intractable tumors. At the core of effective tumor BNCT are 10B carriers with facile preparation as well as advantageous pharmacokinetic and therapeutic profiles. Herein, the design and preparation of sub&#8208;10 nm&#160;10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG), and their application to cancer treatment by BNCT are reported. By virtue of their small particle size and outstanding stealth property, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles accumulate efficiently in murine CT26 colon tumors with a high intratumor 10B concentration of 8.8%ID&#160;g&#8722;1 or 102.1&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at 12&#160;h post&#8208;injection. Moreover, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles penetrate into the inside of the tumor parenchyma and then are taken up by the tumor cells. BNCT comprising a single bolus injection of h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles and subsequent one&#8208;time neutron irradiation results in significant shrinkage of subcutaneous CT26 tumors. h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG&#8208;mediated BNCT not only causes direct DNA damage to the tumor cells, but also triggers pronounced inflammatory immune response in the tumor tissues, which contributes to long&#8208;lasting tumor suppression after the neutron irradiation. Thus, the h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles are promising BNCT agents to eradicate tumor through highly efficient 10B accumulation.

         <title>Multistable Metafluid based Energy Harvesting and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a novel approach to energy harvesting, storage, and on&#8208;demand release by integrating compressible gas within a multistable structure. An analytical and experimental investigation is carried out into this &#8220;metafluid.&#8221; We&#160;examine its potential for energy harvesting from temperature fluctuations (such as day and night cycles), store the energy internally, and convert it into mechanical energy when needed.








Abstract
The thermodynamic properties of fluids play a crucial role in many engineering applications, particularly in the context of energy. Fluids with multistable thermodynamic properties may offer new paths for harvesting and storing energy via transitions between equilibria states. Such artificial multistable fluids can be created using the approach employed in metamaterials, which controls macro&#8208;properties through micro&#8208;structure composition. In this work, the dynamics of such &#8220;metafluids&#8221; is examined for a configuration of calorically&#8208;perfect compressible gas contained within multistable elastic capsules flowing in a fluid&#8208;filled tube. The velocity&#8208;, pressure&#8208;, and temperature&#8208;fields of multistable compressible metafluids is studied by both analytically and experimentally, focusing on transitions between different equilibria. The dynamics of a single capsule is first examine, which may move or change equilibrium state, due to fluidic forces. The interaction and motion of multiple capsules within a fluid&#8208;filled tube is then studied. It shows that such a system can be used to harvest energy from external temperature variations in either time or space. Thus, fluidic multistability allows specific quanta of energy to be captured and stored indefinitely as well as transported as a fluid, via tubes, at standard atmospheric conditions without the need for thermal&#160;isolation.

         <title>Nonlinear Inflatable Actuators for Distributed Control in Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces conical shell actuators that display buckling instability when loaded with pressure. The critical peak&#8208; and valley&#8208;pressures are independently tunable through geometrical parameters. When these thresholds are carefully tuned for a system of actuators, a complex actuation sequence can be designed for, with only one input. This study demonstrates this by playing Beethoven on a piano.








Abstract
As soft robotic systems grow in complexity and functionality, the size and stiffness of the needed control hardware severely limits their application potential. Alternatively, functionality can be embodied within actuator characteristics, drastically reducing the amount of peripherals. Functions such as memory, computation, and energy storage then result from the intrinsic mechanical behavior of precisely designed structures. Here, actuators are introduced with tunable characteristics to generate complex actuation sequences from a single input. Intricate sequences are made possible by harnessing hysteron characteristics encoded in the buckling of a cone&#8208;shaped shell incorporated in the actuator design. A large variety of such characteristics are generated by varying the actuator geometry. This dependency is mapped and used for creating a tool to determine the actuator geometry that yields a desired characteristic. Using this tool, a system with six actuators is created that plays the final movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with a single pressure supply.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Defined Josephson Weak&#8208;Links in Monolayer WTe2</title>

         <dc:description>
Monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) can be both a quantum spin Hall insulator and gated into a superconducting state. Josephson weak&#8208;links are fabricated using local gates on hBN&#8208;encapsulated WTe2 and the 2D nature of the superconducting leads is demonstrated. The fabrication provides a first step toward realizing versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one gate configurable topological Josephson weak&#8208;links.








Abstract
Systems combining superconductors with topological insulators offer a platform for the study of Majorana bound states and a possible route to realize fault tolerant topological quantum computation. Among the systems being considered in this field, monolayers of tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) have a rare combination of properties. Notably, it has been demonstrated to be a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) and can easily be gated into a superconducting state. Measurements on gate&#8208;defined Josephson weak&#8208;link devices fabricated using monolayer WTe2 are reported. It is found that consideration of the 2D superconducting leads are critical in the interpretation of magnetic interference in the resulting junctions. The reported fabrication procedures suggest a facile way to produce further devices from this technically challenging material and the results mark the first step toward realizing versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one topological Josephson weak&#8208;links using monolayer WTe2.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Thermoelectric Microdevices for 4D Thermometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device is developed for direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale. The paradigm of a 3D&#8208;printed thermocouple micro&#8208;network provides new advantages to access microscopic thermodynamics without dimensional limit. In this study, microscale 4D temperature fields generated by Joule&#8208;heating or evaporative cooling are directly observed.








Abstract
Thermometry, the process of measuring temperature, is one of the most fundamental tasks not only for understanding the thermodynamics of basic physical, chemical, and biological processes but also for thermal management of microelectronics. However, it is a challenge to acquire microscale temperature fields in both space and time. Here, a 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device that enables direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale is reported. The device is composed of freestanding thermocouple probe networks, fabricated by bi&#8208;metal 3D printing with an outstanding spatial resolution of a few &#181;m. It shows that the developed 4D thermometry can explore dynamics of Joule heating or evaporative cooling on microscale subjects of interest such as a microelectrode or a water meniscus. The utilization of 3D printing further opens up the possibility to freely realize a wide range of on&#8208;chip, freestanding microsensors or microelectronic devices without the design restrictions by manufacturing processes.

         <title>Directed Neural Stem Cells Differentiation via Signal Communication with Ni&#8211;Zn Micromotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;driven Ni&#8211;Zn micromotors precisely approach target neural stem cells (NSCs) under magnetic guidance and further activate the cellular voltage&#8208;gated ion channel, thus directing the differentiation fate of the target cell. Such micromotors provide a possibility for non&#8208;invasive, minimally invasive therapy for neuron regeneration.








Abstract
Neural stem cells (NSCs), with the capability of self&#8208;renewal, differentiation, and environment modulation, are considered promising for stroke, brain injury therapy, and neuron regeneration. Activation of endogenous NSCs, is attracting increasing research enthusiasm, which avoids immune rejection and ethical issues of exogenous cell transplantation. Yet, how to induce directed growth and differentiation in situ remain a major challenge. In this study, a pure water&#8208;driven Ni&#8211;Zn micromotor via a self&#8208;established electric&#8211;chemical field is proposed. The micromotors can be magnetically guided and precisely approach target NSCs. Through the electric&#8211;chemical field, bioelectrical signal exchange and communication with endogenous NSCs are allowed, thus allowing for regulated proliferation and directed neuron differentiation in vivo. Therefore, the Ni&#8211;Zn micromotor provides a platform for controlling cell fate via a self&#8208;established electrochemical field and targeted activation of endogenous NSCs.

         <title>Buckling Metamaterials for Extreme Vibration Damping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing number of applications. It is shown that allowing buckling of the primary load path can be used to set an upper limit for vibration transmission. In free&#8208;standing mechanical metamaterials, this principle is used to generate extreme vibration damping with very high stiffness, far exceeding typical values for lightweight structural materials.








Abstract
Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing number of applications. Many passive damping methods rely on using low stiffness, complex mechanical structures or electrical systems, which render them unfeasible in many of these applications. Herein, a new method for passive vibration damping, by allowing buckling of the primary load path in mechanical metamaterials and lattice structures, is introduced, which sets an upper limit for vibration transmission: the transmitted&#160;acceleration saturates at a maximum value in both tension and compression, no matter what the input acceleration is. This nonlinear mechanism leads to an extreme damping coefficient tan&#948; &#8776; 0.23 in a metal metamaterial&#8212;orders of magnitude larger than the linear damping coefficient of traditional lightweight structural materials. This principle is demonstrated experimentally and numerically in free&#8208;standing rubber and metal mechanical metamaterials over a range of accelerations. It is also shown that damping nonlinearities even allow buckling&#8208;based vibration damping to work in tension, and that bidirectional buckling can further improve its performance. Buckling metamaterials pave the way toward extreme vibration damping without mass or stiffness penalty, and, as such, could be applicable in a multitude of high&#8208;tech applications, including aerospace, vehicles, and sensitive&#160;instruments.

         <title>Delocalized Electronic Engineering of Ni5P4 Nanoroses for Durable Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen heteroatoms are introduced to effectively induce electron delocalization and construction of strong electronegative centers of nickel phosphide, significantly decreasing the energy barrier for efficient oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction in Li&#8211;O2 batteries.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics and issues associated with the parasitic reactions of cathodes are major obstacles to the large&#8208;scale application of Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs), despite their large theoretical energy density. Therefore, efficient electrocatalyst design is critical for optimizing their performance. Ni5P4 is analyzed theoretically as a cathode material, and the downshift of the d&#8208;band center is found to enhance electron occupation in antibonding orbits, providing a valuable descriptor for understanding and enhancing the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. In this study, it is demonstrated that incorporating additional nitrogen atoms into Ni5P4 nanoroses regulates the electronic structure, resulting in superior electrocatalytic performance in LOBs. Further spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that the incorporated nitrogen sites can effectively induce localized structure polarization, lowering the energy barrier for the production of desirable intermediates and thus enhancing battery capacity and preventing cell degradation. This approach provides a sound basis for developing advanced electrode materials with optimized electronic structures for high&#8208;performance LOBs.

         <title>A Gas/phototheranostic Nanocomposite Integrates NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Peak Absorbing Aza&#8208;BODIPY with Thermal&#8208;Sensitive Nitric Oxide Donor for Atraumatic Osteosarcoma Therapy</title>

In this work, an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is engineered to obtain the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;peak (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak) absorbing aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPY), combining with a thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor to form a gas/phototheranostics. This gas/phototheranostics that combines gas therapy with low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy executes the therapeutic mechanism of enhanced cell apoptosis for osteosarcoma, simultaneously, achieving an atraumatic therapeutic process.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has received increasing interest in cancer therapeutics owing to its excellent efficacy and controllability. However, there are two major limitations in PTT applications, which are the tissue penetration depth of lasers within the absorption range of photothermal agents and the unavoidable tissue empyrosis induced by high&#8208;energy lasers. Herein, a gas/phototheranostic nanocomposite (NA1020&#8208;NO@PLX) is engineered that integrates the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;peak (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak) absorbing aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPY,NA1020) with the thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetylpenicillamine, SNAP). An enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is proposed to achieve the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak absorbance (&#955;max = 1020&#160;nm) on NA1020, thereby obtaining its deep tissue penetration depth. The NA1020 exhibits a remarkable photothermal conversion, making it feasible for the deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic osteosarcoma therapy and providing favorable NIR&#8208;II emission to precisely pinpoint the tumor for a visible PTT process. The simultaneously investigated atraumatic therapeutic process with an enhanced cell apoptosis mechanism indicates the feasibility of the synergistic NO/low&#8208;temperature PTT for osteosarcoma. Herein, this gas/phototheranostic strategy optimizes the existing PTT to present a repeatable and atraumatic photothermal therapeutic process for deep&#8208;tissue tumors, validating its potential clinical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature, Reversible, and Robust Thermochromic Fluorescence Based on Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are demonstrated in Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 and related crystals. Such unique features showcase a multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption application.








Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) characterized by noticeable emission color variation with temperature have attracted pervasive attention for their frontier application in stimulus&#8208;response and optical encryption technologies. However, existing TFMs typically suffer from weak PL reversibility as well as limited mild operating temperature and severe temperature PL quenching. PL switching under extreme conditions such as high temperature will undoubtedly improve encryption security, while it is still challenging for present TFMs. In this work, high&#8208;temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are observed in Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 and related crystals, which is seldom reported for PL changes at such a high temperature. Temperature&#8208;driven nonluminous, red and green light emission states can be achieved at specific temperatures and the modulation mechanism is verified by in situ optical and structural measurements and single particle transition. By virtue of this unique feature, a multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption applications are demonstrated. This work opens a window for the design of inorganic materials with multi&#8208;PL change and the development of advanced encryption strategies with extreme stimuli source.

         <title>All&#8208;Day Multicyclic Atmospheric Water Harvesting Enabled by Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel with Hybrid Desorption Mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with free and coordinated hygroscopic salt is described, which exhibits fast sorption due to the large interior osmotic pressure and prevention of salt aggregation and leakage through the strong salt&#8211;polymer electrostatic interactions. By using a multicyclic operation strategy and a hybrid desorption mode, the sorbent achieves high&#8208;yield water production, outperforming single&#8208;cyclic solar&#8208;driven mode by three times.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is a promising approach for mitigating worldwide water scarcity. However, reliable water supply driven by sustainable energy regardless of diurnal variation and weather remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. To address this issue, a polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with an optimal hybrid&#8208;desorption multicyclic&#8208;operation strategy is proposed, achieving all&#8208;day AWH and a significant increase in daily water production. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel possesses a large interior osmotic pressure of 659 atm, which refreshes sorption sites by continuously migrating the sorbed water within its interior, and thus enhancing sorption kinetics. The charged polymeric chains coordinate with hygroscopic salt ions, anchoring the salts and preventing agglomeration and leakage, thereby enhancing cyclic stability. The hybrid desorption mode, which couples solar energy and simulated waste heat, introduces a uniform and adjustable sorbent temperature for achieving all&#8208;day ultrafast water release. With rapid sorption&#8211;desorption kinetics, an optimization model suggests that eight moisture capture&#8211;release cycles are capable of achieving&#160;high water yield of 2410 mLwater kgsorbent&#8722;1 day&#8722;1, up to 3.5 times that of single&#8208;cyclic non&#8208;hybrid modes. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent and the coupling with sustainable energy driven desorption mode pave the way for the next&#8208;generation AWH systems, significantly bringing freshwater on a multi&#8208;kilogram scale closer.

         <title>Visualizing Interfacial Energy Offset and Defects in Efficient 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of energy offset and defects with different halide types in 2D perovskite are studied, providing a new approach for designing stable and efficient PSCs. Using 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions can improve the passivation and charge&#8208;carrier extraction, boosting the efficiency to 25.32% for the small devices and 21.48% for the large module.








Abstract
Currently, the full potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by chargecarrier recombination owing to imperfect passivation methods. Here, the recombination loss mechanisms owing to the interfacial energy offset and defects are quantified. The results show that a favorable energy offset can reduce minority carriers and suppress interfacial recombination losses more effectively than chemical passivation. To obtain high&#8208;efficiency PSCs, 2D perovskites are promising candidates, which offer powerful field effects and require only modest chemical passivation at the interface. The enhanced passivation and charge&#8208;carrier extraction offered by the 2D/3D heterojunction PSCs has boosted their power conversion efficiency to 25.32% (certified 25.04%) for small&#8208;size devices and to 21.48% for a large&#8208;area module (with a designated area of 29.0&#160;cm2). Ion migration is also suppressed by the 2D/3D heterojunction, such that the unencapsulated small&#8208;size devices maintain 90% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous operation at the maximum power point.

The entropy&#8208;driven instability in the evaporation process of DNA LCs induces a stochastic birefringent pattern that provides high&#8208;level security codes based on physical unclonable functions. The platform can allow the fabrication&#160;of protective barriers with a simple method, brushstrokes.








Abstract
Controversy over artwork's authenticity is ongoing despite numerous technologies for copyright protection. Artists should build their own ways to protect the authority, but these are still open to piracy. Here, a platform is proposed for developing anticounterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs), in an artist&#8208;friendly manner, brushstrokes. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which is natural, biocompatible, and eco&#8208;friendly, can be applied as a paint that shows entropy&#8208;driven buckling instability of the liquid crystal phase. Brushed and wholly dried DNA exhibits line&#8208;shaped zig&#8208;zag textures with inherent randomness as a source of the PUF, and its primary performance and reliability are systematically examined. This breakthrough enables the utilization of these drawings in a wider range of applications.

         <title>An Artificial Olfactory System Based on a Chemi&#8208;Memristive Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hysteretic chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor containing TiO2&#8208;nanorod memristors based on oxygen vacancy dynamics different from that of conventional sensors is developed. Analog conductance modulation based on the redox reaction with external gas molecules in a ruptured filament area after memristive switching converts external gas stimuli into synaptic weights to realize an artificial olfactory system.








Abstract
Technologies based on the fusion of gas sensors and neuromorphic computing to mimic the olfactory system have immense potential. However, the implementation of neuromorphic olfactory systems remains in a state of infancy because conventional gas sensors lack the necessary functions. Therefore, this study proposes a hysteretic &#8220;chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor&#8221; based on oxygen vacancy chemi&#8208;memristive dynamics that differ from that of conventional gas sensors. After the memristive switching operation, the redox reaction with the external gas molecules is enhanced, resulting in the generation and elimination of oxygen vacancies that induce rapid current changes. In addition, the pre&#8208;generated oxygen vacancies enhance the post&#8208;sensing properties. Therefore, fast responses, short recovery times, and hysteretic gas response are achieved by the proposed sensor at room temperature. Based on the advantageous functionality of the sensor, device&#8208;level olfactory systems that can monitor the history of input gas stimuli are experimentally demonstrated as a potential application. Moreover, analog conductance modulation induced by oxidizing and reducing gases enables the conversion of external gas stimuli into synaptic weights and hence the realization of typical synaptic functionalities without an additional device or circuit. The proposed chemi&#8208;memristive device represents an advance in the bioinspired technology adopted in creating artificial intelligence systems.

         <title>Seeded Synthesis of Hollow PdSn Intermetallic Nanomaterials for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seeded method is developed to prepare hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles, i.e., orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2, based on rational modulation of phase and morphology. The obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn nanoparticles with modified electronic structure, high intrinsic activity, and abundant active sites exhibit excellent catalytic performances toward electrochemical glycerol oxidation, outperforming hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 and solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn nanoparticles.








Abstract
Intermetallic nanomaterials have shown promising potential as high&#8208;performance catalysts in various catalytic reactions due to their unconventional crystal phases with ordered atomic arrangements. However, controlled synthesis of intermetallic nanomaterials with tunable crystal phases and unique hollow morphologies remains a challenge. Here, a seeded method is developed to synthesize hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with two different intermetallic phases, that is, orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2. Benefiting from the rational regulation of the crystal phase and morphology, the obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs deliver excellent electrocatalytic performance toward glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), outperforming solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs, hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 NPs, and commercial Pd/C, which places it among the best reported Pd&#8208;based GOR electrocatalysts. The reaction mechanism of GOR using the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn as the catalyst is investigated by operando infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, which reveals that the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn catalyst cleaves the C&#63743;C bond more easily compared to the commercial Pd/C. This work can pave an appealing route to the controlled synthesis of diverse novel intermetallic nanomaterials with hollow morphology for various promising applications.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Molecular Dynamics Elucidates the Mechanics of Reinforcement in Graphene&#8208;Based Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of reinforcement of polymer materials by graphene&#8208;based inclusions is highly important for the design of high&#8208;performance composites. Very large molecular simulations show that single graphene layers can effectively reinforce the polymer matrix via a shear&#8208;lag process down to flake sizes of 500 nm, as long as the flake is predominantly flat. However, even small undulations of the surface substantially degrade the enhancement of materials properties.








Abstract
Using very large&#8208;scale classical molecular dynamics, the mechanics of nano&#8208;reinforcement of graphene&#8208;based nanocomposites are &#160;examined. Simulations show that significant quantities of large, defect&#8208;free, and predominantly flat graphene flakes are required for successful enhancement of materials properties in excellent agreement with experimental and proposed continuum shear&#8208;lag theories. The critical lengths for enhancement are approximately 500 nm for graphene and 300 nm and for graphene oxide (GO). The reduction of Young's modulus in GO results in a much smaller enhancement of the composite's Young's modulus. The simulations reveal that the flakes should be aligned and planar for optimal reinforcement. Undulations substantially degrade the enhancement of materials properties.

         <title>Polyimides Physically Crosslinked by Aromatic Molecules Exhibit Ultrahigh Energy Density at 200&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D rigid aromatic molecules are introduced into aromatic polyimides to form physical crosslinking networks through electrostatic interactions between their oppositely charged phenyl groups. The dense physical crosslinking networks strengthen the polyimides to boost breakdown strength and trap charge carriers to suppress dielectric loss. An ultrahigh Ud of 5.12&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and superior cyclic stability at 200&#160;&#176;C are achieved in the all&#8208;organic composites.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics possess significant advantages in electrostatic energy storage applications, such as high breakdown strength (Eb) and efficiency (&#951;), while their discharged energy density (Ud) at high temperature is limited by the decrease in Eb and &#951;. Several strategies including introducing inorganic components and crosslinking have been investigated to improve the Ud of polymer dielectrics, but new issues will be encountered, e.g., the sacrifice of flexibility, the degradation of the interfacial insulating property and the complex preparation process. In this work, 3D rigid aromatic molecules are introduced into aromatic polyimides to form physical crosslinking networks through electrostatic interactions between their oppositely charged phenyl groups. The dense physical crosslinking networks strengthen the polyimides to boost the Eb, and the aromatic molecules trap the charge carriers to suppress the loss, allowing the strategy to combine the advantages of inorganic incorporation and crosslinking. This study demonstrates that this strategy is well applicable to a number of representative aromatic polyimides, and ultrahigh Ud of 8.05&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (150&#160;&#176;C) and 5.12&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (200&#160;&#176;C) is achieved. Furthermore, the all&#8208;organic composites exhibit stable performances during ultralong 105 charge&#8211;discharge cycles in harsh environments (500&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and 200&#160;&#176;C) and prospects for large&#8208;scale preparation.

&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; of 8.05&#160;J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; (150&#160;&#176;C) and 5.12&#160;J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; (200&#160;&#176;C) is achieved. Furthermore, the all-organic composites exhibit stable performances during ultralong 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; charge&#8211;discharge cycles in harsh environments (500&#160;MV&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 200&#160;&#176;C) and prospects for large-scale preparation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalysts for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries Featuring Single Molybdenum Atoms in a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of multicomponent core&#8211;shell structures presents a versatile route to produce bifunctional molybdenum&#8208;based single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts. Zinc&#8211;air batteries with such multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and a long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, significantly outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks.








Abstract
Bifunctional catalysts can facilitate two different electrochemical reactions with conflicting characteristics. Here, a highly reversible bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) is reported featuring a &#8220;core&#8211;shell structure&#8221; in which N&#8208;doped graphene sheets wrap around vanadium molybdenum oxynitride nanoparticles. Single Mo atoms are released from the particle core during synthesis and anchored to electronegative N&#8208;dopant species in the graphitic shell. The resultant Mo single&#8208;atom catalysts excel as active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) sites in pyrrolic&#8208;N and as active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites in pyridinic&#8208;N environments. ZABs with such bifunctional and multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks. Flexible ZABs that can tolerate a wide range of temperatures (&#8722;20 to 80&#160;&#176;C) under severe mechanical deformation are also demonstrated

         <title>An Ultrafast, Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrochromic and Thermochromic Device for Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through innovative molecular design and advanced device optimization, a high&#8208;performance electrochromic device is achieved, demonstrating high transparency, rapid color&#8208;switching, and excellent stability. In conjunction with the creation of a thermoresponsive gel electrolyte, an electro&#8208; and thermochromic device is realized, exhibiting flame&#8208;retardant properties and energy&#8208;saving characteristics. Such an advanced device equips smart windows with energy efficiency, privacy protection, and decorative enhancements.








Abstract
Smart windows nowadays undertake the esteemed obligation of reducing energy consumption as well as upgrading living experience. This project aims to devise a smart window that responds to both electricity and heat, with the intention of achieving energy efficiency, privacy preservation, and enhanced decorative attributes. Through the implementation of a novel electrochromic material design, coupled with the optimization of electrochromic devices (ECDs), a high&#8208;performance ECD is obtained, demonstrating coloring/bleaching time of 0.53/0.16&#160;s, a transmittance modulation of 78% (from 99% to 21%), and superior performance in six dimensions. Furthermore, temperature&#8208;responsive units and an ionic liquid are incorporated into the electrolyte system to create a novel thermochromic gel electrolyte with transmittance modulation from 80% to 0%, and excellent thermal insulation (6.4&#160;&#176;C reduction). Ultimately, an electro&#8208; and thermochromic device is developed, featuring an ultrafast color&#8208;switching speed of 0.82/0.60&#160;s and multiple working modes. Overall, this work showcases a prospective design pathway for the development of next&#8208;generation ultrafast&#8208;switching, and energy&#8208;efficient intelligent windows.

         <title>Constructing Oxygen&#8208;Related Defects in Carbon Nanodots with Janus Optical Properties: Noninvasive NIR Fluorescent Imaging and Effective Photocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;related defects with unpaired electrons are constructed in carbon dots via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid, which not only contribute to the enhanced near&#8208;infrared (NIR) bandgap emission but also act as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to noninvasive NIR fluorescent imaging and effective photocatalytic therapy.








Abstract
Noninvasive fluorescence (FL) imaging and high&#8208;performance photocatalytic therapy (PCT) are opposing optical properties that are difficult to combine in a single material system. Herein, a facile approach to introducing oxygen&#8208;related defects in carbon dots (CDs) via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid is reported, in which some nitrogen atoms are substituted by oxygen atoms. Unpaired electrons in these oxygen&#8208;related defects rearrange the electronic structure of the oxidized CDs (ox&#8208;CDs), resulting in an emerging near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption band. These defects not only contribute to enhanced NIR bandgap emission but also act as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to abundant photo&#8208;generated holes on the ox&#8208;CDs surface under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Under white LED torch irradiation, the photo&#8208;generated holes oxidize hydroxide to hydroxyl radicals in the acidification of the aqueous solution. In contrast, no hydroxyl radicals are detected in the ox&#8208;CDs aqueous solution under 730&#160;nm laser irradiation, indicating noninvasive NIR FL imaging potential. Utilizing the Janus optical properties of the ox&#8208;CDs, the in vivo NIR FL imaging of sentinel lymph nodes around tumors and efficient photothermal enhanced tumor PCT are demonstrated.

         <title>Multifunctional Flexible Sensor Based on PU&#8208;TA@MXene Janus Architecture for Selective Direction Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the asymmetric structural features and functions of finger skin, an innovative PU&#8208;TA@MXene sensing film with bionic Janus architecture is proposed by a simple but ingenious gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy, and the derived flexible sensor reveals strong mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing ability, and well&#8208;selective response behavior to normal pressure, stretching, and directional bending.








Abstract
Multifunctional selectivity and mechanical properties are always a focus of attention in the field of flexible sensors. In particular, the construction of biomimetic architecture for sensing materials can endow the fabricated sensors with intrinsic response features and extra&#8208;derived functions. Here, inspired by the asymmetric structural features of human skin, a novel tannic acid (TA)&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;polyurethane film with a bionic Janus architecture is proposed, which is prepared by gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly for the gradient dispersion of 2D TA@MXene nanosheets into a PU network. This obtained film reveals strong mechanical properties of a superior elongation at a break of 2056.67% and an ultimate tensile strength of 50.78&#160;MPa with self&#8208;healing performance. Moreover, the Janus architecture can lead to a selective multifunctional response of flexible sensors to directional bending, pressure, and stretching. Combined with a machine learning module, the sensor is endowed with high recognition rates for force detection (96.1%). Meanwhile, direction identification in rescue operations and human movement monitoring can be realized by this sensor. This work offers essential research value and practical significance for the material structures, mechanical properties, and application platforms of flexible sensors.

         <title>Thin&#8208;Film Organic Heteroepitaxy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems have not been fully clarified. In this work, one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate heteroepitaxy is demonstrated and it is shown that the lattice matched plane of the adcrystal must also be its lowest energy surface.








Abstract
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, while rules for commensurate epitaxy of covalent or ionic inorganic material systems are known to be dictated by lattice matching constraints, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems are still being written. Here, it is found that lattice matching alone is insufficient to achieve heteroepitaxy in molecular systems, owing to weak intermolecular forces that describe molecular crystals. It is found that, in addition, the lattice matched plane also must be the lowest energy surface of the adcrystal to achieve one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate molecular heteroepitaxy over a large area. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the lattice matched interface to be of higher electronic quality than a disordered interface of the same materials.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Electrochemically Promoting Lithium Atom Diffusion and Relieving Accumulative Stress for Deep&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tensile stress can be incorporated into lithium metal anodes to reduce lithium atom diffusion energy barrier by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium through copolymer thinning. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8208;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) can double the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the notorious lithium dendrite growth and large volume change are not well addressed, especially under deep cycling. Here, an in&#8211;situ mechanical&#8211;electrochemical coupling system is built, and it is found that tensile stress can induce smooth lithium deposition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and finite element method (FEM) simulation confirm that the lithium atom diffusion energy barrier can be reduced when the lithium foils are under tensile strain. Then tensile stress is incorporated into lithium metal anodes by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium in which the copolymer thinning can yield tensile stress to the lithium foil. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8211;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation. The ELMA can withstand hundreds of compression&#8208;release cycles under 10% strain. LMBs paired with ELMA and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode can operate beyond 250 cycles with 80% capacity retention under practical condition of 4 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode capacity, 2.86&#160;g Ah&#8722;1 electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C) and 1.8 negative&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio (N/P), five times of the lifetime using lithium foils.

         <title>Flexible Modulation of Cellular Activities with Cationic Photosensitizers: Insights of Alkyl Chain Length on Reactive Oxygen Species Antimicrobial Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) with berberine (BBR) cores with different length alkyl chains are successfully designed for different binding, localization, and photodynamic killing effects among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. Moderate length alkyl chains enable CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility.








Abstract
Cationic photosensitizers have good binding ability with negatively charged bacteria and fungi, exhibiting broad applications potential in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). However, cationic photosensitizers often display unsatisfactory transkingdom selectivity between mammalian cells and pathogens, especially for eukaryotic fungi. It is unclear which biomolecular sites are more efficient for photodynamic damage, owing to the lack of systematic research with the same photosensitizer system. Herein, a series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) (using berberine (BBR) as the photosensitizers core) with different length alkyl chains are successfully designed and synthesized for flexible modulation of cellular activities. The BBR core can efficiently produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve high&#8208;performance aPDT . Through the precise regulation of alkyl chain length, different bindings, localizations, and photodynamic killing effects of CABs are achieved and investigated systematically among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. It is found that intracellular active substances, not membranes, are more efficient damage sites of aPDT. Moderate length alkyl chains enable CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility. This study is expected to provide systematic theoretical and strategic research guidance for the construction of high&#8208;performance cationic photosensitizers with good transkingdom selectivity.

         <title>Multienzyme&#8208;Mimicking LaCoO3 Nanotrigger for Programming Cancer&#8208;Cell Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals are developed to trigger the generation of aberrant reactive oxygen species, release of La ions, and the activation of inflammasomes to induce pyroptosis&#8208;mediated cell death and inhibit metastasis during lung cancer.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a distinct paradigm of programmed cell death, is an efficient strategy against cancer by overcoming resistance to apoptosis. In this study, LaCoO3 (LCO) lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals with multienzyme characteristics are rationally designed and engineered to trigger the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of lanthanum ions, ultimately inducing lung cancer cell pyroptosis. The peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of LCO nanocrystals endow LCO with ROS production capacity in tumor tissues with an acidic pH and high hydrogen peroxide content. Concurrently, the LCO nanoenzyme exhibits catalase&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activities, reversing the hypoxic microenvironment, destroying the activated antioxidant system of tumor cells, and amplifying the sensitivity of tumor cells to ROS. The use of ultrasound further accelerates the enzymatic kinetic rate. Most importantly, the La3+ ions released by LCO robustly destroy the lysosomal membrane, finally inducing canonical pyroptotic cell death, together with ROS. LCO&#8208;nanocrystal&#8208;triggered programmed cell pyroptosis amplifies the therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, effectively restraining lung cancer growth and metastasis. This study paves a new avenue for the efficient treatment of lung cancer and metastasis through US&#8208;enhanced lanthanum&#8208;based nanoenzyme platforms and pyroptotic cell death.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarization Strategy for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte is reported, wherein Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced OER activity.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarization is known as a promising way to promote the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), since the intermediates and products endow spin&#8208;dependent behaviors, yet it is rarely reported for ferromagnetic catalysts toward acidic OER practically used in industry. Herein, the first spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy is reported to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte. Element&#8208;selective X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the ferromagnetic coupling between Mn and Ru ions, fulfilling the Goodenough&#8211;Kanamori rule. The ferromagnetism behavior at room temperature can be well interpreted by first principles calculations as the interaction between the Mn2+ impurity and Ru ions. Indeed, Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic field enhanced OER activity, with the lowest overpotential of 143&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 and negligible activity decay in 480&#160;h stability (vs 200&#160;mV/195&#160;h without magnetic field) as known for magnetic effects in the literature. The intrinsic turnover frequency is also improved to reach 5.5 s&#8722;1 at 1.45 VRHE. This work highlights an important avenue of spin&#8208;engineering strategy for designing efficient acidic oxygen evolution catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Spin-polarization is known as a promising way to promote the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), since the intermediates and products endow spin-dependent behaviors, yet it is rarely reported for ferromagnetic catalysts toward acidic OER practically used in industry. Herein, the first spin-polarization-mediated strategy is reported to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via dilute manganese (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte. Element-selective X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the ferromagnetic coupling between Mn and Ru ions, fulfilling the Goodenough&#8211;Kanamori rule. The ferromagnetism behavior at room temperature can be well interpreted by first principles calculations as the interaction between the Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; impurity and Ru ions. Indeed, Mn-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic field enhanced OER activity, with the lowest overpotential of 143&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sub&gt;geo&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and negligible activity decay in 480&#160;h stability (vs 200&#160;mV/195&#160;h without magnetic field) as known for magnetic effects in the literature. The intrinsic turnover frequency is also improved to reach 5.5 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.45 V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;. This work highlights an important avenue of spin-engineering strategy for designing efficient acidic oxygen evolution catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Eye&#8208;Mimicked Neural Network Composed of Photosensitive Neural Spheroids with Human Opsin Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eye&#8208;to&#8208;brain mimicking model is designed with photosensitive neural spheroid and neural network. In the photosensitive neural spheroid, human opins such as rhodopsin and short&#8208;wavelength opsin are reacted by the specific wavelength of light with selective sensitivity. Photonic reaction result in the neural response, of which signal spread to other neurons through axons.








Abstract
An&#160;in vitro model, composed of the short&#8208;wavelength human opsins and rhodopsins, is created. Two types of photosensitive neural spheroids are transfected for selective reaction under bluish&#8208;purple and green lights. These are employed to two devices with intact neuron and neural&#8208;spheroid to study the interaction. By photostimulation, the photosensitive spheroid initiated photoactivation, and the signal generated from its body is transmitted to adjacent neural networks. Specifically, the signal traveled through the axon bundle in narrow gap from photosensitive spheroid to intact spheroid as an eye&#8208;to&#8208;brain model including optic nerve. The whole process with photosensitive spheroid is monitored by calcium ion detecting fluorescence images. The results of this study can be applied to examine vision restoration and novel photosensitive biological systems with spectral sensitivity.

         <title>Optical Fibers Embedded with As&#8208;Grown Carbon Nanotubes for Ultrahigh Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with narrow diameter distribution on the inner walls of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) by a two&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is developed. By using the as&#8208;fabricated 3&#8208;cm&#8208;long CNT&#8208;fibers with desirable nanotube optical transitions, both third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been largely enhanced and mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser has been fabricated with a stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate.








Abstract
Photonic crystal fiber (PCF) embedded with functional materials has demonstrated diverse applications ranging from ultrafast lasers, optical communication to chemical sensors. Many efforts have been made to fabricating carbon nanotube (CNT) based optical fibers by ex situ transfer method; however, often suffer poor uniformity and coverage. Here, the direct growth of CNTs on the inner walls of PCFs by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#160;method is reported. A two&#8208;step growth method is&#160;developed to control the narrow diameter distribution of CNTs to ensure desirable nanotube optical transitions. In the as&#8208;fabricated CNT&#8208; embedded fiber, third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been enhanced by &#8776;15 times compared with flat CNT film on fused silica. A dual&#8208;wavelength all&#8208;fiber mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser (&#8776;1561 and &#8776;1064&#160;nm) is further demonstrated by integrating the 1.36&#177;0.15&#160;nm&#8208;diameter CNTs into two kinds of photonic bandgap hollow core PCF&#160;(named HC&#8208;1550 and HC&#8208;1060) as saturable absorbers, using their S11 (&#8776;0.7&#160;eV) and S22 (&#8776;1.2&#160;eV) interband transition respectively. The fiber laser shows stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate at 1561&#160;nm wavelength. These&#160;results can enable the large&#8208;scale applications of CNTs in PCF&#8208;based optical devices.

         <title>New Function of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework: Structurally Ordered Metal Promoter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeted post&#8208;modification strategy is developed to anchor dozen kinds of metal ions into metal&#8211;organic framework composites as structurally ordered metal promoters, which not only contributes to constructing ideal catalyst models for elucidating action mechanism of metal promoters during the catalytic process, but also provides a universal method to synthesize high&#8208;efficiency catalysts.








Abstract
The remarkable roles of metal promoters have been known for nearly a century, but it is still a challenge to find a suitable structure model to reveal the action mechanism behind metal promoters. Herein, a new function of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is developed as an ideal model to construct structurally ordered metal promoters by a targeted post&#8208;modification strategy. MOFs as model not only favor clearing the real action mechanism behind metal promoters, but also can anchor one or multiple kinds of metal promoters especially noble metal promoters. Typically, the as&#8208;prepared Pd/bpy&#8208;UiO&#8208;Cu catalysts show high selectivity (&gt;99%) toward 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane in 4&#8208;nitrostyrene hydrogenation, mainly due to the enhanced interaction between Pd nanoparticles and MOF carriers induced by Cu promoters, thus inhibiting the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane. This strategy with flexibility and universality will open up a new route to synthesize efficient catalysts with structurally ordered metal promoters.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Mechanical Bilayer Metamaterial with Global Area&#8208;Preserving Density Tunability for Acoustic Wave Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented 2D metamaterial consists of two layers that are actuated separately by a remotely applied magnetic field. This novel bilayer design strategy enables the adjustment of the area density while simultaneously preserving the overall dimensions. These designs can be further exploited in acoustic applications, including highly tunable bandgaps and waveguides.








Abstract
2D metamaterials have immense potential in acoustics, optics, and electromagnetic applications due to their unique properties and ability to conform to curved substrates. Active metamaterials have attracted significant research attention because of their on&#8208;demand tunable properties and performances through shape reconfigurations. 2D active metamaterials often achieve active properties through internal structural deformations, which lead to changes in overall dimensions. This demands corresponding alterations of the conforming substrate, or the metamaterial fails to provide complete area coverage, which can be a significant limitation for their practical applications. To date, achieving area&#8208;preserving active 2D metamaterials with distinct shape reconfigurations remains a prominent challenge. In this paper, magneto&#8208;mechanical bilayer metamaterials are presented that demonstrate area density tunability with area&#8208;preserving capability. The bilayer metamaterials consist of two arrays of magnetic soft materials with distinct magnetization distributions. Under a magnetic field, each layer behaves differently, which allows the metamaterial to reconfigure its shape into multiple modes and to significantly tune its area density without changing its overall dimensions. The area&#8208;preserving multimodal shape reconfigurations are further exploited as active acoustic wave regulators to tune bandgaps and wave propagations. The bilayer approach thus provides a new concept for the design of area&#8208;preserving active metamaterials for broader applications.

         <title>Induction of Tumor Ferroptosis&#8208;Dependent Immunity via an Injectable Attractive Pickering Emulsion Gel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;in&#8208;oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver RSL&#8208;3, a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)&#160;antibody, an immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water. RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells through cascade amplification and elicits antitumor immune responses via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells in tumors with low immunogenicity.








Abstract
The combination of ferroptosis inducers and immune checkpoint blockade can enhance antitumor effects. However, the efficacy in tumors with low immunogenicity requires further investigation. In this work, a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver (1S, 3R)&#8208;RSL&#8208;3 (RSL&#8208;3), a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) antibody, the most commonly used immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water, with optimal characteristics (RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel). Tumor lipase degrades the continuous oil phase, which results in the slow release of RSL&#8208;3&#160;and PD&#8208;1&#160;antibody and a notable antitumor effect against low&#8208;immunogenic hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Intriguingly, the RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells, resulting in antitumor immune response via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, the single&#8208;cell sequence profiling analysis during tumor treatment reveals the induction of ferroptosis in tumor cells together with strong antitumor immune response in ascites.

         <title>Strong Magnetically&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence and X&#8208;Ray Scintillation in Ultrarobust Mn(II)&#8211;Organic Helical Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrarobust helical Mn(II)&#8208;organic polymers are developed to realize magnetically&#8208;responsive circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with exceptionally high performance (&#934;PL&#160;=&#160;89%, glum&#160;=&#160;0.021) as well as triboluminescence and excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation activity.&#160;We&#160;have disclosed that the magnetic field has a remarkably high negative effect on CPP for Mn(II) materials, suppressing the CPP signal noticeably.








Abstract
Over recent years, Mn(II)&#8208;organic materials showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted great interest because of their eco&#8208;friendliness, cheapness, and room temperature phosphorescence. Using the helicity design strategy, herein, chiral Mn(II)&#8208;organic helical polymers are constructed featuring long&#8208;lived circularly polarized phosphorescence with exceptionally high glum and &#934;PL magnitudes of 0.021% and 89%, respectively, while remaining ultrarobust toward humidity, temperature, and X&#8208;rays. Equally important, it is disclosed for the first time that the magnetic field has a remarkably high negative effect on CPL for Mn(II) materials, suppressing the CPL signal by 4.2&#8208;times at B&#8407;$\vec{B}$&#160;=&#160;1.6&#160;T. Using the designed materials, UV&#8208;pumped CPL light&#8208;emitting diodes are fabricated, demonstrating enhanced optical selectivity under right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed polarization conditions. On top of all this, the reported materials display bright triboluminescence and excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation activity with a perfectly linear X&#8208;ray dose rate response up to 174&#160;&#181;Gyair&#160;s&#8722;1. Overall, these observations significantly contribute to the CPL phenomenon for multi&#8208;spin compounds and promote the design of highly efficient and stable Mn(II)&#8208;based CPL emitters.

         <title>Sequential Molecule&#8208;Doped Hole Conductor to Achieve &gt;23% Perovskite Solar Cells with 3000&#8208;Hour Operational Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
Application of solution&#8208;processed doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD hole transport layers (HTLs) is being held back by poor stability and unsatisfied scalability. Herein, a versatile molecular implantation&#8208;assisted sequential doping approach is developed to improve the spatial doping uniformity and fabricate all&#8208;evaporated HTL. The resultant devices achieve a record efficiency of 23.4%, and exhibit impressive stability both in ambient and working conditions.








Abstract
Although hole transport layers (HTLs) based on solution&#8208;processed doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD are extremely popular and effective for their remarkable performance in n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their scalable application is still being held back by poor chemical stability and unsatisfied scalability. Essentially, the volatile components and hygroscopic nature of ionic salts often cause morphological deformation that deteriorate both device efficiency and stability. Herein, a simple and effective molecular implantation&#8208;assisted sequential doping (MISD) approach is strategically introduced to modulate spatial doping uniformity of organic films and fabricate all evaporated Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD layer in which phase&#8208;segregation free HTL is achieved accompanied with high molecular density, uniform doping composition, and superior optoelectronic characteristics. The resultant MISD&#8208;based devices attain a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.4%, which represents the highest reported value among all the PSCs with evaporated HTLs. Simultaneously, the unencapsulated devices realize considerably enhanced stability by maintaining over 90% of their initial PCEs in the air for 5200&#160;h and after working at maximum power point under illumination for 3000&#160;h. This method provides a facile way to fabricate robust and reliable HTLs toward developing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Extracellular Vesicles&#8208;Derived Hybrid Nanoplatforms for Amplified CD47 Blockade&#8208;Based Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid nanoplatforms are designed by fusing M1 macrophage extracellular vesicles with drug&#8208;loaded liposomes and decorating them with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, which enables amplified CD47 blockade&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy through combinational treatment strategy.








Abstract
Immunomodulation of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) into tumor&#8208;inhibiting M1&#8208;like phenotype is a promising but challenging strategy. Cleverly, tumor cells overexpress CD47, a &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal that ligates with the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) on macrophages to escape phagocytosis. Thus, effective re&#8208;education of TAMs into the &#8220;eat me&#8221; type and blocking the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling play pivotal roles in tumor immunotherapy. Herein, it is reported that hybrid nanovesicles (hEL&#8208;RS17) derived from extracellular vesicles of M1 macrophages and decorated with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, can actively target tumor cells and remodel TAM phenotypes. Consequently, more M1&#8208;like TAMs infiltrate into tumor tissue to phagocytize more tumor cells due to CD47 blockade. By further co&#8208;encapsulating chemotherapeutic agent shikonin, photosensitizer IR820, and immunomodulator polymetformin in hEL&#8208;RS17, an enhanced antitumor effect is obtained due to the combinational treatment modality and close synergy among each component. Upon laser irradiation, the designed SPI@hEL&#8208;RS17 nanoparticles exert potent antitumor efficacy against both 4T1 breast tumor and B16F10 melanoma models, which not only suppresses primary tumor growth but also inhibits lung metastasis and prevents tumor recurrence, exhibiting great potential in boosting CD47 blockade&#8208;based antitumor immunotherapy.

         <title>A Carbon Aerogel Lightweight Al Battery for Fast Storage of Fluctuating Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lightweight Al battery is constructed using a dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and a high&#8208;loading integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF induce Al deposition. The zero&#8208;volume expansion of the GCAF results in better stability. A CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery exhibits excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance toward fast storage of fluctuating electricity.








Abstract
Al batteries have great potential for renewable energy storage owing to their low cost, high capacity, and safety. High energy density and adaptability to fluctuating electricity are major challenges. Here, a lightweight Al battery for fast storage of fluctuating energy is constructed based on a novel hierarchical porous dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and an integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. A new induced mechanism by the O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF anode is con&#8208;firmed for uniform Al deposition. The GCAF cathode possesses a higher mass utilization ratio due to the extremely high loading mass (9.5&#8211;10.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) of graphite materials compared to conventional coated cathodes. Meanwhile, the volume expansion of the GCAF cathode is almost negligible, resulting in better cycling stability. The lightweight CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery can adapt well to large and fluctuating current densities owing to its hierarchical porous structure. A large discharge capacity (115.6 mAh g&#8722;1) after 2000 cycles and a short charge time (7.0&#160;min) at a high current density are obtained. The construction strategy of lightweight Al batteries based on carbon aerogel electrodes can promote the breakthrough of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Al batteries adapted to the fast storage of fluctuating renewable energy.

         <title>How to Adequately Describe Full Range Intercalation&#8212;A Two&#8208;Sided Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate description of the cell voltage of an intercalation electrode succeeds by applying defect thermodynamics near the ordered compositions. At large deviations thermodynamic interpolation (as indicated in the figure) or non&#8208;ideal statistics is required. Literature data on nanocrystalline LixFePO4 are reproduced where the entire range is realized, but other materials can be described analogously (i, n, v, and p stand for interstitial Li+, excess electrons, Li+ vacancies, electron holes; C&#948; denotes the chemical capacitance; electronic defects are not shown in the figure).








Abstract
One of the key challenges in battery research is to quantitatively describe the intercalation storage capacity as a function of the reversible cell voltage. The reason that such endeavors are not yet very successful, lies in the lack of an adequate charge carrier treatment. Using the most challenging example of nanocrystalline lithium iron phosphate, where the full range from FePO4 to LiFePO4 is accessible without miscibility gap, this study shows how a quantitative description of literature results can be achieved even for such a huge window. For this purpose, point&#8208;defect thermodynamics is applied and the problem is tackled from the two end&#8208;member sides including saturation effects. A first, rather heuristic treatment interpolates in&#8208;between using the safe thermodynamic criterion of local phase stability. Already this straightforward approach works very satisfactorily. In order to also gain mechanistic insight, interactions among and between ions and electrons have to be taken account of. This study shows how to implement them into the analysis.

         <title>Quantifying Charge Extraction and Recombination Using the Rise and Decay of the Transient Photovoltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rise time of transient photovoltage measurements on halide perovskite solar cells is used to quantify charge extraction. As the decay time of the photovoltage can be used to quantify recombination, the combination of rise and decay provides a complete analysis of recombination and extraction and its impact on photovoltaic performance.








Abstract
The extraction of photogenerated charge carriers and the generation of a photovoltage belong to the fundamental functionalities of any solar cell. These processes happen not instantaneously but rather come with finite time constants, e.g., a time constant related to the rise of the externally measured open circuit voltage following a short light pulse. Herein, a new method to analyze transient photovoltage measurements at different bias light intensities combining rise and decay times of the photovoltage. The approach uses a linearized version of a system of two coupled differential equations that are solved analytically by determining the eigenvalues of a 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 matrix. By comparison between the eigenvalues and the measured rise and decay times during a transient photovoltage measurement, the rates of carrier recombination and extraction as a function of bias voltage are determined, and establish a simple link between their ratio and the efficiency losses in the perovskite solar cell.

         <title>Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom and Clustered Catalysts Outperform Benchmark Pt for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium cobalt oxide substrate provides active sites for the dissociation of water, and the generated H intermediates recombine to generate H2 on the Ru single atoms or clusters. Comparing the two kinds of Ru sites, Ru cluster dominates the alkaline HER activity due to the more fluent migration of H intermediates and its more favorable adsorption&#8211;desorption energetics toward H intermediates.








Abstract
Guaranteeing satisfactory catalytic behavior while ensuring high metal utilization has become the problem that needs to be addressed when designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for electrochemical reactions. Here, well&#8208;dispersed ruthenium (Ru) based clusters with adjacent Ru single atoms (SAs) on layered sodium cobalt oxide (Ru/NC) are demonstrated as a superb electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. The Ru/NC catalyst demonstrates an activity increase by a factor of two relative to the commercial Pt/C. Operando characterizations in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) simulations uncover the origin of the superior activity and establish a structure&#8211;performance relationship, that is, under HER condition, the real active species are Ru SAs and metallic Ru clusters supported on the NC substrate. The excellent alkaline HER activity of the Ru/NC catalyst can be understood by a spatially decoupled water dissociation and hydrogen desorption mechanism, where the NC substrate accelerates the water dissociation rate, and the generated H intermediates would then migrate to the Ru SAs or clusters and recombine to have H2 evolution. More importantly, comparing the two forms of Ru sites, it is the Ru cluster that dominates the HER activity.

         <title>A Multifunctional Additive Strategy Enables Efficient Pure&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;functional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate performs three functions on perovskites: dimensionality control, defect passivation, and surface modification. Consequently, the optimized devices exhibit a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 11.87% at 468&#160;nm, the highest reported to date for pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting devices.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites have shown exceptional performance in light&#8208;emitting devices (PeLEDs), particularly in producing significant electroluminescence in sky&#8208;blue to near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. However, PeLEDs emitting pure&#8208;blue light at 465&#8211;475 nm are still not satisfactory. Herein, efficient and stable pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs are reported by controlling phase distribution, passivation of defects, as well as surface modifications using multifunctional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate (PEATFA) in reduced&#8208;dimensional p&#8208;F&#8208;PEA2Csn&#8722;1Pbn(Br0.55Cl0.45)3n+1 polycrystalline perovskite films. Compared with 4&#8208;fluorophenylethylammonium (p&#8208;F&#8208;PEA+) in the pristine films, phenylethylammonium (PEA+) has lower adsorption energy while interacting with perovskites, resulting in large&#8208;n low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, which can greatly facilitate charge transport within the low&#8208;dimensional perovskite films. The interaction between the C&#63742;O group in trifluoroacetate (TFA&#8722;) and perovskites significantly reduces defects in the perovskite films. Additionally, the electron&#8208;giving &#63743;CF3 group in TFA&#8208; uplifts surface potential in the films, resulting in smooth electronic injection in devices. The multifunctional additive strategy leads to elevated radiative recombination and efficient carrier transport in the films and devices. As a result, the devices exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.87% at 468 nm with stable spectral output, the highest reported to date for pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs. Thus, this study extends the way for high&#8208;efficiency pure&#8208;blue LED with perovskite polycrystal films.

Herein, efficient and stable pure-blue PeLEDs are reported by controlling phase distribution, passivation of defects, as well as surface modifications using multifunctional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate (PEATFA) in reduced-dimensional p-F-PEA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(Br&lt;sub&gt;0.55&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;0.45&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt; polycrystalline perovskite films. Compared with 4-fluorophenylethylammonium (p-F-PEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in the pristine films, phenylethylammonium (PEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) has lower adsorption energy while interacting with perovskites, resulting in large-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; low-dimensional perovskites, which can greatly facilitate charge transport within the low-dimensional perovskite films. The interaction between the C&#63742;O group in trifluoroacetate (TFA&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and perovskites significantly reduces defects in the perovskite films. Additionally, the electron-giving &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group in TFA- uplifts surface potential in the films, resulting in smooth electronic injection in devices. The multifunctional additive strategy leads to elevated radiative recombination and efficient carrier transport in the films and devices. As a result, the devices exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.87% at 468 nm with stable spectral output, the highest reported to date for pure-blue PeLEDs. Thus, this study extends the way for high-efficiency pure-blue LED with perovskite polycrystal films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergetic Enhancement of Strength&#8211;Ductility and Thermoelectric Properties of Ag2Te by Domain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanodomain strategy for improving the mechanical and thermoelectric properties of materials simultaneously is presented. Ag2Te with suppressed lattice thermal conductivity and improved strength&#8211;ductility synergy is achieved. These findings provide new insights into grain and domain boundary engineering for high&#8208;performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical strength&#8211;ductility synergy.








Abstract
Simultaneously improving the mechanical and thermoelectric (TE) properties is significant for the engineering applications of inorganic TE materials. In this work, a novel nanodomain strategy is developed for Ag2Te compounds to yield 40% and 200% improved compressive strength (160&#160;MPa) and fracture strain (16%) when compared to domain&#8208;free samples (115&#160;MPa and 5.5%, respectively). The domained samples also achieve a 45% improvement in average ZT value. The domain boundaries (DBs) provide extra sites for dislocation nucleation while pinning the dislocation movement, resulting in superior strength and ductility. In addition, phonon scattering induced by DBs suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity of Ag2Te and also reduces the weighted mobility. These findings provide new insights into grain and DB engineering for high&#8208;performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical properties.

Active Metamaterials
In article number 2303541, Ruike Renee Zhao and co&#8208;workers present a novel magneto&#8208;mechanical metamaterial that employs a double&#8208;layer design to change area density while preserving the overall area for good conformability during actuation. Magnetic actuation facilitates rapid and reversible structural deformation between multiple modes. This allows for the metamaterial to control the propagation of in&#8208;plane elastic waves of different frequencies.

Physical Unclonable Functions
In article number 2302135, Dong Ki Yoon and co&#8208;workers present a framework for the creation of physical unclonable function (PUF)&#8208;based authentication labels using DNA. The platform leverages the inherent stochastic birefringent pattern that emerges through the entropy&#8208;driven instability during the drying process of aqueous DNA solutions. By harnessing the disclinations within the DNA film, secure security codes are generated, exhibiting a level of randomness that ensures robust high&#8208;level security measures.

Gas Sensors
In article number 2302219, Suk Yeop Chun, Young Geun Song, Chong&#8208;Yun Kang, Jung Ho Yoon, and co&#8208;workers propose a hysteretic &#8220;chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor&#8221; based on oxygen&#8208;vacancy chemi&#8208;memristive dynamics that differ from that of conventional gas sensors. Based on the advantageous functionality of the sensor, including fast responses, short recovery times, and hysteretic gas response, device&#8208;level olfactory systems that can monitor the history of input gas stimuli are experimentally demonstrated.

Organic Electrochemical Transistors
In article number 2300308, Natalie Banerji and co&#8208;workers present an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) based on a conjugated polymer film. Switching on the transistor leads to oxidation of the polymer, forming polarons and bipolarons. The charges are compensated by ions that enter the film from the electrolyte. Using time&#8208;resolved spectroelectrochemistry, they show that polarons prefer the ordered regions of the film, while bipolarons are generated in the amorphous regions.

         <title>Understanding and Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination Losses in Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimizing non&#8208;radiative recombination losses in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene solar cells is of utmost importance in order to achieve power conversion efficiencies over 20% in the future. This review discusses methods to accurately quantify non&#8208;radiative voltage losses as well as the current understanding of their origin and empirical strategies for reducing them.








Abstract
Organic solar cells benefit from non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFA) due to their high absorption coefficients, tunable frontier energy levels, and optical gaps, as well as their relatively high luminescence quantum efficiencies as compared to fullerenes. Those merits result in high yields of charge generation at a low or negligible energetic offset at the donor/NFA heterojunction, with efficiencies over 19% achieved for single&#8208;junction devices. Pushing this value significantly over 20% requires an increase in open&#8208;circuit voltage, which is currently still well below the thermodynamic limit. This can only be achieved by reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination, and hereby increasing the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the photo&#8208;active layer. Here, current understanding of the origin of non&#8208;radiative decay, as well as an accurate quantification of the associated voltage losses are summarized. Promising strategies for suppressing these losses are highlighted, with focus on new material design, optimization of donor&#8211;acceptor combination, and blend morphology. This review aims at guiding researchers in their quest to find future solar harvesting donor&#8211;acceptor blends, which combine a high yield of exciton dissociation with a high yield of radiative free carrier recombination and low voltage losses, hereby closing the efficiency gap with inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Bifunctional Single Atom Catalysts for Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries: From Dynamic Mechanism to Rational Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the dynamic oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms, the rational regulations for various single atom catalysts (SACs) to improve their bifunctional activity and stability, and the challenges and future perspectives of bifunctional SACs for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8211;air batteries are discussed systematically.








Abstract
Ever&#8208;growing demands for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) call for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. Among various electrocatalysts, single atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to the merits of high atom utilization, structural tunability, and remarkable activity. Rational design of bifunctional SACs relies heavily on an in&#8208;depth understanding of reaction mechanisms, especially dynamic evolution under electrochemical conditions. This requires a systematic study in dynamic mechanisms to replace current trial and error modes. Herein, fundamental understanding of dynamic oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms for SACs is first presented combining in situ and/or operando characterizations and theoretical calculations. By highlighting structure&#8211;performance relationships, rational regulation strategies are particularly proposed to facilitate the design of efficient bifunctional SACs. Furthermore, future perspectives and challenges are discussed. This review provides a thorough understanding of dynamic mechanisms and regulation strategies for bifunctional SACs, which are expected to pave the avenue for exploring optimum single atom bifunctional oxygen catalysts and effective ZABs.

Herein, fundamental understanding of dynamic oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms for SACs is first presented combining in situ and/or operando characterizations and theoretical calculations. By highlighting structure&#8211;performance relationships, rational regulation strategies are particularly proposed to facilitate the design of efficient bifunctional SACs. Furthermore, future perspectives and challenges are discussed. This review provides a thorough understanding of dynamic mechanisms and regulation strategies for bifunctional SACs, which are expected to pave the avenue for exploring optimum single atom bifunctional oxygen catalysts and effective ZABs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In the review, it is not only focused on reviewing dendritic polymer electrolytes (PEs) in basic concept, synthesis methodologies, balancing of properties, ion transport mechanism, etc. but also try to outline the possibility of dendritic PEs toward on&#8208;demand design. It is believed that including examples of designing advanced/safe dendritic PEs will show the readers a more comprehensive prospect of this burgeoning field.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ions battery is widely used and recognized, but its energy density based on organic electrolytes has approached the theoretical upper limit, while the use of organic electrolytes also brings some safety hazards (leakage and flammability). Polymer electrolytes (PEs) are expected to fundamentally solve the safety problem and improve energy density. Therefore, Li&#8208;ions battery based on solid PE has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, low ionic conductivity and poor mechanical properties, as well as a narrow electrochemical window limit its further development. Dendritic PEs with unique topology structure has low crystallinity, high segmental mobility, and reduced chain entanglement, providing a new avenue for designing high&#8208;performance PEs. In this review, the basic concept and synthetic chemistry of dendritic polymers are first introduced. Then, this story will turn to how to balance the mechanical properties, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical stability of dendritic PEs from synthetic chemistry. In addition, accomplishments on dendritic PEs based on different synthesis strategies and recent advances in battery applications are summarized and discussed. Subsequently, the ionic transport mechanism and interfacial interaction are deeply analyzed. In the end, the challenges and prospects are outlined to promote further development in this booming field.

         <title>Flexible and Stretchable Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Physiological Sensing Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are an emerging class of organic electronic building blocks exhibiting significant advantages for developing flexible/stretchable physiological sensors. This review discusses structure, operation, critical features, a wide spectrum of physiological sensing mechanisms and uses, as well as major challenges and opportunities for flexible/stretchable OECTs, particularly for biochemical and bioelectrical sensor applications.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable bioelectronics provides a biocompatible interface between electronics and biological systems and has received tremendous attention for in situ monitoring of various biological systems. Considerable progress in organic electronics has made organic semiconductors, as well as other organic electronic materials, ideal candidates for developing wearable, implantable, and biocompatible electronic circuits due to their potential mechanical compliance and biocompatibility. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as an emerging class of organic electronic building blocks, exhibit significant advantages in biological sensing due to the ionic nature at the basis of the switching behavior, low driving voltage (&lt;1 V), and high transconductance (in millisiemens range). During the past few years, significant progress in constructing flexible/stretchable OECTs (FSOECTs) for both biochemical and bioelectrical sensors has been reported. In this regard, to summarize major research accomplishments in this emerging field, this review first discusses structure and critical features of FSOECTs, including working principles, materials, and architectural engineering. Next, a wide spectrum of relevant physiological sensing applications, where FSOECTs are the key components, are summarized. Last, major challenges and opportunities for further advancing FSOECT physiological sensors are discussed.

         <title>Cancer Models on Chip: Paving the Way to Large&#8208;Scale Trial Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>

ToC devices may become state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art models for pharmaceutical oncology trials. To achieve this, the ToC should present reliability in mimicking the TME and monitoring biophysical and chemical signals using sensors and actuators. The translation of this technology to the industrial scale must take into consideration scalability and the standardization of the materials/biomaterials, architectures, actuators, and integration with analytical tools.








Abstract
Cancer kills millions of individuals every year all over the world (Global Cancer Observatory). The physiological and biomechanical processes underlying the tumor are still poorly understood, hindering researchers from creating new, effective therapies. Inconsistent results of preclinical research, in vivo testing, and clinical trials decrease drug approval rates. 3D tumor&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (ToC) models integrate biomaterials, tissue engineering, fabrication of microarchitectures, and sensory and actuation systems in a single device, enabling reliable studies in fundamental oncology and pharmacology. This review includes a critical discussion about their ability to reproduce the tumor microenvironment (TME), the advantages and drawbacks of existing tumor models and architectures, major components and fabrication techniques. The focus is on current materials and micro/nanofabrication techniques used to manufacture reliable and reproducible microfluidic ToC models for large&#8208;scale trial applications.
