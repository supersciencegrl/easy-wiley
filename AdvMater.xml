         <title>An Asymmetry Field&#8208;Effect Phototransistor for Solving Large Exciton Binding Energy of 2D TMDCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The probing of fundamental photophysics is a key prerequisite for the construction of diverse optoelectronic devices and circuits. To date, though, photocarrier dynamics in two&#8208;dimensional materials remains unclear, plagued primarily by two issues: a large exciton binding energy, and the lack of a suitable system that enables the manipulation of excitons. Here, we demonstrate a WSe2&#8208;based phototransistor with an asymmetric split&#8208;gate configuration, which we name the asymmetry field&#8208;effect phototransistor (AFEPT). This structure allows for the effective modulation of the electric field profile across the channel, thereby providing a standard device platform for exploring the photocarrier dynamics of the intrinsic WSe2 layer. By controlling the electric field, we observed in this work the spatial evolution of the photocurrent, notably with a strong signal over the entire WSe2 channel. Using photocurrent and optical spectroscopy measurements, we clarified the physical origin of the novel photocurrent behavior and determined a room temperature exciton binding energy of 210 meV with our device. In our phototransistor geometry, lateral p&#8208;n junctions serve as a simultaneous pathway for both photogenerated electrons and holes, reducing their recombination rate and thus enhancing photodetection. Our study establishes a new device platform for both fundamental studies and technological applications.

         <title>Microfluidic Screening&#8208;Assisted Machine Learning to Investigate Vertical Phase Separation of Small Molecule:Polymer Blend</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film processing is a widely utilized technique for the fabrication of various devices. In particular, the tunability of the ink composition and coating condition allow precise control of thin&#8208;film properties and device performance. Despite the advantage of having such tunability, the sheer number of possible combinations of slce parameters render it infeasible to efficiently optimize device performance and analyze the correlation between experimental parameters and device performance. In this work, microfluidic screening&#8208;embedded thin&#8208;film processing technique is developed, through which thin&#8208;films of varying ratios of small molecule semiconductor:polymer blend were simultaneously generated and screened in a time&#8208; and resource&#8208;efficient manner. Moreover, utilizing the thin&#8208;films of varying combinations of experimental parameters, machine learning models were trained to predict the transistor performance. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithms tuned by Bayesian optimization showed the best predictive accuracy amongst the trained models, which enables narrowing down of the combinations of experimental parameters and investigation of the degree of vertical phase separation under the predicted parameter space. Our technique can serve as a guideline for elucidating the underlying complex parameter&#8208;property&#8208;performance correlations in solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film processing, thereby accelerating the optimization of various thin&#8208;film devices in the future.

         <title>Scalable van der Waals Encapsulation by Inorganic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Encapsulation is critical for devices to guarantee their stability and reliability. It becomes an even more essential requirement for devices based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with atomic thinness and far inferior stability compared to their bulk counterparts. Here we report a general van der Waals (vdW) encapsulation method for 2D materials using Sb2O3 layer of inorganic molecular crystal fabricated via thermal evaporation deposition. We demonstrate that such a scalable encapsulation method not only maintains the intrinsic properties of typical air&#8208;susceptible 2D materials due to their vdW interactions but also remarkably improves their environmental stability. Specifically, the encapsulated black phosphorus (BP) exhibits greatly enhanced structural stability of over 80 days and more sustaining electronic properties of 19 days while the bare BP undergoes degradation within hours. Moreover, our encapsulation layer can be facilely removed by sublimation in vacuum without damaging the underlying materials. This scalable encapsulation method shows a promising pathway to effectively enhance the environmental stability of 2D materials, which may further boost their practical application in novel (opto)electronic devices.

         <title>Elastic plasmonic&#8208;enhanced Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities with ultrasensitive stretching tunability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The emerging stretchable photonics field faces challenges like the robust integration of optical elements into elastic matrices or the generation of large opto&#8208;mechanical effects. Here we demonstrate the first stretchable plasmonic enhanced and wrinkled Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities, which are composed of self&#8208;embedded arrays of Au nanostructures at controlled depths into elastomer films. The novel self&#8208;embedding process is triggered by the Au nanostructures catalytic activity, which locally increases the polymer curing rate, thereby inducing a mechanical stress that simultaneously pulls the Au nanostructures into the polymer and forms a wrinkled skin layer. This geometry yields unprecedented opto&#8208;mechanical effects produced by the coupling of the broad plasmonic modes of the Au nanostructures and the Fabry&#8208;Perot modes, which are modulated by the wrinkled optical cavity. As a result, film stretching induces drastic changes in both the spectral position and intensity of the plasmonic enhanced Fabry&#8208;Perot resonances due to the simultaneous cavity thickness reduction and cavity wrinkle flattening, thus increasing the cavity finesse. We exploit these opto&#8208;mechanical effects to demonstrate new strain sensing approaches, achieving a strain detection limit of 0.006%, i.e., 16&#8208;fold lower than current optical strain detection schemes.

         <title>Revealing the Sulfur Redox Paths in a Li&#8211;S Battery by an In&#8208;Situ Hyphenated Technique of Electrochemistry and Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery is one of the most promising next genertion energy storage systems due to its high theoretical specific energy. However, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides formed during cell operation is a crucial reason for the low cyclability suffered by current Li&#8208;S batteries. As a result, an in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the sulfur cathode redox reactions is urgently required for further adancement of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, we report the direct observation of polysulfides in a Li&#8208;S battery by an in&#8208;situ hyphenated technique of electrochemistry and mass spectrometry. Several short&#8208;lived lithium polysulfide intermediates during sulfur redox have been identified. Furthermore, we apply this method to a mechanistic study of an electrocatalyst that has been observed to promote the polysulfides conversion in a Li&#8208;S cell. Through the abundance distributions of various polysulfides before and after adding the electrocatalyst, compelling experimental evidences of catalytic selectivity of cobalt phthalocyanine to those long&#8208;chain polysulfide intermediates are obtained. This work could provide guidance for the design of novel cathode to overcome the shuttle effect and facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics.

Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting technology for producing &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; is important for the global mission of carbon neutrality. Electrocatalysts with decent performance at high current densities play a central role in the industrial implementation of this technology. This field has advanced immensely in recent years, as witnessed by many types of catalysts designed and synthesized toward industrially&#8208;relevant current densities (&gt; 200&#160;mA cm&#8211;2). By discussing recent advances in this field, we summarize several key aspects that affect the catalytic performance for high&#8208;current&#8208;density electrocatalysis, including dimensionality of catalysts, surface chemistry, electron transport path, morphology, and catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interplay. We highlight the multiscale design strategy that considers these aspects comprehensively for developing high&#8208;current&#8208;density electrocatalysts. We also put forward our perspectives on the future directions in this emerging field.

         <title>Simultaneous Interfacial Modification and Crystallization Control by Biguanide Hydrochloride for Stable Perovskite Solar Cell with PCE of 24.4%</title>

Abstract
Interfacial modification that serves multiple roles is vital for the fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. Here, a multi&#8208;functional interfacial material, biguanide hydrochloride (BGCl), is introduced between SnO2 and perovskite to enhance electron extraction as well as crystal growth of perovskite. The BGCl can chemically link to the SnO2 through Lewis coordination/electrostatic coupling and help to anchor the PbI2. Better energetic alignment, reduced interfacial defects and homogeneous perovskite crystallites are achieved, yielding an impressive certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.4%, with an open circuit voltage of 1.19&#160;V and a drastically improved fill factor of 82.4%. More importantly, the unencapsulated device maintains 95% of its initial PCE after aging for over 500 h at 20 &#8451; and 30% relative humidity in ambient conditions. These results suggest that the incorporation of BGCl is a promising strategy to modify the interface and control the crystallization of the perovskite, towards the attainment of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells as well as other perovskite&#8208;based electronics.

         <title>Preparation of fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Heterophase Pd@Ir Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd@Ir core&#8211;shell nanostructures with fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc heterophase and different Pd/Ir atomic ratios are prepared via seeded phase&#8208;selective epitaxial growth. The fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc&#8208;heterophase Pd45@Ir55 nanodendrites exhibit superior catalytic performance toward electrochemical hydrogen evolution. This work offers new opportunities toward the rational synthesis of novel heterophase nanostructures and paves a way to the phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) for various promising applications.








Abstract
With the development of phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN), construction of noble&#8208;metal heterostructures with unconventional crystal phases, including heterophases, has been proposed as an attractive approach toward the rational design of highly efficient catalysts. However, it still remains challenging to realize the controlled preparation of such unconventional&#8208;phase noble&#8208;metal heterostructures and explore their crystal&#8208;phase&#8208;dependent applications. Here, various Pd@Ir core&#8211;shell nanostructures are synthesized with unconventional fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc heterophase (2H: hexagonal close&#8208;packed; fcc: face&#8208;centered cubic) through a wet&#8208;chemical seeded method. As a result, heterophase Pd66@Ir34 nanoparticles, Pd45@Ir55 multibranched nanodendrites, and Pd68@Ir22Co10 trimetallic nanoparticles are obtained via the phase&#8208;selective epitaxial growth of fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc&#8208;heterophase Ir&#8208;based nanostructures on 2H&#8208;Pd seeds. Importantly, the heterophase Pd45@Ir55 nanodendrites exhibit excellent catalytic performance toward electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions. An overpotential of only 11.0&#160;mV is required to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 on Pd45@Ir55 nanodendrites, which is lower than those of the conventional fcc&#8208;Pd47@Ir53 counterparts, commercial Ir/C and Pt/C. This work not only demonstrates an appealing route to synthesize novel heterophase nanomaterials for promising applications in the emerging field of PEN, but also highlights the significant role of the crystal phase in determining their catalytic properties.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Switchable Laser via Optical Pumping of Rubrene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and operation of a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind magnetically switchable laser is reported. The dependence of singlet&#8208;exciton fission on magnetic field is exploited to drive the gain medium below and above the lasing threshold using an external magnetic field. Magnetic switching results in a +360% modulation in output intensity, the largest magnetically induced change in brightness from a singlet&#8208;fission system to date.








Abstract
Volumetric optical imaging of magnetic fields is challenging with existing magneto&#8208;optical materials, motivating the search for dyes with strong magnetic field interactions, distinct emission spectra, and an ability to withstand high photon flux and incorporation within samples. Here, the magnetic field effect on singlet&#8208;exciton fission is exploited to demonstrate spatial imaging of magnetic fields in a thin film of rubrene. Doping rubrene with the high&#8208;quantum yield dye dibenzotetraphenylperiflanthene (DBP) is shown to enable optically pumped, slab waveguide lasing. This laser is magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;switchable: when operated just below the lasing threshold, application of a 0.4 T magnetic field switches the device between nonlasing and lasing modes, accompanied by an intensity modulation of +360%. This is thought to be the first demonstration of a magnetically switchable laser, as well as the largest magnetically induced change in emission brightness in a singlet&#8208;fission material to date. These results demonstrate that singlet&#8208;fission materials are promising materials for magnetic sensing applications and could inspire a new class of magneto&#8208;optical modulators.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8211;MoS2 Integrated Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area transistor circuits are successfully fabricated using solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene as source/drain and gate contact electrodes, wafer&#8208;scale MoS2 film as the channel, and an ultrathin HfO2/Al2O3 layer of about 8&#160;nm as the dielectric layer. The high yield and performance uniformity of the device array indicate great potential for Ti3C2Tx MXene in large&#8208;area ultrathin 2D electronics.








Abstract
It is very challenging to employ solution&#8208;processed conducting films in large&#8208;area ultrathin nanoelectronics. Here, spray&#8208;coated Ti3C2Tx MXene films as metal contacts are successfully integrated into sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gate oxide 2D MoS2 transistor circuits. Ti3C2Tx films are spray coated on glass substrates followed by vacuum annealing. Compared to the as&#8208;prepared sample, vacuum annealed films exhibit a higher conductivity (&#8776;11&#8201;000 S cm&#8722;1) and a lower work function (&#8776;4.5&#160;eV). Besides, the annealed Ti3C2Tx film can be patterned through a standard cleanroom process without peeling off. The annealed Ti3C2Tx film shows a better band alignment for n&#8208;type transport in MoS2 channel with small work function mismatch of 0.06&#160;eV. The MoS2 film can be uniformly transferred on the patterned Ti3C2Tx surface and then readily processed through the cleanroom process. A large&#8208;area array of Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8211;MoS2 transistors is fabricated using different dielectric thicknesses and semiconducting channel sizes. High yield and stable performance for these transistor arrays even with an 8&#160;nm&#8208;thick dielectric layer are demonstrated. Besides, several circuits are demonstrated, including rectifiers, negative&#8208;channel metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (NMOS) inverters, and voltage&#8208;shift NMOS inverters. Overall, this work indicates the tremendous potential for solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene films in large&#8208;area 2D nanoelectronics.

&lt;/i&gt; MXene films as metal contacts are successfully integrated into sub-10&#160;nm gate oxide 2D MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transistor circuits. Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; films are spray coated on glass substrates followed by vacuum annealing. Compared to the as-prepared sample, vacuum annealed films exhibit a higher conductivity (&#8776;11&#8201;000 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a lower work function (&#8776;4.5&#160;eV). Besides, the annealed Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; film can be patterned through a standard cleanroom process without peeling off. The annealed Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; film shows a better band alignment for n-type transport in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel with small work function mismatch of 0.06&#160;eV. The MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; film can be uniformly transferred on the patterned Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; surface and then readily processed through the cleanroom process. A large-area array of Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; MXene&#8211;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transistors is fabricated using different dielectric thicknesses and semiconducting channel sizes. High yield and stable performance for these transistor arrays even with an 8&#160;nm-thick dielectric layer are demonstrated. Besides, several circuits are demonstrated, including rectifiers, negative-channel metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (NMOS) inverters, and voltage-shift NMOS inverters. Overall, this work indicates the tremendous potential for solution-processed Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; MXene films in large-area 2D nanoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antiferromagnetism in Ni&#8208;Based Superconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging Ni&#8208;based infinite&#8208;layer superconducting oxide thin films mark the birth of the Ni age of superconductivity, which may differ from well&#8208;known high&#8208;temperature superconducting cuprates and Fe&#8208;based superconductors because no magnetic order is known in their bulk parent compounds. However, it has now been surprisingly discovered that long&#8208;range antiferromagnetism coexists with superconductivity in infinite&#8208;layer nickelate thin films.








Abstract
Due to the lack of any magnetic order down to 1.7 K in the parent bulk compound NdNiO2, the recently discovered 9&#8211;15 K superconductivity in the infinite&#8208;layer Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 thin films has provided an exciting playground for unearthing new superconductivity mechanisms. Herein, the successful synthesis of a series of superconducting Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 thin films ranging from 8 to 40&#160;nm is reported. The large exchange bias effect is observed between the superconducting Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 films and a thin ferromagnetic layer, which suggests the existence of the antiferromagnetic order. Furthermore, the existence of the antiferromagnetic order is evidenced by X&#8208;ray magnetic linear dichroism measurements. These experimental results are fundamentally critical for the current field.

         <title>Highly Efficient Photothermal Conversion and Water Transport during Solar Evaporation Enabled by Amorphous Hollow Multishelled Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous Ta2O5/C nanocomposite with a hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is prepared for the first time. This HoMS results in highly efficient energy conversion and rapid water transport, achieving superfast evaporation speed with long&#8208;term stability. A World Health Organization standard drinkable water can be achieved from seawater, water containing metallic ions, and extremely acidic/alkaline , radioactive, and virus&#8208;polluted water.








Abstract
Solar evaporation, which enables water purification without consuming fossil fuels, has been considered the most promising strategy to address global scarcity of drinkable water. However, the suboptimal structure and composition designs still result in a trade&#8208;off between photothermal conversion, water transport, and tolerance to harsh environments. Here, an ultrastable amorphous Ta2O5/C nanocomposite is designed with a hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) for solar evaporation. This HoMS results in highly efficient photoabsorption and photothermal conversion, as well as a decrease of the actual water evaporation enthalpy. A superfast evaporation speed of 4.02&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 is achieved. More importantly, a World Health Organization standard drinkable water can be achieved from seawater, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208; and bacteria&#8208;containing water, and even from extremely acidic/alkaline or radioactive water sources. Notably, the concentration of pseudovirus SC2&#8208;P can be decreased by 6 orders of magnitude after evaporation.

         <title>Multiscale Understanding of Surface Structural Effects on High&#8208;Temperature Operational Resiliency of Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature calendar aging and thermal runaway have led to severe performance decay and safety concerns regarding battery cathodes. By using a combination of various in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray and electron microscopy techniques, a multiscale understanding of surface structure effects in regulating the high&#8208;temperature operational resilience of polycrystalline Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes is reported.








Abstract
The worldwide energy demand in electric vehicles and the increasing global temperature have called for development of high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with improved high&#8208;temperature operational resiliency. However, current attention has been mostly focused on cycling aging at elevated temperature, leaving considerable gaps of knowledge in the failure mechanism, and practical control of abusive calendar aging and thermal runaway that are highly related to the eventual operational lifetime and safety performance of LIBs. Herein, using a combination of various in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray and electron microscopy techniques, a multiscale understanding of surface structure effects involved in regulating the high&#8208;temperature operational tolerance of polycrystalline Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes is reported. The results collectively show that an ultraconformal poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) coating can effectively prevent a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode from undergoing undesired phase transformation and transition metal dissolution on the surface, atomic displacement, and dislocations within primary particles, intergranular cracking along the grain boundaries within secondary particles, and intensive bulk oxygen release during high state&#8208;of&#8208;charge and high&#8208;temperature aging. The present work highlights the essential role of surface structure controls in overcoming the multiscale degradation pathways of high&#8208;energy battery materials at extreme temperature.

         <title>A &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained Metal twins&#8221; Strategy to Prepare Efficient dual&#8208;metal atom Catalysts for Cooperative Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal atom center catalysts (DACs) are a novel frontier in oxygen electrocatalysis, boasting functional and electronic synergies between contiguous metal centers and higher catalytic activities than single atom center catalysts. However, the definition and catalytic mechanism of DACs configurations remain unclear. Here, a &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained metal twins&#8221; strategy was proposed to prepare contiguous FeN4 and CoN4 DACs with homogeneous conformations embedded in an N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC). A programmable phthalocyanines dimer was used as a structural moiety to anchor the bimetallic sites (containing Co and Fe) in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) to achieve delocalized dispersion before pyrolysis. The resultant FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC exhibited excellent electrochemical performance in oxygen electrocatalysis and rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the synergetic interaction of adjacent metals optimized the d&#8208;band center position of metal centers and balanced the free energy of the *O intermediate, thereby improving the oxygen electrocatalytic activity. This work opens up an avenue for the rational design of DACs with tailored electronic structures and uniform geometric configurations.

         <title>Growth of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials at the Wafer Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth has become a critical bottleneck for scaling up applications of van der Waal (vdW) layered two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials in high&#8208;end electronics and optoelectronics. Most vdW 2D materials were initially obtained through top&#8208;down synthesis methods, such as exfoliation, which can only prepare small flakes on a micrometer scale. Bottom&#8208;up growth can enable 2D flake growth over a large area. However, seamless merging of these flakes to form large&#8208;area continuous films with well&#8208;controlled layer thickness and lattice orientation is still a significant challenge. In this review, we briefly introduce several vdW layered 2D materials covering their lattice structures, representative physical properties, and potential roles in large&#8208;scale applications. Then, several methods used to grow vdW layered 2D materials at the wafer&#8208;scale are reviewed in depth. In particular, we summarize three strategies that enable 2D film growth with a single&#8208;crystalline structure over the whole wafer: growth of an isolated domain, growth of unidirectional domains, and conversion of oriented precursors. After that, we review the progress in using wafer&#8208;scale 2D materials in integrated devices and advanced epitaxy. Finally, future directions in the growth and scaling of vdW layered 2D materials are discussed.

         <title>Anionic Redox Regulated via Metal&#8211;Ligand Combinations in Layered Sulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathodes utilizing anionic redox chemistry have higher energy density, but are still accompanied by reversibility problems. In this work, by regulating metal&#8211;ligand combinations, it is found that strong covalency between cations and anions can stabilize holes, and grants the cathode with better electron conductivity, prevents irreversible anion dimerization and cation migration, and thus restrains voltage hysteresis and voltage decay issues.








Abstract
The increasing demand for energy storage is calling for improvements in cathode performance. In traditional layered cathodes, the higher energy of the metal 3d over the O 2p orbital results in one&#8208;band cationic redox; capacity solely from cations cannot meet the needs for higher energy density. Emerging anionic redox chemistry is promising to access higher capacity. In recent studies, the low&#8208;lying O nonbonding 2p orbital was&#160;designed to activate one&#8208;band oxygen redox, but they are still accompanied by reversibility problems like oxygen loss, irreversible cation migration, and voltage decay. Herein, by regulating the metal&#8211;ligand energy level, both extra capacities provided by anionic redox and highly reversible anionic redox process are realized in NaCr1&#8722;yVyS2 system. The simultaneous cationic and anionic redox of Cr/V and S is observed by in situ X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Under high d&#8211;p hybridization, the strong covalent interaction stabilizes the holes on the anions, prevents irreversible dimerization and cation migration, and restrains voltage hysteresis and voltage decay. The work provides a fundamental understanding of highly reversible anionic redox in layered compounds, and demonstrates the feasibility of anionic redox chemistry based on hybridized bands with d&#8211;p covalence.

         <title>Self&#8208;blockade of PD&#8208;L1 with bacteria&#8208;derived outer&#8208;membrane vesicle for enhanced cancer immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
The checkpoint inhibitor therapy that blocks the Programmed Death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) and its major ligand PD&#8208;L1; has achieved encouraging clinical efficacy in certain cancers. However; the binding of checkpoint inhibitors with other immune cells that express PD&#8208;L1 often results in a low response rate to the blockade and severe adverse effects. Herein; we developed a LyP1 polypeptide&#8208;modified outer&#8208;membrane vesicle (LOMV) loaded with a PD&#8208;1 plasmid to achieve self&#8208;blockade of PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells. The nanocarriers accumulated in the tumor tissue through OMV&#8208;targeting ability and were internalized into the tumor cells via LyP1&#8208;mediated target; subsequently delivering PD&#8208;1 plasmid into the nucleus; leading to the expression of PD&#8208;1 by tumor cells. In addition; a magnetic particle chemiluminescence kit was developed to quantitatively detect the binding rate of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1. The self&#8208;expressed PD&#8208;1 bonded with the PD&#8208;L1 expressed by both autologous and neighboring tumor cells; achieving self&#8208;blockade. Simultaneously; the outer&#8208;membrane protein of LOMV recruited cytotoxic lymphocyte cells and natural killer cells to tumor tissues and stimulated them to secrete IFN&#8208;&#947;; improving the antitumor activity of the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 self&#8208;blocking therapy.

         <title>Anisotropic Carrier Mobility from 2H WSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with 2H phase are expected to be the building blocks in next&#8208;generation electronics, however, suffered from electrical anisotropy, which is the basics for multi&#8208;terminal artificial synaptic devices, digital inverters, and anisotropic memtransistors that are highly desired in neuromorphic computing. Herein, the anisotropic carrier mobility from 2H WSe2 is reported for the first time, where the anisotropic degree of carrier mobility spans from 0.16 to 0.95 for various WSe2 field effect transistors under a gate voltage of &#8722;60&#160;V. Phonon scattering, impurity ions scattering, and defect scattering are excluded for anisotropic mobility. Intrinsic screening layer is proposed and confirmed by Z&#8208;contrast STEM imaging to respond to the electrical anisotropy. Seven types of intrinsic screening layers are created and calculated by density functional theory to evaluate modulated electronic structures, effective masses, and scattering intensities, resulting in anisotropic mobility. The discovery of anisotropic carrier mobility from 2H WSe2 provides a degree of freedom for adjusting the physical properties of 2H TMDCs and a fertile ground for exploring and integrating the TMDCs electronic transistors with better performance along the direction of high mobility.

         <title>Constructing a Stable Interface Layer by Tailoring Solvation Chemistry in Carbonate Electrolytes for High Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered as promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high energy density. However, commercial carbonate electrolytes cannot be used in LMBs due to their poor compatibility with lithium metal anode and detrimental HF generation by LiPF6 decomposition. By introducing LiNO3 additive and a small amount of tetramethylurea as a multifunctional cosolvent to a commercial carbonate electrolyte, NO3&#8211; which is usually insoluble can be introduced into the solvation structure of Li+ to form a conductive and stable SEI. At the same time, HF generation is suppressed by manipulating the solvation structure and a scavenging effect. As a result, the Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Li||Cu half cells using the designed carbonate electrolyte can reach 98.19% at room temperature and 96.14% at a low temperature (&#8208;15 &#8451;), and Li||LFP cells deliver a high capacity retention of 94.9% with a high CE of 99.6% after 550 cycles. This work provides a simple and effective way to extend the use of commercial carbonate electrolytes for next&#8208;generation battery systems.

A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hafnium oxide (HfO2)&#8208;based self&#8208;powered, ultrafast (60 &#181;s), and high&#8208;performing (68 &#181;A&#8201;W&#8722;1) infrared pyroelectric sensor is developed. Further, a conceptually new kind of photoreadable memory with controllable suspension and reestablishment of self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse is demonstrated. Using the innovative approach, advanced applications like memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency warning systems are offered.








Abstract
With highly diverse multifunctional properties, hafnium oxide (HfO2) has attracted considerable attention not only because of its potential to address fundamental questions about material behaviors, but also its potential for applied perspectives like ferroelectric memory, transistors, and pyroelectric sensors.&#160;However, effective harvesting of the pyro&#8208;photoelectric effect of HfO2 to develop high&#8208;performing self&#8208;biased photosensors and electric writable and optical readable memory has yet to be developed. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept HfO2&#8208;based self&#8208;powered and ultrafast (response time &#8776; 60 &#181;s) infrared pyroelectric sensor with a responsivity of up to 68 &#181;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 is developed. In particular, temporal infrared light illumination induced surface heating and, in turn, change in spontaneous polarization are attributed to robust pyro&#8208;photocurrent generation. Further, controllable suspension and reestablishment of the self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse are demonstrated, which offers a conceptually new kind of photoreadable memory. Potentially, the novel approach opens a new avenue for designing on&#8208;demand pyro&#8208;phototronic response over a desired area and offers the opportunity to utilize it for various applications, including memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency alert systems.

         <title>Multicolor Photonic Pigments for Rotation&#8208;Asymmetric Mechanochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multicolor photonic pigment is developed by magnetically assembling Fe3O4 nanorods and fixing the resulting tetragonal photonic crystals. Its dynamic color tuning and precise orientational control enable the convenient printing of structural&#8208;colored patterns and the design of rotation&#8208;asymmetric photonic devices.








Abstract
Photonic crystals are extensively explored to replace inorganic pigments and organic dyes as coloring elements in printing, painting, sensing, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting due to their brilliant structural colors, chemical stability, and environmental friendliness. However, most existing photonic&#8208;crystal&#8208;based pigments can only display monochromatic colors once made, and generating multicolors has to start with designing different building blocks. Here, a novel photonic pigment featuring highly tunable structural colors in the entire visible spectrum, made by the magnetic assembly of monodisperse nanorods into body&#8208;centered&#8208;tetragonal photonic crystals, is reported. Their prominent magnetic and crystal anisotropy makes it efficient to generate multicolors using one photonic pigment by magnetically controlling the crystal orientation. Further, the combination of angle&#8208;dependent diffraction and magnetic orientation control enables the design of rotation&#8208;asymmetric photonic films that display distinct patterns and encrypted information in response to rotation. The efficient multicolor generation through precise orientational control makes this novel photonic pigment promising in developing high&#8208;performance structural&#8208;colored materials and optical devices.

         <title>Liquid Gating Meniscus&#8208;Shaped Deformable Magnetoelastic Membranes with Self&#8208;Driven Regulation of Gas/Liquid Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid gating magnetoelastic membrane with meniscus&#8208;shaped deformations actuated by magnetic stimuli is reported to actively regulate gas/liquid release. It introduces a universal and new self&#8208;driven strategy for smart liquid gating membranes, combining fast and contactless operation and nonfouling behavior for energy&#8208;saving multiphase fluid transport and separation, and visible gas/liquid mixture content monitoring.








Abstract
Liquid gating membranes have been demonstrated to show unprecedented properties of dynamicity, stability, adaptivity, and stimulus&#8208;responsiveness. Most recently, smart liquid gating membranes have attracted increasing attention to bring some brand&#8208;new properties for real&#8208;world applications, and various environment&#8208;driven systems have been created. Here, a self&#8208;driven system of a smart liquid gating membrane is further developed by designing a new sytem based on a liquid gating magnetoelastic porous membrane with reversible meniscus&#8208;shaped deformations, and it is not subject to the complex gating liquid restriction of magnetorheological fluids. Compared with other systems, this magnetic&#8208;responsive self&#8208;driven system has the advantage that it provides a universal and convenient way to realize active regulation of gas/liquid release. Experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate the stability, the nonfouling behavior, and the tunability of the system. In addition, this system can be used to perfectly open and close gas transport, and the gating pressure threshold for the liquid release can be reduced under the same conditions. Based on the above capabilities, combined with the fast and 3D contactless operation, it will be of benefit in fields ranging from visible gas/liquid mixture content monitoring and energy&#8208;saving multiphase separation, remote fluid release, and beyond.

         <title>Suppressing the Step Effect of 3D Printing for Constructing Contact Lenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous liquid film confined 3D printing strategy is exploited to eliminate the step effect. Reutilization and good control of the liquid residual can improve the printing fidelity and avoid a post&#8208;washing process. Based on this strategy, a centimeter&#8208;scale contact lens structure with nanoscale roughness and high&#8208;definition imaging can be 3D printed, indicating its great potential in scalable 3D printing optical structures.








Abstract
3D printing has been considered as a sustainable method to construct complicated 3D structures. However, the step effect induced by the traditional point&#8208;by&#8208;point or layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer additive manufacturing mode inevitably occurs and remains an obstacle to realizing the smoothness and uniformity of 3D samples. Here, a continuous liquid film confined 3D printing strategy is proposed to fabricate high&#8208;precision 3D structures based on the Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology. With the control of the confinement of the liquid&#8211;solid interface and the continuous printing mode, liquid film adhering to the cured structure is sucked into the cured layer structures with excess resin adhering to the cured structure scraping off, where the step effect is eliminated and post&#8208;washing is avoided. The morphology and dimension of the confined liquid film can be well regulated by ink properties and printing parameters to optimize the surface smoothness and printing fidelity. In addition, heat accumulation and thermal diffusion are also suppressed, ensuring the long&#8208;term printing stability. A centimeter&#8208;scale contact lens structure with central thickness of &#8776;135&#160;&#181;m comparable to commercial ones can be printed, which possesses extreme smoothness (sub 1.3&#160;nm), homogeneous mechanical characteristic, biocompatibility, and high optical properties with imaging resolution of up to 228.1 lp mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Defective Bimetallic Selenides for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic CuInSe2 with Se vacanies (V&#8208;CuInSe2) significantly optimizes the adsorption of CO2 electroreduction intermediates owing to its moderate band center relative to the Fermi level. Meanwhile, hydrogen evolution is suppressed on V&#8208;CuInSe2 due to an energetically unfavorable surface reconstruction after hydrogen adsorption. Consequently, the V&#8208;CuInSe2 achieves a highly active and selective CO generation ability.








Abstract
CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to CO is promising for the carbon cycle but still remains challenging. Au is regarded as the most selective catalyst for CO2RR, but its high cost significantly hinders its industrial application. Herein, the bimetallic CuInSe2 is found to exhibit an Au&#8208;like catalytic feature: i) the interaction of Cu and In orbitals induces a moderate adsorption strength of CO2RR intermediates and favors the reaction pathway; and ii) the hydrogen evolution is energetically unfavorable on CuInSe2, as a surface reconstruction along with high energy change will occur after hydrogen adsorption. Furthermore, the Se vacancy is found to induce an electron redistribution, slightly tune the band structure, and optimize the CO2RR route of bimetallic selenide. Consequently, the Se&#8208;defective CuInSe2 (V&#8208;CuInSe2) achieves a highly selective CO production ability that is comparable to noble metals in aqueous electrolyte, and the V&#8208;CuInSe2 cathode shows a satisfactory performance in an aqueous Zn&#8211;CO2 cell. This work demonstrates that designing cost&#8208;effective catalysts with noble&#8208;metal&#8208;like properties is an ideal strategy for developing efficient electrocatalysts. Moreover, the class of transition bimetallic selenides has shown promising prospects as active and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts owing to their unique structural, electronic, and catalytic properties.

Moreover, the class of transition bimetallic selenides has shown promising prospects as active and cost-effective electrocatalysts owing to their unique structural, electronic, and catalytic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antiangiogenic Nanomicelles for the Topical Delivery of Aflibercept to Treat Retinal Neovascular Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
nEPCs + A are aflibercept&#8208;loaded nanomicelles formed by encapsulating aflibercept in an EPC copolymer solution. In this study, the ability of nEPCs + A to deliver clinically significant amounts of aflibercept to the retina for control of choroidal neovascularization in mice is described. Interestingly, nEPCs also demonstrate intrinsic antiangiogenic activity, which synergizes with their drug delivery capability for the treatment of neovascular retinal diseases.








Abstract
The traditional intravitreal injection delivery of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF) to the posterior segment of the eye for treatment of retinal diseases is invasive and associated with sight&#8208;threatening complications. To avoid such complications, there has been significant interest in developing polymers for topical drug delivery to the retina. This study reports a nanomicelle drug delivery system made of a copolymer EPC (nEPCs), which is capable of delivering aflibercept to the posterior segment topically through corneal&#8211;scleral routes. EPC is composed of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(propylene glycol) (PPG), and polycaprolactone (PCL) segments. In this study, aflibercept&#8208;loaded nEPCs (nEPCs + A) are capable of penetrating the cornea in ex vivo porcine eye models and deliver a clinically significant amount of aflibercept to the retina in laser&#8208;induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) murine models, causing CNV regression. nEPCs + A also demonstrate biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, this study also suggests that nEPCs have intrinsic antiangiogenic properties. The ability to deliver anti&#8208;VEGF drugs and the intrinsic antiangiogenic properties of nEPCs may result in synergistic effects, which can be harnessed for effective therapeutics. nEPCs may be a promising topical anti&#8208;VEGF delivery platform for the treatment of retinal diseases.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ion Oligomerization Inside Electrified Carbon Micropores and its Effect on Capacitive Charge Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomerization of transition metal aqua ions inside electrified carbon micropores is observed using in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The cations associate together via hydroxo bridging under the synergy of confinement and negative charging. The resulting ionic oligomers have sluggish dissociation kinetics and accumulate upon cycling, leading to capacitance fading of supercapacitors. Positive charging destructs them and revivifies the capaictance.








Abstract
Ion adsorption inside electrified carbon micropores is pivotal for the operation of supercapacitors. Depending on the electrolyte, two main mechanisms have been identified so far, the desolvation of ions in solvents and the formation of superionic states in ionic liquids. Here, it is shown that upon confinement inside negatively charged micropores, transition&#8208;metal cations dissolved in water associate to form oligomer species. They are identified using in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The cations associate one with each other via hydroxo bridging, forming ionic oligomers under the synergic effect of spatial confinement and Coulombic screening. The oligomers display sluggish dissociation kinetics and accumulate upon cycling, which leads to supercapacitor capacitance fading. They may be dissolved by applying a positive potential, so an intermittent reverse cycling strategy is proposed to periodically evacuate micropores and revivify the capacitance. These results reveal new insights into ion adsorption and structural evolution with their effects on the electrochemical performance, providing guidelines for designing advanced supercapacitors.

         <title>Tailoring Layer Number of 2D Porphyrin&#8208;Based MOF Towards Photo&#8208;Coupled Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inspired by the success of graphene, a series of single&#8208; or few&#8208;layer two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been developed and applied in the past decade. Here, we report the successful preparation of monolayer and bilayer (two dimensional) 2D porphyrin&#8208;based metal organic frameworks (MOFs) by a facile solvothermal method. The structure transition from monolayer to bilayer drives distinct electronic properties and restructuring behaviors, which finally results in distinct catalytic pathways towards CO2 electrocatalysis. The monolayer favors CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 pathway due to the restructuring of Cu&#8208;O4 sites while CO and HCOO&#8211; are the major products over the bilayer. In photo&#8208;coupled electrocatalysis, Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2 compounds shows a nearly 4&#8208;fold increase on the monolayer than that under dark condition (FEC2 increases from 11.9% to 41.1% at &#8208;1.4&#160;V). For comparison, the light field plays a negligible effect on the bilayer. The light&#8208;induced selectivity optimization is investigated by experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work opens up a novel possibility to tune the selectivity of carbon products just by tailoring the layer number of 2D material.

         <title>Giant Thermal Transport Tuning at a Metal/Ferroelectric Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant thermal transport tuning is observed at a metal/ferroelectric interface by switching the ferroelectric polarization orientations. This work shows that surface bound charges at a metal/insulator interface can substantially enhance the interfacial electron&#8211;phonon&#8208;mediated thermal coupling, providing a new route to optimize the thermal transport performance in the next&#8208;generation nanodevices, power electronics, and thermal logic devices.








Abstract
Interfacial thermal transport plays a prominent role in the thermal management of nanoscale objects and is of fundamental importance for basic research and nanodevices. At metal/insulator interfaces, a configuration commonly found in electronic devices, heat transport strongly depends upon the effective energy transfer from thermalized electrons in the metal to the phonons in the insulator. However, the mechanism of interfacial electron&#8211;phonon coupling and thermal transport at metal/insulator interfaces is not well understood. Here, the observation of a substantial enhancement of the interfacial thermal resistance and the important role of surface charges at the metal/ferroelectric interface in an Al/BiFeO3 membrane are reported. By applying uniaxial strain, the interfacial thermal resistance can be varied substantially (up to an order of magnitude), which is attributed to the renormalized interfacial electron&#8211;phonon coupling caused by the charge redistribution at the interface due to the polarization rotation. These results imply that surface charges at a metal/insulator interface can substantially enhance the interfacial electron&#8211;phonon&#8208;mediated thermal coupling, providing a new route to optimize the thermal transport performance in next&#8208;generation nanodevices, power electronics, and thermal logic devices.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phenolic Network&#8208;Coated Dendrimer&#8208;Drug Conjugates for Tumor MR Imaging and Chemo/Chemodynamic Therapy via Amplification of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress</title>

Abstract
Amplification of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) to realize enhanced cancer therapy has been considered to be unique in current cancer nanomedicine design. Herein, we report the design of metal&#8208;phenolic network&#8208;coated dendrimer&#8208;drug conjugates as a novel theranostic nanoplatform based on ERS amplification. In our design, acetylated generation 5 poly(amidoamine) dendrimers were conjugated with an ERS drug toyocamycin (Toy) through the attached phenylboronic acid moiety, and coated with iron (Fe)&#8208;tannic acid (TF) network. The generated nanocomplexes with a size of 50.2&#160;nm are stable under a physiological environment, and can rapidly release Toy under the tumor microenvironment due to the pH&#8208; and reactive oxygen species&#8208;responsive boronic ester bonds to effectively inhibit the ERS&#8208;mediated cancer cell adaptation. Meanwhile, the coated TF network enables the nanocomplexes to generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals through a Fenton reaction, amplifying the ERS for improved chemotherapy/chemodynamic therapy of cancer cells in vitro and a xenografted breast tumor model in vivo. Moreover, the coating of TF also renders the complexes with an eminent r1 relaxivity for in vivo T1&#8208;weighted tumor magnetic resonance imaging. The created intelligent nanocomplexes may represent an advanced nanomedicine formulation uniquely integrated with metal&#8208;phenolic network and dendrimer nanotechnology for imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapy through ERS amplification.

&lt;p&gt;Amplification of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) to realize enhanced cancer therapy has been considered to be unique in current cancer nanomedicine design. Herein, we report the design of metal-phenolic network-coated dendrimer-drug conjugates as a novel theranostic nanoplatform based on ERS amplification. In our design, acetylated generation 5 poly(amidoamine) dendrimers were conjugated with an ERS drug toyocamycin (Toy) through the attached phenylboronic acid moiety, and coated with iron (Fe)-tannic acid (TF) network. The generated nanocomplexes with a size of 50.2&#160;nm are stable under a physiological environment, and can rapidly release Toy under the tumor microenvironment due to the pH- and reactive oxygen species-responsive boronic ester bonds to effectively inhibit the ERS-mediated cancer cell adaptation. Meanwhile, the coated TF network enables the nanocomplexes to generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals through a Fenton reaction, amplifying the ERS for improved chemotherapy/chemodynamic therapy of cancer cells in vitro and a xenografted breast tumor model in vivo. Moreover, the coating of TF also renders the complexes with an eminent &lt;i&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; relaxivity for in vivo &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-weighted tumor magnetic resonance imaging. The created intelligent nanocomplexes may represent an advanced nanomedicine formulation uniquely integrated with metal-phenolic network and dendrimer nanotechnology for imaging-guided cancer therapy through ERS amplification.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Critical review on low&#8208;temperature Li&#8208;ion/metal batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
With the highest energy density ever among all sorts of commercialized rechargeable batteries, Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have stimulated the upsurge utilization in 3C devices, electric vehicles, and stationary energy storage systems. However, a high performance of commercial LIBs based on ethylene carbonate electrolytes and graphite anodes can only be achieved at above &#8208;20&#176;C, which restricts their applications in harsh environments. In this review, we provided a comprehensive research progress and in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical factors leading to the poor low&#8208;temperature performance of LIBs, sorted out the distinctive challenges on the anodes, electrolytes, cathodes and electrolyte&#8208;electrodes interphases, with a special focus on Li&#8208;ions transport mechanism therein. Finally, promising strategies and solutions for improving low&#8208;temperature performance were highlighted to maximize the working&#8208;temperature range of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion/metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;With the highest energy density ever among all sorts of commercialized rechargeable batteries, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have stimulated the upsurge utilization in 3C devices, electric vehicles, and stationary energy storage systems. However, a high performance of commercial LIBs based on ethylene carbonate electrolytes and graphite anodes can only be achieved at above -20&#176;C, which restricts their applications in harsh environments. In this review, we provided a comprehensive research progress and in-depth understanding of the critical factors leading to the poor low-temperature performance of LIBs, sorted out the distinctive challenges on the anodes, electrolytes, cathodes and electrolyte-electrodes interphases, with a special focus on Li-ions transport mechanism therein.

The role of iodide as an additive in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries is not well understood, especially in the charging process. The recent advances on LiI are reviewed and the synergistic effect with water is discussed. Alternative approaches for enabling the charging process are also provided.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries possess a high theoretical energy density, which means they could become a potential alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Nevertheless, the charging process of Li&#8211;O2 batteries requires much higher energy, due to the insulating nature of the discharge product. It has been revealed that the anion additive, lithium iodide (LiI), can tune the cell chemistry to form lithium hydroxide (LiOH) as the product and facilitate the kinetics during the charging process. Although numerous studies have been reported, the role of this additive is still under investigation. Herein, the recent advances focusing on the use of LiI in Li&#8211;O2 batteries are reviewed, its catalytic behavior on discharge and charge is discussed, and its synergistic effect with water is understood. The ambiguity existing among the studies are also revealed, and solutions to the current issues are introduced.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;microenvironment activatable polymer nano&#8208;immunomodulator for precision cancer photoimmunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Cancer nanomedicine combined with immunotherapy has become a promising strategy for treating cancer in terms of safety and potency; however, precise regulation of the activation of antitumor immunity remains challenging. We herein report a smart semiconducting polymer nano&#8208;immunomodulator (SPNI) in response to acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) for precision photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer. SPNI is self&#8208;assembled by a NIR&#8208;absorbing semiconducting polymer, and an amphipathic polymer conjugated with a Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist via an acid&#8208;liable linker. Upon arrival at tumor site, SPNI undergoes hydrolysis and triggers an efficient liberation of TLR7 agonist in response to acidic TME for DC activation. Moreover, SPNI exerts photodynamic effects for direct tumor eradication and immunogenic cancer cell death under NIR photoirradiation. The synergistic action of released immunogenic factors and acidic TME&#8208;activated TLR7 agonist can serve as an in situ generated cancer vaccine to evoke strong antitumor activities. Notably, such localized immune activation boosts systemic antitumor immune responses, resulting in enhanced cytotoxic CD8+ T infiltration to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Thereby, this work presents a general strategy to devise prodrug of immunotherapeutics for precise regulation of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Tough, Transparent, 3D printable and Self&#8208;healing Polyethylene Glycol&#8208;Gel (PEGgel)</title>

Abstract
Polymer gels, such as hydrogels, consisting of cross&#8208;linked polymer chains and small molecule solvents, have been widely used in biomedical applications, flexible electronics and soft machines due to the similarity of their mechanical properties to those of soft biological tissues. Polymer network design and its contribution to the properties of such materials has been extensively studied. In this study, we demonstrate the critical influence of the solvent nature on the mechanical properties and performance of soft polymer gels. Here, we report a polymer gel system (PEGgel) based on a poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylic acid) copolymerized in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) used as the liquid phase of the PEGgel. Compared to the corresponding hydrogel or ethylene glycol based gel, the PEGgel demonstrates exceptional physical properties, such as high stretchability and toughness, rapid self&#8208;healing, and long&#8208;term stability under ambient conditions. Depending on the molecular weight and fraction of PEG, the tensile strength of PEGgels varied from 0.22&#160;MPa to 41.3&#160;MPa, fracture strain from 12% to 4336%, modulus from 0.08&#160;MPa to 352&#160;MPa, and toughness from 2.89&#160;MJ m&#8211;3 to 56.23&#160;MJ m&#8211;3. The influence of PEG on the mechanical properties was evaluated using the coarse&#8208;grain molecular dynamics (CGMD) model and solid&#8208;state NMR, revealing abundant weak hydrogen bonding leading to the observed enhancement of mechanical properties. Finally, we demonstrated rapid self&#8208;healing of PEGgel materials and fabricated a self&#8208;healing pneumatic actuator by 3D printing of PEGgel structures. The enhanced mechanical properties of the PEGgel system could be extended to other polymer networks (both chemically and physically cross&#8208;linked). This study demonstrates the important influence of the liquid phase of polymer gels on their mechanical and other properties, and highlights the potential for finetuning different physical properties of gels through the use of PEG possessing weak but multiple hydrogen bond interactions with the polymer network. Such a simple 3D printable, self&#8208;healing and tough soft material holds promise for broad applications in wearable electronics, soft actuators and robotics.

         <title>Reconstructable Uterus&#8208;Derived Materials for Uterus Recovery towards Efficient Live Births</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Uterine factor infertility is increasingly common in modern society and has severely affected human life and health. However, the existing biomaterial scaffold&#8208;mediated system remains limited in efficiently uterus recovery, leading to low pregnancy rate and live birth. Here, we demonstrate a reconstructable uterus&#8208;derived materials (RUMs) by combing with uterus&#8208;derived extracellular matrix (ECM) and seeded chorionic villi mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for uterus recovery, achieving highly efficient live births in rats with severe uterine injury. The RUMs can be designed into different states (such as liquid RUMs and solid RUMs) and shapes (such as cuboid, triangular&#8208;prism and cube) in terms of requirements. The RUMs can effectively prevent intrauterine adhesion, and promote endometrial regeneration and muscle collagen reconstruction as well as accelerate wound healing by constructing physical barrier and secreting cytokines, allowing efficient uterus recovery. The injured uterus nearly achieves complete regeneration after treating with our RUMs and has normal pregnancies for supporting fetal development and live births, similar to the normal rats. Our study provides a regenerative medicine therapeutics for uterine factor infertility.

         <title>High Current&#8208;density Organic Electrochemical Diodes Enabled by Asymmetric Active Layer Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Owing to outstanding electrical/electrochemical performance, operational stability, mechanical flexibility, and decent biocompatibility, organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors have shown great potential as implantable electrodes for neural recording/stimulation and as active channels for signal switching/amplifying transistors. Nonetheless, no studies exist on the general design rule for high&#8208;performance electrochemical diodes, which are essential for highly functional circuit architectures. Herein, we report on generalizable electrochemical diodes with very high current density over 30 kAcm&#8722;2 by introducing an asymmetric active layer based on organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors. The underlying mechanism on polarity&#8208;sensitive balanced ionic doping/dedoping is elucidated by numerical device analysis and in operando spectroelectrochemical potential mapping, while the general material requirements for electrochemical diode operation are deduced using various types of conjugated polymers. In parallel, analog signal rectification and digital logic processing circuits are successfully demonstrated to show the broad impact of organic electrochemical diode&#8208;incorporated circuits. We expect that organic electrochemical diodes will play vital roles in realizing multifunctional soft bioelectronic circuitry in combination with organic electrochemical transistors.

         <title>Mixed Dimethylammonium/Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskite Single Crystals for Improved Structural Stability and Enhanced Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We utilize the solvent acidolysis crystallization technique to grow mixed dimethylammonium/methylammonium lead tribromide (DMA/MAPbBr3) crystals reaching the highest dimethylammonium incorporation of 44% while maintaining the 3D cubic perovskite phase. These mixed perovskite crystals show suppression of the orthorhombic phase and a lower tetragonal to cubic phase transition temperature compared to MAPbBr3. We observe distinct behavior in the temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence properties of MAPbBr3 and mixed DMA/MAPbBr3 crystals due to the different organic cation dynamics governing the phase transition(s). Furthermore, we fabricate lateral photodetectors which show that, at room temperature, the mixed crystals possess higher detectivity compared to MAPbBr3 crystals caused by structural compression and reduced surface trap density. Remarkably, the mixed crystal devices exhibit large enhancement in their detectivity below the phase transition temperature (at 200K), while the MAPbBr3 devices demonstrate insignificant changes. The higher detectivity makes our devices attractive for visible light communication and for space applications. Our results highlight the importance of the synthetic technique for the halide perovskites compositional engineering that governs their structural and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Redistributed Current Density in Lateral Organic Light&#8208;emitting Transistors Enabling Uniform Area Emission with Good Stability and Arbitrary Tunability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs), integrating the functions of an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) and an organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) in a single device, have unique advantages to meet the miniaturization and integration trend for the next&#8208;generation display technology. However, the great challenge of achieving uniform area emission in OLETs, especially in lateral OLETs that with good planar integration significantly hinders their development in this field. Herein, we propose an effective solution to obtain well&#8208;defined area emission in lateral OLETs in which a charge transport buffer (CTB) layer is introduced between the conducting channel and emitting layer beneath the drain electrode. Comprehensive theoretical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the potential beneath the drain electrode is well&#8208;redistributed, which is mainly attributed to the shielding effect of the CBT&#8208;layer on the equipotential drain electrode. As a result, a highly uniform current density under the drain electrode was observed. In this case, uniform recombination of balanced holes and electrons can be guaranteed, which is essential for the formation of area emission in the following OLETs. Furthermore, well&#8208;defined uniform RGB area emission OLETs were constructed by incorporating 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1] benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzo&#8208;thiophene (C8&#8208;BTBT) as the conducting layer, 1,1&#8208;bis[(di&#8208;4&#8208;tolamino)phenyl]cyclohexane (TAPC) as CTB&#8208;layer and three phosphorescent materials as the emitting layer. These RGB area&#8208;emission OLETs demonstrate good gate tunable ability (ON/OFF ratio 106), high loop stability (over 200 cycles) as well as high aperture ratio (over 80%) due to the arbitrary tunability of device geometry. This work provides a new avenue for constructing area&#8208;emission lateral OLETs, which have great potential for display technology because of their good compatibility with conventional fabrication techniques.

         <title>Anisotropic Nodal&#8208;Line&#8208;Derived Large Anomalous Hall Conductivity in ZrMnP and HfMnP</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous Hall conductivity appears in metallic ferromagnets due to the anomalous velocity of charge carriers in the presence of a magnetic field. In ferromagnets ZrMnP and HfMnP, the abundance of mirror planes forming nodal lines at the Fermi energy guides and enhances such velocity, resulting in both the compounds exhibiting large value of anomalous Hall conductivity.








Abstract
The nontrivial band structure of semimetals has attracted substantial research attention in condensed matter physics and materials science in recent years owing to its intriguing physical properties. Within this class, a group of nontrivial materials known as nodal&#8208;line semimetals is particularly important. Nodal&#8208;line semimetals exhibit the potential effects of electronic correlation in nonmagnetic materials, whereas they enhance the contribution of the Berry curvature in magnetic materials, resulting in high anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). In this study, two ferromagnetic compounds, namely ZrMnP and HfMnP, are selected, wherein the abundance of mirror planes in the crystal structure ensures gapped nodal lines at the Fermi energy. These nodal lines result in one of the largest AHC values of 2840 &#937;&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, with a high anomalous Hall angle of 13.6% in these compounds. First&#8208;principles calculations provide a clear and detailed understanding of nodal line&#8208;enhanced AHC. The finding suggests a guideline for searching large AHC compounds.

         <title>Atomic Structure Evolution of Pt&#8211;Co Binary Catalysts: Single Metal Sites versus Intermetallic Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key factors determining whether the alloying or atomization of Pt NPs on a single Co site rich carbon support are dynamically revealed, including initial Pt loadings, particle sizes, the nature of the carbon supports, and the annealing conditions. The corresponding ordered Pt3Co intermetallic and single Pt/Co site (i.e., PtC3N/CoN4) catalysts are evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction. The established structure&#8211;property correlations shed light on the design of advanced Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Due to their exceptional catalytic properties for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and other crucial electrochemical reactions, PtCo intermetallic nanoparticle (NP) and single atomic (SA) Pt metal site catalysts have received considerable attention. However, their formation mechanisms at the atomic level during high&#8208;temperature annealing processes remain elusive. Here, the thermally driven structure evolution of Pt&#8211;Co binary catalyst systems is investigated using advanced in situ electron microscopy, including PtCo intermetallic alloys and single Pt/Co metal sites. The pre&#8208;doping of CoN4 sites in carbon supports and the initial Pt NP sizes play essential roles in forming either Pt3Co intermetallics or single Pt/Co metal sites. Importantly, the initial Pt NP loadings against the carbon support are critical to whether alloying to L12&#8208;ordered Pt3Co NPs or atomizing to SA Pt sites at high temperatures. High Pt NP loadings (e.g., 20%) tend to lead to the formation of highly ordered Pt3Co intermetallic NPs with excellent activity and enhanced stability toward the ORR. In contrast, at a relatively low Pt loading (&lt;6&#160;wt%), the formation of single Pt sites in the form of PtC3N is thermodynamically favorable, in which a synergy between the PtC3N and the CoN4 sites could enhance the catalytic activity for the ORR, but showing insufficient stability.

         <title>Design Principles of Sodium/Potassium Protection Layer for High&#8208;Power High&#8208;Energy Sodium/Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes: a Case Study of Na2Te/K2Te</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na2Te (K2Te) protection layer with high ionic conductivity, low electronic conductivity, and high mechanical stability on a Na (K) metal anode is designed and prepared. The Na@Na2Te (K@K2Te) realizes excellent electrochemi cal performance for sodium&#8208;metal (potassiummetal) batteries of both symmetrical cells and full batteries in widely used carbonate electrolytes.








Abstract
The sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes combine low&#8208;cost, high theoretical capacity, and high energy density, demonstrating promising application in sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal batteries. However, the dendrites&#8217; growth on the surface of Na (K) has impeded their practical application. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) results predict Na2Te/K2Te is beneficial for Na+/K+ transport and can effectively suppress the formation of the dendrites because of low Na+/K+ migration energy barrier and ultrahigh Na+/K+ diffusion coefficient of 3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1/1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1 (300 K), respectively. Then a Na2Te protection layer is prepared by directly painting the nanosized Te powder onto the sodium&#8208;metal surface. The Na@Na2Te anode can last for 700 h in low&#8208;cost carbonate electrolytes (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 1 mAh cm&#8722;2), and the corresponding Na3V2 (PO4)3//Na@Na2Te full cell exhibits high energy density of 223&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an unprecedented power density of 29687 W kg&#8722;1 as well as an ultrahigh capacity retention of 93% after 3000 cycles at 20 C. Besides, the K@K2Te&#8208;based potassium&#8208;metal full battery also demonstrates high power density of 20 577 W kg&#8722;1 with energy density of 154&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work opens up a new and promising avenue to stabilize sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes with simple and low&#8208;cost interfacial layers.

         <title>Direct Atomic&#8208;Scale Structure and Electric Field Imaging of Triazine&#8208;Based Crystalline Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy technique reveals the local atomic configuration and also directly determines the atomic electric field of poly(triazine imide) crystal, the triazine&#8208;based crystalline carbon nitride. These findings offer a fundamental insight on the electronic structure for photoabsorption and the migration of charge carriers in photocatalysis with this material.








Abstract
Crystalline carbon nitrides (CNs) have recently attracted considerable attention owing to their superior photocatalytic activity. However, the electron&#8208;beam&#8208;sensitive nature of crystalline CNs hinders atomic&#8208;resolution imaging of their local structures by conventional (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) techniques. Here, the atomic structure of a triazine&#8208;based crystalline CN, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) incorporated with lithium and chloride ions, is unambiguously revealed using the emerging imaging technique of differential phase contrast STEM under a low dose. The lightest&#8208;element Li/H configuration is resolved within framework cavities of PTI and significantly affects the electronic structure for photoabsorption. The atomic electric field of PTI crystal directly determined in real space provides a fundamental evidence for the chemical bonding of Li ions and adjacent atoms for the migration of photogenerated carriers. These results facilitate the comprehension on local atomic configuration and chemical bonding state of crystalline CNs and can lead to a deeper understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>Managing Growth and Dimensionality of Quasi 2D Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystalline Flakes for Tunable Excitons Orientation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;sized quasi 2D&#8208;perovskites with tunable number of inorganic layers are synthesized by an innovative synthetic approach based on the use of a reactant, potassium iodide, that can modulate the supersaturation levels of the perovskite precursors solution without being part of the final products. Exciton orientation is changed from &#8220;in&#8208;plane&#8221; to &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8221; by increasing the &#8220;n&#8221; value.








Abstract
Hybrid perovskites are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications. Their 2D crystalline form is even more interesting since the alternating inorganic and organic layers naturally forge a multiple quantum&#8208;well structure, leading to the formation of stable excitonic resonances. Nevertheless, a controlled modulation of the quantum well width, which is defined by the number of inorganic layers (n) between two organic ones, is not trivial and represents the main synthetic challenge in the field. Here, a conceptually innovative approach to easily tune n in lead iodide perovskite single&#8208;crystalline flakes is presented. The judicious use of potassium iodide is found to modulate the supersaturation levels of the precursors solution without being part of the final products. This allows to obtain a fine tuning of the n value. The excellent optical quality of the as synthesized flakes guarantees an in&#8208;depth analysis by Fourier&#8208;space microscopy, revealing that the excitons orientation can be manipulated by modifying the number of inorganic layers. Excitonic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component, indeed, is enhanced when &#8220;n&#8221; is increased. The combined advances in the synthesis and optical characterization fill in the picture of the exciton behavior in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite, paving the way to the design of materials with improved optoelectronic characteristics.

         <title>Promoting Oral Mucosal Wound Healing with a Hydrogel Adhesive Based on a Phototriggered S&#8208;Nitrosylation Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a new coupling reaction, an easily operated hydrogel adhesive that features thin&#8208;layer fabrication, ultrafast gelation, appropriate elasticity, and excellent tissue adhesion is developed. This hydrogel adhesive matches the material requirements for oral mucosal treatment and establishes a conducive microenvironment for tissue growth, thus notably shortening the healing time of mucosal wounds.








Abstract
The wet and highly dynamic environment of the mouth makes local treatment of oral mucosal diseases challenging. To overcome this, a photo&#8208;crosslinking hydrogel adhesive is developed inspired by the success of light&#8208;curing techniques in dentistry. The adhesive operates on a fast (within 5 s) phototriggered S&#8208;nitrosylation coupling reaction and employs imine anchoring to connect to host tissues. Unlike other often&#8208;used clinical agents that adhere weakly and for short durations, this thin, elastic, adhesive, and degradable cyclic o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid gel protects mucosal wounds from disturbance by liquid rinsing, oral movement, and friction for more than 24 h. The results from both rat and pig oral mucosa repair models demonstrate that this new gel adhesive creates a favorable microenvironment for tissue repair and can shorten tissue healing time. This study thus illustrates a therapeutic strategy with the potential to advance the treatment of oral mucosal defects in the clinic.

         <title>Crystal Phase Transition Creates a Highly Active and Stable RuCX Nanosurface for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal phase&#8208;transition of Ru/C from cubic&#8208;close&#8208;packing to hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packing creates a ruthenium carbide (RuCX, X&#160;&lt;&#160;1) nanosurface on Ru nanocrystal. The as&#8208;created RuCX nanosurface presents a highly active and stable performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculations predict the RuCX sites as bifunctional configurations for improving alkaline HER kinetics.








Abstract
Although metastable crystal structures have received much attention owing to their utilization in various fields, their phase&#8208;transition to a thermodynamic structure has attracted comparably little interest. In the case of nanoscale crystals, such an exothermic phase&#8208;transition releases high energy within a confined surface area and reconstructs surface atomic arrangement in a short time. Thus, this high&#8208;energy nanosurface may create novel crystal structures when some elements are supplied. In this work, the creation of a ruthenium carbide (RuCX, X&#160;&lt;&#160;1) phase on the surface of the Ru nanocrystal is discovered during phase&#8208;transition from cubic&#8208;close&#8208;packed to hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed structure. When the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is tested in alkaline media, the RuCX exhibits a much lower overpotential and good stability relative to the counterpart Ru&#8208;based catalysts and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculations predict that the local heterogeneity of the outermost RuCX surface promotes the bifunctional HER mechanism by providing catalytic sites for both H adsorption and facile water dissociation.

         <title>Direct Measurement of Oxygen Mass Transport at the Nanoscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method based on atom probe tomography for the direct measurement of ion kinetics at the nanoscale is reported. Extremely high 3D resolution (&lt;1&#160;nm) and straight correlation with local cation distribution are demonstrated for the exemplary case of a mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor exhibiting enhanced grain boundary oxygen diffusivity.








Abstract
Tuning oxygen mass transport properties at the nanoscale offers a promising approach for developing high performing energy materials. A number of strategies for engineering interfaces with enhanced oxygen diffusivity and surface exchange have been proposed. However, the origin and the magnitude of such local effects remain largely undisclosed to date due to the lack of direct measurement tools with sufficient resolution. In this work, atom probe tomography with sub&#8208;nanometer resolution is used to study oxygen mass transport on oxygen&#8208;isotope exchanged thin films of lanthanum chromite. A direct 3D visualization of nanoscaled highly conducting oxygen incorporation pathways along grain boundaries, with reliable quantification of the oxygen kinetic parameters and correlative link to local chemistries, is presented. Combined with finite element simulations of the exact nanostructure, isotope exchange&#8208;atom probe tomography allowed quantifying an enhancement in the grain boundary oxygen diffusivity and in the surface exchange coefficient of lanthanum chromite of about 4 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to the bulk. This remarkable increase of the oxygen kinetics in an interface&#8208;dominated material is unambiguously attributed to grain boundary conduction highways thanks to the use of a powerful technique that can be straightforwardly extended to the study of currently inaccessible multiple nanoscale mass transport phenomena.

         <title>Engineering Photoresponsive Ligand Tethers for Mechanical Regulation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is developed to regulate the behaviors and functions of stem cells by switching the states of light&#8208;switchable tethers. This method offers the chance to study mechanotransduction via cellular tethers and realize spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates.








Abstract
Regulating stem cell functions by precisely controlling the nanoscale presentation of bioactive ligands has a substantial impact on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine but remains a major challenge. Here it is shown that bioactive ligands can become mechanically &#8220;invisible&#8221; by increasing their tether lengths to the substrate beyond a critical length, providing a way to regulate mechanotransduction without changing the biochemical conditions. Building on this finding, light switchable tethers are rationally designed, whose lengths can be modulated reversibly by switching a light&#8208;responsive protein, pdDronpa, in between monomer and dimer states. This allows the regulation of the adhesion, spreading, and differentiation of stem cells by light on substrates of well&#8208;defined biochemical and physical properties. Spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates on the same substrate is further demonstrated, which may represent an important step toward constructing complex organoids or mini tissues by spatially defining the mechanical cues of the cellular microenvironment with light.

         <title>Volatilizable Solid Additive&#8208;Assisted Treatment Enables Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 18.8% and Fill Factor Exceeding 80%</title>

A new morphology control approach is developed to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic solar cells by utilizing the synergistic effect of 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN) and dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) additives. This approach exhibits general application in various active layer systems to achieve well&#8208;developed morphology, enabling outstanding power&#8208;conversion efficiency over 18.8% and fill factor exceeding 80% for the device based on PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6:PC71BM.








Abstract
Controlling the self&#8208;assembling of organic semiconductors to form well&#8208;developed nanoscale phase separation in the bulk&#8208;heterojunction active layer is critical yet challenging for building high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, the similar anisotropic conjugated structures between nonfullerene acceptors and p&#8208;type organic semiconductor donors raise more complexity on manipulating their aggregation toward appropriate phase separation. Herein, a new approach to tune the morphology of photoactive layer is developed by utilizing the synergistic effect of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) and 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN). The volatilizable solid additive DTT with high crystallinity can restrict the over self&#8208;assembling of nonfullerene acceptors during the film casting process, and then allowing the refining of phase separation and molecular packing with the simultaneous volatilization of DTT under thermal annealing. Consequently, the PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6:PC71BM&#8208;based ternary OSCs processed by the dual additives of CN and DTT record a notable power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 18.89%, with a remarkable FF of 80.6%.

Organic single crystals based on 9,10&#8208;bis([N,N&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TPA&#8208;An) and 9,10&#8208;bis([1&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TBA&#8208;An) exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields close to 100% and ultrahigh hole mobilities of 0.45 and 0.15&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

Abstract
Organic single crystals with excellent optical and electrical properties are critical for the development of organic optoelectronics. Herein, two compounds 9,10&#8208;bis([N,N&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TPA&#8208;An) and 9,10&#8208;bis([1&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TBA&#8208;An) are synthesized by introducing two different luminescent groups, triphenylamine and 1,3&#8208;diphenylbenzene, at the 9,10 positions of anthracene via triple bond connection. Single crystals based on TPA&#8208;An and TBA&#8208;An with a ribbon morphology obtained through the slow solvent&#8208;evaporation method exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 98% and 99% at room temperature, and remarkable hole mobilities of 0.45 and 0.15 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistors (SC&#8208;OFETs). Furthermore, UV phototransistors based on the two single crystals obtain photosensitivities of 1.03 &#215; 103 and 3.45 &#215; 104, ultrahigh photoresponsivities of 7.19 &#215; 105 and 1.50&#160;&#215; 105 A W&#8722;1, and the detectivities exceeding 1.40 &#215; 1016 and 1.60 &#215; 1017 Jones.

         <title>Photoinduced Halide Segregation in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper 2D Mixed Halide Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D mixed halide perovskites with bandgap tunability and increased stability are employed in photovoltaics, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and optoelectronics. Inherent halide ion mobility (instability) of mixed halides drives photoinduced halide ion segregation. The important role of dimensionality across 3D to 2D perovskites governs the excited&#8208;state dynamics and the kinetics of halide segregation and dark recovery.








Abstract
2D lead halide perovskites, which exhibit bandgap tunability and increased chemical stability, have been found to be useful for designing optoelectronic devices. Reducing dimensionality with decreasing number of layers (n&#160;=&#160;10&#8211;1) also imparts resistance to light&#8208;induced ion migration as seen from the halide ion segregation and dark recovery in mixed halide (Br:I&#160;=&#160;50:50) perovskite films. The light&#8208;induced halide ion segregation efficiency, as determined from difference absorbance spectra, decreases from 20% to &lt;1%&#160;as the dimensionality is decreased for 2D perovskite film from n&#160;=&#160;10 to 1. The segregation rate constant (ksegregation), which decreases from 5.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;s&#8722;1 (n&#160;=&#160;10) to 3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;s&#8722;1 (n&#160;=&#160;1), correlates well with nearly an order of magnitude decrease observed in charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (&#964;average&#160;=&#160;233&#160;ps for n&#160;=&#160;10&#160;vs &#964;avg&#160;=&#160;27&#160;ps for n&#160;=&#160;1). The tightly bound excitons in 2D perovskites make charge separation less probable, which in turn decreases the halide mobility and resulting phase segregation. The importance of controlling the dimensionality of the 2D architecture in suppressing halide ion mobility is discussed.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Capacitive Pressure Sensors over a Wide Pressure Range Enabled by the Hybrid Responses of a Highly Porous Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low sensitivity at large pressure is a long&#8208;standing obstacle of capacitive pressure sensors. A novel soft capacitive pressure sensor that employs an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite is a promising solution for resolving this chronic challenge. This hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor exhibits unprecedented sensitivity up to 50 kPa. An analytical model explains its mechanism and enables selection of optimal manufacturing parameters.








Abstract
Past research aimed at increasing the sensitivity of capacitive pressure sensors has mostly focused on developing dielectric layers with surface/porous structures or higher dielectric constants. However, such strategies have only been effective in improving sensitivities at low pressure ranges (e.g., up to 3&#160;kPa). To overcome this well&#8208;known obstacle, herein, a flexible hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor (HRPS) composed of an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite (PNC) laminated with an ultrathin dielectric layer is devised. Using a nickel foam template, the PNC is fabricated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs)&#8208;doped Ecoflex to be 86% porous and electrically conductive. The PNC exhibits hybrid piezoresistive and piezocapacitive responses, resulting in significantly enhanced sensitivities (i.e., more than 400%) over wide pressure ranges, from 3.13 kPa&#8722;1 within 0&#8211;1 kPa to 0.43 kPa&#8722;1 within 30&#8211;50 kPa. The effect of the hybrid responses is differentiated from the effect of porosity or high dielectric constants by comparing the HRPS with its purely piezocapacitive counterparts. Fundamental understanding of the HRPS and the prediction of optimal CNT doping are achieved through simplified analytical models. The HRPS is able to measure pressures from as subtle as the temporal arterial pulse to as large as footsteps.

A metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;sacrificed in situ acid&#8208;etching strategy to bring about the controllable synthesis of a series of covalent organic framework based multicomponent nanocomposites from core&#8211;shell, yolk&#8211;shell, and hollow&#8208;sphere structures is presented. Combining the unique yolk&#8211;shell structure with the synergistic effects of the three components, the MTCN&#8208;H (ys) demon strates remarkable catalytic performance in photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O.








Abstract
The precise tuning and multi&#8208;dimensional processing of covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8208;based materials into multicomponent superstructures with appropriate diversity are essential to maximize their advantages in catalytic reactions. However, up to now, it remains an ongoing challenge for the precise design of COFs&#8208;based multicomponent nanocomposites with diverse architectures. Herein, a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;sacrificed in situ acid&#8208;etching (MSISAE) strategy that enables continuous synthesis of core&#8208;shell, yolk&#8208;shell, and hollow&#8208;sphere COFs&#8208;based nanocomposites through tuning of core decomposition (NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 into TiO2) rate is developed. More importantly, due to the multiple active sites, fast transfer of carriers, increased light utilization ability, et al, one of the obtained samples, NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125/TiO2@COF&#8208;366&#8208;Ni&#8208;OH&#8208;HAc (yolk&#8208;shell) with special three components, exhibits high photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency in the gas&#8208;solid mode. The MSISAE strategy developed in this work achieves the precise morphology design and control of multicomponent hybrid composites based on COFs, which may pave a new way in devealoping porous crystalline materials with powerful superstructures for multifunctional catalytic reactions.

         <title>A Conductive Network and Dipole Field for Harnessing Photogenerated Charge Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TiO2 network exhibits two orders of magnitude enhancement in electric conductivity, which will greatly suppress electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) recombination by reducing the charge&#8208;transfer resistance. In addition, 2D MXene induces a dipole at the interface. The dipole field pushes charge extraction and suppresses charge recombination by inducing band bending.








Abstract
Photogenerated charge separation and directional transfer to active sites are pivotal steps in photocatalysis, which limit the efficiency of redox reactions. Here, a conductive network and dipole field are employed to harness photogenerated charge kinetics by using a Ti3C2/TiO2 network (TTN). The TTN exhibits a prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (1.026&#160;ns) and an 11.76&#8208;fold increase in hexavalent chromium photoreduction reaction kinetics compared to TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs). This super photocatalytic performance is derived from the efficient photogenerated charge kinetics, which is steered by the conductive network and dipole field. The conductivity enhancement of the TiO2 network is achieved by continuous chemical bonds, which promotes electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) separation. In addition, at the interface of Ti3C2 and TiO2, band bending induced by the dipole field promotes photogenerated electron spatially directed transfer to the catalytic sites on Ti3C2. This study demonstrates that a conductive network and dipole field offer a new concept to harness charge kinetics for photocatalysis.

         <title>Coupling Glucose&#8208;Assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) Redox with Electrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach is proposed to achieve low&#8208;voltage and continuous hydrogen production using glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox as the anode reaction. Glucose in the electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) spontaneously, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is a sustainable technology for hydrogen production since this process can utilize the intermittent electricity generated by renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro. However, the large&#8208;scale application of this process is restricted by the high electricity consumption due to the large potential gap (&gt;1.23&#160;V) between the anodic oxygen evolution reaction and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a novel and efficient hydrogen production system is developed for coupling glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox with HER. The onset potential of the electrooxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) is as low as 0.7 VRHE (vs reversible hydrogen electrode). In situ Raman spectroscopy, ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculation demonstrates that glucose in the electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) instantaneously via a thermocatalysis process, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92&#160;V to achieve a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Consequently, the electricity consumption for per cubic H2 produced in the system is 2.2&#160;kWh, only half of the value for conventional water electrolysis (4.5&#160;kWh). This work provides a promising strategy for the low&#8208;cost, efficient production of high&#8208;purity H2.

         <title>Physiologically Self&#8208;Regulated, Fully Implantable, Battery&#8208;Free System for Peripheral Nerve Restoration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physiologically self&#8208;regulated, fully implantable, battery&#8208;free neural electrical stimulation system is successfully constructed to produce physiologically electrical signals for the acceleration of regeneration and functional recovery of peripheral nerve injury.








Abstract
The long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injury (PNI) represents a global medical challenge, leading to incomplete nerve tissue recovery and unsatisfactory functional reconstruction. However, the current electrical stimulation (ES) apparatuses fail perfect nerve repair due to their inability of the variable synchronous self&#8208;regulated function with physiological states. It is urgent to develop an implantable ES platform with physiologically adaptive function to provide instantaneous and nerve&#8208;preferred ES. Here, a physiologically self&#8208;regulated electrical signal is generated by integrating a novel tribo/piezoelectric hybrid nanogenerator with a nanoporous nerve guide conduit to construct a fully implantable neural electrical stimulation (FI&#8208;NES) system. The optimal neural ES parameters completely originate from the body itself and are highly self&#8208;responsive to different physiological states. The morphological evaluation, representative protein expression level, and functional reconstruction of the regenerated nerves are conducted to assess the PNI recovery process. Evidence shows that the recovery effect of 15&#160;mm length nerve defects under the guidance of the FI&#8208;NES system is significantly close to the autograft. The designed FI&#8208;NES system provides an effective method for long&#8208;term accelerating the recovery of PNI in vivo and is also appropriate for other tissue injury or neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Construction of Six&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Single Ni Sites on g&#8208;C3N4 with Boron&#8208;Oxo Species for Photocatalytic Water&#8208;Activation&#8208;Induced CO2 Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>
Six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites are successfully anchored by highly dispersed boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets. The as&#8208;fabricated single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst can realize efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction, where single Ni atoms can effectively capture photoelectrons and preferentially reduce absorbed water to produce H atoms as active species eventually inducing the reduction of CO2.








Abstract
The configuration regulation of single&#8208;atom photocatalysts (SAPCs) can significantly influence the interfacial charge transfer and subsequent catalytic process. The construction of conventional SAPCs for aqueous CO2 reduction is mainly devoted toward favorable activation and photoreduction of CO2, however, the role of water is frequently neglected. In this work, single Ni atoms are successfully anchored by boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets through a facile ion&#8208;exchange method. The dative interaction between the B atom and the sp2 N atom of g&#8208;C3N4 guarantees the high dispersion of boron&#8208;oxo species, where O atoms coordinate with single Ni (II) sites to obtain a unique six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated configuration. The optimized single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst, rivaling Pt&#8208;modified g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets, provides excellent CO2 reduction rate with CO and CH4 as products. Quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra, transient absorption spectra, isotopic labeling, and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra reveal that as&#8208;fabricated six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites can effectively capture the photoelectrons of CN along the B&#63743;O bridges and preferentially activate adsorbed water to produce H atoms to eventually induce a hydrogen&#8208;assisted CO2 reduction. This work diversifies the synthetic strategies for single&#8208;atom catalysts and provides insight on correlation between the single&#8208;atom configuration and reaction pathway.

         <title>High&#8208;Speed Fabrication of All&#8208;Inkjet&#8208;Printed Organometallic Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes on Elastic Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inkjet&#8208;printing approaches are used to fabricate flexible organometallic halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes on elastic substrates from the bottom anode to the top cathode under ambient conditions. The fabrication time is significantly shortened by at least tenfold. The device has a novel simplified 4&#8208;layer structure without conventional electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transport&#8208;layer, but still exhibits extremely high performance even under aggressive bending tests.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have great potential for use in high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and displays. Here, a perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) fabricated directly on an elastomer substrate, in which every single layer in the device from bottom anode to top cathode is patterned solely using a highly scalable inkjet printing process, is reported. Compared to PeLEDs made using conventional microfabrication processes, the printing process significantly shortens the fabrication time by at least tenfold (from over 5 h to less than 25 min). The all&#8208;printed PeLEDs have a novel 4&#8208;layer structure (bottom electrode, perovskite emissive layer, buffer layer, top electrode) without separate electron or hole transporting layers. For flexible PeLEDs printed directly in ambient conditions, a turn&#8208;on voltage, maximum luminance intensity, and maximum current efficiency of 3.46&#160;V, 10227&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and 2.01&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1, respectively, is achieved. The devices also exhibit excellent robustness and stability even when bent to a curvature radius of 2.5&#160;mm. The reported device structure and fabrication processes can enable high&#8208;performance flexible PeLEDs to be manufactured over a larger area at extremely low cost and fast speed, which can facilitate the adoption of the promising PeLED technology in the emerging foldable displays, smart wearables, and many other applications.

         <title>3D Printing Scaffold Vaccine for Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printed scaffolds loaded with immunoregulators are developed for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The implantable 3D scaffold vaccine with porous structure endows similar functions compared with lymphoid organs by recruiting immune cells and promoting antigen presentation, as well as inducing robust antitumor immune responses. This 3D scaffold vaccine is also capable of customized manufacturing and personalized treatment.








Abstract
Cancer vaccine platform has attracted great interest in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Here, 3D printed scaffolds loaded with immunoregulators are developed for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The rapid manufacturing and precise molding based on 3D printing can realize the mass manufacturing of cancer vaccines and personalized design. Meanwhile, compared to the traditional hydrogel, the 3D&#8208;scaffold with porous structure endows its similar functions compared with real lymphoid organs by recruitment of a great number of immune cells, leading to the formation of &#8220;artificial tertiary lymphoid structures,&#8221; where there is a promising site to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses. Efficient anticancer immunity is induced when combined with immune checkpoint blockade to inhibit the tumor growth. Personalized antitumor scaffold vaccines are further demonstrated for filling of tumor site after surgery to prevent cancer metastasis. Taken together, these results promise the 3D printing scaffold vaccine as the potential strategy for cancer vaccine therapy in the future.

         <title>Superior High&#8208;Temperature Strength in a Supersaturated Refractory High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural materials with exceptional high&#8208;temperature strengths are highly desirable for high&#8208;temperature applications. In this work, three alloy&#8208;design principles of the large atomic&#8208;size and elastic&#8208;modulus mismatches, the insensitive temperature&#8208;dependence of elastic properties, and the dominance of non&#8208;screw dislocations are used to design a CrMoNbV refractory high&#8208;entropy alloy, which exhibits outperforming high&#8208;temperature strengths.








Abstract
Refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys (RHEAs) show promising applications at high temperatures. However, achieving high strengths at elevated temperatures above 1173K is still challenging due to heat softening. Using intrinsic material characteristics as the alloy&#8208;design principles, a single&#8208;phase body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) CrMoNbV RHEA with high&#8208;temperature strengths (beyond 1000&#160;MPa at 1273 K) is designed, superior to other reported RHEAs as well as conventional superalloys. The origin of the high&#8208;temperature strength is revealed by in situ neutron scattering, transmission&#8208;electron microscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations. The CrMoNbV's elevated&#8208;temperature strength retention up to 1273 K arises from its large atomic&#8208;size and elastic&#8208;modulus mismatches, the insensitive temperature dependence of elastic constants, and the dominance of non&#8208;screw character dislocations caused by the strong solute pinning, which makes the solid&#8208;solution strengthening pronounced. The alloy&#8208;design principles and the insights in this study pave the way to design RHEAs with outstanding high&#8208;temperature strength.

         <title>In&#8208;Materio Reservoir Computing in a Sulfonated Polyaniline Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonated polyaniline (SPAN) organic electrochemical network device (OEND) that exhibits ionic conduction in a humid environment is used as an in materio reservoir for reservoir computing (RC). The output behavior indicates wide variations for each electrode, which improves RC performance. Practical spoken&#8208;digit classification is realized with 60% accuracy, demonstrating that SPAN OEND can manage time&#8208;series data operation in RC.








Abstract
A sulfonated polyaniline (SPAN) organic electrochemical network device (OEND) is fabricated using a simple drop&#8208;casting method on multiple Au electrodes for use in reservoir computing (RC). The SPAN network has humidity&#8208;dependent electrical properties. Under high humidity, the SPAN OEND exhibits mainly ionic conduction, including charging of an electric double layer and ionic diffusion. The nonlinearity and hysteresis of the current&#8211;voltage characteristics progressively increase with increasing humidity. The rich dynamic output behavior indicates wide variations for each electrode, which improves the RC performance because of the disordered network. For RC, waveform generation and short&#8208;term memory tasks are realized by a linear combination of outputs. The waveform task accuracy and memory capacity calculated from a short&#8208;term memory task reach 90% and 33.9, respectively. Improved spoken&#8208;digit classification is realized with 60% accuracy by only 12 outputs, demonstrating that the SPAN OEND can manage time series dynamic data operation in RC owing to a combination of rich dynamic and nonlinear electronic properties. The results suggest that SPAN&#8208;based electrochemical systems can be applied for material&#8208;based computing, by exploiting their intrinsic physicochemical behavior.

         <title>Controllable Doping in 2D Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable doping by modulating the thickness is realized in 2D layered materials. The decreasing thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies in thicker PtSSe to anion vacancies in thinner PtSSe, which leads to controllable doping. Thickness&#8208;modulated doping shows great potential in novel electronics and optoelectronics, especially including diodes and photodetectors.








Abstract
For each generation of semiconductors, the issue of doping techniques is always placed at the top of the priority list since it determines whether a material can be used in the electronic and optoelectronic industry or not. When it comes to 2D materials, significant challenges have been found in controllably doping 2D semiconductors into p&#8208; or n&#8208;type, let alone developing a continuous control of this process. Here, a unique self&#8208;modulated doping characteristic in 2D layered materials such as PtSSe, PtS0.8Se1.2, PdSe2, and WSe2 is reported. The varying number of vertically stacked&#8208;monolayers is the critical factor for controllably tuning the same material from p&#8208;type to intrinsic, and to n&#8208;type doping. Importantly, it is found that the thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies to anion vacancies based on dynamic and thermodynamic analyses, which leads to p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conductance, respectively. By thickness&#8208;modulated doping, WSe2 diode exhibits a high rectification ratio of 4400 and a large open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.38&#160;V. Meanwhile, the PtSSe detector overcomes the shortcoming of large dark&#8208;current in narrow&#8208;bandgap optoelectronic devices. All these findings provide a brand&#8208;new perspective for fundamental scientific studies and applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each generation of semiconductors, the issue of doping techniques is always placed at the top of the priority list since it determines whether a material can be used in the electronic and optoelectronic industry or not. When it comes to 2D materials, significant challenges have been found in controllably doping 2D semiconductors into p- or n-type, let alone developing a continuous control of this process. Here, a unique self-modulated doping characteristic in 2D layered materials such as PtSSe, PtS&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;, PdSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reported. The varying number of vertically stacked-monolayers is the critical factor for controllably tuning the same material from p-type to intrinsic, and to n-type doping. Importantly, it is found that the thickness-induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies to anion vacancies based on dynamic and thermodynamic analyses, which leads to p- and n-type conductance, respectively. By thickness-modulated doping, WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diode exhibits a high rectification ratio of 4400 and a large open-circuit voltage of 0.38&#160;V. Meanwhile, the PtSSe detector overcomes the shortcoming of large dark-current in narrow-bandgap optoelectronic devices. All these findings provide a brand-new perspective for fundamental scientific studies and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Conductive Protonated Layered Oxides from H2O Vapor&#8208;Annealed Brownmillerites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonated 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides often display low electronic conduction, which hampers their application in electric, magnetic, thermoelectric, and catalytic fields. In this work, a thermal hydration synthesis of conductive protonated oxides from 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides is introduced. By incorporating H2O into the lattice frame, the insulating brownmillerite SrCoO2.5 transforms to a novel layered&#8208;oxide SrCoO3H, which demonstrates a highly improved electric conduction.








Abstract
Protonated 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides often display low electronic conduction, which hampers their application in electric, magnetic, thermoelectric, and catalytic fields. Electronic conduction can be enhanced by co&#8208;inserting oxygen acceptors simultaneously. However, the currently used redox approaches hinder protons and oxygen ions co&#8208;insertion due to the selective switching issues. Here, a thermal hydration strategy for systematically exploring the synthesis of conductive protonated oxides from 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides is introduced. This strategy is illustrated by synthesizing a novel layered&#8208;oxide SrCoO3H from the brownmillerite SrCoO2.5. Compared to the insulating SrCoO2.5, SrCoO3H exhibits an unprecedented high electronic conductivity above room temperature, water uptake at 250&#160;&#176;C, and a thermoelectric power factor of up to 1.2&#160;mW K&#8722;2 m&#8722;1 at 300 K. These findings open up opportunities for creating high&#8208;conductive protonated layered oxides by protons and oxygen ions co&#8208;doping.

         <title>Polymerized Hybrid Perovskites with Enhanced Stability, Flexibility, and Lattice Rigidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid perovskite with unsaturated  organoammoniums is demonstrated to be able to undergo solid&#8208;state polymerization without damaging the perovskite structure. The polymerized perovskite behaves like a polymer with enhanced stability and flexi bility. The lattice rigidity is also enhanced due to the polymerized covalent C&#63743;C bonding. As a result, a stable and efficient polymerized perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.2% is demonstrated.








Abstract
The intrinsic soft lattice nature of organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) makes them very tolerant to defects and ideal candidates for solution&#8208;processed optoelectronic devices. However, the soft lattice results in low stability towards external stresses such as heating and humidity, high density of phonons and strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling (EPC). Here, it is demonstrated that the OHPs with unsaturated 4&#8208;vinylbenzylammonium (VBA) as organoammonium cations can be polymerized without damaging the perovskite structure and its tolerance to defects. The polymerized perovskites show enhanced stability and flexibility compared to regular three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites. Furthermore, the polymerized 4&#8208;vinylbenzylammonium group improves perovskite lattice rigidity substantially, resulting in a reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination rate because of suppressed electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and enhanced carrier mobility because of suppressed phonon scattering. 2D polymerized perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with strong electroluminescence at room temperature, and quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.2% and enhanced operation stability are demonstrated. The work has opened a new way of enhancing the intrinsic stability and optoelectronic properties of OHPs.

         <title>Understanding the Synergistic Oxidation in Dichalcogenides through Electrochemiluminescence Blinking at Millisecond Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic oxidation in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is revealed through electrochemiluminescence blinking. The formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the oxygen migration to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping, which favors the formation of Mo&#8211;O&#8211;Mo, as active sites. This mechanism is universal to transition metal dichalcogenides containing sulfur atoms.








Abstract
The oxidation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has been extensively studied and applied in electronics, optics, and energy sources because of its tunable structure and performance. However, due to the lack of appropriate technology, dynamically observe the oxidation process remains an arduous task. Herein, the synergistic oxidation between edge and basal plane in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is observed through electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) blinking with a millisecond resolution. In addition, the ECL method provides a simple, convenient, and quick way to judge structural changes. The transient elevation of the ECL intensity proved the intermittent doping of oxygen at MoS2, which generates O&#8208;atom active sites. High ECL intensity enhanced from the produced hydroperoxide intermediates eases the monitoring of MoS2 particles. Further study shows that the formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the migration of oxygen to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping that favors the formation of Mo&#63743;O&#63743;Mo as new active sites to induce bursts. The revealing of sulfur vacancy&#8208;governed blinking from MoS2 indicates a complex interaction between oxygen and MoS2. The same phenomenon is observed on tungsten disulfide (WS2), which provides new information about the oxidation feature of 2D dichalcogenides.

         <title>Reborn Three&#8208;Dimensional Graphene with Ultrahigh Volumetric Desalination Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D graphene (3DG) is repeatedly crushed and reshaped to upgrade its overall performance like &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana.&#8221; 3DG is reborn to a higher self as NvG, making it emerge with unprecedented advantages in areas such as capacitive deionization and becoming a new engine to initiate the development of innovative 3D structures for carbon materials.








Abstract
The constructing of 3D materials with optimal performance is urgently needed to meet the growing demand of advanced materials in the high&#8208;tech sector. A distinctive 3D graphene (3DG) is designed based on a repeated rebirth strategy to obtain a better body and performance after each round of rebirth, as if it is Phoenix Nirvana. The properties of reborn graphene, namely 3DG after Nirvana (NvG), has been dramatically upgraded compared to 3DG, including high density (3.36 times) together with high porosity, as well as better electrical conductivity (1.41 times), mechanical strength (32.4 times), and ultrafast infiltration behavior. These advantages of NvG make it a strong intrinsic motivation for application in capacitive deionization (CDI). Using NvG directly as the CDI electrode, it has an extremely high volumetric capacity of 220&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a maximum salt absorption capacity of 8.02~9.2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3 (8.9&#8211;10.2 times), while the power consumption for adsorption of the same mass of salt is less than a quarter of 3DG. The &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana&#8221;&#8208;like strategy of manufacturing 3D structures will undoubtedly become the new engine to kick&#8208;start the development of innovative carbon materials through an overall performance upgrade.

         <title>Revamping Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries for High Cell&#8208;Level Energy Density by Synergistic Utilization of Polysulfide Additives and Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Layers</title>

         <dc:description>
A practical approach for achieving a high &#8220;cell&#8208;level&#8221; energy density using lithium polysulfides (LPS)&#8208;containing electrolytes and Li2S&#8208;phobic artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (A&#8208;SEI) layers is presented. The synergistic effects from the LPS and A&#8208;SEI result in superior cell&#8208;level volumetric energy densities (&#8776;650&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1) and large cumulative energy densities considering cycling life. 








Abstract
Despite the high theoretical capacity of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, a high cell&#8208;level energy density and a long cycling life are barely achieved, mainly due to the large electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio, polysulfide (PS) shuttle causing the loss of active sulfur, and the formation of passivation layers on the Li anode. To raise the energy density, holding PS in the cathode has been the most popular approach. Still, it has failed, particularly, when the sulfur loading is high enough to have energy densities similar to those of commercial Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a practical approach of achieving high &#8220;cell&#8208;level&#8221; energy densities is attempted using lithium PS (LPS)&#8208;containing electrolytes instead of a pure electrolyte, reducing the electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio and PS diffusion out of the cathode due to concentration differences. Meanwhile, the persistent problems including PS passivation and Li dendrites are suppressed using Li2S&#8208;phobic artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (A&#8208;SEI) layers on Li metal. The synergistic effects from the LPS additives and A&#8208;SEI result in a superior cell&#8208;level volumetric energy density of 650&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1 as well as large cumulative energy densities considering cycling life. This approach provides an important stepping stone to realize commercial Li&#8211;S batteries rivaling the current Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Phototriggered Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Direct Generation of 4D Soft Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to realize remote spatio&#8208;temporal control of luminescence behavior of materials through a phototriggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission (PTAIE) process is reported. With the strategy, laser&#8208;mediated mask&#8208;free writing and transformable 4D soft patterns of AIE&#8208;active gels are realized.








Abstract
Microscopic control of macroscopic phenomena is one of the core subjects in materials science. Particularly, the spatio&#8208;temporal control of material behaviors through a non&#8208;contact way is of fundamental importance but is difficult to accomplish. Herein, a strategy to realize remote spatio&#8208;temporal control of luminescence behaviors is reported. A multi&#8208;arm salicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazone&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)/metal&#8208;ion system, of which the fluorescence can be gated by the UV irradiation with time dependency, is developed. By changing the metal&#8208;ion species, the fluorescence emission and the intensity can also be tuned. The mechanism of the UV&#8208;mediated fluorescence change is investigated, and it is revealed that a phototriggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission (PTAIE) process contributes to the behaviors. The AIEgen is further covalently integrated into a polymeric network and the formed gel/metal&#8208;ion system can achieve laser&#8208;mediated mask&#8208;free writing enabled by the PTAIE process. Moreover, by further taking advantage of the time&#8208;dependent self&#8208;healing property of hydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent bond, transformable 4D soft patterns are generated. The findings and the strategy increase the ways to manipulate molecules on the supramolecule or aggregate level. They also show opportunities for the development of controllable smart materials and expand the scope of the materials in advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthesis Functionalization Enables Fine&#8208;Tuning the Molecular&#8208;Sieving Properties of Zeolites for Light Olefin/Paraffin Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective size of zeolite pores is systematically tuned using a versatile method wherein organic molecules are covalently attached to zeolite frameworks via bridging oxygens using an electrophile, thereby obtaining size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separations. 4&#8208;Methoxybenzene&#8208;functionalized MOR separates ethylene from ethane, whereas toluene&#8208;grafted MOR separates propylene/propane mixtures. Therefore, tailoring the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of zeolites by organic&#8208;functionalization broadens their applications to challenging separations.








Abstract
Zeolite molecular sieves are widely used in gas separation and shape&#8208;selective catalysis, but these applications often require discriminating differences as little as 0.1 &#197;. Molecular sieving with such size selectivity demands zeolites with highly tunable pore diameters and adsorption properties, which are technically challenging to prepare. Nevertheless, it is shown that a wide range of organic functional groups can be covalently functionalized onto the interior pore walls of the zeolites, MOR, LTL, FAU, and MFI, to systematically &#8220;tune&#8221; their effective pore diameters with respect to the size of organic groups. For organic functionalization, small and aggressive organic electrophiles are used (e.g., organo&#8208;halide and &#8208;diazonium) as grafting agents, which are accessible to the intracrystalline void space, forming a C&#8211;Ozeolite bond in a reaction with a bridging oxygen as proved by multiple analysis data. It is demonstrated that the post&#8208;functionalization can be used to tailor the molecular sieving action of a parent zeolite to give size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separations. 4&#8208;Methoxybenzene&#8208;functionalized MOR separates ethylene from ethane with an ideal&#8208;adsorbed&#8208;solution&#8208;theory selectivity of &#8776;5873, whereas toluene&#8208;grafted MOR completely separates propylene/propane mixtures. Therefore, tailoring the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of zeolites by organic functionalization broadens their applications to challenging separations.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Black Phosphorus Heterostructures with Improved Ambient Stability and Enhanced Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering strategy is demonstrated to prepare ambient stable black phosphorus (BP)/hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) hybrid heterostructures. This strategy not only modifies the band structure of BP sheets but also improves their charge mobility, paving the way toward ambient processing and fabrication of high&#8208;performance BP&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Overcoming the intrinsic instability and preserving unique electronic properties are key challenges for the practical applications of black phosphorus (BP) under ambient conditions. Here, it is demonstrated that molecular heterostructures of BP and hexaazatriphenylene derivatives (BP/HATs) enable improved environmental stability and charge transport properties. The strong interfacial coupling and charge transfer between the HATs and the BP lattice decrease the surface electron density and protect BP sheets from oxidation, resulting in an excellent ambient lifetime of up to 21 d. Importantly, HATs increase the charge scattering time of BP, contributing to an improved carrier mobility of 97 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, almost three times of the pristine BP films, based on noninvasive THz spectroscopic studies. The film mobility is an order of magnitude larger than previously reported values in exfoliated 2D materials. The strategy opens up new avenues for versatile applications of BP sheets and provides an effective method for tuning the physicochemical properties of other air&#8208;sensitive 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic&#8211;Organic Isoporous Membranes with Tunable Pore Sizes and Functionalities for Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes are fabricated via sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition within block copolymer membranes followed by addition of functional organic molecules. The membrane pore sizes are controlled by metal oxide growth in a predictive manner. The hybrid membranes exhibit superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2 nm organic molecules and similar&#8208;sized proteins.








Abstract
Accomplishing on&#8208;demand molecular separation with a high selectivity and good permeability is very desirable for pollutant removal and chemical and pharmaceutical processing. The major challenge for sub&#8208;10&#160;nm filtration of particles and molecules is the fabrication of high&#8208;performance membranes with tunable pore size and designed functionality. Here, a versatile top&#8208;down approach is demonstrated to produce such a membrane using isoporous block copolymer membranes with well&#8208;defined pore sizes combined with growth of metal oxide using sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition (SIS and ALD). The pore size of the membranes is tuned by controlled metal oxide growth within and onto the polymer channels, enabling up to twofold pore diameter reduction. Following the growth, the distinct functionalities are readily incorporated along the membrane nanochannels with either hydrophobic, cationic, or anionic groups via straightforward and scalable gas/liquid&#8211;solid interface reactions. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the membrane nanochannel is significantly changed by the introduction of hydrophilic metal oxide and hydrophobic fluorinated groups. The functionalized membranes exhibit a superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2&#160;nm organic molecules and fractionating similar&#8208;sized proteins based on size, charge, and hydrophobicity. This demonstrates the great potential of organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes for high&#8208;performance molecular separation in numerous applications.

         <title>Textile Waste Fiber Regeneration via a Green Chemistry Approach: A Molecular Strategy for Sustainable Fashion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green chemical method for complete separation and regeneration of natural/synthetic blended fabrics is introduced, which aims to provide a universal recycling strategy for fast fashion waste and provide a new source of fibers. Besides single&#8208;component fibers, a new composite fiber consisting of cellulose and wool keratin is also regenerated, which presents unique morphology differing from previous studies.








Abstract
Fast fashion, as a continuously growing part of the textile industry, is widely criticized for its excessive resource use and high generation of textiles. To reduce its environmental impacts, numerous efforts are focused on finding sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to textile recycling. However, waste textiles and fibers are still mainly disposed of in landfills or by incineration after their service life and thereby pollute the natural environment, as there is still no effective strategy to separate natural fibers from chemical fibers. Herein, a green chemistry strategy is developed for the separation and regeneration of waste textiles at the molecular level. Cellulose/wool keratin composite fibers and multicomponent fibers are regenerated from waste textiles via a green chemical process. The strategy attempts to reduce the large amount of waste textiles generated by the fast&#8208;developing fashion industry and provide a new source of fibers, which can also address the fossil fuel reserve shortages caused by chemical fiber industries and global food shortages caused by natural fiber production.

         <title>Elastic Lattice and Excess Charge Carrier Manipulation in 1D&#8211;3D Perovskite Solar Cells for Exceptionally Long&#8208;Term Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;strictive strain in 3D polycrystalline perovskite is observed, which can lead to an accelerated ion migration under operational conditions. The 1D&#8211;3D perovskite, that is, 1D BnPbI3 perovskite, spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film and compensating the dangling bonds in the grain boundaries, can effectively inhibit electro&#8208;strictive  responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, realizing ultralong operational stability.








Abstract
3D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) inherently face severe instability issue due to ion migration under operational conditions. This ion migration inevitably results from the decomposition of ionic bonds under lattice strain and is accelerated by the existence of excess charge carriers. In this study, a 1D&#8211;3D mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite material is explored by adding an organic salt with a bulk benzimidazole cation (Bn+). The Bn+ can induce 3D perovskite crystalline growth with the preferred orientation and form a 1D BnPbI3 perovskite spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film. For the first time, the electro&#8208;strictive response, which has a significant influence on the lattice strain under an electric field, is observed in polycrystalline perovskite. The 1D&#8211;3D perovskite can effectively suppress electro&#8208;strictive responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, providing an intrinsically stable lattice with enhanced ionic bonds and fewer excess charge carriers. As a result, the ion migration behavior of the p&#8208;i&#8208;n 1D&#8211;3D based pero&#8208;SC is dramatically suppressed under operational conditions, showing ultra&#8208;long&#8208;term stability that retains 95.3% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) under operation for 3072 h, and simultaneously achieving an excellent PCE with a hysteresis&#8208;free photovoltaic behavior.

The 3D&#8208;scaffold with porous structure endows the system with similar functions to real lymphoid organs by the recruitment of a large number of immune cells, leading to the formation of &#8220;artificial tertiary lymphoid structures&#8221; (aTLS), which are promising sites to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses. Efficient anticancer immunity is induced when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.

Capacitive Pressure Sensors
Low sensitivity at large pressure has been a long&#8208;lasting obstacle of capacitive pressure sensors. In article number 2103320, Nanshu Lu and co&#8208;workers introduce a hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor (HRPS), which offers a promising solution to this challenge. By laminating an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite (PNC) with an ultrathin insulating layer, the combined piezoresistivity and piezocapacitivity of the PNC enable up to 423% improvement over existing sensors.

Topological Nodal Line States
A mirror helps light rays to make an image of an object; the mirror planes in a material's crystal structure similarly guide electrons and enhance the properties. In article number 2104126, Chandra Shekhar and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the abundance of such mirror planes is primarily responsible for topological nodal line states at the Fermi energy in some ferromagnetic metals, leading to a large anomalous Hall conductivity.

Molecular Sieves
Zeolite molecular sieves are widely used in gas separation, but this application often requires discriminating differences as little as 0.1 &#197;. Molecular sieving with such size selectivity demands zeolites with highly tunable pore diameters. In article number 2105398, Michal Mazur, Hae Sung Cho, Changbum Jo, and co&#8208;workers report the development of a versatile method for tuning zeolite micropores by attaching organic molecules to internal bridging oxygens, thereby obtaining size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separation.

         <title>Conquering the Hypoxia Limitation for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy is often restricted by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). The strategies deve loped to alleviate tumor hypoxia in the past decades are reviewed, including delivering exogenous O2, in situ O2 generation, reducing cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, regulating the TME, and inhibiting the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has aroused great research interest in recent years owing to its high spatiotemporal selectivity, minimal invasiveness, and low systemic toxicity. However, due to the hypoxic nature characteristic of many solid tumors, PDT is frequently limited in therapeutic effect. Moreover, the consumption of O2 during PDT may further aggravate the tumor hypoxic condition, which promotes tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion resulting in poor prognosis of treatment. Therefore, numerous efforts have been made to increase the O2 content in tumor with the goal of enhancing PDT efficacy. Herein, these strategies developed in past decade are comprehensively reviewed to alleviate tumor hypoxia, including 1) delivering exogenous O2 to tumor directly, 2) generating O2 in situ, 3) reducing tumor cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, 4) regulating the TME, (e.g., normalizing tumor vasculature or disrupting tumor extracellular matrix), and 5) inhibiting the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway to relieve tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the O2&#8208;independent Type&#8208;I PDT is also discussed as an alternative strategy. By reviewing recent progress, it is hoped that this review will provide innovative perspectives in new nanomaterials designed to combat hypoxia and avoid the associated limitation of PDT.

&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of photodynamic therapy is often restricted by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). The strategies deve loped to alleviate tumor hypoxia in the past decades are reviewed, including delivering exogenous O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in situ O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation, reducing cellular O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption by inhibiting respiration, regulating the TME, and inhibiting the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has aroused great research interest in recent years owing to its high spatiotemporal selectivity, minimal invasiveness, and low systemic toxicity. However, due to the hypoxic nature characteristic of many solid tumors, PDT is frequently limited in therapeutic effect. Moreover, the consumption of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during PDT may further aggravate the tumor hypoxic condition, which promotes tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion resulting in poor prognosis of treatment. Therefore, numerous efforts have been made to increase the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content in tumor with the goal of enhancing PDT efficacy. Herein, these strategies developed in past decade are comprehensively reviewed to alleviate tumor hypoxia, including 1) delivering exogenous O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to tumor directly, 2) generating O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in situ, 3) reducing tumor cellular O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption by inhibiting respiration, 4) regulating the TME, (e.g., normalizing tumor vasculature or disrupting tumor extracellular matrix), and 5) inhibiting the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway to relieve tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-independent Type-I PDT is also discussed as an alternative strategy. By reviewing recent progress, it is hoped that this review will provide innovative perspectives in new nanomaterials designed to combat hypoxia and avoid the associated limitation of PDT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Bifunctional Proteins for Targeted Cancer Therapy: Prospects and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of various forms of bifunctional proteins (BFPs) for cancer treatment is becoming increasingly popular and important. BFPs can simultaneously act on different components in the tumor microenvironment, which are expected to play a diverse role in combating tumor heterogeneity and improving treatment outcomes. A variety of preclinical and early&#8208;stage clinical studies have reported their great potential in cancer treatment.








Abstract
Bifunctional proteins (BFPs) are a class of therapeutic agents produced through genetic engineering and protein engineering, and are increasingly used to treat various human diseases, including cancer. These proteins usually have two or more biological functions&#8212;specifically recognizing different molecular targets to regulate the related signaling pathways, or mediating effector molecules/cells to kill tumor cells. Unlike conventional small&#8208;molecule or single&#8208;target drugs, BFPs possess stronger biological activity but lower systemic toxicity. Hence, BFPs are considered to offer many benefits for the treatment of heterogeneous tumors. In this review, the authors briefly describe the unique structural feature of BFP molecules and innovatively divide them into bispecific antibodies, cytokine&#8208;based BFPs (immunocytokines), and protein toxin&#8208;based BFPs (immunotoxins) according to their mode of action. In addition, the latest advances in the development of BFPs are discussed and the potential limitations or problems in clinical applications are outlined. Taken together, future studies need to be centered on understanding the characteristics of BFPs for optimizing and designing more effective such drugs.

         <title>Advances in Microwave Synthesis of Nanoporous Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave ovens can be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various  porous materials including silicas, carbons, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and metal oxides. Microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers a simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtain nanoporous materials. The recent achievements in the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of these  diverse nanoporous materials and their potential applications are summarized.








Abstract
Usually, porous materials are synthesized by using conventional electric heating, which can be energy&#8208; and time&#8208;consuming. Microwave heating is commonly used in many households to quickly heat food. Microwave ovens can also be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various porous materials. The microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers a simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtain many of the advanced nanomaterials. This review summarizes the recent achievements in the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of diverse groups of nanoporous materials including silicas, carbons, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and metal oxides. Microwave&#8208;assisted methods afford highly porous materials with high specific surface areas (SSAs), e.g., activated carbons with SSA &#8776;3100 m2 g&#8722;1, metal&#8211;organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;4200&#160;m2 g&#8722;1, covalent organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;2900 m2 g&#8722;1, and metal oxides with relatively small SSA &#8776;300 m2 g&#8722;1. These methods are also successfully implemented for the preparation of ordered mesoporous silicas and carbons as well as spherically shaped nanomaterials. Most of the nanoporous materials obtained under microwave irradiation show potential applications in gas adsorption, water treatment, catalysis, energy storage, and drug delivery, among others.

         <title>Manipulating Intratumoral Fenton Chemistry for Enhanced Chemodynamic and Chemodynamic&#8208;Synergized Multimodal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advances in reinforcement strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction are discussed. Then, multimodal anticancer therapies involving enhanced chemodynamic therapy and mechanisms of synergy are highlighted. Finally, the major challenges and further improvements of this evolving field are elaborated.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) uses the tumor microenvironment&#8208;assisted intratumoral Fenton reaction for generating highly toxic hydroxyl free radicals (&#8226;OH) to achieve selective tumor treatment. However, the limited intratumoral Fenton reaction efficiency restricts the therapeutic efficacy of CDT. Recent years have witnessed the impressive development of various strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction. The introduction of these reinforcement strategies can dramatically improve the treatment efficiency of CDT and further promote the development of enhanced CDT (ECDT)&#8208;based multimodal anticancer treatments. In this review, the authors systematically introduce these reinforcement strategies, from their basic working principles, reinforcement mechanisms to their representative clinical applications. Then, ECDT&#8208;based multimodal anticancer therapy is discussed, including how to integrate these emerging Fenton reinforcement strategies for accelerating the development of multimodal anticancer therapy, as well as the synergistic mechanisms of ECDT and other treatment methods. Eventually, future direction and challenges of ECDT and ECDT&#8208;based multimodal synergistic therapies are elaborated, highlighting the key scientific problems and unsolved technical bottlenecks to facilitate clinical translation.

         <title>Unraveling the Molar Mass Dependence of Shearing Induced Aggregation Structure of a High Mobility Polymer Semiconductor</title>

Abstract
Aggregation structure formation of conjugated polymers is a fundamental problem in the field of organic electronics and remains poorly understood. Herein, we thoroughly show the molar mass dependence of the aggregation structure of a high&#8208;mobility conjugated copolymer (TDPP&#8208;Se) comprising thiophene&#8208;flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and selenophene. Five batches of TDPP&#8208;Se are prepared with number&#8208;average molecular weights (Mn) varied greatly from 21 to 135&#160;kg mol&#8722;1. We combine small&#8208;angle neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy to probe the solution structure of these polymers, consistently using a deuterated solvent. All the polymers adopt the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) rod&#8208;like aggregation structures and the radius of 1D rod is not sensitive to the Mn while the length increases monotonically with the Mn. By utilizing the ordered packing of the aggregated structure in solution, we prepare highly aligned and ordered film and thereafter realize a reliable hole mobility of up to 13.8 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 in organic thin&#8208;film transistors with the moderate Mn batch via bar coating. The hole mobility is among the highest values reported for diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers in the literature. This work paves the way to visualize the real aggregated structure of polymer semiconductors in solution state and sheds light on the aggregation structure control of high&#8208;performance electronic devices.

         <title>Light&#8208;controlled Nucleation and Shaping of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Controlling self&#8208;assembly of nanocomposites is a fundamental challenge with exciting implications for next&#8208;generation advanced functional materials. Precursors for composites can be generated photochemically, but limited insight in the underlying processes have hindered precise hands&#8208;on guidance. In this study, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Carbonate is generated photochemically using ultraviolet (UV) light to steer the precipitation of nanocomposites of barium carbonate nanocrystals and amorphous silica (BaCO3/SiO2). Using a custom&#8208;build optical setup, the self&#8208;assembly process is controlled by optimizing the photogeneration, diffusion, reaction, and precipitation of the carbonate species, using the radius and intensity of the UV&#8208;light irradiated area and reaction temperature. Exploiting this control, nucleation is induced and the contours and individual features of the growing composite are sculpted according to micrometer&#8208;defined light patterns. Moreover, moving light patterns are exploited to create a constant carbonate concentration at the growth front to draw lines of nanocomposites with constant width over millimeters with micrometer precision. Light&#8208;directed generation of local gradients opens previously unimaginable opportunities for guiding self&#8208;assembly into functional materials.

         <title>Creating A Ferromagnetic Ground State with Tc Above Room Temperature in A Paramagnetic Alloy Through Non&#8208;equilibrium Nano&#8208;structuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Materials with strong magneto&#8208;structural coupling have complex energy landscapes featuring multiple local ground states, thus making it possible to switch among distinct magnetic&#8208;electronic properties. However, these energy minima are rarely accessible by a mere application of an external stimuli to the system in equilibrium state. Here, we report that a ferromagnetic ground state, with Tc above room temperature, can be created in an initially paramagnetic alloy by non&#8208;equilibrium nano&#8208;structuring. By dealloying process we transformed bulk chemically&#8208;disordered FeRh alloys into a nanoporous structure with a topology of a few nanometer&#8208;sized ligaments and nodes. Magnetometry and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy revealed the co&#8208;existence of two magnetic ground states &#8208; a conventional low&#8208;temperature spin glass and a hitherto&#8208;unknown robust ferromagnetic phase. The emergence of the ferromagnetic phase is validated by the density functional theory calculations showing that local tetragonal distortion induced by surface stress favors ferromagnetic ordering. Our study provides a means for reaching conventionally inaccessible magnetic states, resulting in a complete on/off ferromagnetic&#8208;paramagnetic switching over a broad temperature range.

         <title>Controlled n&#8208;Doping of Naphthalene Diimide&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) are promising as structurally well&#8208;defined, permanently porous, organic semiconductors. However, 2DPs are nearly always isolated as closed shell organic species with limited charge carriers, which leads to low bulk conductivities. Here, we enhance the bulk conductivity of two naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;containing 2DP semiconductors by controllably n&#8208;doping the NDI units using cobaltocene (CoCp2). Optical and transient microwave spectroscopy reveals that both as&#8208;prepared NDI&#8208;containing 2DPs are semiconducting with sub&#8208;2&#160;eV optical bandgaps and photoexcited charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes of tens of nanoseconds. Following reduction with CoCp2, both 2DPs largely retain their periodic structures and exhibit optical and electron&#8208;spin resonance spectroscopic features consistent with the presence of NDI&#8208;radical anions. While the native NDI&#8208;based 2DPs are electronically insulating, maximum bulk conductivities of &gt;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 are achieved by substoichiometric levels of n&#8208;doping. Density functional theory calculations show that the strongest electronic couplings in these 2DPs exist in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (&#960;&#8208;stacking) crystallographic directions, which indicates that cross&#8208;plane electronic transport through NDI stacks is primarily responsible for the observed electronic conductivity. Taken together, this study underlines that controlled molecular doping is a useful approach to access structurally well&#8208;defined, paramagnetic, 2DP n&#8208;type semiconductors with measurable bulk electronic conductivities of interest for electronic or spintronic devices.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Selectivity and &#8220;Order in Disorder&#8221; Engineering in Carbon for Durable and Fast Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Defect&#8208;rich carbon materials possess high gravimetric potassium storage capability due to the abundance of active sites, but their cyclic stability is limited because of the low reversibility of undesirable defects and the deteriorative conductivity. Herein, we report an in&#8208;situ defect&#8208;selectivity and order in disorder synergetic engineering in carbon materials via a self&#8208;template strategy to boost the K+ storage capacity, rate capability and cyclic stability simultaneously. The defect&#8208;sites are selectively tuned to realize abundant reversible carbon&#8208;vacancies as well as the sacrifice of poor&#8208;reversible heteroatom&#8208;defects through the persistent gas release during pyrolysis. Meanwhile, the nanobubbles generated during pyrolysis serve as the self&#8208;templates to induce the surface atom rearrangement, thus in&#8208;situ embedding nanographitic networks in defective domains without serious phase separation, which greatly enhance the intrinsic conductivity. The synergetic &#8220;order in disorder&#8221; structure ensures high concentration of reversible carbon&#8208;vacancies and fast charge transfer kinetics simultaneously, leading to high reversible capacity (425 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1), high&#8208;rate (237.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1) and superior cyclic stability (90.4% capacity retention from cycle 10 to 400 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1). This work provides a rational and facile strategy to realize the tradeoff between defect sites and intrinsic conductivity, and gives deep insights into the mechanism of reversible potassium storage.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomachinery for Enhancement of Bone Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The visionary idea that RNA adopts non&#8208;biological roles in today's nanomaterial world has been nothing short of phenomenal. These RNA molecules have ample chemical functionality and self&#8208;assemble to form distinct nanostructures in response to external stimuli. They may be combined with inorganic materials to produce nanomachines that carry cargo to the target sites in a controlled manner and respond dynamically to environmental changes. Comparable to biological cells, programmed RNA nanomachines have the potential to replicate bone healing in vitro. Here, an RNA&#8208;biomineral nanomachine has been developed that accomplishes intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar mineralization of collagen scaffolds to mimic bone formation in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulation indicates that noncovalent hydrogen bonding provides the energy source that initiates self&#8208;assembly of these RNA&#8208;biomineral nanomachines. Incorporation of RNA&#8208;biomineral nanomachines into collagen scaffolds in vivo creates an osteoinductive microenvironment within a bone defect that is conducive to rapid biomineralization and osteogenesis. Addition of RNA degrading enzymes into the RNA&#8208;biomineral nanomachines further creates a stop signal that inhibits unwarranted bone formation in tissues other than bone and teeth. The potential of RNA in building functional nanostructures has been underestimated in the past. The concept of RNA&#8208;biomineral nanomachines participating in physiological processes may transform the nanoscopic world of life science.

         <title>NIR&#8208;responsive TiO2 Biometasurface: Towards in situ Photodynamic Antibacterial Therapy for Biomedical Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The implant&#8208;related microbial infection is a challenging clinical problem and its treatment requires efficient eradiation of the biofilm from the implant surface. NIR&#8208;responsive strategies have been proposed as an emerging efficient antibacterial therapy. However, the utilization of photosensitizer or photocatalytic/photothermal nanomaterials in the available approach likely induces high potential risks of interfacial deterioration and biosafety compromise. Herein, TiO2/TiO2&#8208;X metasurface with potent NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial activity was produced on Ti alloy implant by a newly invented topochemical conversion&#8208;based alkaline&#8208;acid bidirectional hydrothermal method (aaBH). Electromagnetic simulations proved that NIR absorption and near&#8208;field distribution of the metasurface can be tuned by the dimension and arrangement of the nanostructural unit. Promising antibacterial efficacy was proved by both in vitro and in vivo tests, with low power NIR irradiation for 10 mins. Besides, the designed nanostructure in the metasurface itself also showed excellence in enhancing the adhesion&#8208;related gene expression of human gingival fibroblasts that were exposed to 10 mins NIR irradiation, proving the potent nanostructure&#8208;induced biological effects. This work provides a biosafe and upscalable metasurfacing approach with extraordinary capacity of manipulating light adsorption, photocatalysis, and biological properties.

         <title>Kinetics Manipulation Enables High&#8208;performance Thick Ternary Organic Solar Cells via R2R Compatible Slot&#8208;die Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) have crossed 18% mark largely fabricated by spin coating, and optimal photoactive thickness is limited to 100&#160;nm. To increase reproducibility of results with industrial roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing, we used slot&#8208;die coating coupled with ternary strategy for optimal performance of large are thick OSCs. Based on miscibility differences, we incorporated a highly crystalline molecule BTR&#8208;Cl and regulated the phase separation kinetics of D18:Y6 film. BTR&#8208;Cl provides an early liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and early aggregation of Y6, which slightly improves the molecular crystallinity and vertical phase separation of ternary blends, resulting in high PCEs of 17.2% and 15.5% for respective thicknesses of 110 and 300&#160;nm photoactive films. Our ternary design strategy for large area and thick films was further utilized to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency flexible devices, which promises reproducibility of our lab results from slot&#8208;die coating to industrial R2R manufacturing.

         <title>Ion Migration in Perovskite Light Emitting Diodes: Mechanism, Characterizations, and Material and Device Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent years, perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have emerged as a promising new lighting technology with high external quantum efficiency, color purity, and wavelength tunability as well as low&#8208;temperature processability. However, the operational stability of PeLEDs is still insufficient for their commercialization. The generation and migration of ionic species in metal halide perovskites has been widely acknowledged as the primary factor causing the performance degradation of PeLEDs. In this review, this topic is systematically discussed by considering the fundamental and engineering aspects of ion&#8208;related issues in PeLEDs, including the material and processing origins of ion generation, the mechanisms driving ion migration, characterization approaches for probing ion distributions, the effects of ion migration on device performance and stability, and strategies for ion management in PeLEDs. Finally, perspectives on remaining challenges and future opportunities are highlighted.

         <title>A Universal Approach for Room&#8208;Temperature Printing and Coating of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregated suspensions of 2D materials with high&#8208;enough concentrations can be processed into homogenous gel inks for various printing and coating methods. The stability of the inks, their rheological properties, and film formation behavior mainly depend on their interflake van der Waals interactions, eliminating the need for addition of the conventional additives and enabling their room&#8208;temperature processing.








Abstract
Processing 2D materials into printable or coatable inks for the fabrication of functional devices has proven to be quite difficult. Additives are often used in large concentrations to address the processing challenges, but they drastically degrade the electronic properties of the materials. To remove the additives a high&#8208;temperature post&#8208;deposition treatment can be used, but this complicates the fabrication process and limits the choice of materials (i.e., no heat&#8208;sensitive materials). In this work, by exploiting the unique properties of 2D materials, a universal strategy for the formulation of additive&#8208;free inks is developed, in which the roles of the additives are taken over by van der Waals (vdW) interactions. In this new class of inks, which is termed &#8220;vdW inks&#8221;, solvents are dispersed within the interconnected network of 2D materials, minimizing the dispersibility&#8208;related limitations on solvent selection. Furthermore, flow behavior of the inks and mechanical properties of the resultant films are mainly controlled by the interflake vdW attractions. The structure of the vdW inks, their rheological properties, and film&#8208;formation behavior are discussed in detail. Large&#8208;scale production and formulation of the vdW inks for major high&#8208;throughput printing and coating methods, as well as their application for room&#8208;temperature fabrication of functional films/devices are demonstrated.

         <title>Critical Review, Recent Updates on Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) and Its Derivatives for Electrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Design and construction of low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability is a challenging task in the field of catalysis. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) are promising candidates as precursor materials in the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications. This review starts with a summary of basic concepts and key evaluation parameters involved in the electrochemical water&#8208;splitting reaction. Then different synthesis approaches reported for the cobalt&#8208;based Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;67) and its derivatives are critically reviewed. Additionally, several strategies employed to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability of ZIF&#8208;67 based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail. The present review provides a succinct insight into the ZIF&#8208;67 and its derivatives (oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphide, nitrides, telluride, heteroatom/metal&#8208;doped carbon, noble metal&#8208;supported ZIF&#8208;67 derivatives) reported for OER, HER, and overall water splitting applications. Finally, this review concludes with the associated challenges and our perspectives on developing the best economic, durable electrocatalytic materials.

&lt;p&gt;Design and construction of low-cost electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and long-term stability is a challenging task in the field of catalysis. Metal-organic frameworks (MOF) are promising candidates as precursor materials in the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications. This review starts with a summary of basic concepts and key evaluation parameters involved in the electrochemical water-splitting reaction. Then different synthesis approaches reported for the cobalt-based Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) and its derivatives are critically reviewed. Additionally, several strategies employed to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability of ZIF-67 based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail. The present review provides a succinct insight into the ZIF-67 and its derivatives (oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphide, nitrides, telluride, heteroatom/metal-doped carbon, noble metal-supported ZIF-67 derivatives) reported for OER, HER, and overall water splitting applications. Finally, this review concludes with the associated challenges and our perspectives on developing the best economic, durable electrocatalytic materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Smart Face Mask Based on an Ultrathin Pressure Sensor for Wireless Monitoring of Breath Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thinnest (totally compressed thickness of &#8776;5.5&#160;&#181;m) and lightest (total weight of &#8776;4.5&#160;mg) self&#8208;powered pressure sensor developed can output a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage up to &#8776;10&#160;V when stimulated by airflow. A portable/wearable smart face mask is obtained based on the sensor and is used for wireless monitoring and analysis of various breath conditions from multiple testers.








Abstract
A smart face mask that can conveniently monitor breath information is beneficial for maintaining personal health and preventing the spread of diseases. However, some challenges still need to be addressed before such devices can be of practical use. One key challenge is to develop a pressure sensor that is easily triggered by low pressure and has excellent stability as well as electrical and mechanical properties. In this study, a wireless smart face mask is designed by integrating an ultrathin self&#8208;powered pressure sensor and a compact readout circuit with a normal face mask. The pressure sensor is the thinnest (totally compressed thickness of &#8776;5.5&#160;&#181;m) and lightest (total weight of &#8776;4.5&#160;mg) electrostatic pressure sensor capable of achieving a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of up to &#8776;10&#160;V when stimulated by airflow, which endows the sensor with the advantage of readout circuit miniaturization and makes the breath&#8208;monitoring system portable and wearable. To demonstrate the capabilities of the smart face mask, it is used to wirelessly measure and analyze the various breath conditions of multiple testers.

         <title>Bright and Stable Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedently bright, efficient, and stable quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) are presented by multilateral approaches, including appropriate modification of the QD structure and optimization of the device architecture, via resolving heat&#8208;related degradation, enhancing light&#8208;outcoupling, and controlling the excitonic states precisely, which expands the applications of QLEDs as a light source.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) are one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation displays and lighting sources, but they are barely used because vulnerability to electrical and thermal stresses precludes high brightness, efficiency, and stability at high current density (J) regimes. Here, bright and stable QLEDs on a Si substrate are demonstrated, expanding their potential application boundary over the present art. First, a tailored interface is granted to the quantum dots, maximizing the quantum yield and mitigating nonradiative Auger decay of the multiexcitons generated at high&#8208;J regimes. Second, a heat&#8208;endurable, top&#8208;emission device architecture is employed and optimized based on optical simulation to enhance the light outcoupling efficiency. The multilateral approaches realize that the red top&#8208;emitting QLEDs exhibit a maximum luminance of 3&#160;300&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, a current efficiency of 75.6&#160;cd A&#8722;1, and an operational lifetime of 125&#160;000&#160;000 h at an initial brightness of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which are the highest of the values reported so far.

         <title>Fast Ionic Storage in Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The highly dynamic nature of grid&#8208;scale energy systems necessitates fast kinetics in energy storage and conversion systems. Rechargeable aqueous batteries are a promising energy&#8208;storage solution for renewable&#8208;energy grids as the ionic diffusivity in aqueous electrolytes can be up to 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than in organic systems, in addition to being highly safe and low cost. Recent research in this regard has focussed on developing suitable electrode materials for fast ionic storage in aqueous electrolytes. In this review, breakthroughs in the field of fast ionic storage in aqueous battery materials, and one&#8208;/two&#8208;/three&#8208;dimensional (1D/2D/3D) and over&#8208;3D&#8208;tunnel materials are summarized, and tunnels in over&#8208;3D materials are not oriented in any direction in particular. Various materials with different tunnel sizes have been developed to be suitable for the different ionic radii of Li+, Na+, K+, H+, NH4+, and Zn2+, which show significant differences in the reaction kinetics of ionic storage. New topochemical paths for ion insertion/extraction, which provide superfast ionic storage, are also discussed.

         <title>Mechanochemistry Advances High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
A prerequisite for commercializing perovskite photovoltaics is to develop a swift and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis route, which guarantees the mass production of halide perovskites in the industry. Herein, a green&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted mechanochemical strategy is developed for fast synthesizing a stoichiometric &#948;&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (&#948;&#8208;FAPbI3) powder, which serves as a high&#8208;purity precursor for perovskite films deposition with low defects. The pre&#8208;synthesized &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 precursor possesses high concentration of micron&#8208;sized colloids, which are in favor of preferable crystallization by spontaneous nucleation. The resultant perovskite films own preferred crystal orientations of cubic (100) plane, which is beneficial for superior carrier transport compared to that of the films with isotropic crystal orientations using &#8220;mixture of PbI2 and FAI&#8221; as precursors. As a result, high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 24.2% are obtained. Moreover, the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powder shows superior storage stability for more than ten months in ambient environment (40&#160;&#177; 10% relative humidity), being conducive to a facile and practical storage for further commercialization.

         <title>Honeycomb&#8208;structure RuI3, a new quantum material related to &#945;&#8208;RuCl3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The layered honeycomb lattice material &#945;&#8208;RuCl3 has emerged as a prime candidate for displaying the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state and as such has attracted much research interest. Here we describe a new layered honeycomb lattice polymorph of RuI3, a material that is strongly chemically and structurally related to &#945;&#8208;RuCl3. The material is synthesized at moderately elevated pressures and is stable under ambient conditions. Preliminary characterization reveals that it is a metallic conductor, with the absence of long&#8208;range magnetic order down to 0.35 K and an unusually large T&#8208;linear contribution to the heat capacity. We propose that this phase, with a layered honeycomb lattice and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, provides a new route for the characterization of quantum materials.

         <title>Small&#8208;Dipole&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Containing Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three kinds of small&#8208;dipole&#8208;molecule&#8208;containing electrolytes are developed for aqueous batteries. The developed electrolytes deliver an expanded electrochemical stability window (over 2.5&#160;V), and their solvation&#8208;sheath structure and ion conductivity mechanism are explored. A constructed Li4Ti5O12//LiMn2O4 battery in a glycerol&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibits high output voltage (2.45&#160;V) and a specific capacity of 119.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage aqueous rechargeable batteries are promising competitors for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems with safety and high specific energy, but they are limited by the absence of low&#8208;cost aqueous electrolytes with a wide electrochemical stability window (ESW). The decomposition of aqueous electrolytes is mainly facilitated by the hydrogen bond network between water molecules and the water molecules in the solvation sheath. Here, three types of small dipole molecules (small molecules containing a dipole; glycerol (Gly), erythritol (Et), and acrylamide (AM)) are reported to develop aqueous electrolytes with high safety and wide ESW (over 2.5&#160;V) for aqueous lithium&#8208;, sodium&#8208;, and zinc&#8208;ion batteries, respectively. The solvation&#8208;sheath structures are explored by ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, demonstrating that three types of dipole molecules deplete the water molecules in the solvation sheath of the charge carrier and break the hydrogen bond network between the water molecules, thus effectively expanding the ESW. A battery constructed from lithium titanate and lithium manganate in Gly&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibits an output voltage of 2.45&#160;V and retains a specific capacity of 119.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles. This work provides another strategy for exploiting low&#8208;cost high&#8208;voltage electrolytes for aqueous energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Biodegradable Polymer with Effective Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Absorption as a Photothermal Agent for Deep Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable photothermal agent is developed by inserting cleavable disulfide moieties into a conjugative polymer, which affords biodegradability and excellent adsorption in both the near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II windows, effectively inhibits tumor progression, and extends survival spans in a deep&#8208;seated ovarian cancer mouse model.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy holds great promise for cancer treatment due to its effective tumor ablation and minimal invasiveness. Herein a new class of biodegradable photothermal agents with effective adsorption in both near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) and NIR&#8208;II windows is reported for deep tumor therapy. As demonstrated in a deep&#8208;seated ovarian cancer model, photothermal therapy using 1064&#160;nm irradiation effectively inhibits tumor progression and prolongs survival spans. This work provides a new design of photothermal agents toward a more effective therapy of tumors.

         <title>Heterointerface Engineering in Electromagnetic Absorbers: New Insights and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New and in&#8208;depth insights into the electromagnetic response mechanism of heterointerface engineering are provided, including band alignment, spatial charge, electron transport, lattice defects, lattice strain, and pinning effects. The relevant characterization techniques and reinforcement strategies are systematically demonstrated. Smart electromagnetic absorbers based on interfacial effects are highlighted.








Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) absorbers play an increasingly essential role in the electronic information age, even toward the coming &#8220;intelligent era&#8221;. The remarkable merits of heterointerface engineering and its peculiar EM characteristics inject a fresh and infinite vitality for designing high&#8208;efficiency and stimuli&#8208;responsive EM absorbers. However, there still exist huge challenges in understanding and reinforcing these interface effects from the micro and macro perspectives. Herein, EM response mechanisms of interfacial effects are dissected in depth, and with a focus on advanced characterization as well as theoretical techniques. Then, the representative optimization strategies are systematically discussed with emphasis on component selection and structural design. More importantly, the most cutting&#8208;edge smart EM functional devices based on heterointerface engineering are reported. Finally, current challenges and concrete suggestions are proposed, and future perspectives on this promising field are also predicted.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Reactive Oxygen Species Amplifier for Enzymatic Cascade Cancer Starvation/Chemodynamic /Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP)&#8208;based smart UCNPs@Cu&#8211;Cys&#8211;GOx (UCCG) nanosystem is designed, which combines natural enzymes and nanozymes so as to in situ amplify reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via an open source and reduce expenditure strategy. Furthermore, the chemodynamic therapy (CDT) process can be monitored in real time by the luminescence intensity of the UCNPs core.








Abstract
At present, some progress has been made in the field of cancer theranostics based on nanocatalysts (NCs), but achieving precise theranostics in response to the specific tumor microenvironment (TME) remains a major challenge. Herein, a TME&#8208;responsive upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;based smart UCNPs@Cu&#8211;Cys&#8211;GOx (UCCG) nanosystem is engineered, which combines natural enzymes and nanozymes so as to amplify reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in situ for cancer starvation/chemodynamic/immunotherapy. One of the biggest merits of this material is that it can be preserved inert (off) in normal tissues, and only in the TME can it be specifically activated (on) through a series of enzymatic cascades to boost ROS production via a strategy of open source (H2O2 self&#8208;supplying ability) and reduce expenditure (glutathione (GSH) consuming ability). More importantly, the enhanced oxidative stress by UCCG NCs reverses the immunosuppressive TME, and facilitates antitumor immune responses. Meanwhile, the starvation/chemodynamic synergistic therapy triggered by UCCG combined with PD&#8208;L1 antibody effectively inhibits the growth of primary tumors and cancer metastasis. In addition, the UCNPs in UCCG present upconversion luminescence enhancement, which can be exploited to visualize the reinforced ROS generation in real time. Collectively, this work provides an original method for the devising and exploitation of UCNPs&#8208;based catalytic immunotherapy.

         <title>Electrically Tunable and Dramatically Enhanced Valley&#8208;Polarized Emission of Monolayer WS2 at Room Temperature with Plasmonic Archimedes Spiral Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient tailoring of valley&#8208;polarized photoluminescence from monolayer WS2 at room temperature (RT) through surface plasmon&#8211;exciton interactions with plasmonic Archimedes spiral (PAS) nanostructures is achieved in this manuscript. The degree of valley polarization of WS2&#8211;PAS heterostructures at RT can be further enhanced from 40% to 70% by modulating the carrier doping via a backgate field effect transistor (FET) device.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have intrinsic valley degrees of freedom, making them appealing for exploiting valleytronic applications in information storage and processing. WS2 monolayer possesses two inequivalent valleys in the Brillouin zone, each valley coupling selectively with a circular polarization of light. The degree of valley polarization (DVP) under the excitation of circularly polarized light (CPL) is a parameter that determines the purity of valley polarized photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer WS2. Here efficient tailoring of valley&#8208;polarized PL from monolayer WS2 at room temperature (RT) through surface plasmon&#8211;exciton interactions with plasmonic Archimedes spiral (PAS) nanostructures is reported. The DVP of WS2 at RT can be enhanced from &lt;5% to 40% and 50% by using 2 turns (2T) and 4 turns (4T) of PAS, respectively. Further enhancement and control of excitonic valley polarization is demonstrated by electrostatically doping monolayer WS2. For CPL on WS2&#8211;2TPAS heterostructures, the 40% valley polarization is enhanced to 70% by modulating the carrier doping via a backgate, which may be attributed to the screening of momentum&#8208;dependent long&#8208;range electron&#8211;hole exchange interactions. The manifestation of electrically tunable valley&#8208;polarized emission from WS2&#8211;PAS heterostructures presents a new strategy toward harnessing valley excitons for application in ultrathin valleytronic devices.

The degree of valley polarization (DVP) under the excitation of circularly polarized light (CPL) is a parameter that determines the purity of valley polarized photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Here efficient tailoring of valley-polarized PL from monolayer WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature (RT) through surface plasmon&#8211;exciton interactions with plasmonic Archimedes spiral (PAS) nanostructures is reported. The DVP of WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at RT can be enhanced from &amp;lt;5% to 40% and 50% by using 2 turns (2T) and 4 turns (4T) of PAS, respectively. Further enhancement and control of excitonic valley polarization is demonstrated by electrostatically doping monolayer WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For CPL on WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;2TPAS heterostructures, the 40% valley polarization is enhanced to 70% by modulating the carrier doping via a backgate, which may be attributed to the screening of momentum-dependent long-range electron&#8211;hole exchange interactions. The manifestation of electrically tunable valley-polarized emission from WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;PAS heterostructures presents a new strategy toward harnessing valley excitons for application in ultrathin valleytronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Chemistry Engineering of Perovskite Quantum Dots: Strategies, Applications, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface chemistry of metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) plays a key role in determining their structural stability and electronic properties. A critical overview focusing on the surface ligand engineering of PQDs, including advanced synthesis, in situ passivation, and ligand exchange, toward efficient and stable optoelectronic applications is presented.








Abstract
The presence of surface ligands not only plays a key role in keeping the colloidal integrity and non&#8208;defective surface of metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), but also serves as a knob to tune their optoelectronic properties for a variety of exciting applications including solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, these indispensable surface ligands may also deteriorate the stability and key properties of PQDs due to their highly dynamic binding and insulating nature. To address these issues, a number of innovative surface chemistry engineering approaches have been developed in the past few years. Based on an in&#8208;depth fundamental understanding of the surface atomistic structure and surface defect formation mechanism in the tiny nanoparticles, a critical overview focusing on the surface chemistry engineering of PQDs including advanced colloidal synthesis, in&#8208;situ surface passivation, and solution&#8208;phase/solid&#8208;state ligand exchange is presented, after which their unprecedented achievements in photovoltaics and other optoelectronics are presented. The practical hurdles and future directions are critically discussed to inspire more rational design of PQD surface chemistry toward practical applications.

         <title>High Lift Micro&#8208;Aerial&#8208;Robot Powered by Low Voltage and Long Endurance Dielectric Elastomer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are a special class of artificial muscles that have been used to construct animal&#8208;like soft robotic systems. However, compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rigid actuators such as piezoelectric bimorphs and electromagnetic motors, most DEAs require higher driving voltages, and their power density and lifetime remain substantially lower. These limitations pose significant challenges for developing agile and power autonomous soft robots. Here, a low voltage, high endurance, and power&#8208;dense DEA based on novel multiple&#8208;layering techniques and electrode material optimization, is reported. When operated at 400&#160;Hz, the 143&#160;mg DEA generates forces of 0.36 N and displacements of 1.15&#160;mm. This DEA is incorporated into an aerial robot to demonstrate high performance. The robot achieves a high lift&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio of 3.7, low hovering voltage of 500&#160;V, and a long lifetime that exceeds 2 million actuation cycles. With 20 seconds of hovering time, and position and attitude error smaller than 2.5&#160;cm and 2&#176;, the robot demonstrates the longest and best performing flight among existing sub&#8208;gram aerial robots. This important milestone demonstrates that soft robots can outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rigid counterparts, and it provides an important step towards realizing power autonomy in soft robotic flights.

         <title>A ROS&#8208;Sensitive Nanozyme&#8208;Augmented Photoacoustic Nanoprobe for Early Diagnosis and Therapy of Acute Liver Failure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Early diagnosis of acute liver failure (ALF) is critical for a curable treatment of the patients, because most existing ALF therapies have narrow therapeutic time windows after disease onset. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which lead to the sequential occurrences of hepatocyte necrosis and the leakage of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), represent early biomarkers of ALF. Photoacoustic imaging is emerging as a powerful tool for in vivo imaging of ROS. However, high&#8208;performance imaging probes that can boost the photoacoustic signals of short&#8208;lived ROS of ALF are yet to be developed, and there remains a great challenge for ROS&#8208;based imaging of ALF. Herein, we present a ROS&#8208;sensitive nanozyme&#8208;augmented photoacoustic nanoprobe for successful in vivo imaging of ALF. The deep&#8208;penetrated photoacoustic signals of nanoprobe can be activated by the overexpressed ROS in ALF due to the synergy between nanocatalytic bubbles generation and thermoelastic expansion. Impressively, the nanozyme&#8208;augmented ROS imaging enables earlier diagnosis of ALF than clinical ALT method, and the ROS&#8208;activated catalytic activity of nanoprobe permits timely nanocatalytic therapy of ALF.

         <title>Capillary Confinement Crystallization for Monolayer Molecular Crystal Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic single crystalline semiconductors are highly desired for fabrication of integrated electronic circuits, yet the uniform growth and efficient patterning of them is a huge challenge. Here, a general solution procedure named soft&#8208;template&#8208;assisted&#8208;assembly method (STAA method) is developed to prepare centimeter&#8208;scale monolayer molecular crystal (MMC) arrays with precise regulation over their size and location via capillary confinement crystallization process. It is remarkable that the field&#8208;effect mobility of the array is highly uniform, with variation less than 4.4%, which demonstrates the most uniform organic single crystal arrays ever reported so far. Simulations based on fluid dynamics were carried out to understand the function mechanism of this method. Thanks to the ultrasmooth crystalline orientation surface of MMCs, high&#8208;quality p&#8208;n heterojunction arrays can be prepared by weak epitaxy growth of n&#8208;type material atop the MMC. The p&#8208;n heterojunction FETs show ambipolar characteristics and the corresponding inverters constructed by these heterojunctions exhibit a competitive gain of 155. This work provides a general strategy to realize the preparation and application of logic complementary circuits based on patterned organic single crystals.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Probe: Intraoperative Pathological Fluorescent Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer via Specific Cathepsin E</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic AIE&#8208;active probe is developed by integrating a biological penetration unit, a cell penetrating peptide, which realizes efficient cell&#8208;penetration ability, with in situ generation of high&#8208;fidelity AIE signals for long&#8208;term tracking of the endogenous overexpressed Cathepsin E enzyme in human PC cells, achieving the intraoperative pathological diagnosis of pancreatic cancer section, and succeeding in tracking xenograft&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing nude BALB/C mice.








Abstract
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most devastating malignant tumors. However, fluorescence probes for early clinical diagnosis of PC often encounter difficulties in accuracy and penetrability. In this work, an enzyme&#8208;activated aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) probe, QM&#8211;HSP&#8211;CPP, for high&#8208;contrast fluorescence diagnosis of PC is developed by monitoring specific overexpressed enzyme Cathepsin E (CTSE). The probe is composed of an AIE fluorophore QM&#8211;COOH (QM = quinoline&#8211;malononitrile), CTSE&#8208;triggered hydrophobic peptide (HSP), and hydrophilic biocompatible cell penetrating peptide (CPP). The CPP unit can well&#8208;modulate the molecular dispersion properties, giving initial fluorescence&#8208;off state in the aqueous biosystem, thus endowing high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and finally overcoming the poor targeting selectivity of traditional AIE probes. CPP can ensure cell/tissue penetrating ability, thus allowing on&#8208;site monitoring of endogenous CTSE in PC cells, tissues, and living animal models. When the QM&#8211;HSP&#8211;CPP probe is specifically cleaved by CTSE, it can generate AIE signals in situ with high&#8208;specificity and long&#8208;term tracking ability, and successfully achieve intraoperative diagnosis of human PC sections, tracking PC in heterotopic nude mice models. The CTSE&#8208;enzyme&#8208;triggered AIEgens&#8217; liberation strategy improves accuracy and addresses the penetration problem simultaneously, which can expand the database of multitudinous biocompatible AIE&#8208;active probes, especially for establishing intraoperative pathological fluorescent diagnosis.

         <title>Rational Design of Dot&#8208;on&#8208;Rod Nano&#8208;Heterostructure for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Pivotal Role of Hole Transfer and Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dot&#8208;on&#8208;rod (DOR) nano&#8208;heterostructure is rationally constructed by anchoring multiple ZnSe QDs on a single CdS nanorod. Due to the favored energy level alignment and the good exposure of ZnSe to the surrounding medium, ultrafast (&#8776;2&#160;ps) charge separation and facile hole utilization are realized, which enable effective and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction taking H2O as an electron donor.








Abstract
Inspired by green plants, artificial photosynthesis has become one of the most attractive approaches toward carbon dioxide (CO2) valorization. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) or dot&#8208;in&#8208;rod (DIR) nano&#8208;heterostructures have gained substantial research interest in multielectron photoredox reactions. However, fast electron&#8211;hole recombination or sluggish hole transfer and utilization remains unsatisfactory for their potential applications. Here, the first application of a well&#8208;designed ZnSe/CdS dot&#8208;on&#8208;rods (DORs) nano&#8208;heterostructure for efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction with H2O as an electron donor is presented. In&#8208;depth spectroscopic studies reveal that surface&#8208;anchored ZnSe QDs not only assist ultrafast (&#8776;2&#160;ps) electron and hole separation, but also promote interfacial hole transfer participating in oxidative half&#8208;reactions. Surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy provides a direct image of spatially separated electrons in CdS and holes in ZnSe. Therefore, ZnSe/CdS DORs photocatalyze CO2 to CO with a rate of &#8776;11.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and &#8805;85% selectivity, much higher than that of ZnSe/CdS DIRs or pristine CdS nanorods under identical conditions. Obviously, favored energy&#8208;level alignment and unique morphology balance the utilization of electrons and holes in this nano&#8208;heterostructure, thus enhancing the performance of artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.

         <title>Mechanistically Scoping Cell&#8208;free and Cell&#8208;dependent Artificial Scaffolds in Rebuilding Skeletal and Dental Hard Tissues</title>

Abstract
Rebuilding mineralized tissues in skeletal and dental systems remains costly and challenging. Despite of numerous demands and heave clinical burden over the world, sources of autografts, allografts, and xenografts are far limited, along with massive risks including viral infections, ethic crisis, and so on. Per such dilemma artificial scaffolds have emerged to provide efficient alternatives. Up to date, cell&#8208;free biomimetic mineralization (BM) and cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds both demonstrated promising capabilities of regenerating mineralized tissues. However, BM and cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds own distinctive mechanisms for mineral genesis, which makes them methodically, synthetically, and functional disparate. In this review, we systematically summarized these two strategies in regenerative dentistry and orthopedics at the level of mechanisms. For BM, we focused on methodological and theoretical advances; and meanwhile for cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds we demonstrated how scaffolds orchestrated osteogenic cell fate. Our summaries of experimental advances and clinical progresses will endow researchers with mechanistic understandings of artificial scaffolds in rebuilding hard tissues, by which better clinical choices and research directions may be approached.

         <title>Structural Insights into Multi&#8208;Metal Spinel Oxide Nanoparticles for Boosting Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multi&#8208;metal oxide (MMO) materials have significant potential to facilitate various demanding reactions by providing additional degrees of freedom in catalyst design. However, fundamental understanding of the (electro)catalytic activity of MMOs is limited because of the intrinsic complexity of multi&#8208;element nature. Additional complexities arise when MMO catalysts have crystalline structures with two different metal site occupancies, such as spinel structure. Differences in quantum electronic structure and metal&#8211;oxygen bonds and the resulting differences in the tetrahedral and octahedral environments make it more challenging to investigate the origin of the (electro)catalytic activity of MMOs. Here, we synthesize uniform&#8208;sized multi&#8208;metal spinel oxide nanoparticles composed of Mn, Co, and Fe as model MMO electrocatalysts and systematically study the contributions of each element to the structural flexibility of the spinel oxides, which boosts the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Detailed crystal and electronic structure characterizations combined with electrochemical and computational studies reveal that the incorporation of Co not only increases the preferential octahedral site occupancy, but also modifies the electronic state of the ORR&#8208;active Mn site to enhance the intrinsic ORR activity. As a result, nanoparticles of the optimized catalyst, Co0.25Mn0.75Fe2.0&#8208;MMO, exhibit a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.904&#160;V (versus RHE) and mass activity of 46.9 A goxide&#8722;1 (at 0.9&#160;V versus RHE) with promising stability.

         <title>Advanced Flame&#8208;Retardant Methods for Polymeric Materials</title>

Abstract
Most organic polymeric materials have high flammability, for which the large amounts of smoke, toxic gases, heat, and melt drips produced during their burning are causing immeasurable damages to human life and property every year. Despite some desirable results have been achieved by conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods, their application is encountering more and more difficulties with the ever&#8208;increasing high flame&#8208;retardant requirements such as high flame&#8208;retardant efficiency, great persistence, low release of heat, smoke and toxic gases, and more importantly not deteriorating or even enhancing the overall properties of polymers. Under such condition, some advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods have been developed in the past years based on &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; intumescence, nanotechnology, in situ reinforcement, intrinsic char formation, plasma treatment, biomimetic coatings, etc., which provided potential solution to the dilemma of conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods. This review briefly outlines the development, application, and problems of conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods, including bulk&#8208;additive, bulk&#8208;copolymerization, and surface treatment, and focuses on the raise, development, and potential application of advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods. The future development of flame&#8208;retardant methods is further discussed.

         <title>Hysteresis&#8208;Free Nanoparticle&#8208;Reinforced Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The elastic storage and release of mechanical energy has been key to many developments throughout the history of mankind. Resilience, absent hysteresis, has been an elusive goal to achieve, particularly at large deformations. Using a low&#8208;crosslink density polyacrylamide hydrogel at 96% water content having hyper&#8208;branched silica nanoparticles (HBSPs) as the major junction points, we have realized a hysteresis&#8208;free material. The fatigue&#8208;free characteristic of these composite hydrogels is evidenced by the invariance of the stress&#8208;strain curves at strain ratios of 4, even after 5,000 cycles. At a strain ratio of 7, only a 1.3% hysteresis is observed. A markedly increased strain ratio&#8208;at&#8208;break of 11.5 is observed. The unique attributes of these resilient hydrogels are manifested in the high&#8208;fidelity detection of dynamic deformations under cyclic loading over a broad range of frequencies, difficult to achieve with other materials.

Abstract
Aiming to overcome both the structural and commercial limitations of flexible thermoelectric power generators (F&#8208;TEGs), we designed an efficient room&#8208;temperature aqueous selenization reaction that could be completed in air within less than 1&#160;min, to directly fabricate thin &#946;&#8208;Ag2Se films consisting of perfectly crystalline and large columnar grains with both in&#8208;plane randomness and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane [201] preferred orientation. A high power factor (PF) of 2590&#160;&#177; 414 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 and a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (zT) of 1.2&#160;&#177; 0.42 were obtained from the sample with a thickness of &#8764;1&#160;&#956;m. The maximum output power density (MOPD) of the best 4&#8208;leg TEG sample reached up to 27.6&#160;&#177; 1.95 and 124&#160;&#177; 8.78 W&#183;m&#8722;2 at room temperature with 30 K and 60 K temperature differences, respectively, which may be used in future flexible TE devices.

         <title>Mass&#8208;manufactured beam&#8208;steering metasurfaces for high&#8208;speed full&#8208;duplex optical wireless broadcasting communications</title>

Abstract
Beam&#8208;steering devices, which are at the heart of optical wireless broadcasting communication links, play an important role in data allocation and exchange. An ideal beam&#8208;steering device features large steering angles, arbitrary channel numbers, reconfigurability, and ultra&#8208;compactness. However, these criteria have been achieved only partially with conventional beam&#8208;steering devices based on waveguides, micro&#8208;electrical mechanical systems, spatial light modulators, and gratings, which would substantially limit the application of optical wireless broadcasting communication techniques. In this study, we designed and experimentally demonstrated an ultra&#8208;compact full&#8208;duplex meta&#8208;broadcasting communication system, which exhibits beam steering angles up to &#177;40&#176;, 14 broadcasting channels with capacity for downstream and upstream links up to 100 and 10&#160;Gbps for each user channel, three operating modes for flexible signal switching, and meta&#8208;device dimensions as small as 2&#160;mm &#215; 2&#160;mm. In particular, the beam&#8208;steering meta&#8208;devices are mass&#8208;manufactured by a complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor processing platform, which shows their potential for large&#8208;scale commercial applications. The demonstrated meta&#8208;broadcasting communication system merges optical wireless broadcasting communications and metasurfaces, which reduces the complexity of beam&#8208;steering devices while significantly increasing their performance, opening up a new avenue for high&#8208;quality optical wireless broadcasting communications.

         <title>Deciphering Nanoparticle Trafficking into Glioblastomas Uncovers an Augmented Antitumor Effect of Metronomic Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The underlying fate of surface&#8208;modified lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles is directly observed in an intracranial glioblastoma xenograft model. An augmented antitumor effect is further validated directly on glioma cells from the metronomic chemotherapy administration using nanoparticles.








Abstract
Nanoparticles have been explored in glioblastomas as they can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier and target glioblastoma selectively. However, direct observation of nanoparticle trafficking into glioblastoma cells and their underlying intracellular fate after systemic administration remains uncharacterized. Here, based on high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy experiments of an intracranial glioblastoma model, it is shown that ligand&#8208;modified nanoparticles can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier, endocytose into the lysosomes of glioblastoma cells, and undergo endolysosomal escape upon photochemical ionization. Moreover, an optimal dose of metronomic chemotherapy using dual&#8208;drug&#8208;loaded nanocarriers can induce an augmented antitumor effect directly on tumors, which has not been recognized in previous studies. Metronomic chemotherapy enhances antitumor effects 3.5&#8208;fold compared with the standard chemotherapy regimen using the same accumulative dose in vivo. This study provides a conceptual framework that can be used to develop metronomic nanoparticle regimens as a safe and viable therapeutic strategy for treating glioblastomas and other advanced&#8208;stage solid tumors.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired Design of Photomechanically Modulated Display Systems for On&#8208;Demand Fluorescent Patterning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the bioelectromechanical display mechanism of cephalopods, a conceptually new photomechanically modulated fluorescent system is developed. Its key component is an NIR&#8208;light&#8208;responsive fluorescent actuator with desirable time&#8208; and NIR light power dependent actuating behaviors. When paired with customizable display panels, on&#8208;demand display of diverse fluorescent patterns/information can be realized by facilely controlling the single remote NIR signal.








Abstract
Cephalopods can display variable body color/patterns upon environmental stimulation via bioelectricity&#8208;controlled muscle contraction/expansion of skin chromatophores. However, it remains challenging to produce artificial display analogs that exhibit reversible and rapid switching between multiple expected luminescent patterns, although such systems are very appealing for many practical uses (e.g., data encryption). Inspired by the bioelectromechanical display tactic of cephalopods, in this work, a conceptually new photomechanically modulated fluorescent system that enables on&#8208;demand display of fluorescent patterns via a cascading stimulation&#8722;mechanical movement&#8722;optical output conduction mechanism is presented. Specifically, this biomimetic system comprises a customizable hollow display panel and a bottom&#8208;tethered photothermally responsive fluorescent actuator. Under NIR light, the photomechanically bending movements of the fluorescent actuator will immediately cover the hollow window of the display panel and synchronously manifest as the display of fluorescent patterns. Owing to its desirable time&#8208; and light&#8208;power&#8208;dependent actuating behaviors, diverse fluorescent patterns/information can be dynamically and reversibly displayed by facilely controlling this single remote NIR signal. This bioinspired strategy is universal and promising for fabricating on&#8208;demand fluorescent display platforms that combine a wide choice of fluorophores, remote control with high spatial/temporal precision, and especially single&#8208;input multiple&#8208;output features.

         <title>Oligoethylene Glycol Side Chains Increase Charge Generation in Organic Semiconductor Nanoparticles for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in nanoparticle photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency. Glycolation facilitates charge generation and suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in donor/acceptor nanoparticles. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation and H2 evolution.








Abstract
Organic semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) composed of an electron donor/acceptor (D/A) semiconductor blend have recently emerged as an efficient class of hydrogen&#8208;evolution photocatalysts. It is demonstrated that using conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in NP photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency compared to their nonglycolated analogues. The strategy is broadly applicable to a range of structurally diverse conjugated polymers. Transient spectroscopic studies show that glycolation facilitates charge generation even in the absence of a D/A heterojunction, and further suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in D/A NPs. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation, which is correlated with greatly enhanced H2&#8208;evolution rates in the glycolated NPs. Glycolation increases the relative permittivity of the semiconductors and facilitates water uptake. Together, these effects may increase the high&#8208;frequency relative permittivity inside the NPs sufficiently, to cause the observed suppression of exciton and charge recombination responsible for the high photocatalytic activities of the glycolated NPs.

         <title>Reliable and Remote Monitoring of Absolute Temperature During Liver Inflammation via Luminescence Lifetime&#8208;Based Nanothermometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Temperature of tissues and organs is one of the first parameters affected by physiological and pathological processes, such as metabolic activity, acute trauma, or infection&#8208;induced inflammation. Therefore, the onset and development of these processes could be detected by monitoring deviations from basal temperature. To accomplish this, minimally invasive, reliable, and accurate measurement of the absolute temperature of internal organs is required. Luminescence nanothermometry is the ideal technology for meeting these requirements. Although this technique has lately undergone remarkable developments, its reliability is being questioned due to spectral distortions caused by biological tissues. In this work, we demonstrate how the use of bright Ag2S nanoparticles featuring temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence lifetime enables reliable and accurate measurement of the absolute temperature of the liver in mice subjected to lipopolysaccharide induced inflammation. Beyond the remarkable thermal sensitivity (&#8776; 3% &#176;C&#8211;1 around 37 &#176;C) and thermal resolution obtained (smaller than 0.3&#176;C), the results included in this work set a blueprint for the development of new diagnostic procedures based on the use of intra&#8208;corporeal temperature as a physiological indicator.

         <title>Orbital gating driven by giant Stark effect in tunneling phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Conventional gating in transistors uses electric fields through external dielectrics that require complex fabrication processes. Various optoelectronic devices deploy photogating by electric fields from trapped charges in neighbor nanoparticles or dielectrics under light illumination. We demonstrate orbital gating driven by giant Stark effect in tunneling phototransistors based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 without using external gating bias or slow charge trapping dynamics in photogating. The original self&#8208;gating by light illumination modulates the interlayer potential gradient by switching on and off the giant Stark effect where the dz2&#8208;orbitals of molybdenum atoms play the dominant role. The orbital gating shifts the electronic bands of the top atomic layer of the MoTe2 by up to 100 meV, which is equivalent to modulation of a carrier density of 7.3&#215;1011 cm&#8211;2 by electrical gating. Suppressing conventional photoconductivity, the orbital gating in tunneling phototransistors achieves low dark current, practical photo&#8208;responsivity (3357 AW&#8211;1), and fast switching time (0.5&#160;ms) simultaneously.

         <title>Assessing the Photovoltaic Quality of Vacuum&#8208;Thermal Evaporated Organic Semiconductor Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Vacuum&#8208;thermal evaporation (VTE) is a highly relevant fabrication route for organic solar cells (OSCs), especially on an industrial scale as proven by the commercialisation of organic light emitting diode (OLED) based displays. While OSC performance is reported for a range of VTE&#8208;deposited molecules, a comprehensive assessment of donor:acceptor blend properties with respect to their photovoltaic performance is scarce. Here, we fabricate organic thin films and solar cells of three select systems and measure ellipsometry, external quantum efficiency with high dynamic range, as well as OTRACE to quantify absorption, voltage losses, and charge carrier mobility. These parameters are key to explain OSC performance and will help to rationalize the performance of other material systems reported in literature as our methodology is applicable beyond VTE systems. Furthermore, it could help to judge the prospects of new molecules in general. We find large differences in the measured values and find that today's VTE OSCs can reach high extinction coefficients, but only moderate mobility and voltage loss compared to their solution&#8208;processed counterparts. We outline what needs to improve for VTE organic solar cells to again catch up with their solution&#8208;processed counterparts in terms of power conversion efficiency.

         <title>Multivalent non&#8208;covalent interfacing and cross&#8208;linking of supramolecular tubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Natural supramolecular filaments have the ability to crosslink with each other and to interface with the cellular membrane via biomolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions. This behavior allows them to form complex networks within as well as outside the cell, i.e., the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, respectively. The potential of artificial supramolecular polymers to interact through specific non&#8208;covalent interactions has so far only seen limited exploration due to the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions. Here, we demonstrate a system of synthetic supramolecular tubes that crosslink forming supramolecular networks, and at the same time bind to biomimetic surfaces by the aid of non&#8208;covalent streptavidin&#8208;biotin linkages. The architecture of the networks can be engineered by controlling the density of the biotin moiety at the exterior of the tubes as well as by the concentration of the streptavidin. The presented strategy provides a pathway for designing adjustable artificial supramolecular superstructures, which can potentially yield more complex biomimetic adaptive materials.

A combined structure with Cu+ and high&#8208;facets is developed via insufficient graphene growth and a postoxidation process. The synthesized catalysts show high ethanol selectivity from the electrochemical CO2 reduction. The enhanced CO binding strength due to the introduction of Cu+ induces stable CO adsorption while maintaining high&#8208;facet properties, resulting in a favorable CO&#8211;CO coupling reaction for C2 formation.








Abstract
Although the electroconversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into ethanol is considered to be one of the most promising ways of using CO2, the ethanol selectivity is less than 50% because of difficulties in designing an optimal catalyst that arise from the complicated pathways for the electroreduction of CO2 to ethanol. Several approaches including the fabrication of oxide&#8208;derived structures, atomic surface control, and the Cu+/Cu interfaces have been primarily used to produce ethanol from CO2. Here, a combined structure with Cu+ and high&#8208;facets as electrocatalysts is constructed by creating high&#8208;facets of wrinkled Cu surrounded by Cu2O mesh patterns. Using chemical vapor deposition graphene growth procedures, the insufficiently grown graphene is used as an oxidation&#8208;masking material, and the high&#8208;facet wrinkled Cu is simultaneously generated during the graphene growth synthesis. The resulting electrocatalyst shows an ethanol selectivity of 43% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is one of the highest ethanol selectivity values reported thus far. This is attributed to the role of Cu+ in enhancing CO binding strength, and the high&#8208;facets, which favor C&#8211;C coupling and the ethanol pathway. This method for generating the combined structure can be widely applicable not only for electrochemical catalysts but also in various fields.

         <title>Anomalous Superconducting Proximity Effect in Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 Thin&#8208;Film Heterojunctions</title>

Abstract
Superconducting proximity effect (SPE) induces superconductivity transition in the otherwise non superconducting thin&#8208;film in proximity with a superconductor. The SPE usually occurs in real space and decays exponentially with the film thickness. Herein, we unveiled an abnormal SPE in a topological insulator (TI)/superconductor heterostructure, which is attributed to the topologically protected surface state. Surprisingly, such abnormal SPE occurs in momentum space regardless the TI film thickness, as long as the topological surface states are robust and form a continuous conduction loop. Combining transport measurements and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy techniques, we explored the SPE in Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 heterostructures, where Bi2Se3 is an ideal three&#8208;dimensional topological insulator and FeSe0.5Te0.5 a typical iron&#8208;based superconductor. As the thickness of the Bi2Se3 thin&#8208;film exceeds 400 nanometers, there still exits SPE&#8208;induced superconductivity on the surface of Bi2Se3 thin&#8208;film with a transition temperature Tc not less than 10 K. Such an extraordinary behavior is induced by the unique properties of topologically protected surface states of Bi2Se3. This research will deepen the understanding of important role of topologically protected surface states in the SPE.

         <title>Resolving Atomic&#8208;Scale Interactions in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor Organic Solar Cells with Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy, Crystallographic Modelling, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

Abstract
Fused&#8208;ring core non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), designated &#8220;Y&#8208;series&#8221;, have enabled high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) achieving over 18% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Since the introduction of these NFAs, much effort has been expended to understand the reasons for their exceptional performance. While several studies have identified key optoelectronic properties that govern high PCEs, little is known about the molecular level origins of large variations in performance, spanning from 5 to 18% PCE, e.g., in the case of PM6:Y6 OSCs. Here, we introduce a combined solid&#8208;state NMR, crystallography, and molecular modelling approach to elucidate the atomic&#8208;scale interactions in Y6 crystals, thin films, and PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends. We show the Y6 morphologies in BHJ blends are not governed by the morphology in neat films or single crystals. Notably, PM6:Y6 blends processed from different solvents self&#8208;assemble into different structures and morphologies, whereby the relative orientations of the sidechains and end groups of the Y6 molecules to their fused&#8208;ring cores play a crucial role in determining the resulting morphology and overall performance of the solar cells. The molecular&#8208;level understanding of BHJs enabled by this approach will guide the engineering of next&#8208;generation NFAs for stable and efficient OSCs.

         <title>Spiderweb Nanomechanical Resonators via Bayesian Optimization: Inspired by Nature and Guided by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human creativity, analytical models, and trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experimentation have led to groundbreaking achievements in nanotechnology. In this work, machine learning is shown to offer a new path to discovery, complementing the traditional process. A spiderweb&#8208;inspired sensor is designed and fabricated by this strategy achieving world&#8208;class performance. The algorithm finds a novel vibration mechanism, enabling devices isolated from room&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
From ultrasensitive detectors of fundamental forces to quantum networks and sensors, mechanical resonators are enabling next&#8208;generation technologies to operate in room&#8208;temperature environments. Currently, silicon nitride nanoresonators stand as a leading microchip platform in these advances by allowing for mechanical resonators whose motion is remarkably isolated from ambient thermal noise. However, to date, human intuition has remained the driving force behind design processes. Here, inspired by nature and guided by machine learning, a spiderweb nanomechanical resonator is developed that exhibits vibration modes, which are isolated from ambient thermal environments via a novel &#8220;torsional soft&#8208;clamping&#8221; mechanism discovered by the data&#8208;driven optimization algorithm. This bioinspired resonator is then fabricated, experimentally confirming a new paradigm in mechanics with quality factors above 1 billion in room&#8208;temperature environments. In contrast to other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art resonators, this milestone is achieved with a compact design that does not require sub&#8208;micrometer lithographic features or complex phononic bandgaps, making it significantly easier and cheaper to manufacture at large scales. These results demonstrate the ability of machine learning to work in tandem with human intuition to augment creative possibilities and uncover new strategies in computing and nanotechnology.

         <title>Polymer Acceptors with Flexible Spacers Afford Efficient and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High efficiency and mechanical robustness are both crucial for the practical applications of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) in stretchable and wearable electronics. In this regard, we report a series of new polymer acceptors (PAs) by incorporating a flexible conjugation&#8208;break spacer (FCBS) to achieve highly efficient and mechanically robust all&#8208;PSCs. Incorporation of FCBS affords the effective modulation of the crystallinity and pre&#8208;aggregation of the PAs, and achieves the optimal blend morphology with polymer donor (PD), increasing both the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of all&#8208;PSCs. In particular, the all&#8208;PSC based on PYTS&#8208;0.3 as a PA incorporated with 30% FCBS and a PD (PBDB&#8208;T) demonstrates a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.68% and excellent mechanical stretchability with a crack onset strain (COS) of 21.64% and toughness of 3.86&#160;MJ m&#8211;3, which is significantly superior to those of devices with the PA without the FCBS (PYTS&#8208;0.0, PCE = 13.01% and toughness = 2.70&#160;MJ m&#8211;3). To date, this COS is the highest value reported for PSCs with PCEs of over 8% without any insulating additives. These results reveal that the introduction of FCBS into the conjugated backbone is a highly feasible strategy to simultaneously improve the PCE and stretchability of PSCs.

         <title>Rational Design of Covalent Heptazine Frameworks with Spatially Separated Redox Centers for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>

Abstract
The redox reaction centers in natural organisms conducting oxygenic photosynthesis are well arranged in a physically separated manner to convert sunlight into chemical energy efficiently. Mimicking natural photosynthesis via precisely constructing oxidative and reductive reaction centers within photocatalysts is ideal for enhancing catalytic performances in artificial photosynthesis. In this study, new covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) with spatially separated redox centers are rationally designed for photocatalytic production of H2O2 from water and oxygen without using any sacrificial agents. Both experimental and computational investigations indicate that the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction occurs on the heptazine moiety, whereas the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction occurs on the acetylene or diacetylene bond in the CHFs. This unique spatial separation feature is critical for enhancing charge separation and achieving efficient H2O2 production. Meanwhile, the measured exciton binding energy of the diacetylene&#8208;containing polymer is merely 24 meV. Under simulated solar irradiation, the rationally designed CHFs can achieve a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.78%, surpassing previously reported photocatalytic materials. This study establishes a molecular engineering approach to construct periodically arranged and spatially separated redox centers in single&#8208;component polymer photocatalysts, representing a hallmark to create more exciting polymer structures for photocatalysis moving forward.

         <title>Sequential activation of molecular and macroscopic spin&#8208;state switching within the hysteretic region following pulsed light excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) compounds constitute a promising class of photoactive materials exhibiting efficient photo&#8208;induced phase transitions (PIPTs), driven by cooperative elastic interactions between the switchable molecules. Taking advantage of the unique, picture&#8208;perfect reproducibility of the spin&#8208;transition properties in the compound [Fe(HB(1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)3)2], we have dissected the spatiotemporal dynamics of the PIPT within the thermodynamic metastability (hysteretic) region of a single crystal, using pump&#8208;probe optical microscopy. Beyond a threshold laser excitation density, complete PIPTs were evidenced, with conversion rates up to 200 switched molecules per absorbed photon. We show that the PIPT takes place through the sequential activation of two (molecular and macroscopic) switching mechanisms, occurring on sub&#8208;&#956;s and ms timescales, governed by the intramolecular and free energy barriers of the system, respectively. The main finding here is that the thermodynamic metastability has strictly no influence on the sub&#8208;ms switching dynamics. Indeed, before this ms timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser excitation involves a gradual, molecular conversion process, as if there was no hysteresis loop. Consequently, in this regime, even a 100% photo&#8208;induced conversion may not give rise to a PIPT. These results provide new insight on the intrinsic dynamical limits of the PIPT in SCO solids (and other types of bistable materials), which is an important issue, from a technological perspective, for achieving fast and efficient photo&#8208;control of the functionalities of condensed matter.

         <title>Stabilization of Exposed Metal Nanocrystals in High&#8208;temperature Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidal metal nanocrystals with uniform sizes, shapes, compositions and architectures are ideal building blocks for constructing heterogeneous catalysts with well&#8208;defined characteristics towards the investigation of accurate structure&#8208;property relationships and better understanding of catalytic mechanism. However, their applications in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis are often restricted by the difficulty in maintaining the high metal dispersity and easy accessibility to active sites under harsh operating conditions. Here, we propose a partial&#8208;oxide&#8208;coating strategy to stabilize metal nanocrystals against sintering and meanwhile enable an effective exposure of active sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate controlled partial silica coating of colloidally prepared Pd0.82Ni0.18 nanocrystals with the size of 8 nanometers. This partially coated catalyst exhibits excellent activity, selectivity and stability, outperforming its counterparts with fully coated and supported structures, in reverse water gas shift catalysis particularly at high operating temperatures. Our study opens a new avenue for the exploration of colloidal metal nanocrystals in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Power Mesocarbon Microbeads|Na+&#8208;diglyme|Na3V2(PO4)3 Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>

Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) show practical applications in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. But, their power density is limited by the sluggish Na+ diffusion into the cathode and anode materials. Herein, we demonstrate a prototype of ultrahigh power SIB, consisted of the high&#8208;rate Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, graphite&#8208;type mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode, and Na+&#8208;diglyme electrolyte. It is found that the overpotential of the NVP cathode obeys the Ohmic rule. Thus, the as&#8208;synthesized NVP@C@CNTs cathode with the high conductive CNTs networks displays high electronic conductivity, reducing the overpotential and charge transfer resistances and leading to the remarkable rate capability over 1000C. For the MCMB anode, the initial [Na&#8208;diglyme]+ co&#8208;intercalation step is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the expended graphite's layers ensure the subsequent fast ions diffusion. The rapid (de)intercalation kinetics in between the cathode and anode are well&#8208;matched. Thus, the assembled MCMB|1 M NaPF6 in diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs full&#8208;cell SIB delivers the energy density of 88&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at high power density of &#8764;10&#160;kW kg&#8722;1. Even at the ultrahigh power density of 23&#160;kW kg&#8722;1, an energy density of 58&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is obtained. The encouraging results of the full cell will promote the development of high&#8208;power SIB for large&#8208;scale applications in the future.

         <title>Generation and Control of Terahertz Spin Currents in Topology&#8208;induced Two&#8208;dimensional Ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2|Bi2Te3 Heterostructures</title>

Abstract
Future information technologies for low&#8208;dissipation quantum computation, high&#8208;speed storage, and on&#8208;chip communication applications require the development of atomically thin, ultracompact, and ultrafast spintronic devices in which information is encoded, stored, and processed using electron spin. Exploring low&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials, designing novel heterostructures, and generating and controlling ultrafast electron spin in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) magnetism at room temperature, preferably in the unprecedented terahertz (THz) regime, is in high demand. Using THz emission spectroscopy driven by femtosecond laser pulses, we successfully realized optical THz spin current bursts at room temperature in 2D van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) integrated with Bi2Te3 as a topological insulator. The symmetry of the THz radiation was effectively controlled by the optical pumping incidence and external magnetic field directions, indicating that the THz generation mechanism is the inverse Edelstein effect contributed spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. Thickness&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, and structure&#8208;dependent nontrivial THz transients revealed that topology&#8208;enhanced interlayer exchange coupling increases the FGT Curie temperature to room temperature, which provides an effective approach for engineering THz spin current pulses. These results contribute to the goal of all&#8208;optical generation, manipulation, and detection of ultrafast THz spin currents in room&#8208;temperature 2D magnetism, accelerating the development of atomically thin high&#8208;speed spintronic devices.

Abstract
Anti&#8208;adhesion barriers such as films and hydrogels used to wrap repaired tendons are important for preventing the formation of adhesion tissue after tendon surgery. However, sliding of the tendon can compress the adjacent hydrogel barrier and cause it to rupture, which may then lead to unexpected inflammation. Here, a self&#8208;healing and deformable hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel was constructed as a peritendinous anti&#8208;adhesion barrier. Matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2)&#8208;degradable gelatin&#8208;methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) encapsulated with Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles were entrapped within the HA hydrogel to inhibit fibroblast proliferation and prevent peritendinous adhesion. Silencing effect of Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles was around 75% towards targeted gene. The mean adhesion scores of composite barrier group were 1.67&#177;0.51&#160;and 2.17&#177;0.75&#160;by macroscopic and histological evaluation, respectively. Furthermore, GelMA MSs were responsively degraded by upregulation of MMP&#8208;2, achieving on&#8208;demand release of siRNA nanoparticles to inhibit the formation of adhesion tissue. The proposed self&#8208;healing hydrogel anti&#8208;adhesion barrier with MMP&#8208;2&#8208;responsive drug release behavior is highly effective for decreasing inflammation and inhibiting tendon adhesion. Therefore, this research provides a new strategy for the development of safe and effective anti&#8208;adhesion barriers.

&lt;p&gt;Anti-adhesion barriers such as films and hydrogels used to wrap repaired tendons are important for preventing the formation of adhesion tissue after tendon surgery. However, sliding of the tendon can compress the adjacent hydrogel barrier and cause it to rupture, which may then lead to unexpected inflammation. Here, a self-healing and deformable hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel was constructed as a peritendinous anti-adhesion barrier. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)-degradable gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) encapsulated with Smad3-siRNA nanoparticles were entrapped within the HA hydrogel to inhibit fibroblast proliferation and prevent peritendinous adhesion. Silencing effect of Smad3-siRNA nanoparticles was around 75% towards targeted gene.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane for Precise Ion/Solvent Separation toward Highly Stable Magnesium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metallic magnesium batteries are promising candidates beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries; however, a passive interfacial layer because of the electro&#8208;reduction of solvents on Mg surfaces usually leads to ultra&#8208;high overpotential for the reversible Mg chemistry. Inspired by the excellent separation effect of permselective metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) at angstrom scale, we here construct a large&#8208;area and defect&#8208;free MOF membrane directly on Mg surfaces. In this process, the electrochemical deprotonation of ligand can be facilitated to afford the self&#8208;healing of intercrystalline voids until a seamless membrane formed, which can eliminate nonselective intercrystalline diffusion of electrolyte and realize selective Mg2+ transport but precisely separate the solvent molecules from the MOF channels. Compared with the continuous solvent reduction on bare Mg anode, the as&#8208;constructed MOF membrane is demonstrated to significantly stabilize the Mg electrode via suppressing the permeation of solvents, hence contributing to a low&#8208;overpotential plating/stripping in conventional electrolytes. We demonstrate the concept that membrane separation can serve as solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, which would be widely applicable to other energy&#8208;storage systems.

&lt;p&gt;Metallic magnesium batteries are promising candidates beyond lithium-ion batteries; however, a passive interfacial layer because of the electro-reduction of solvents on Mg surfaces usually leads to ultra-high overpotential for the reversible Mg chemistry.

Abstract
Due to the increasing importance of artificial intelligence (AI), significant recent effort has been devoted to the development of neuromorphic circuits that seek to emulate the energy&#8208;efficient information processing of the brain. While non&#8208;volatile memory (NVM) based on resistive switching, phase&#8208;change memory, and magnetic tunnel junctions have shown potential for implementing neural networks, additional multi&#8208;terminal device concepts are required for more sophisticated bio&#8208;realistic functions. Of particular interest are memtransistors based on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, which are capable of electrostatically tuning memory and learning behavior at the device level. In this Perspective, a conceptual overview of the memtransistor is provided in the context of neuromorphic circuits. Recent progress is surveyed for memtransistors and related multi&#8208;terminal NVM devices including dual&#8208;gated floating&#8208;gate memories, dual&#8208;gated ferroelectric transistors, and dual&#8208;gated van der Waals heterojunctions. The different materials systems and device architectures are classified based on the degree of control and relative tunability of synaptic behavior, with an emphasis on device concepts that harness the reduced dimensionality, weak electrostatic screening, and phase changes properties of nanomaterials. Finally, strategies for achieving wafer&#8208;scale integration of memtransistors and multi&#8208;terminal NVM devices are delineated, with specific attention given to the materials challenges for practical neuromorphic circuits.

         <title>Probing Electronic States in Monolayer Semiconductors through Static and Transient Third&#8208;Harmonic Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced optical technique is introduced: broadband static and transient third&#8208;harmonic spectroscopies capture clear fingerprints of relevant electronic states in monolayer semiconductors with an unprecedentedly high contrast ratio up to 200 and further offer a dramatic advance in understanding of exciton dynamics with an ultrafast speed of &#8776;1 ps and high modulation depth up to 94%.








Abstract
Electronic states and their dynamics are of critical importance for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Here, various relevant electronic states in monolayer MoS2, such as multiple excitonic Rydberg states and free&#8208;particle energy bands are probed with a high relative contrast of up to &#8805;200 via broadband (from &#8776;1.79 to 3.10 eV) static third&#8208;harmonic spectroscopy (THS), which is further supported by theoretical calculations. Moreover, transient THS is introduced to demonstrate that third&#8208;harmonic generation can be all&#8208;optically modulated with a modulation depth exceeding &#8776;94% at &#8776;2.18&#160;eV, providing direct evidence of dominant carrier relaxation processes associated with carrier&#8211;exciton and carrier&#8211;phonon interactions. The results indicate that static and transient THS are not only promising techniques for the characterization of monolayer semiconductors and their heterostructures, but also a potential platform for disruptive photonic and optoelectronic applications, including all&#8208;optical modulation and imaging.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of I&#8208;Rich Lithium Argyrodite Glass&#8211;Ceramic Electrolyte with High Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast synthesis of lithium argyrodite Li6&#8211;xPS5&#8211;xI1+x glass&#8211;ceramic electrolytes is accomplished via ultimate&#8208;energy mechanical alloying method within 1 h. A 45% S2&#8211;/I&#8211; disorder at 4d sites together with an ionic conductivity over 2 mS cm&#8211;1 is achieved for the optimal Li5.6PS4.6I1.4. The LiI&#8208;containing anodic interface helps solid&#8208;state batteries demonstrate prominent cycling stability and rate performance.








Abstract
Lithium argyrodites are one of the most promising sulfide electrolytes due to their high ionic conductivity and ductile feature. Among them, Li6PS5I (LPSI) exhibits better stability against Li metal but a rather low ionic conductivity (only &#8776;10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1) because of the absence of S2&#8722;/I&#8722; disorder. Herein, argyrodite Li6&#8722;xPS5&#8722;xI1+x glass&#8211;ceramic electrolytes with high iodine content are synthesized using ultimate&#8208;energy mechanical alloying method. S2&#8722;/I&#8722; disorder is successfully introduced into the system by doping LiI during this one&#8208;pot process. Determined by 6Li magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the introduction of iodine promotes Li+ inter&#8208;cage jumps, leading to an enhanced long&#8208;range Li+ conducting. The Li5.6PS4.6I1.4 glass&#8211;ceramic electrolyte (LPSI1.4&#8208;gc) possesses high ionic conductivity (2.04 mS cm&#8722;1) and excellent stability against Li metal. The Li symmetric cell with the LPSI1.4&#8208;gc electrolyte demonstrates ultralong cycling stability over 3200 h at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. LiCoO2/Li6PS5Cl/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery applying LPSI1.4&#8208;gc as the anode interlayer also presents prominent cycling and rate performance. This work provides a novel type of electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and stability against Li metal.

Determined by &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the introduction of iodine promotes Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; inter-cage jumps, leading to an enhanced long-range Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conducting. The Li&lt;sub&gt;5.6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;4.6&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;1.4&lt;/sub&gt; glass&#8211;ceramic electrolyte (LPSI&lt;sub&gt;1.4&lt;/sub&gt;-gc) possesses high ionic conductivity (2.04 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and excellent stability against Li metal. The Li symmetric cell with the LPSI&lt;sub&gt;1.4&lt;/sub&gt;-gc electrolyte demonstrates ultralong cycling stability over 3200 h at 0.2&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Single Crystals Heterogeneity Impacts the Intrinsic and Extrinsic Properties of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of heterogeneities in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be enormous at the single&#8208;particle level but is often neglected in characterization due to the lack of microscopes capable of correlated studies on the same crystals. The authors present an analysis platform for correlated, in situ spectroscopy and imaging named MOSAIC, and unveil new heterogeneity&#8211;property relations for two important MOF systems.








Abstract
At present, an enormous characterization gap exists between the study of the crystal structure of a material and its bulk properties. Individual particles falling within this gap cannot be fully characterized in a correlative manner by current methods. The authors address this problem by exploiting the noninvasive nature of optical microscopy and spectroscopy for the correlative analysis of metal&#8208;organic framework particles in situ. They probe the intrinsic as well as extrinsic properties in a correlated manner. The authors show that the crystal shape of MIL&#8208;88A strongly impacts its optical absorption. Furthermore, the question of how homogeneously water is distributed and adsorbed within one of the most promising materials for harvesting water from humid air, MOF&#8208;801, is addressed. The results demonstrate the considerable importance of the particle level and how it can affect the property of the material.

         <title>Coordination Polymer&#8208;Coated CaCO3 Reinforces Radiotherapy by Reprogramming the Immunosuppressive Metabolic Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acidity&#8208;IDO1 modulation nanoparticles (AIM NPs) can effectively promote the transition of immunosuppressive (cold) tumor microenvironment to immune&#8208;activated (hot) one via simultaneous tumor acidity neutralization and Kyn depletion. In synergizing with AIM NPs injection, treatment with external X&#8208;ray irradiation can effectively suppress the growth of irradiated primary tumors, distant unirradiated (metastatic) tumors, and rechallenged (relapsed) tumors by eliciting potent antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy is widely exploited for the treatment of a large range of cancers in clinic, but its therapeutic effectiveness is seriously crippled by the tumor immunosuppression, mainly driven by the altered metabolism of cancer cells. Here, a pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicine is prepared by coating calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticles with 4&#8208;phenylimidazole (4PI), an inhibitor against indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO&#8208;1), together with zinc ions via the coordination reaction, aiming at reinforcing the treatment outcome of radiotherapy. The obtained pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicine, coined as acidity&#8208;IDO1&#8208;modulation nanoparticles (AIM NPs), is able to instantly neutralize protons, and release 4PI to suppress the IDO1&#8208;mediated production of kynurenine (Kyn) upon tumor accumulation. As a result, treatment with AIM NPs can remarkably enhance the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy against both murine CT26 and 4T1 tumors by eliciting potent antitumor immunity. Furthermore, it is shown that such combination treatment can effectively suppress the growth of untreated distant tumors via the abscopal effect, and result in immune memory responses to reject rechallenged tumors. This work highlights a novel strategy of simultaneous tumor acidity neutralization and IDO1 inhibition to potentiate radiotherapy, with great promises to suppress tumor metastasis and recurrence by eliciting robust antitumor immunity.

         <title>Quenching&#8208;Resistant Multiresonance TADF Emitter Realizes 40% External Quantum Efficiency in Narrowband Electroluminescence at High Doping Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design tactic to achieve quenching&#8208;resistant multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is proposed by fencing the MR&#8208;skeleton with steric units. Excellent electroluminescence performances are recorded in corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, with record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiencies up to 40.0% and full width at half maximum values of only 25&#160;nm.








Abstract
Multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters manifest great potential for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high exciton&#8208;utilization efficiency and narrowband emission. Nonetheless, their tendency toward self&#8208;quenching caused by strong interchromophore interactions would induce doping sensitivity and deteriorate the device performances, and effective strategy to construct quenching&#8208;resistant emitters without sacrifycing color purity is still to be developed. By segregating the planar MR&#8208;TADF skeleton using two bulky carbazolyl units, herein a highly emissive molecule with enhanced quenching resistance is reported. The steric effect largely removes the formation of detrimental excimers/aggregates, and boosts the performance of the corresponding devices with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) up to 40.0% and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm, representative of the only example of single OLED that can concurrently achieve narrow bandwidth and high EL efficiency surpassing 40% to date. Even at doping ratio of 30 wt%, the EQEmax is retained to be 33.3% with nearly unchanged emission spectrum. This work provides a viable approach to realize doping&#8208;insensitive MR&#8208;TADF devices with extreme EL efficiency and color purity for high&#8208;end OLED displays.

         <title>Stapled Liposomes Enhance Cross&#8208;Priming of Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antigen&#8208;capturing stapled liposome (ACSL) with robust structure and bioactive surface that can capture and transport tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) from lysosomes to cytoplasm in dendritic cells, thereby enhancing the TAA cross&#8208;presentation for effective radio&#8208;immunotherapy is demonstrated.








Abstract
The release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) and their cross&#8208;presentation in dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for radio&#8208;immunotherapy. However, the irradiation resistance of tumor cells usually results in limited TAA generation and release. Importantly, TAAs internalized by DCs are easily degraded in lysosomes, resulting in unsatisfactory extent of TAA cross&#8208;presentation. Herein, an antigen&#8208;capturing stapled liposome (ACSL) with a robust structure and bioactive surface is developed. The ACSLs capture and transport TAAs from lysosomes to the cytoplasm in DCs, thereby enhancing TAA cross&#8208;presentation. l&#8208;arginine encapsulated in ACSLs induces robust T cell&#8208;dependent antitumor response and immune memory in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice after local irradiation, resulting in significant tumor suppression and an abscopal effect. Replacing l&#8208;arginine with radiosensitizers, photosensitizers, and photothermal agents may make ACSL a universal platform for the rapid development of various combinations of anticancer therapies.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Metal Deposition on 2D Materials via Inkjet Printing Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evaporation of Au or the sputtering of Cr on 2D layered hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) produces local atomic defects in its structure, specially at its interfaces, which increases the leakage current across it. It is found that the deposition of metal on hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) using inkjet printing does not introduce any defect, and maintains its layered structure free of defects.








Abstract
2D materials have many outstanding properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of electronic devices, such as high conductivity, flexibility, and transparency.

Recent studies have demonstrated that standard metal deposition techniques (like electron beam evaporation and sputtering) significantly damage the atomic structure of 2D materials.

&lt;p&gt;The evaporation of Au or the sputtering of Cr on 2D layered hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) produces local atomic defects in its structure, specially at its interfaces, which increases the leakage current across it. It is found that the deposition of metal on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) using inkjet printing does not introduce any defect, and maintains its layered structure free of defects.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D materials have many outstanding properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of electronic devices, such as high conductivity, flexibility, and transparency. However, integrating 2D materials in commercial devices and circuits is challenging because their structure and properties can be damaged during the fabrication process. Recent studies have demonstrated that standard metal deposition techniques (like electron beam evaporation and sputtering) significantly damage the atomic structure of 2D materials. Here it is shown that the deposition of metal via inkjet printing technology does not produce any observable damage in the atomic structure of ultrathin 2D materials, and it can keep a sharp interface. These conclusions are supported by abundant data obtained via atomistic simulations, transmission electron microscopy, nanochemical metrology, and device characterization in a probe station.

         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the fundamental understanding of the characteristics and challenges of the &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes of zinc&#8208;ion batteries, including conventional organic electrolytes, ionic liquid, all/quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and goes deep into the discussion on the pros and cons of each electrolyte. Lastly, this review presents a perspective on the challenges and future opportunities for the &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes.








Abstract
With the growing demands for large&#8208;scale energy storage, Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with distinct advantages, including resource abundance, low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety, and acceptable energy density, are considered&#160;as potential substitutes for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Although numerous efforts are devoted to design and develop high performance cathodes and aqueous electrolytes for ZIBs, many challenges, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, water evaporation, and liquid leakage, have greatly hindered the development of aqueous ZIBs. Developing &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes can be able to avoid these issues due to the absence of water, which are beneficial for the achieving of highly efficient ZIBs. In this review, the recent development of the &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes, including conventional organic electrolytes, ionic liquid, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state, quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and deep eutectic electrolytes are presented. The critical issues and the corresponding strategies of the designing of &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes for ZIBs are also summarized.

         <title>Design of Materials Configuration for Optimizing Redox&#8208;Based Resistive Switching Memories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Influence of electrode and capping layer materials configuration in HfO2&#8208;based electrochemical metallization memory (ECM) and valence&#8208;change memory (VCM) types of redox&#8208;based resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells is presented. Cyclic voltammetry reveals different interfacial electrochemical redox processes. The modulation of the resistive switching characteristics by varying the capping layer material in a combination with counter(bottom) electrode configurations are demonstrated and highlighted.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;based resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) are based on electrochemical processes of oxidation and reduction within the devices. The selection of materials and material combinations strongly influence the related nanoscale processes, playing a crucial role in resistive switching properties and functionalities. To date, however, comprehensive studies on device design accounting for a combination of factors such as electrodes, electrolytes, and capping layer materials related to their thicknesses and interactions are scarce. In this work, the impact of materials&#8217; configuration on interfacial redox reactions in HfO2&#8208;based electrochemical metallization memory (ECM) and valence&#8208;change memory (VCM) systems is reported. The redox processes are studied by cyclic voltammetry, and the corresponding resistive switching characteristics are investigated. In ECM cells, the overall cell resistance depends on the electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrode. Nonetheless, the capping layer material further influences the cell resistance and the SET and RESET voltages. In VCM systems, the influence of the electrode material configuration is also pronounced, and is capable of modulating the active resistive switching interface. For both types of memory cells, the switching behavior changes significantly with variation of the oxide thickness. The results present important materials selection criteria for rationale design of ReRAM cells for various memristive applications.

         <title>Double&#8208;Layer Nacre&#8208;Inspired Polyimide&#8208;Mica Nanocomposite Films with Excellent Mechanical Stability for LEO Environmental Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyimide&#8208;mica (PI&#8208;Mica) nanocomposite film with outstanding mechanical properties and atomic oxygen resistance is produced by integrating mica nanosheets with polyimide into a double&#8208;layer nacre&#8208;inspired structure with a much higher density of mica in the top layer. This unique microstructure and advantages of mica also impart the film with favorable resistance to ultraviolet, space debris, and high temperatures.








Abstract
Owing to their outstanding comprehensive performance, polyimide (PI) composite films are widely used on the external surfaces of spacecraft to protect them from the adverse conditions of low Earth orbit (LEO). However, current PI composite films have inadequate mechanical properties and atomic oxygen (AO) resistance. Herein, this work fabricates a new PI&#8208;based nanocomposite film with greatly enhanced mechanical properties and AO resistance by integrating mica nanosheets with PI into a unique double&#8208;layer nacre&#8208;inspired structure with a much higher density of mica nanosheets in the top layer. In addition, the unique microstructure and the intrinsic properties of mica also impart the nanocomposite film with favorable ultraviolet and high&#8208;temperature resistance. The comprehensive performance of this material is superior to those of pure PI, single&#8208;layer PI&#8208;mica, and previously reported PI&#8208;based composite films. Thus, the double&#8208;layer nanocomposite film displays great potential as an aerospace material for use in LEO.

         <title>Silk Embolic Material for Catheter&#8208;Directed Endovascular Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embolic materials today are clinically approved for achieving vascular occlusion. In this work, a biomaterial comprising silk fibroin and nanoclay is developed and optimized as a multifunctional embolic agent that offers both embolization and drug&#8208;delivery capabilities. The silk embolic material exhibits excellent transcatheter injectability, mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and hemocompatibility to serve as a catheter&#8208;directed embolic drug carrier for the treatment of vascular diseases.








Abstract
Embolization is a catheter&#8208;based minimally invasive procedure that deliberately occludes diseased blood vessels for treatment purposes. A novel silk&#8208;based embolic material (SEM) that is developed and optimized to provide tandem integration of both embolization and the delivery of therapeutics is reported. Natural silk is processed into fibroin proteins of varying lengths and is combined with charged nanoclay particles to allow visibility and injectability using clinical catheters as small as 600 &#956;m in diameter at lengths &gt;100&#160;cm.&#160;SEMs loaded with fluorochrome labeled bovine albumin and Nivolumab, which is among the most used immunotherapy drugs worldwide, demonstrate a sustained release profile in vitro over 28 days. In a porcine renal survival model, SEMs with labeled albumin and Nivolumab successfully embolize porcine arteries without recanalization and lead to the delivery of both albumin and Nivolumab into the interstitial space of the renal cortex. Mechanistically, it is shown that tissue delivery is most optimal when the internal elastic membrane of the embolized artery is disrupted. SEM is a potential next&#8208;generation multifunctional embolic agent that can achieve embolization and deliver a wide range of therapeutics to treat vascular diseases including tumors.

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Healing Multifunctional Dressing with Antibacterial Activity for Sutureless Wound Closure and Infected Wound Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;healing elastomer&#8208;based multifunctional wound dressing (MFWD) with desirable mechanical robustness, biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity is developed for effective wound management. MFWD assists in contracting wound edges, based on the excellent self&#8208;healing ability of the elastomer. The wound status can also be comprehensively monitored and reported with this MFWD.








Abstract
Wound healing represents a major clinical and public healthcare problem that is frequently challenged by infection risks, detrimental consequences on the surrounding tissues, and difficulties to monitor the healing process. Here we&#160;report on a novel self&#8208;healing, antibacterial, and multifunctional wound dressing for sutureless wound closure and real&#8208;time monitoring of the healing parameters. The self&#8208;healing elastomer contains cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and has high mechanical toughness (35&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), biocompatibility, and outstanding antibacterial activity (bactericidal rate is &#8776;90% in 12 h), enabling the wound dressing to effectively inhibit bacterial growth and accelerate infected wound healing. In vivo tests based on full&#8208;thickness skin incision model shows that the multifunctional wound dressing can help in contracting wound edges and facilitate wound closure and healing, as could be evidenced by notably dense and well&#8208;organized collagen deposition. The test provides an evidence that the integrated sensor array within the multifunctional wound dressing can monitor temperature, pH, and glucose level of the wound area in real&#8208;time, providing reliable and timely information of the condition of the wound. Ultimately, the reported multifunctional dressing would be of high value in managing the burden associated with wound healing via personalised monitoring and treatment approaches, digital and other people&#8208;centred solutions for health care.

&lt;p&gt;A novel self-healing elastomer-based multifunctional wound dressing (MFWD) with desirable mechanical robustness, biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity is developed for effective wound management. MFWD assists in contracting wound edges, based on the excellent self-healing ability of the elastomer. The wound status can also be comprehensively monitored and reported with this MFWD.

         <title>Evolution from Lead&#8208;Based to Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics: Engineering of Lattices, Domains, Boundaries, and Defects Leading to Giant Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergetic combination of conventional and emergent strategies to enhance piezoelectricity, with a deeper understanding of structure&#8211;property relationship using advanced state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques, can lead to a breakthrough in giant piezoelectricity with the desired characteristics.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials are known to mankind for more than a century, with numerous advancements made in both scientific understandings and practical applications. In the last two decades, in particular, the research on piezoelectrics has largely been driven by the constantly changing technological demand, and the drive toward a sustainable society. Hence, environmental&#8208;friendly &#8220;lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics&#8221; have emerged in the anticipation of replacing lead&#8208;based counterparts with at least comparable performance. However, there are still obstacles to be overcome for realizing this objective, while the efforts in this direction already seem to culminate. Therefore, novel structural strategies need to be designed to address these issues and for further breakthrough in this field. Here, various strategies to enhance piezoelectric properties in lead&#8208;free systems with fundamental and historical context, and from atomic to macroscopic scale, are explored. The main challenges currently faced in the transition from lead&#8208;based to lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics are identified and key milestones for future research in this field are suggested. These include: i) decoding the fundamental mechanisms; ii) large temperature&#8208;stable piezoresponse; and iii) fabrication&#8208;friendly and tailorable composition. Strategic insights and general guidelines for the synergistic design of new piezoelectric materials for obtaining a large piezoelectric response are also provided.

         <title>Ultrahigh Sensitive Au&#8208;Doped Silicon Nanomembrane Based Wearable Sensor Arrays for Continuous Skin Temperature Monitoring with High Precision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal monitoring of the human body with high accuracy provides a fast, facile, but powerful route in a wide range of health information standards. Ultrasensitive, and stretchable Au&#8208;doped silicon nanomembrane (SiNM) epidermal temperature sensor array achieved by property modulations of SiNM with the development of a novel gold&#8208;doping strategy offers a general foundation for continuous monitoring of human body temperature.








Abstract
Monitoring the body temperature with high accuracy provides a fast, facile, yet powerful route about the human body in a wide range of health information standards. Here, the first ever ultrasensitive and stretchable gold&#8208;doped silicon nanomembrane (Au&#8208;doped SiNM) epidermal temperature sensor array is introduced. The ultrasensitivity is achieved by shifting freeze&#8208;out region to intrinsic region in carrier density and modulation of fermi energy level of p&#8208;type SiNM through the development of a novel gold&#8208;doping strategy. The Au&#8208;doped SiNM is readily transferred onto an ultrathin polymer layer with a well&#8208;designed serpentine mesh structure, capable of being utilized as an epidermal temperature sensor array. Measurements in vivo and in vitro show temperature coefficient of resistance as high as &#8722;37270.72 ppm &#176;C&#8722;1,&#160;22&#160;times higher than existing metal&#8208;based temperature sensors with similar structures, and one of the highest thermal sensitivity among the inorganic material based temperature sensors. Applications in the continuous monitoring of body temperature and respiration rate during exercising are demonstrated with a successful capture of information. This work lays a foundation for monitoring body temperature, potentially useful for precision diagnosis (e.g., continuous monitoring body temperature in coronavirus disease 2019 cases) and management of disease relevance to body temperature in healthcare.

         <title>Thermally Controlled Charge&#8208;Carrier Transitions in Disordered PbSbTe Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown experimentally that the carrier type and mobility in Pb&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te thin films can be controlled by annealing the disordered crystal. First&#8208;principles simulations indicate that the unexpected transition from n&#8208; to p&#8208;conduction is caused by a crossover of the predominant point&#8208;defect type with increasing order. Tuning self&#8208;doping properties this way could prove useful for thermoelectric devices and other applications.








Abstract
Binary and ternary chalcogenides have recently attracted much attention due to their wide range of applications including phase&#8208;change memory materials, topological insulators, photonic switches, and thermoelectrics. These applications require a precise control of the number and mobility of charge carriers. Here, an unexpected charge&#8208;carrier transition in ternary compounds from the PbTe&#8211;Sb2Te3 pseudo&#8208;binary line is reported. Upon thermal annealing, sputtered thin films of PbSb2Te4 and Pb2Sb2Te5 undergo a transition in the temperature coefficient of resistance and in the type of the majority charge carriers from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type. These transitions are observed upon increasing structural order within one crystallographic phase. To account for this striking observation, it is proposed that the Fermi energy shifts from the tail of the conduction band to the valence band because different levels of overall structural disorder lead to different predominant types of native point defects. This view is confirmed by an extensive computational study, revealing a transition from excess cations and SbPb for high levels of disorder to PbSb prevailing for low disorder. The findings will help fine&#8208;tune transport properties in certain chalcogenides via proper thermal treatment, with potential benefits for memories, thermoelectric material optimization, and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zinc(I) Active Sites to Accelerate Nitrogen Reduction Kinetics for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon electrocatalyst with single Zn(I) sites is discovered to accelerate kinetics of hydrogenation process for efficient N2 reduction.








Abstract
Developing highly active and stable nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) catalysts for NH3 electrosynthesis remains challenging. Herein, an unusual NRR electrocatalyst is reported with a single Zn(I) site supported on hollow porous N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (Zn1N&#8211;C). The Zn1N&#8211;C nanofibers exhibit an outstanding NRR activity with a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;16.1&#160;&#181;g NH3 h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.3&#160;V and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 11.8% in alkaline media, surpassing other previously reported carbon&#8208;based NRR electrocatalysts with transition metals atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated (TM&#8208;Nx) sites. 15N2 isotope labeling experiments confirm that the feeding nitrogen gas is the only nitrogen source in the production of NH3. Structural characterization reveals that atomically dispersed Zn(I) sites with Zn&#8211;N4 moieties are likely the active sites, and the nearby graphitic N site synergistically facilitates the NRR process. In situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared measurement and theoretical calculation elucidate that the formation of initial *NNH intermediate is the rate&#8208;limiting step during the NH3 production. The graphitic N atoms adjacent to the tetracoordinate Zn&#8211;N4 moieties could significantly lower the energy barrier for this step to accelerate hydrogenation kinetics duing the NRR.

The graphitic N atoms adjacent to the tetracoordinate Zn&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; moieties could significantly lower the energy barrier for this step to accelerate hydrogenation kinetics duing the NRR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating and Mitigating High&#8208;Voltage Degradation Cascades in Cobalt&#8208;Free LiNiO2 Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the O3&#8211;O1 stacking transition in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2 lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes, which subsequently induces Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults, microscale creep, cracking, and even bending of layers after high&#8208;voltage cycling. By suppressing oxygen evolution, hermetic graphene coatings arrest this degradation cascade, resulting in substantially improved high&#8208;voltage capacity retention.








Abstract
LiNiO2 (LNO) is a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to its exceptionally high capacity and cobalt&#8208;free composition that enables more sustainable and ethical large&#8208;scale manufacturing. However, its poor cycle life at high operating voltages over 4.1&#160;V impedes its practical use, thus motivating efforts to elucidate and mitigate LiNiO2 degradation mechanisms at high states of charge. Here, a multiscale exploration of high&#8208;voltage degradation cascades associated with oxygen stacking chemistry in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2, is presented. Lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the local O3&#8211;O1 stacking transition at high states of charge, which subsequently leads to Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults during cycling. This undesirable atomic&#8208;scale structural evolution accelerates microscale electrochemical creep, cracking, and even bending of layers, ultimately resulting in macroscopic mechanical degradation of LNO particles. By employing a graphene&#8208;based hermetic surface coating, oxygen loss is attenuated in LNO at high states of charge, which suppresses the initiation of the degradation cascade and thus substantially improves the high&#8208;voltage capacity retention of LNO. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insight into the high&#8208;voltage degradation of LNO, which will inform ongoing efforts to employ cobalt&#8208;free cathodes in Li&#8208;ion battery technology.

         <title>3D Printed, Solid&#8208;State Conductive Ionoelastomer as a Generic Building Block for Tactile Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast photocurable, solid&#8208;state conductive ionoelastomer is designed for high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of soft ionic conductor with arbitrary architectures. The printed building blocks display excellent and temperature&#8208;tolerant electrical&#8211;mechanical properties, as well as can be programmed into 3D flexible tactile devices such as gyroid&#8208;based piezoresistive sensor and gap&#8208;based capacitive sensor, both of which exhibit sensitivities much higher than their bulky counterparts.








Abstract
Shaping soft and conductive materials into preferential architectures via 3D printing is highly attractive for numerous applications ranging from tactile devices to bioelectronics. A landmark type of soft and conductive materials is hydrogels/ionogels. However, 3D&#8208;printed hydrogels/ionogels still suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: limited stability in their electrical&#8211;mechanical properties caused by the evaporation and leakage of liquid within hydrogels/ionogels. Although photocurable liquid&#8208;free ion&#8208;conducting elastomers can circumvent these limitations, the associated photocurable process is cumbersome and hence the printing quality is relatively poor. Herein, a fast photocurable, solid&#8208;state conductive ionoelastomer (SCIE) is developed that enables high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of arbitrary architectures. The printed building blocks possess many promising features over the conventional ion&#8208;conducting materials, including high resolution architectures (even &#8776;50&#160;&#181;m overhanging lattices), good Young's modulus (up to &#8776;6.2&#160;MPa), and stretchability (fracture strain of &#8776;292%), excellent conductivity tolerance in a wide range of temperatures (from &#8722;30 to 80&#160;&#176;C), as well as fine elasticity and antifatigue ability even after 10&#160;000 loading&#8211;unloading cycles. It is further demonstrated that the printed building blocks can be programmed into 3D flexible tactile sensors such as gyroid&#8208;based piezoresistive sensor and gap&#8208;based capacitive sensor, both of which exhibit several times higher in sensitivity than their bulky counterparts.

         <title>Bioinspired Quasi&#8208;3D Multiplexed Anti&#8208;Counterfeit Imaging via Self&#8208;Assembled and Nanoimprinted Photonic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite lattice photonic crystal architecture can realize polarization&#8208;sensitive multichannel image encodings designed by self&#8208;assembling and nanoimprinting technique. This strategy is low cost, high yield, and scalable, leading to innovative anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology with efficient and handy fabrication.








Abstract
Innovative multiplexing technologies based on nano&#8208;optics for anti&#8208;counterfeiting have been proposed as overt and covert technologies to secure products and make them difficult to counterfeit. However, most of these nano&#8208;optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are metasurfaces and metamaterials with complex and expensive fabrication process, often resulting in materials that are not damage tolerant. Highly efficient anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies with easy fabrication process are targeted for intuitive and effective authentication of banknotes, secure documents, and goods packing. Here, a simple strategy exploiting self&#8208;assembling and nanoimprinting technique to fabricate a composite lattice photonic crystal architecture featuring full spatial control of light, multiplexed full&#8208;pixel imaging, and multichannel cryptography combined with customized algorithms is reported. In particular, the real&#8208;time encryption/recognition of mobile quick response codes and anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels on a postage stamp, encoded by the proposed photonic architecture, are both demonstrated. The wave optics of scattering, diffraction, and polarization process involved are also described, validated with numerical simulations and experiments. By introducing a new degree of freedom in the 3D space, the multichannel image switching exhibits unprecedented variability of encryption, providing a promising roadmap to achieve larger information capacity, better security, and higher definition for the benefit of modern anti&#8208;counterfeiting security.

         <title>Selective Antisite Defect Formation in WS2 Monolayers via Reactive Growth on Dilute W&#8208;Au Alloy Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisite defects in monolayer WS2 are selectively formed with a nonequilibrium synthesis strategy that can reduce their formation energy via W&#8208;poor growth conditions achieved by limiting the available surface W concentration on a W/Au alloy. A high density of SW and S2W antisite defects can be obtained and identified in monolayer WS2 that are sufficient to induce localized defect states in the bandgap.








Abstract
Defects are ubiquitous in 2D materials and can affect the structure and properties of the materials and also introduce new functionalities. Methods to adjust the structure and density of defects during bottom&#8208;up synthesis are required to control the growth of 2D materials with tailored optical and electronic properties. Here, the authors present an Au&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition approach to selectively form SW and S2W antisite defects, whereby one or two sulfur atoms substitute for a tungsten atom in WS2 monolayers. Guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, they describe a new method that can maintain tungsten&#8208;poor growth conditions relative to sulfur via the low solubility of W atoms in a gold/W alloy, thereby significantly reducing the formation energy of the antisite defects during the growth of WS2. The atomic structure and composition of the antisite defects are unambiguously identified by Z&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy, and their total concentration is statistically determined, with levels up to &#8776;5.0%. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations further verified these antisite defects and revealed the localized defect states in the bandgap of WS2 monolayers. This bottom&#8208;up synthesis method to form antisite defects should apply in the synthesis of other 2D materials.

By using the optimized n&#8208;propylamine&#8211;zinc oxide electron transporting layer, an organic solar cell with high power conversion efficiency and outstanding stability is achieved.








Abstract
As a representative electron transporting layer in organic solar cells, zinc oxide (ZnO) can be fabricated by the meniscus&#8208;guided coating with the promotion of sol&#8211;gel technology. In order to fabricate stable and flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the printable ZnO layers, here, a new method for simultaneously manipulating fluidics of the sol&#8211;gel ZnO precursor and optimizing processability of the ZnO layer for flexible OSCs is developed. It is found that the Marangoni recirculation in meniscus and the annealing temperature of the sol&#8211;gel ZnO precursor can be effectively modulated by changing the Lewis base. With the use of propylamine, the high&#8208;quality ZnO layer that is suitable for flexible OSCs can be fabricated through blade coating. Under such a condition, the formation of polar facet in ZnO layer is well restrained, which favors the photostability of the cells. As a result, the best 1.00 cm2 flexible cell outputs a power conversion efficiency of 16.71%, which is the best value till now.

         <title>Atomic Visualization and Switching of Ferroelectric Order in &#946;&#8208;In2Se3 Films at the Single Layer Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single layer &#946;&#8242;&#8208; and &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3 films are experimentally validated to host 2D in&#8208;plane anti&#8208;ferroelectric and ferroelectric order, respectively, with structural and spectroscopic evidences characterized by low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)/spectroscopy. An electric field&#8208;induced phase transition is also realized via applying an STM tip pulse, demonstrating the manipulation of the ferroelectric polarization with reversible switching.








Abstract
2D ferroelectrics have received wide interest due to the remarkable quantum states of emerging physics at reduced dimensionality, associated with their exotic properties in high&#8208;performance and nonvolatile functional devices. Here, by combing molecular beam epitaxy synthesis and scanning tunneling microscopy characterization, two metastable phases of layered In2Se3 films: &#946;&#8242;&#8208; and &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3 are reported, which develop different types of in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarizations, thus resulting in different striped morphologies. The anti&#8208;ferroelectric order in &#946;&#8242;&#8208;In2Se3 and ferroelectric order of &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3 are identified, respectively, down to the 2D limit by comprehensive investigations of structural and spectroscopic signatures, including the lattice distortion, the spatial profile of images, the formation of domain structure, and the electronic band&#8208;bending by polarization charges at edges. The ferroelectric switching between those two phases are further controlled via applying an electric field generated from the scanning tunneling microscopy tip in a reversible manner. The intriguing tunability between the (anti&#8208;)ferroelectric orders in the 2D limit provides a promising platform for studying the interplay between electronic structure and ferroelectricity in van der Waals materials, and promotes potential development of miniaturized transistors and memory devices based on electric polarizations.

         <title>Programmable Zwitterionic Droplets as Biomolecular Sorters and Model of Membraneless Organelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to produce programmable liquid droplets via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation of associative synthetic polymers is presented. Starting from zwitterionic polymers as reference, different functional groups able to encode multiple intermolecular interactions are introduced in the polymer. In this way, it is possible to simultaneously control multiple mesoscopic properties of the droplets, opening attractive applications in bioseparation and diagnostics.








Abstract
Increasing evidence indicates that cells can regulate biochemical functions in time and space by generating membraneless compartments with well&#8208;defined mesoscopic properties. One important mechanism underlying this control is simple coacervation driven by associative disordered proteins that encode multivalent interactions. Inspired by these observations, programmable droplets based on simple coacervation of responsive synthetic polymers that mimic the &#8220;stickers&#8208;and&#8208;spacers&#8221; architecture of biological disordered proteins are developed. Zwitterionic polymers that undergo an enthalpy&#8208;driven liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation process and form liquid droplets that remarkably exclude most molecules are developed. Starting from this reference material, different functional groups in the zwitterionic polymer are progressively added to encode an increasing number of different intermolecular interactions. This strategy allowed the multiple emerging properties of the droplets to be controlled independently, such as stimulus&#8208;responsiveness, polarity, selective uptake of client molecules, fusion times, and miscibility. By exploiting this high programmability, a model of cellular compartmentalization is reproduced and droplets capable of confining different molecules in space without physical barriers are generated. Moreover, these biomolecular sorters are demonstrated to be able to localize, separate, and enable the detection of target molecules even within complex mixtures, opening attractive applications in bioseparation, and diagnostics.

         <title>Efficient Tandem Quantum&#8208;Dot LEDs Enabled by An Inorganic Semiconductor&#8208;Metal&#8208;Dielectric Interconnecting Layer Stack</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient interconnecting layers (ICLs) are reported consisting of multifunctional inorganic semiconductor&#8208;metal&#8208;dielectric stack, which enables the resultant tandem quantum dot light emitting diodes (QLEDs) with double junction to achieve a record efficiency, with the EQEs of 40% for red, 49% for yellow, 50% for green, and 24% for blue.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) in a tandem configuration offer a strategy to realize high&#8208;performance, multicolor devices. Until now, though, the efficiency of tandem colloidal quantum dot LEDs (QLEDs) has been limited due to unpassivated interfaces and solvent damage originating from the materials processing requirements of interconnecting layers (ICLs). Here an ICL is reported consisting of a semiconductor&#8208;metal&#8208;dielectric stack that provides facile fabrication, materials stability, and good optoelectronic coupling. It is investigated experimentally how the ICL enables charge balance, suppresses current leakage, and prevents solvent damage to the underlying layers. As a result record efficiencies are reported for double&#8208;junction tandem QLEDs, whose emission wavelengths cover from blue to red light; i.e., external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 40% (average 37+/&#8722;2%) for red, 49% (average 45+/&#8722;2%) for yellow, 50% (average 46+/&#8722;2%) for green, and 24% (average 21+/&#8722;2%) for blue are achieved.

         <title>Tunable Supramolecular Cavities Molecularly Homogenized in Polymer Membranes for Ultraefficient Precombustion CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble organic macrocyclic cavitands (OMCs) with interactive affinity for polymers can be utilized to design novel nanocomposite membranes with true molecular homogeneity, unlike conventional nanoarchitectures that form heterogeneous nanofiller phases within membranes that cause performance and processability issues. By adjusting the OMC cavity size within the membranes, tunable gas transport properties can be obtained for highly molecular&#8208;sieving H2/CO2 separation.








Abstract
Processable molecular&#8208;sieving membranes are important materials for realizing energy&#8208;efficient precombustion CO2 capture during industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production. However, the promising design of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) that aims to integrate the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of nanoporous architectures with industrial processable polymers still faces performance and fabrication issues due to the formation of segregated nanofiller domains in their polymer matrices. Here, an unconventional nanocomposite membrane design is proposed using soluble organic macrocyclic cavitands (OMCs) with tunable open cavity sizes that not only mitigate the formation the discrete nanofiller phases but also deliver distinct molecular&#8208;sieving separations. The versatile organic&#8208;solvent solubility coupled with highly interactive functionalities of OMCs allows them to obtain molecularly homogeneous mixing with matrix polymers and form only one integral continuous phase crucial to the robust processability of polymers. A series of polybenzimidazole&#8208;based molecularly mixed composite membranes (MMCMs) are fabricated via the incorporation of a soluble and thermally stable OMC choice, sulfocalixarenes, with various cavity sizes. These membranes achieve outstanding high&#8208;temperature mixed&#8208;gas H2/CO2 separation performances comparable with several state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular&#8208;sieving membranes owing to effective size&#8208;sieving gas passages through the open or partially&#8208;intruded supramolecular cavities. The broadly tunable structures and functionalities of OMCs would make their MMCMs attractive for other energy&#8208;intensive molecular separations.

A series of polybenzimidazole-based molecularly mixed composite membranes (MMCMs) are fabricated via the incorporation of a soluble and thermally stable OMC choice, sulfocalixarenes, with various cavity sizes. These membranes achieve outstanding high-temperature mixed-gas H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performances comparable with several state-of-the-art molecular-sieving membranes owing to effective size-sieving gas passages through the open or partially-intruded supramolecular cavities. The broadly tunable structures and functionalities of OMCs would make their MMCMs attractive for other energy-intensive molecular separations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interpolation between W Dopant and Co Vacancy in CoOOH for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpolation principle between W dopant and Co vacancy with opposite modulation effect is proposed to tune the electronic structure of CoOOH for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, near&#8208;optimal electronic states and near&#8208;ideal intermediate energetics are achieved, leading to high catalytic activity. Such an interpolation principle can open up a new methodology for efficient catalyst design.








Abstract
Electronic structure engineering via integrating two defect structures with opposite modulation effects holds the key to fully unlocking the power of a catalyst. Herein, an interpolation principle is proposed to activate CoOOH via W doping and Co vacancies for the oxygen evolution reaction. Density functional theory suggests opposite roles for the W dopant and the Co vacancy but a synergy between them in tuning the electronic states of the Co site, leading to near&#8208;ideal intermediate energetics and dramatically lowered catalytic overpotential. Experimental studies confirm the modulation of the electronic structure and validate the greatly enhanced catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 298.5&#160;mV to drive 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The discovery of the interpolation between dopants and vacancies opens up a new methodology to design efficient catalysts for various electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Low&#8208;Threshold, Highly Stable Colloidal Quantum Dot Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Laser enabled by Suppression of Trap&#8208;Assisted Auger Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short&#8208;wave infrared single&#8208;mode laser is demonstrated based on PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), which exhibit low threshold and highly&#8208;stable performance owing to suppression of trap&#8208;assisted Auger recombination at supra&#8208;nanocrystalline level. PbS CQDs act as a gain medium where their trap states are electronically passivated by the donated electrons from ZnO nanocrystals.








Abstract
Pb&#8208;chalcogenide colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are attractive materials to be used as tuneable laser media across the infrared spectrum. However, excessive nonradiative Auger recombination due to the presence of trap states outcompetes light amplification by rapidly annihilating the exciton population, leading to high gain thresholds. Here, a binary blend is employed of CQDs and ZnO nanocrystals in order to passivate the in&#8208;gap trap states of PbS&#8208;CQD gain medium. Using transient absorption, a fivefold increase is measured in Auger lifetime demonstrating the suppression of trap&#8208;assisted Auger recombination. By doing so, a twofold reduction is achieved in amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold. Finally, by integrating the proposed binary blend to a distributed feedback (DFB) resonator, single&#8208;mode lasing emission is demonstrated at 1650&#160;nm with a linewidth of 1.23&#160;nm (0.62 meV), operating at a low lasing threshold of &#8776;385 &#956;J cm&#8211;2. The Auger suppression in this system has allowed to achieve unprecedented lasing emission stability for a CQD laser with recorded continuous operation of 5 h at room temperature and ambient conditions.

         <title>A Tri&#8208;Channel Oxide Transistor Concept for the Rapid Detection of Biomolecules Including the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed metal oxide heterojunction channel with a geometrically engineered tri&#8208;channel architecture several millimeters in size, is developed and used as a generic platform for robust, selective, and ultrasensitive detection of various biomolecules. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, selective sensing of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein down to attomolar concentrations in under 2 min is demonstrated.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state transistor sensors that can detect biomolecules in real time are highly attractive for emerging bioanalytical applications. However, combining upscalable manufacturing with the required performance remains challenging. Here, an alternative biosensor transistor concept is developed, which relies on a solution&#8208;processed In2O3/ZnO semiconducting heterojunction featuring a geometrically engineered tri&#8208;channel architecture for the rapid, real&#8208;time detection of important biomolecules. The sensor combines a high electron mobility channel, attributed to the electronic properties of the In2O3/ZnO heterointerface, in close proximity to a sensing surface featuring tethered analyte receptors. The unusual tri&#8208;channel design enables strong coupling between the buried electron channel and electrostatic perturbations occurring during receptor&#8211;analyte interactions allowing for robust, real&#8208;time detection of biomolecules down to attomolar (am) concentrations. The experimental findings are corroborated by extensive device simulations, highlighting the unique advantages of the heterojunction tri&#8208;channel design. By functionalizing the surface of the geometrically engineered channel with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) antibody receptors, real&#8208;time detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein down to am concentrations is demonstrated in under 2 min in physiological relevant conditions.
