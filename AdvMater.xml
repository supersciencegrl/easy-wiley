         <title>Morphology&#8208;Control Growth of Graphene Islands by Nonlinear Carbon Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling the morphology of graphene and other two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth is crucial because the morphology reflects the crystal quality of as&#8208;synthesized nanomaterials in a certain way, and consequently it indirectly represents the physical properties of 2D materials such as band gap, selective ion transportation, and impermeability. However, precise control of the morphology is limited by the complex formation mechanism and sensitive growth&#8208;environment factors of graphene. Therefore, the CVD synthesis of single&#8208;crystal hexagonal&#8208;shaped graphene islands with specific sizes is challenging. Herein, an unconventional nonlinear carbon supply growth strategy is proposed to realize controllable CVD growth of desired hexagonal graphene islands with specific sizes on Cu substrates. Large&#8208;area graphene films of isolated islands with desired densities, sizes, and distances between the islands were successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the direct growth of a planar&#8208;tunnel&#8208;junction structure based on two parallel gapped graphene islands was achieved by specific adjustment of the growth and etching processes of graphene CVD synthesis. We therefore demonstrated that the nonlinear carbon supply growth strategy is a reliable method for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene and can facilitate the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based nanodevices in the future.

         <title>Unraveling the Mechanisms of the Apis mellifera Honeycomb Construction by Four&#8208;Dimensional (4D) X&#8208;ray Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Honeycomb is one of nature's best engineered structures. Even though it has inspired several modern engineering structures, an understanding of the process by which the hexagonal cells are formed in 3D space is lacking. Previous studies on the structure of the honeycomb are based on either 2D microscopy or by direct visual observations. As a result, several critical features of its microstructure and the precise mechanisms of its growth are not well understood. Using 4D X&#8208;ray microscopy, this study shows, how individual and groups of honeycomb cells are formed. Cells grow additively from a corrugated central spine in a dynamic manner. The previously undocumented, corrugated spine contributes significantly to the comb's robust mechanical properties in all three dimensions. As cells grow, honey bees create a &#8220;coping&#8221;, which this study shows to be the location where new wax material is deposited behind which compaction and densification take place. This is exemplified by pores in the wax observed at the coping and alternating rear junctions between the comb cells that arise from the additive building technique and the highly efficient cell packing methodology, respectively. Additional mechanisms for growth and formation are discussed and described.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Membranes Prepared by Rapid Electrophoretic Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a disruptive material platform for various novel applications including nanofiltration for water purification due to their excellent physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the currently available approaches for preparing COF membranes need stringent synthesis conditions, prolonged fabrication time, and tedious post&#8208;processing, leading to poor productivity. Herein, we develop a simple and efficient layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking assembly strategy based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to rapidly generate ionic COF membranes due to the uniform driving force for nanosheet assembly. A new two&#8208;cell EPD design avoids the usual EPD problems such as bubbles and acidic/alkaline microenvironments in the near&#8208;electrode region in aqueous EPD processes. The ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures can be produced within several minutes. Consequently, the prepared COF membranes exhibit outstanding permselectivity and possess good stability and anti&#8208;pressure ability due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.

         <title>Magnetic Alignment for Plasmonic Control of Gold Nanorods Coated with Iron Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembly of spherical, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles on gold nanorods yields magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) that align in applied magnetic fields. Magnetic manipulation of the surface plasmon resonance of MagGNRs is comprehensively investigated through structural and optical characterization, and an analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment behavior. Dynamic alignment of MagGNRs is demonstrated in rotating magnetic fields.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles that can be manipulated with magnetic fields are of interest for advanced optical applications, diagnostics, imaging, and therapy. Alignment of gold nanorods yields strong polarization&#8208;dependent extinction, and use of magnetic fields is appealing because they act through space and can be quickly switched. In this work, cationic polyethyleneimine&#8208;functionalized superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are deposited on the surface of anionic gold nanorods coated with bovine serum albumin. The magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) obtained through mixing maintain the distinct optical properties of plasmonic gold nanorods that are minimally perturbed by the magnetic overcoating. Magnetic alignment of the MagGNRs arising from magnetic dipolar interactions on the anisotropic gold nanorod core is comprehensively characterized, including structural characterization and enhancement (suppression) of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance and suppression (enhancement) of the transverse surface plasmon resonance for light polarized parallel (orthogonal) to the magnetic field. The MagGNRs can also be driven in rotating magnetic fields to rotate at frequencies of at least 17&#160;Hz. For suitably large gold nanorods (148&#160;nm long) and Fe3O4 NPs (13.4&#160;nm diameter), significant alignment is possible even in modest (&lt;500&#160;Oe) magnetic fields. An analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment of MagGNRs.

         <title>A Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery&#8208;Type Self&#8208;Powered Pressure Sensor with Long Service Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc&#8208;ion battery (ZIB)&#160;pressuresensor where the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB is&#160;itself designed as a flexible pressure sensor has excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance, endowing it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs and ultrahigh stability. The sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.








Abstract
Accurate and continuous pressure signal detection without external power supply is a key technology to realize the miniaturization of wearable electronic equipment, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence. However, it is difficult to be achieved by using current sensor technologies. Here, a new one&#8208;body strategy, i.e., zinc&#8208;ion battery pressure (ZIB&#8208;P) sensor technology, which designs the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB itself as a flexible pressure sensor is reported. In the device, an isolation layer is introduced into the sandwich configuration solid&#8208;state battery to realize the change of device internal resistance by pressure during the transformation of the mechanical signal to the electrical signal. This battery pressure sensor possesses good flexibility, fast response/recovery time (76.0/88.0&#160;ms), stable long&#8208;term response, excellent cycle stability (100&#8239;000 times), and wide pressure detection range (2.0 to 3.68 &#215; 105&#160;Pa). Especially, the excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance in the ZIB&#8208;P sensor endows it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs (pulse, limb movement, etc.) and ultrahigh stability without degradation even under 100&#8239;000 times pressure stimulation. The ZIB&#8208;P sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.

         <title>Mechanically Induced Nanoscale Architecture Endows Titanium Carbide MXene Electrode with Integrated High Areal and Volumetric Capacitance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Complete utilization of electrochemically active materials while maintaining the high areal/volumetric packing density is a goal to be achieved in miniaturized supercapacitor devices, which therefore display both the high volumetric and areal energy density. Although critical, it is usually challenging to achieve this goal by optimizing the electrode architecture. Densely packing of active materials maximizes the volumetric capacitance whereas results in sluggish diffusion of electrolyte. Structurization of the electrode by forming large pores creates pathway for electrolyte penetration but reduces the volumetric energy density. Here we report densified electrodes with hierarchical porous architecture at nanoscale that provides an alternative solution. Worm&#8208;like expanded titanium carbide MXene powders are produced in highly viscous reaction media and assembled by mechanical compression. Expanded morphology of MXene powders translates into the buckling microstructure in electrodes, resulting in 28.2 &#177; 4.1% porosity mainly in the form of nanosized pores. At the sub&#8208;nanometer scale, the diffusion of electrolytes is enhanced in interlayer space of the bended lattice with pillared intercalants. These hierarchical structural features lead to both the high areal and volumetric capacitance (11.4 F cm&#8210;2 coupled with 770 F cm&#8210;3) in hundred&#8208;micrometres&#8208;thick electrodes, which inspires the design of high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage devices.

         <title>Implanting CoOx Clusters on Ordered Macroporous ZnO Nanoreactors for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite suffering from slow charge carrier mobility, photocatalysis is still an attractive and promising technology toward producing green fuels from solar energy. An effective approach is to design and fabricate advanced architectural materials as photocatalysts to enhance the performance of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Herein, metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (MOF)&#8208;derived hierarchically ordered porous nitrogen and carbon co&#8208;doped ZnO (N&#8208;C&#8208;ZnO) structures have been developed as nanoreactors with decorated CoOx nanoclusters for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion driven by visible light. Introduction of hierarchical nanoarchitectures with highly ordered interconnected meso&#8208;macroporous channels shows beneficial properties for photocatalytic reduction reactions, including enhanced mobility of charge carriers throughout the highly accessible framework, maximized exposure of active sites and inhibited recombination of photo&#8208;induced photons. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal the key role of CoOx nanoclusters with high affinity to CO2 molecules, and the Co&#8208;O bond formed on the surface of the composite exhibits stronger charge redistribution. As a result, the obtained CoOx/N&#8208;C&#8208;ZnO demonstrates enhanced photocatalysis performance in terms of high CO yield and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Wireless Miniature Magnetic Phase&#8208;Change Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed wireless miniature phase&#8208;change soft actuators exhibit enhancing output force and work capacity, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. This output performance enables the actuator to have the ability for angioplasty applications, locomotion in granular media, and programmable magnetic deformation, demonstrating its potential in medical and other robotic applications.








Abstract
Wireless miniature soft actuators are promising for various potential high&#8208;impact applications in medical, robotic grippers, and artificial muscles. However, these miniature soft actuators are currently constrained by a small output force and low work capacity. To address such challenges, a miniature magnetic phase&#8208;change soft composite actuator is reported. This soft actuator exhibits an expanding deformation and enables up to a 70&#160;N output force and 175.2&#160;J&#160;g&#8722;1 work capacity under remote magnetic radio frequency heating, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. To demonstrate its capabilities, a wireless soft robotic device is first designed that can withstand 0.24&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 fluid flows in an artery phantom. By integrating it with a thermally&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;memory polymer and bistable metamaterial sleeve, a wireless reversible bistable stent is designed toward future potential angioplasty applications. Moreover, it can additionally locomote inside and jump out of granular media. At last, the phase&#8208;change actuator can realize programmable bending deformations when a specifically designed magnetization profile is encoded, enhancing its shape&#8208;programming capability. Such a miniature soft actuator provides an approach to enhance the mechanical output and versatility of magnetic soft robots and devices, extending their medical and other potential applications.

         <title>Direct Exciton Harvesting from a Bound Triplet Pair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of using bound triplet pairs directly for electrical and chemical work is demonstrated. In support of this it is shown that triplet pairs can be directly harvested and&#160;that significant benefit in the achievable quantum efficiency is achieved by utilizing the triplet pair before annihilation processes occur.








Abstract
Singlet fission is commonly defined as the generation of two triplet excitons from a single absorbed photon. However, ambiguities within this definition arise due to the complexity of the various double triplet states that exist in SF chromophores and the corresponding interconversion processes. To clarify this process, singlet fission is frequently depicted as sequential two&#8208;step conversion in which a singlet exciton decays into a bound triplet&#8208;pair biexciton state that dissociates into two &#8220;free&#8221; triplet excitons. However, this model discounts the potential for direct harvesting from the coupled biexciton state. Here, it is demonstrated that individual triplet excitons can be extracted directly from a bound triplet pair. It is demonstrated that due to the requirement for geminate triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation in intramolecular singlet fission compounds, unique spectral and kinetic signatures can be used to quantify triplet&#8208;pair harvesting yields. An internal quantum efficiency for triplet exciton transfer from the triplet pair of &gt;50%, limited only by the solubility of the compounds is achieved. The harvesting process is not dependent on the net multiplicity of the triplet&#8208;pair state, suggesting that an explicit, independent dissociation step is not a requirement for using triplet pairs to do chemical or electrical work.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Zirconium&#8208;Based Perovskites for Large&#8208;Area and Ultra&#8208;Flexible X&#8208;Ray Scintillator Screens</title>

Abstract
Flexible scintillator screens with environmental stability, high sensitivity and low cost have emerged as candidates for X&#8208;ray imaging applications. Here, we demonstrated a large&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;efficient solution synthesis of vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite Cs2ZrCl6, which is characterized by thermal activation delay fluorescence (TADF) dominated by triplet emission under X&#8208;ray irradiation. The large Stokes shift and efficient luminescence collection of TADF effectively ensure the light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Further, flexible X&#8208;ray scintillator screens with an area of 400 cm2 were prepared using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the carrier, which exhibit excellent scintillation properties with light yields as high as 49&#8239;400 photons/MeV, spatial resolutions up to 18 lp/mm and detection limits as low as 65 nGy/s. Finally, we demonstrated the high&#8208;quality imaging results of non&#8208;planar and dynamic objects by such screens. We believe that the explored Cs2ZrCl6@PDMS flexible scintillator screens would offer a big step towards expanding the application range of scintillators in different environments.

Abstract
Endothelialization of vascular implants plays a vital role in maintaining the long&#8208;term vascular patency. In situ endothelialization and re&#8208;endothelialization is generally achieved by selectively promoting endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and, meanwhile, suppressing smooth muscle cell (SMC) adhesion. Currently, such EC versus SMC selectivity is achieved and extensively used in vascular&#8208;related biomaterials utilizing extra cellular matrix derived EC&#8208;selective peptides, dominantly REDV and YIGSR. Nevertheless, the application of EC&#8208;selective peptides is limited due to their easy proteolysis, time&#8208;consuming synthesis and expensiveness. To address these limitations, we report a polymeric strategy in designing and finding EC&#8208;selective biomaterials using amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;peptide polymers by tuning serum protein adsorption. The optimal &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer displays EC versus SMC selectivity even superior to EC&#8208;selective REDV peptide regarding the cell adhesion, proliferation and migration of EC versus SMC. Mechanism study indicates that surface adsorption of bovine serum albumin, an abundant and anti&#8208;adhesive serum protein, plays a critical role in the EC versus SMC selectivity of &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer. In addition, surface modification of the optimal &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer effectively promotes the endothelialization of vascular implants and inhibits intimal hyperplasia. This study provides an alternative strategy in designing and finding EC&#8208;selective biomaterials, implying great potential in the vascular&#8208;related biomaterial study and application.

&lt;p&gt;Endothelialization of vascular implants plays a vital role in maintaining the long-term vascular patency. In situ endothelialization and re-endothelialization is generally achieved by selectively promoting endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and, meanwhile, suppressing smooth muscle cell (SMC) adhesion. Currently, such EC versus SMC selectivity is achieved and extensively used in vascular-related biomaterials utilizing extra cellular matrix derived EC-selective peptides, dominantly REDV and YIGSR.

         <title>Polar Species for Effective Dielectric Regulation to Achieve High&#8208;Performance CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Non&#8208;radiative losses caused by defects are the main obstacles to further advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cell (PSC). There has been focused research to boost the device performance by reducing number of defects and deactivating defects; however, little attention has been paid to the defect&#8208;capture capacity. Here, upon systematically examining the defect&#8208;capture capacity, highly polarized fluorinated species were designed to modulate the dielectric properties of the perovskite material to minimize its defect&#8208;capture radius. On the one hand, fluorinated polar species strengthen the defect dielectric&#8208;screening effect via enhancing the dielectric constant of the perovskite film, thus reducing the defect&#8208;capture radius. On the other hand, the fluorinated iodized salt replenishes the I&#8208;vacancy defect at the surface, hence lowering the defect density. Consequently, the power&#8208;conversion efficiency of an all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 PSC is increased to as high as 20.5% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2&#160;V and a fill factor of 82.87%, all of which are among the highest in their respective categories. Furthermore, the fluorinated species modification also produces a hydrophobic umbrella yielding significantly improved humidity tolerance, and hence long&#8208;term stability. The present strategy provides a general approach to effectually regulate the defect&#8208;capture radius, thus enhancing the optoelectronic performance.

         <title>Mass Transfer Printing of Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Films and Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust transfer&#8208;printing method is developed using an ultrathin chemical bonding interfacial layer. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit similar performance as optimized spin&#8208;coated LEDs, and the transfer&#8208;printed nanostructure reaches a high resolution up to 1270 ppi. A white perovskite LED structure is finally demonstrated with laterally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes made by the multiple transfer&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Most methods of depositing perovskite films cannot meet the diverse requirements of real applications such as depositing films on various types of substrates, making patterns with different bandgaps for full&#8208;color display. Here, a robust mass transfer method of perovskite films and nanostructures is reported, meeting those requirements, by using an ultrathin branched polyethylenimine as interfacial chemical bonding layers. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite films exhibit comparable morphology, composition, optoelectronic properties, and device performances with the counterparts made by optimized spin&#8208;coating methods. The perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) using the transfer&#8208;printed films show decent external quantum efficiencies of 10.5% and 6.7% for red (680&#160;nm) and sky&#8208;blue (493&#160;nm) emissions, which are similar to the devices made by spin&#8208;coating. This robust transfer printing method also enables the the preparation of perovskite micropatterns with a high resolution up to 1270 pixels per inch. Horizontally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes are further obtained through multiple printing processes for white PeLEDs. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy for making perovskite films or micropatterns on various substrates for real applications in full&#8208;color display, white LEDs, lasing, etc.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Photoelectric Detection and Imaging Enhanced by the Pyro&#8208;Phototronic Effect Based on a Photoinduced Dynamic Schottky Effect in 4H&#8208;SiC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered 4H&#8208;SiC ultraviolet photodetector is realized using a strong photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect, and the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect is first revealed in N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC, which is beneficial to further enhance the photodetection performance. Moreover, via delicate position designs of electrodes, the 4H&#8208;SiC chip reveals efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities.








Abstract
Silicon carbide (SiC), one of the third&#8208;generation semiconductor materials with excellent electrical and optoelectronic properties, is ideal for high light&#8208;sensing performance. Here, a self&#8208;powered SiC ultraviolet (UV) photodetector (PD) is constructed with wider applicability and higher commercialization potential. The great performance of the PD is realized by a remarkable photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect derived from the symbiotic modulation of Schottky and Ohmic contact. Using the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect that exists in the N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC single crystal PDs, a fast pyroelectric response time of 0.27 s is achieved, which is almost ten times shorter than that obtained from the steady&#8208;state signal under UV illumination. The maximal transient photoresponsivity reaches 9.12 nA mW&#8722;1, which is &#8776;20% higher than the conventional photoelectric signal. Moreover, different regions of the 4H&#8208;SiC centimeter&#8208;scale chip output distinct signals under UV illumination, demonstrating efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities of this device. This work not only reveals the fundamental optoelectronic physics lying in this vital third&#8208;generation semiconductor, but also sheds light on its potential photosensing applications for large&#8208;scale commercialization.

         <title>Anode Catalysts in Anion&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Electrolysis without Supporting Electrolyte: Conductivity, Dynamics, and Ionomer Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reach the required scale for green hydrogen, it must be produced with efficient, low&#8208;capital&#8208;expense electrolyzers using non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group catalysts. In this work, oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts in pure&#8208;water anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer devices are studied. Processes causing device failure are illustrated, nano&#8208;Co3O4 is shown to be a viable catalyst, and design rules for engineering catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability are proposed.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) in principle operate without soluble electrolyte using earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and cell materials and thus lower the cost of green H2. Current systems lack competitive performance and the durability needed for commercialization. One critical issue is a poor understanding of catalyst&#8208;specific degradation processes in the electrolyzer. While non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (non&#8208;PGM) oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts show excellent performance and durability in strongly alkaline electrolyte, this has not transferred directly to pure&#8208;water AEMWEs. Here, AEMWEs with five non&#8208;PGM anode catalysts are built and the catalysts&#8217; structural stability and interactions with the alkaline ionomer are characterized during electrolyzer operation and post&#8208;mortem. The results show catalyst electrical conductivity is one key to obtaining high&#8208;performing systems and that many non&#8208;PGM catalysts restructure during operation. Dynamic Fe sites correlate with enhanced degradation rates, as does the addition of soluble Fe impurities. In contrast, electronically conductive Co3O4 nanoparticles (without Fe in the crystal structure) yield AEMWEs from simple, standard preparation methods, with performance and stability comparable to IrO2. These results reveal the fundamental dynamic catalytic processes resulting in AEMWE device failure under relevant conditions, demonstrate a viable non&#8208;PGM catalyst for AEMWE operation, and illustrate underlying design rules for engineering anode catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability.

Here, AEMWEs with five non-PGM anode catalysts are built and the catalysts&#8217; structural stability and interactions with the alkaline ionomer are characterized during electrolyzer operation and post-mortem. The results show catalyst electrical conductivity is one key to obtaining high-performing systems and that many non-PGM catalysts restructure during operation. Dynamic Fe sites correlate with enhanced degradation rates, as does the addition of soluble Fe impurities. In contrast, electronically conductive Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (without Fe in the crystal structure) yield AEMWEs from simple, standard preparation methods, with performance and stability comparable to IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These results reveal the fundamental dynamic catalytic processes resulting in AEMWE device failure under relevant conditions, demonstrate a viable non-PGM catalyst for AEMWE operation, and illustrate underlying design rules for engineering anode catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Volatile Organic Compound Sensing Array and Optoelectronic Filter System using Ion&#8208;Pairing Dyes with a Wide Visible Spectrum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief methodology to synthesize sensing materials (e.g., ion&#8208;paring dyes) with hydrophobicity, ease of color tunability, and a wide visible spectrum is suggested. This can simplify the sensing array, thereby producing a color map distinguishing functional groups as well as carbon chain lengths. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes will be extended to the electronic system promising the safety and health of the user.








Abstract
An ideal dye&#8208;based sensing array has essential design requirements, including facile preparation methodology, tolerance to water vapor, a broad range of color&#8208;responsive changes, and a simple readout system. Here, a brief synthetic route is developed for ion&#8208;pairing dyes exhibiting unusual chromatic changes across the entire visible spectrum. It requires only mixing and precipitation under mild conditions. The dyes are applied to a sensing array containing 12 sensing elements with different initial states. Owing to the numerous color variations of the dyes, the color map generated by the array is highly simple yet sufficiently accurate to distinguish among the different functional groups (such as amines, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) as well as carbon chain lengths. Principle component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be well classified according to the color changes of the sensing array. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes are embedded into&#160;3D&#160;stacked nanofibers via electrospinning, and function as effective harmful&#8208;gas (e.g., formaldehyde) sensors with sub&#8208;ppm theoretical detection limits (0.15&#160;ppm). Finally, the 3D stacked nanofibers can be employed in an optoelectronic filter system that automatically checks for formaldehyde in the surroundings and also confirms the effective removal of the detected formaldehyde by the gas filter cartridge.

         <title>Photoactivatable Silencing Extracellular Vesicle (PASEV) Sensitizes Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle is developed, which not only serves as a nanocarrier for packaging, tumor accumulation, and intracellular release of small interfering RNA against p21&#8208;activated kinase 4 to boost intratumoral&#160;immune infiltration, but also is able to initiate antitumor immunity through immunogenic phototherapy. The combined immunotherapy between boosted immune infiltration and immune activation elicits superior antitumor outcome.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has delivered impressive outcomes in combating tumor malignancies. However, insufficient immune infiltration and poor immunogenicity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) greatly compromise patient response rates. Here, a photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle (PASEV) is developed for sensitized cancer immunotherapy. p21&#8208;Activated kinase 4 (PAK4) is a newly identified tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;intrinsic &#8220;guard&#8221; associated with immune exclusion. Small interfering RNA against PAK4 (siPAK4) is designed and assembled with a photoactivatable reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer to form the nanocomplex core, which is further camouflaged by extracellular vesicles from M1 macrophages. The PASEV not only serves as a vehicle for packaging, tumor accumulation, and ROS&#8208;responsive release of siPAK4 for potent PAK4 silencing, but also primes the TME through immunogenic phototherapy, thereby simultaneously boosting intratumoral infiltration and immune activation. The combined immunotherapy elicits robust anticancer immunity, thus showing great promise for fighting cancers. This work opens a new avenue to simultaneously boost intratumoral infiltration and immune activation for sensitized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectric Resonant Tunneling Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors under external voltage in perovskite oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 quantum&#8208;well structures are reported. The NDR ratio can be modified by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the polarization states of the ferroelectric barrier, and a large OFF/ON resistance ratio up to 23 000 is obtained.








Abstract
Resonant tunneling is a quantum&#8208;mechanical effect in which electron transport is controlled by the discrete energy levels within a quantum&#8208;well (QW) structure. A ferroelectric resonant tunneling diode (RTD) exploits the switchable electric polarization state of the QW barrier to tune the device resistance. Here, the discovery of robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric&#8208;modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors in all&#8208;perovskite&#8208;oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 QW structures is reported. The resonant current amplitude and voltage are tunable by the switchable polarization of the BaTiO3 ferroelectric with the NDR ratio modulated by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude and an OFF/ON resistance ratio exceeding a factor of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;104. The observed NDR effect is explained an energy bandgap between Ru&#8208;t2g and Ru&#8208;eg orbitals driven by electron&#8211;electron correlations, as follows from density functional theory calculations. This study paves the way for ferroelectric&#8208;based quantum&#8208;tunneling devices in future oxide electronics.

         <title>Excimer Formation in the Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals 2D Semiconductor Bi2O2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excimer formation is unambiguously demonstrated in non&#8208;van der Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se via transient absorption spectroscopy. The excimer in Bi2O2Se nanosheets is diffusive and its formation can be described as excitons relax to an excimer geometry driven by the ultrafast photoscreening of the intrinsic built&#8208;in dipolar electric field.








Abstract
The layered semiconductor Bi2O2Se is a promising new&#8208;type 2D material that holds layered structure via electrostatic forces instead of van der Waals (vdW) attractions. Aside from the huge success in device performance, the non&#8208;vdW nature in Bi2O2Se with a built&#8208;in interlayer electric field has also provided an appealing platform for investigating unique photoexcited carrier dynamics. Here, experimental evidence for the observation of excimers in multilayer Bi2O2Se nanosheets via transient absorption spectroscopy is presented. It is found that the excimer formation is the primary decay pathway of photoexcited excitons and three&#8208;stage excimer dynamics with corresponding time scales are established. Excitation&#8208;fluence&#8208;dependent excimer dynamics further suggest that the excimer is diffusive and its formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work indicates the outstanding promise of unique excitonic processes in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device designs.

         <title>Instantaneous High&#8208;Resolution Visual Imaging of Latent Fingerprints in Water Using Color&#8208;Tunable AIE Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The instantaneous visualization of latent fingerprints (LFPs) is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water under UV light or ambient sunlight. Remarkably, LFPs can be visualized within seconds including details at the Level 3, shedding light on the potential security protection and criminal investigation in various scenarios.








Abstract
Instant visualization of latent fingerprints is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water, under UV light or ambient sunlight. By simply soaking, or spraying with an aqueous solution of the probe, bright yellow fluorescence images with high contrast and resolution are readily developed on various surfaces including tinfoil, glass, paper, steel, leather, and ceramic tile. Remarkably, latent fingerprints can be visualized within seconds including details of whorl and sweat pores. The color of emission can be tuned from blue to orange by modifying the pincer ligands, allowing direct imaging under sunlight. These inexpensive, water&#8208;resistant, and color&#8208;tunable probes provide a practical approach for latent fingerprints recording and analysis, security protection, as well as criminal investigation in different scenarios.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Magnetoactive and Electro&#8211;Ionic Soft Actuator Derived from a Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuator is presented by an engineering of unprecedented nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF). It can nurture the complex motion for relevant robotic interaction. The magneto&#8211;electro&#8208;ionic soft actuator obtained from the newly developed Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived active material is successfully utilized to demonstrate hovering motion of a hummingbird robot under magnetic and electrical stimuli.








Abstract
There is growing demand for multiresponsive soft actuators for the realization of natural, safe, and complex motions in robotic interactions. In particular, soft actuators simultaneously stimulated by electrical and magnetic fields are always under development owing to their simple controllability and reliability during operation. Herein, magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuators (MESAs) derived from novel nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C), are reported. Nanoscale Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C has excellent electrochemical and magnetic properties that allow it to be used as a multifunctional material under both magnetoactive and electro&#8208;ionic actuations. The dual&#8208;responsive MESA exhibits a bending displacement of 30&#160;mm and an ultrafast rising time of 1.5 s under a very low input voltage of 1&#160;V and also exerts a bending deflection of 12.5&#160;mm at 50 mT under a high excitation frequency of 5&#160;Hz. By utilizing a dual&#8208;responsive MESA, the hovering motion of a hummingbird robot is demonstrated under magnetic and electrical stimuli.

         <title>Semicrystalline Conjugated Polymers with Well&#8208;Defined Active Sites for Nitrogen Fixation in a Seawater Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface is well constructed by introducing a suitable semicrystalline structure in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers to significantly boost the nitrogen reduction reaction with a high Faradaic efficiency of 60.5% and a maximum NH3 yield rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte.








Abstract
Faradaic efficiency for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is often limited by low N2 solubility in the electrolyte, while a large number of intimate contacts between the electrolyte and solid catalyst can also inevitably sacrifice many active sites for the NRR. Here, it is reported that a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface formed in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers (CPs) is beneficial to boosting the NRR process and at the same time suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Of particular interest, it is found that a semicrystalline CP catalyst, SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT, exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of up to 60.5% with a maximum NH3 production rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte. Molecular dynamics and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations reveal the origin of the observed high NRR performance arising from the presence of desirable crystal regions to resist the penetration of H2O molecules, leading to the formation of a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface inside the catalyst for a favorable direct&#8208;contact between the catalyst and N2 molecules. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput computations, based on density functional theory, reveal the actual real active site for N2 adsorption and reduction in SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT. This work provides a new framework for optimizing NRR performance of metal&#8208;free catalysts by controlling their crystallinities.

         <title>Endocytosis&#8208;Independent and Cancer&#8208;Selective Cytosolic Protein Delivery via Reversible Tagging with LAT1 substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pro&#8208;protein approach is developed based on reversible tagging with l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) substrate, which enables carrier&#8208;free, cancer&#8208;selective, and endocytosis&#8208;independent cytosolic delivery via LAT1&#8208;mediated direct transport. It demonstrates high generality and robust efficiency for varieties of functional proteins, including enzymes, toxins, antibodies, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein. This facile and versatile platform holds transformative potentials in protein pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Protein drugs targeting intracellular machineries have shown profound therapeutic potentials, but their clinical utilities are greatly hampered by the lack of efficient cytosolic delivery techniques. Existing strategies mainly rely on nanocarriers or conjugated cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), which often have drawbacks such as materials complexity/toxicity, lack of cell specificity, and endolysosomal entrapment. Herein, a unique carrier&#8208;free approach is reported for mediating cancer&#8208;selective and endocytosis&#8208;free cytosolic protein delivery. Proteins are sequentially modified with 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 4&#8208;(4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzyl carbonate as the H2O2&#8208;responsive domain and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine as the substrate of l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). Thus, the pro&#8208;protein can be directly transported into tumor cells by overexpressed LAT1 on cell membranes, bypassing endocytosis and endolysosomal entrapment. In the cytosol, overproduced H2O2 restores the protein structure and activity. Using this technique, versatile proteins are delivered into tumor cells with robust efficiency, including toxins, enzymes, CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, and antibodies. Furthermore, intravenously injected pro&#8208;protein of saporin shows potent anticancer efficacy in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, without provoking systemic toxicity. Such a facile and versatile pro&#8208;protein platform may benefit the development of protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Multiscale Functional Metal Architectures by Antibody&#8208;Guided Metallization of Specific Protein Assemblies in Ex Vivo Multicellular Organisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of metallic structures mimicking the specific protein assemblies in multicellular organisms, such as human cells and animal tissue, is demonstrated via antibody&#8211;antigen interactions and electroless deposition. This work enables the use of diverse protein structures that are arranged in unique 3D geometries optimized for certain functions as scaffolds for biotemplating.








Abstract
Biological systems consist of hierarchical protein structures, each of which has unique 3D&#160;geometries optimized for specific functions. In the past decades, the growth of inorganic materials on specific proteins has attracted considerable attention.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of metallic structures mimicking the specific protein assemblies in multicellular organisms, such as human cells and animal tissue, is demonstrated via antibody&#8211;antigen interactions and electroless deposition. This work enables the use of diverse protein structures that are arranged in unique 3D geometries optimized for certain functions as scaffolds for biotemplating.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological systems consist of hierarchical protein structures, each of which has unique 3D&#160;geometries optimized for specific functions. In the past decades, the growth of inorganic materials on specific proteins has attracted considerable attention. However, the use of specific proteins as templates has only been demonstrated in relatively simple organisms, such as viruses, limiting the range of structures that can be used as scaffolds. This study proposes a method for synthesizing metallic structures that resemble the 3D assemblies of specific proteins in mammalian cells and animal tissues. Using 1.4 nm nanogold-conjugated antibodies, specific proteins within cells and ex vivo tissues are labeled, and then the nanogold acts as nucleation sites for growth of metal particles. As proof of concept, various metal particles are grown using microtubules in cells as templates. The metal-containing cells are applied as catalysts and show catalytic stability in liquid-phase reactions due to the rigid support provided by the microtubules. Finally, this method is used to produce metal structures that replicate the specific protein assemblies of neurons in the mouse brain or the extracellular matrices in the mouse kidney and heart. This new biotemplating approach can facilitate the conversion of specific protein structures into metallic forms in ex vivo multicellular organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of 2D Molybdenum Phosphide via Surface&#8208;Confined Atomic Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology and tunable crystallinity can be prepared from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface&#8208;confined atomic substitution. In contrast to the well&#8208;documented edge&#8208;dominated electrocatalytic performance of the MoS2 precusor, the entire basal plane of MoP demonstrates satisfying electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance owing to its coordination&#8208;unsaturated surface atoms with abundant dangling bonds.








Abstract
The emerging nonlayered 2D materials (NL2DMs) are sparking immense interest due to their fascinating physicochemical properties and enhanced performance in many applications. NL2DMs are particularly favored in catalytic applications owing to the extremely large surface area and low&#8208;coordinated surface atoms. However, the synthesis of NL2DMs is complex because their crystals are held together by strong isotropic covalent bonds. Here, nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology is synthesized from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface&#8208;confined atomic substitution. During the synthesis, the molybdenum dichalcogenide nanosheet&#160;functions as the host matrix where each layer of Mo maintains their hexagonal arrangement and forms isotropic covalent bonds with P that substitutes S, resulting in the conversion from layered van der Waals material to a covalently bonded NL2DM. The MoP nanosheets converted from few&#8208;layer MoS2 are single crystalline, while those converted from monolayers are amorphous. The converted MoP demonstrates metallic charge transport and desirable performance in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). More importantly, in contrast to MoS2, which shows edge&#8208;dominated HER performance, the edge and basal plane of MoP deliver similar HER performance, which is correlated with theoretical calculations. This work provides a new synthetic strategy for high&#8208;quality nonlayered materials with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology for future exploration.

         <title>The Energy Level Conundrum of Organic Semiconductors in Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photovoltaic gap measured by ultraviolet and low&#8208;energy photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS/LE&#8208;IPES) gives the best correlation to device properties, enabling the prediction of maximum Voc. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)&#8208;derived redox potentials are less meaningful for predicting the energetic landscape at the &#8220;donor&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;acceptor&#8221; interface.








Abstract
The frontier molecular energy levels of organic semiconductors are decisive for their fundamental function and efficiency in optoelectronics. However, the precise determination of these energy levels and their variation when using different techniques makes it hard to compare and establish design rules. In this work, the energy levels of 33 organic semiconductors via cyclic voltammetry (CV), density functional theory, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and low&#8208;energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy are determined. Solar cells are fabricated to obtain key device parameters and relate them to the significant differences in the energy levels and offsets obtained from different methods. In contrast to CV, the photovoltaic gap measured using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) correlates well with the experimental device VOC. It is demonstrated that high&#8208;performing systems such as PM6:Y6 and WF3F:Y6, which are previously reported to have negligible ionization energy (IE) offsets (&#916;IE), possess sizable &#916;IE of &#8776;0.5&#160;eV, determined by PES. Using various D&#8211;A blends, it is demonstrated that &#916;IE plays a key role in charge generation. In contrast to earlier reports, it is shown that a vanishing &#916;IE is detrimental to device performance. Overall, these findings establish a solid base for reliably evaluating material energetics and interpreting property&#8211;performance relationships in organic solar cells.

         <title>Emergent Magnetic Fan Structures in Manganite Homojunction Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese oxide homojunctions with gradually modulated doping level host surprisingly complex, long&#8208;range ordered magnetic superstructures whose spin alignment is tunable by low magnetic fields. Homojunctions can thus serve as a powerful design element of all&#8208;oxide spintronic devices.








Abstract
Devices with tunable magnetic noncollinearity are important components of superconducting electronics and spintronics, but they typically require epitaxial integration of several complex materials. The spin&#8208;polarized neutron reflectometry measurements on La1&#8722;xSrxMnO3 homojunction arrays with modulated Sr concentration reported herein have led to the discovery of magnetic fan structures with highly noncollinear alignment of Mn spins and an emergent periodicity twice as large as the array's unit cell. The neutron data show that these magnetic superstructures can be fully long&#8208;range ordered, despite the gradual modulation of the doping level created by charge transfer and chemical intermixing. The degree of noncollinearity can be effectively adjusted by low magnetic fields. Notwithstanding their chemical and structural simplicity, oxide homojunctions thus show considerable promise as a platform for tunable complex magnetism and as a powerful design element of spintronic&#160;devices.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline Perovskite p&#8211;n Junction Nanowire Arrays for Ultrasensitive Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of ultrasensitive photodetectors is demonstrated with single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays. The high crystallinity of the nanowire arrays enables efficient carrier transport and the formation of the built&#8208;in electric field in the p&#8211;n junction facilitates effective carrier separation. The photodetectors show excellent sensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with outstanding responsivities.








Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors play significant roles in modern optoelectronic integrated circuits. Constructing p&#8211;n junctions has been proven to be a particularly powerful approach to realizing sensitive photodetection due to their efficient carrier separation. Recently, p&#8211;n&#8208;junction photodetectors based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, which combine favorable optoelectronic performance with facile processability, hold great potential in practical applications. So far, these devices have generally been made of polycrystalline films, which exhibit poor carrier&#8208;transport efficiency, impeding the further improvement of their photoresponsivities. Here, a type of ultrasensitive photodetector based on single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays is demonstrated. The single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays not only possess high crystallinity that enables efficient carrier transport but also form a built&#8208;in electric field facilitating effective carrier separation. As a result, the devices show excellent photosensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with an outstanding responsivity of 2.65&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 532&#160;nm. These results will provide new insights into the design and construction of high&#8208;performance photodetectors for practical optoelectronic applications.

These results will provide new insights into the design and construction of high-performance photodetectors for practical optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exposing Single Ni Atoms in Hollow S/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni single atoms embedded S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) are fabricated through pyrolysis of rationally designed CdS&#8208;NiSx@PAN composite fibers. Benefiting from the abundant exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The development of efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for clean energy and fuel conversion. Herein, the facile preparation of Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) as efficient catalysts for OER through pyrolysis of designed CdS&#8208;NiSx/polyacrylonitrile composite fibers is reported. Specifically, CdS provides the sulfur source for the doping of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;derived carbon matrix and simultaneously creates the hollow macroporous structure, while NiSx is first reduced to nanoparticles and finally evolves into single Ni atoms through the atom migration&#8208;trapping strategy. Benefiting from the abundantly exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalysts deliver outstanding activity and stability for OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 285&#160;mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 50.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.

         <title>Experimental Realization of Atomic Monolayer Si9C15</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Si9C15 monolayer is fabricated on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates via the reaction between Si and graphene under high temperatures. The as&#8208;grown Si9C15 layer is micrometer&#8208;scale, high quality, and single crystalline with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9 eV. Combined measurements and density functional calculations confirm the buckled honeycomb structure. The novel 2D material also shows good air stability.








Abstract
Monolayer SixCy constitutes an important family of&#160;2D&#160;materials that is predicted to feature a honeycomb structure and appreciable bandgaps. However, due to its binary chemical nature and the lack of bulk polymorphs with a layered structure, the fabrication of such materials has so far been challenging. Here, the synthesis of atomic monolayer Si9C15 on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates is reported. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to infer that the 2D lattice of Si9C15 is a buckled honeycomb structure. Monolayer Si9C15 shows semiconducting behavior with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9&#160;eV. Remarkably, the Si9C15 lattice remains intact after exposure to ambient conditions, indicating good air stability. The present work expands the 2D&#8208;materials library and provides a promising platform for future studies in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.

         <title>SrTiO3/CuNi&#8208;Heterostructure&#8208;Based Thermopile for Sensitive Human Radiation Detection and Noncontact Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
SrTiO3/CuNi heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile, characterized by the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, exhibits high sensitivity to human radiation. Further integration of human radiation into a noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction system is experimentally demonstrated, and the real&#8208;time recognition of hand gestures and touchless input of Arabic numbers and English letters are implemented.








Abstract
Noncontact interactive technology provides an intelligent solution to mitigate public health risks from cross&#8208;infection in the era of COVID&#8208;19. The utilization of human radiation as a stimulus source is conducive to the implementation of low&#8208;power, robust noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction. However, the low radiation intensity emitted by humans puts forward a high demand for photodetection performance. Here, a SrTiO3&#8722;x/CuNi&#8208;heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile is constructed, which features the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, to realize the self&#8208;powered detection of human radiation. The response level of this thermopile to human radiation is orders of magnitude higher than those of low&#8208;dimensional&#8208;materials&#8208;based photothermoelectric detectors and even commercial thermopiles. Furthermore, a touchless input device based on the thermopile array is developed, which can recognize hand gestures, numbers, and letters in real&#8208;time. This work offers a reliable strategy to integrate the spontaneous human radiation into noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction systems.

         <title>Percolated Plasmonic Superlattices of Nanospheres with 1 nm&#8208;Level Gap as High&#8208;Index Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroligand gold nanoparticles are stable in an oil phase but can be switched to stable Janus particles at the interface, which forms a 2D superlattice over square centimeters with nanometer&#8208;precision particle&#8208;to&#8208;particle gap. The percolated 2D superstructure exhibits the highest&#8208;ever refractive index (&#8776;7.8) on varying the size and interparticle gap of the NPs, which is explained by a new theoretical model based on &#8220;plasmonic percolation.&#8221;








Abstract
Nanophotonics relies on precise control of refractive index (RI) which can be designed with metamaterials. Plasmonic superstructures of nanoparticles (NPs) can suggest a versatile way of tuning RI. However, the plasmonic effects in the superstructures demand 1 nm&#8208;level exquisite control over the interparticle gap, which is challenging in a sub&#8208;wavelength NPs. Thus far, a large&#8208;area demonstration has been mostly discouraged. Here, heteroligand AuNPs are prepared, which are stable in oil but become Janus particles at the oil&#8211;water interface, called &#8220;adaptive Janus particles.&#8221; NPs are bound at the interface and assembled into 2D arrays over square centimeters as toluene evaporates, which distinctively exhibits the RI tunability. In visible and NIR light, the 2D superstructures exhibit the highest&#8208;ever RI (&#8776;7.8) with varying the size and interparticle gap of NPs, which is successfully explained by a plasmonic percolation model. Furthermore, fully solution&#8208;processable 2D plasmonic superstructures are proved to be advantageous in flexible photonic devices such as distributed Bragg reflectors.

         <title>Robust Piezoelectricity with Spontaneous Polarization in Monolayer Tellurene and Multilayer Tellurium Film at Room Temperature for Reliable Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust piezoelectricity with spontaneous polarization is detected in tellurene at room temperature due to the strong anisotropic property and dipoles induced by unique charity helical chain structure and strong intramolecular interactions. A charming memory window and high on switching current are realized in tellurene&#8208;based memory, providing a new platform to construct robust memory cells for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Robust neuromorphic computing in the Big Data era calls for long&#8208;term stable crossbar&#8208;array memory cells; however, the elemental segregation in the switch unit and memory unit that inevitably occurs upon cycling breaks the compositional and structural stability, making the whole memory cell a failure. Searching for a novel material without segregation that can be used for both switch and memory units is the major concern to fabricate robust and reliable nonvolatile cross&#8208;array memory cells. Tellurium (Te) is found recently to be the only peculiar material without segregation for switching, but the memory function has not been demonstrated yet. Herein, apparent piezoelectricity is experimentally confirmed with spontaneous polarization behaviors in elementary 2D Te, even in monolayer tellurene (0.4&#160;nm), due to the highly oriented polarization of the molecular structure and the non&#8208;centrosymmetric lattice structure. A large memory window of 7000, a low working voltage of 2&#160;V, and high on switching current up to 36.6 &#181;A&#8201;&#181;m&#8722;1 are achieved in the as&#8208;fabricated Te&#8208;based memory device, revealing the great promise of Te for both switching and memory units in one cell without segregation. The piezoelectric Te with spontaneous polarization provides a platform to build robust, reliable, and high&#8208;density logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory chips in neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Rapid Ultratough Topological Tissue Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving tough adhesion in wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. It is shown that combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix can achieve ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000 J m&#8722;2) without covalent bond formation. These properties open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving strong and tough adhesion in permeable wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. However, adhesion generated through covalent bond formation directly with the functional groups of tissues (i.e., &#63743;COOH and &#63743;NH2&#160;groups in collagen), or using non&#8208;covalent interactions can both be limited by weak, unstable, or slow adhesion. Here, it is shown that by combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix one can achieve unprecedented ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) in 5&#8211;10&#160;min without covalent bond formation. The strong non&#8208;covalent adhesion is shown to be stable under physiologically relevant conditions and strongly influenced by chitosan molecular weight, molecular weight of polymers in the matrix, and pH. The adhesion mechanism relies primarily on the topological entanglement between the chitosan chains and the permeable adherends. To further expand the applicability of the adhesives, adhesion time can be decreased by dehydrating the hydrogel matrix to facilitate rapid chitosan interpenetration and entanglement (&gt;1000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;in &#8804;1&#160;min). The unprecedented adhesive properties presented in this study open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives and numerous bioapplications.

         <title>Convection Driven Ultrarapid Protein Detection via Nanobody&#8208;Functionalized Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) at the sample incubation step accelerates the operation of an organic&#8208;electrochemical&#8208;transistor&#8208;based protein sensor with a limit of detection at the attomolar range. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits a sample&#8208;to&#8208;result time of 2 min, with better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation.








Abstract
Conventional biosensors rely on the diffusion&#8208;dominated transport of the target analyte to the sensor surface. Consequently, they require an incubation step that may take several hours to allow for the capture of analyte molecules by sensor biorecognition sites. This incubation step is a primary cause of long sample&#8208;to&#8208;result times. Here, alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) is integrated in an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)&#8208;based sensor to accelerate the device operation. ACET is applied to the gate electrode functionalized with nanobody&#8211;SpyCatcher fusion proteins. Using the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein in human saliva as an example target, it is shown that ACET enables protein recognition within only 2 min of sample exposure, supporting its use in clinical practice. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation. The performance of ACET integrated sensors is compared with two types of organic semiconductors in the channel and grounds for device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations are investigated. The results provide guidelines for the channel material choice in OECT&#8208;based biochemical sensors, and demonstrate that ACET integration substantially decreases the detection speed while increasing the sensitivity and selectivity of transistor&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Light&#8208;Soaking in MAPbI3: The Effect of H2O</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced photodamage and consequent self&#8208;healing inside MAPbI3 single crystals are investigated. Two photobrightening and one photodarkening process are identified,&#160;which&#160;are connected to trap&#8208;filling, methylamine&#8208;chemistry, and the lead&#8208;halide sublattice. H2O is&#160;found&#160;to&#160;strongly influence the overall photodamage and kinetics of the self&#8208;healing process, showing an important connection between self&#8208;healing and the presence of H2O. 








Abstract
The future of halide perovskites (HaPs) is beclouded by limited understanding of their long&#8208;term stability. While HaPs can be altered by radiation that induces multiple processes, they can also return to their original state by &#8220;self&#8208;healing.&#8221; Here two&#8208;photon (2P) absorption is used to effect light&#8208;induced modifications within MAPbI3 single crystals. Then the changes in the photodamaged region are followed by measuring the photoluminescence, from 2P absorption with 2.5&#160;orders of magnitude lower intensity than that used for photodamaging the MAPbI3. After photodamage, two brightening and one darkening process are found, all of which recover but on different timescales. The first two are attributed to trap&#8208;filling (the fastest) and to proton&#8208;amine&#8208;related chemistry (the slowest), while photodamage is attributed to the lead&#8208;iodide sublattice. Surprisingly, while after 2P&#8208;irradiation of crystals that are stored in dry, inert ambient, photobrightening (or &#8220;light&#8208;soaking&#8221;) occurs, mostly photodarkening is seen after photodamage in humid ambient, showing an important connection between the self&#8208;healing of a HaP and the presence of H2O, for long&#8208;term steady&#8208;state illumination, practically no difference remains between samples kept in dry or humid environments. This result suggests that photobrightening requires a chemical&#8208;reservoir that is sensitive to the presence of H2O, or possibly other proton&#8208;related, particularly amine, chemistry.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
While neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations, the accuracy needs improvement by reducing the randomness of memristive behavior. The controlled formation of conduction channels is shown here, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. The results suggest an effective route for controlling the otherwise random electroforming process.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations than conventional digital computers for artificial intelligence (AI). However, its current accuracy is generally less than the dominant software&#8208;based AI. The key to improving accuracy is to reduce the intrinsic randomness of memristive devices, emulating synapses in the brain for neuromorphic computing. Here using a planar device as a model system, the controlled formation of conduction channels is achieved with high oxygen vacancy concentrations through the design of sharp protrusions in the electrode gap, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. Classical molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the controlled formation of conduction channels arises from confinement of the electric field, yielding a reproducible spatial distribution of oxygen vacancies across switching cycles. This work demonstrates an effective route to control the otherwise random electroforming process by electrode design, facilitating the development of more accurate memristive devices for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Ultrafine Silver Nanoparticle Encapsulated Porous Molecular Traps for Discriminative Photoelectrochemical Detection of Mustard Gas Simulants by Synergistic Size&#8208;Exclusion and Site&#8208;Specific Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process affords nanocomposite materials comprising sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) encapsulated in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic framework materials, the AgNPs@HOFs exhibit significantly enhanced photocurrent. A portable photoelectrochemical (PEC) device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 detects chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants with both nanomolar sensitivity and excellent selectivity.








Abstract
The rapid, discriminative, and portable detection of highly toxic chemical warfare agents is extremely important for response to public security emergencies but remains a challenge. One plausible solution involves the integration of porous molecular traps onto a photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor. Here, a fast and facile protocol is developed to fabricate sub&#8208;1&#160;nm AgNPs encapsulated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanocomposite materials through an in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process. Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) materials, these AgNPs@HOFs show significantly enhanced photocurrent. Most importantly, the portable PEC device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 can selectively recognize 13 different mustard gas simulants, including 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), based on synergistic size&#8208;exclusion and specific recognition. The extremely low detection limit for CEES (15.8&#160;nmol L&#8722;1), reusability (at least 30 cycles), and long&#8208;term working stability (at least 30 d) of the portable PEC device warrant its use as a chemical warfare agents (CWAs) sensor in practical field settings. More broadly, this work indicates that integrating porous molecular traps onto PEC sensors offers a promising strategy to further develop portable devices for CWAs detection with both ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity.

         <title>A New Polymer Donor Enables Binary All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells with 18% Efficiency and Excellent Mechanical Robustness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational molecular design, a polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed. Optimal power conversion efficiencies of 18.0% and 16.5% are achieved in rigid and flexible all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells, respectively. This work demonstrates that PQM&#8208;Cl is a promising polymer donor and the design of new polymer donors is essential for further improving the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.








Abstract
The development of polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors has boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells to 17%. However, the polymer donors suitable for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells are still lacking, restricting the further improvement of their PCEs. Herein, a new polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed and its photovoltaic performance is explored. The negative electrostatic potential and low average local ionization energy distribution of the PQM&#8208;Cl surface enable efficient charge generation and transfer process. When blending with a well&#8208;used polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;IT, the PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based devices deliver an impressive PCE of 18.0% with a superior fill factor of 80.7%, both of which are the highest values for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells. The relevant measurements demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based films possess excellent mechanical and flexible properties. As such, PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based flexible photovoltaic cells are fabricated and an excellent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability is displayed. These results demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl is a potential candidate for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells and provide insights into the design of polymer donors for high&#8208;efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

Organic Semiconductors
In article number 2202575, Anirudh Sharma, Derya Baran, and co&#8208;workers unravel the inconsistencies of the determination of the absolute energy levels in organic semiconductors and their implication, particularly in the field of organic solar cells. In the cover image, the charges generated by the excitation of the materials by light are represented by the energy balls with feet and hands: electrons are represented in green and holes in red. The charges are jumping down a staircase, representing the energy levels of different organic semiconductor materials.

Bismuth Oxyselenide
Novel photoinduced quasiparticles, excimers, in the non&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se are unambiguously by Jianbo Hu and co&#8208;workers in article number 2204227, identified through analyzing the emerging dynamic features by transient absorption spectra. Excimers in the Bi2O2Se nanosheets are diffusive and their formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work advances the fundamental understanding of carrier dynamics in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device design.

         <title>Toward Practical High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Pouch Cells: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells are cpomprehensively reviewed regarding the key design parameters, the current performances, and recent advances on failure analysis and promotion strategies on cathode, electrolyte, and anode.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries promise great potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Evaluation and analysis on practical Li&#8211;S pouch cells are essential for achieving actual high energy density under working conditions and affording developing directions for practical applications. This review aims to afford a comprehensive overview of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S pouch cells regarding 7&#160;years of development and to point out further research directions. Key design parameters to achieve actual high energy density are addressed first, to define the research boundaries distinguished from coin&#8208;cell&#8208;level evaluation. Systematic analysis of the published literature and cutting&#8208;edge performances is then conducted to demonstrate the achieved progress and the gap toward practical applications. Following that, failure analysis as well as promotion strategies at the pouch cell level are, respectively, discussed to reveal the unique working and failure mechanism that shall be accordingly addressed. Finally, perspectives toward high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S pouch cells are presented regarding the challenges and opportunities of this field.

This review aims to afford a comprehensive overview of high-energy-density Li&#8211;S pouch cells regarding 7&#160;years of development and to point out further research directions. Key design parameters to achieve actual high energy density are addressed first, to define the research boundaries distinguished from coin-cell-level evaluation. Systematic analysis of the published literature and cutting-edge performances is then conducted to demonstrate the achieved progress and the gap toward practical applications. Following that, failure analysis as well as promotion strategies at the pouch cell level are, respectively, discussed to reveal the unique working and failure mechanism that shall be accordingly addressed. Finally, perspectives toward high-performance Li&#8211;S pouch cells are presented regarding the challenges and opportunities of this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Nanomedicine for the Treatment of Ischemic Heart Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current developments, achievements, challenges, and future directions of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging nanomedicine for the treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD), as well as their risk factors, are reviewed. The properties, generation, and physiological roles of ROS in the process of IHD development and progression are discussed.








Abstract
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play key roles in the progression of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, which are independent risk factors that lead to atherosclerosis and the development of IHD. Engineered biomaterial&#8208;based nanomedicines are under extensive investigation and exploration, serving as smart and multifunctional nanocarriers for synergistic therapeutic effect. Capitalizing on cell/molecule&#8208;targeting drug delivery, nanomedicines present enhanced specificity and safety with favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Herein, the roles of ROS in both IHD and its risk factors are discussed, highlighting cardiovascular medications that have antioxidant properties, and summarizing the advantages, properties, and recent achievements of nanomedicines that have ROS scavenging capacity for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion, and myocardial infarction. Finally, the current challenges of nanomedicines for ROS&#8208;scavenging treatment of IHD and possible future directions are discussed from a clinical perspective.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Exfoliation of Nonlayered Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Crystals into Nanoplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research progress on the use of liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation beyond layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals is summarized. Questions remain unanswered on how these 3D strongly bonded nonlayered crystals exfoliate into nanoplatelets, and on the insight of the exfoliation mechanism. The answer to the questions helps in revealing the future direction of this newly grown sub&#8208;family of 2D&#8208;class of materials.








Abstract
For nearly 15 years, researchers have been using liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) to produce 2D nanosheets from layered crystals. This has yielded multiple 2D materials in a solution&#8208;processable form whose utility has been demonstrated in multiple applications. It was&#160;believed that the exfoliation of such materials is enabled by the very large bonding anisotropy of layered materials where the strength of intralayer chemical bonds is very much larger than that of interlayer van der Waals bonds. However, over the last five years, a number of papers have raised questions about our&#160;understanding of exfoliation by describing the LPE of nonlayered materials. These results are extremely surprising because, as no van der Waals gap is present to provide an easily cleaved direction, the exfoliation of such compounds requires the breaking of only chemical bonds. Here the progress in this unexpected new research area is examined. The structure and properties of nanoplatelets produced by LPE of nonlayered materials are reviewed. A number of unexplained trends are found, not least the preponderance of isotropic materials that have been exfoliated to give high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanoplatelets. Finally, the applications potential of this new class of 2D materials are considered.

         <title>Doping Engineering in the MoS2/SnSe2 Heterostructure towards High Rejection Ratio Solar&#8208;blind UV Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The intentionally designed band alignment of heterostructures and doping engineering are keys to implement device structure design and device performance optimization. According to the theoretical prediction of several typical materials among the TMDs and group IV metal chalcogenides, MoS2 and SnSe2 present the largest staggered band offset. The large band offset is conducive to the separation of photogenerated carriers, thus MoS2/SnSe2 is a theoretically ideal candidate for fabricating photodetector, which is also verified in our experiment. Furthermore, in order to extend the photoresponse spectrum to solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (SBUV), doping engineering is adopted to form an additional electron state, which provides an extra carrier transition channel. In this work, pure MoS2/SnSe2 and doped MoS2/SnSe2 heterostructures are both fabricated. In terms of the photoelectric performance evaluation, the rejection ratio R254/R532 of the photodetector based on doped MoS2/SnSe2 is five orders of magnitude higher than that of pure MoS2/SnSe2, while the response time is obviously optimized by 3 orders. Our results demonstrate that the combination of band alignment and doping engineering provides a new pathway for constructing SBUV photodetectors.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Anode&#8208;Less All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries via the Conversion Reaction of Metal Fluorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature anode&#8208;less all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery is reported by utilizing the conversion reaction of metal fluorides. Silver fluoride is identified as a seed component to induce uniform and reversible lithium plating via a conversion reaction that produces metallic silver nanodomains. These nanodomains, together with the lithium fluoride formed during the conversion reaction, enable sustainable cycling with an extremely high areal capacity.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) that employ anode&#8208;less electrodes have drawn attention from across the battery community because they offer competitive energy densities and a markedly improved cycle life. Nevertheless, the composite matrices of anode&#8208;less electrodes impose a substantial barrier for lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and inhibit operation at room temperature. To overcome this drawback, here, the conversion reaction of metal fluorides is exploited because metallic nanodomains formed during this reaction induce an alloying reaction with lithium ions for uniform and sustainable lithium (de)plating. Lithium fluoride (LiF), another product of the conversion reaction, prevents the agglomeration of the metallic nanodomains and also protects the electrode from fatal lithium dendrite growth. A systematic analysis identifies silver (I) fluoride (AgF) as the most suitable metal fluoride because the silver nanodomains can accommodate the solid&#8208;solution mechanism with a low nucleation overpotential. AgF&#8208;based full cells attain reliable cycling at 25 &#176;C even with an exceptionally high areal capacity of 9.7 mAh cm&#8722;2 (areal loading of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#160;= 50&#160;mg cm&#8211;2). These results offer useful insights into designing materials for anode&#8208;less electrodes for sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs.

Abstract
Here, the authors report a highly efficient integrated ideal&#8208;bandgap perovskite/bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cell (IPBSC) with an inverted architecture, featuring a near infrared (NIR) polymer DTBTI&#8208;based bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) layer atop guanidinium bromide (GABr)&#8208;modified FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 perovskite film as the photoactive layer. The IPBSC shows cascade&#8208;like energy level alignment between the charge&#8208;extractionlayer/perovskite/BHJ and efficient passivation effect of BHJ on perovskite. Thanks to the well&#8208;matched energy level alignment and high&#8208;quality ideal bandgap&#8208;based perovskite film, an efficient charge transfer occurs between the charge&#8208;extraction&#8208;layer/perovskite/BHJ. Moreover, the NIR polymer DTBTI on the perovskite film leads to an improved NIR light response for the IPBSC. In addition, the O, S and N atoms in the DTBTI polymer yield a strong interaction with perovskite, which is conducive to reducing the defects of the perovskite and suppressing charge recombination. As a result, the solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.27% (certificated value at 23.4% with 0.283&#8208;volt voltage loss), currently the recorded efficiency for both IPBSCs and Pb&#8208;Sn alloyed PSCs, and which is over the highest efficiency of perovskite&#8211;organic tandem solar cell. Moreover, the thermal, humidity and long&#8208;term operational stabilities of the IPBSCs are also significantly improved compared with the control PSCs.

         <title>Spleen&#8208;Targeted Glabridin&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles Regulate Polarization of Monocyte/Macrophage (Mo/M&#966;) for the Treatment of Cerebral Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>

         <dc:description>
Glabridin (Gla)&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPGla&#8208;5k) can selectively deliver Gla to the spleen and regulate the polarization of monocyte/macrophages (Mo/M&#966;). By inhibiting Mo/M&#966; mediated inflammatory damage and enhancing its repairing effect, NPGla&#8208;5k treatment improves nervous system function in mice with cerebral I&#8208;R injury.








Abstract
During cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion (I&#8208;R) injury, the infiltration of monocyte/macrophages (Mo/M&#966;) into the ischemic penumbra causes inflammatory damage but also regulates tissue repair in the penumbra. The regulation and balance of Mo/M&#966; polarization is considered as a potential therapeutic target for treating cerebral I&#8208;R injury. Herein, these findings demonstrate that glabridin (Gla)&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (i.e., NPGla&#8208;5k) can effectively inhibit M1&#8208;polarization and enhance M2&#8208;polarization of Mo/M&#966;. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging shows that NPGla&#8208;5k can selectively accumulate in the spleen following intravenous injection. Spleen&#8208;targeted Cy5&#8208;NPGla&#8208;5k can co&#8208;localize with peripheral macrophages in the penumbra at 24&#160;h after tail&#8208;vein injection. Interestingly, NPGla&#8208;5k treatment can reduce inflammatory damage, protect dying neurons, and improve nervous system function. The protective effect of spleen&#8208;targeted NPGla&#8208;5k against cerebral I&#8208;R injury in mice encourages an exploration of their use for clinical treatment of patients with cerebral I&#8208;R injury.

         <title>Molecularly Distorted Local Structure in Bi2CuO4 Oxide to Stabilize Lattice Oxygen for Efficient Formate Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi2CuO4 oxide precatalyst delivers high&#8208;efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion electrocatalysis. Benefiting from the molecularly distorted local structure with [CuO4]6&#8722; square&#8208;planar units rotation, more lattice oxygen can be retained during theelectrochemical CO2 reduction process. The retained local lattice oxygen can optimize the adsorption of *OCHO intermediate, thereby promoting the CO2 reduction efficiency.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an economically feasible way for converting green energy into valuable chemical feedstocks and fuels. Great progress has been achieved in the understanding and synthesis of oxidized&#8208;based precatalysts; however, their dynamical changes of local structure under operando conditions still hinder their further applications. Here a molecularly distorted Bi2CuO4 precatalyst for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion is reported. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) results and theoretical calculations suggest that the distorted structure with molecularly like [CuO4]6&#8722; unit rotation is more conducive to the structural stability of the sample. Operando XAFS and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) results prove that quite a bit of lattice oxygen can remain in the distorted sample after CO2RR. Electrochemical measurements of the distorted sample show an excellent activity and selectivity with a high formate partial current density of 194.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an extremely low overpotential of &#8722;400&#160;mV. Further in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the retained oxygen can optimize the adsorption of *OCHO intermediate for the enhanced CO2RR performance.

         <title>An Electret&#8208;Powered Skin&#8208;Attachable Auditory Sensor that Functions in Harsh Acoustic Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electret&#8208;powered skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor operating without a bulky battery is presented. The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragm array with elastomer nanodroplets facilitates high sensing performance and clear voice detection in a harsh acoustic environment. The acoustic sensor shows a strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications.








Abstract
Auditory sensors have shortcomings with respect to not only personalization with wearability and portability but also detecting a human voice clearly in a noisy environment or when a mask covers the mouth. In this work, an electret&#8208;powered and hole&#8208;patterned polymer diaphragm is exploited into a skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor. The optimized charged electret diaphragm induces a voltage bias of &gt;400&#160;V against the counter electrode, which reduces the necessity of a bulky power source and enables the capacitive sensor to show high sensitivity (2.2&#160;V&#160;Pa&#8722;1) with incorporation of an elastomer nanodroplet seismic mass. The sophisticated capacitive structure with low mechanical damping enables a flat frequency response (80&#8211;3000&#160;Hz) and good linearity (50&#8211;80&#160;dBSPL). The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragms help the skin&#8208;attachable sensor detect only neck&#8208;skin vibration rather than dynamic air pressure, enabling a person's voice to be detected in a harsh acoustic environment. The sensor operates reliably even in the presence of surrounding noise and when the user is wearing a gas mask. Therefore, the sensor shows strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications such as cough monitoring and voice dosimetry.

         <title>Lattice Mismatch Driven Small Angle Moir&#233; Twists in Epitaxially&#8208;Grown 2D Vertical Layered Heterostructures</title>

Abstract
Artificially introduced small twist angles at the interfaces of vertical layered heterostructures (VLHs) have allowed deterministic tuning of electronic and optical properties such as strongly&#8208;correlated electronic phases and Moir&#233; excitons. But creating Moir&#233; twist in van der Waals (vdWs) systems by manual stacking is challenging in reproducibility, uniformity and accuracy of the twist angle, which hinders future studies. Here, we demonstrate that, contrary to the commonly believed 0&#176;&#8208;orientation in vdWs epitaxy, these VLHs show small twist angles controlled by the low&#8208;order commensurate phase with low energy and local atomic relaxation. A commensurate multilevel map was proposed to predict possible orientations. Remarkably, high&#8208;mismatch VLHs show discrete and sometimes non&#8208;zero twist angles dependent on their natural mismatch value. Such framework was experimentally confirmed in five epitaxially&#8208;grown VLHs under high&#8208;angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), and could provide significant insights for large&#8208;scale engineering of twist angle in VLHs.

         <title>A review on regulating Li+ solvation structures in carbonate electrolytes for lithium metal batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation battery systems due to their high energy density. However, commercialized carbonate electrolytes cannot be used in LMBs due to their poor compatibility with lithium metal anodes. While increasing cut&#8208;off voltage is an effective way to boost the energy density of LMBs, conventional ethylene carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes undergo a number of side reactions at high voltages. It is therefore critical to upgrade conventional carbonate electrolytes, the performance of which is highly influenced by the solvation structure of lithium ions (Li+). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the strategies to regulate the solvation structure of Li+ in carbonate electrolytes for LMBs by better understanding the science behind the Li+ solvation structure and Li+ behavior. We systematically compare different strategies to help select better electrolytes for specific applications. Remaining scientific and technical problems are pointed out, and directions for future research on carbonate electrolytes for LMBs are proposed.

         <title>Observation of Coexisting Dirac Bands and Moir&#233; Flat Bands in Magic&#8208;Angle Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices that consist of two or more layers of two&#8208;dimensional materials stacked together with a small twist angle have emerged as a tunable platform to realize various correlated and topological phases, such as Mott insulators, unconventional superconductivity and quantum anomalous Hall effect. Recently, the magic&#8208;angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has shown both robust superconductivity similar to magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) and other unique properties, including the Pauli&#8208;limit violating and re&#8208;entrant superconductivity. These rich properties are deeply rooted in its electronic structure under the influence of distinct moir&#233; potential and mirror symmetry. Here, combining nanometer&#8208;scale spatially resolved angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (nano&#8208;ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we systematically measure the yet unexplored band structure of MATTG near charge neutrality. Our measurements reveal the coexistence of the distinct dispersive Dirac band with the emergent moir&#233; flat band, showing nice agreement with the theoretical calculations. These results serve as a stepstone for further understanding of the unconventional superconductivity in MATTG.

         <title>Colossal Room&#8208;Temperature Terahertz Topological Response in Type&#8208;II Weyl Semimetal NbIrTe4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electromagnetic spectrum between microwave and infrared light is termed the &#8220;terahertz (THz) gap&#8221;, of which there is an urgent lack of feasible and efficient room&#8208;temperature (RT) THz detectors. Type&#8208;II Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have been predicted to host significant RT topological&#160;photoresponses in low&#8208;frequency regions, especially in the THz gap, well addressing the shortcomings of THz detectors. However, such devices have&#160;not&#160;been&#160;experimentally realized so far. Herein, we demonstrate a type&#8208;II WSM&#8208;based THz detector, i.e., a NbIrTe4&#8208;based device, which exhibits a photoresponsivity of 5.7&#215;104 V/W, a detectivity of 2.9&#215;109 Jones, and a 1&#8208;year air stability at RT, comparable&#160;to the best RT THz detectors. Such excellent THz&#8208;detection performance can be attributed to the topological effect of the type&#8208;II WSM in which the effective mass of photogenerated electrons can be reduced by the large tilting angle of the Weyl cones to further improve mobility and photoresponsivity. Impressively, this device shows a giant intrinsic anisotropic conductance ( &#963;max/&#963;min= 339) and THz response ( Iph&#8197;max/Iph&#8197;min = &#8197;40.9), both of which, to the best of our knowledge, are record values. Our findings open a new avenue for the realization of uncooled and high&#8208;sensitive THz detectors by exploring type&#8208;II WSM&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Shaping A Soft Future: Patterning Liquid Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This review highlights the unique techniques for patterning liquid metals containing gallium (e.g., eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn). These techniques are enabled by two unique attributes of these liquids relative to solid metals: (1) The fluidity of the metal allows it to be injected, sprayed, and generally dispensed. (2) The solid native oxide shell allows the metal to adhere to surfaces and be shaped in ways that would normally be prohibited due to surface tension. The ability to shape liquid metals into non&#8208;spherical structures such as wires, antennas, and electrodes can enable fluidic metallic conductors for stretchable electronics, soft robotics, e&#8208;skins, and wearables. This review summarizes the key properties of these metals with a focus on methods to pattern liquid metals into soft or stretchable devices.

         <title>Many&#8208;body molecular interactions in a memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electronic transitions in molecular circuit elements hinge on complex interactions between molecules and ions, offering a multi&#8208;dimensional parameter space to embed, access, and optimize material functionalities for target&#8208;specific applications. This opportunity has not been cultivated in molecular memristors because their low&#8208;temperature charge transport, which is a route to decipher molecular many&#8208;body interactions, is unexplored. To address this, we designed robust, temperature&#8208;resilient molecular memristors based on a Ru complex of an azo aromatic ligand and performed current&#8208;voltage sweep measurements from room temperature down to 2 Kelvin with different cooling protocols. By freezing out or activating different components of supramolecular dynamics, we could control the local Coulombic interactions between the molecules and counterions that affected the electronic transport. We designed operating conditions where functionalities spanning bipolar, unipolar, non&#8208;volatile, and volatile memristors with sharp as well as gradual analog transitions were captured within a single device. A mathematical design space evolved thereof comprising 36 tuneable parameters in which all possible steady&#8208;state functional variations in a memristor characteristic could be attainable. This enables a deterministic design route to engineer neuromorphic devices with unprecedented control over the transformation characteristics governing their functional flexibility and tunability.

         <title>Black Phosphorous Mediates Surface Charge Redistribution of CoSe2 for Electrochemical H2O2 Production in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrochemical generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction offers a green method to mitigate current dependence on the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process, promising its on&#8208;site applications. Unfortunately, in alkaline environments, H2O2 is not stable and undergoes rapid decomposition. Making H2O2 in acidic electrolytes can prevent its decomposition, but choices of active, stable and selective electrocatalysts are significantly limited. Here we report the selective and efficient two&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen towards H2O2 in acid by a composite catalyst that composed of black phosphorus (BP) nailed chemically on the metallic cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) surface. We find that this catalyst exhibits a 91% Faradic efficiency for H2O2 product at an overpotential of 300 millivolts. Moreover, it can mediate O2 to H2O2 with a high production rate of ca. 1530&#160;mg L&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2 in a flow cell reactor. Spectroscopic and computational studies together uncover a BP&#8208;induced surface charge redistribution in CoSe2, which leads to a favorable surface electronic structure that weakens the HOO* adsorption, thus enhancing the kinetics towards H2O2 formation.

         <title>Establishing self&#8208;dopant design principles from structure&#8208;function relationships in self&#8208;n&#8208;doped perylene diimide organic semiconductors</title>

Abstract
Self&#8208;doping is a particular doping method that has been applied to a wide range of organic semiconductors. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding the relationship between dopant structure and function. We investigated a structurally diverse series of self&#8208;n&#8208;doped perylene diimides (PDIs) to study the impact of steric encumbrance, counterion selection, and dopant/PDI tether distance on functional parameters such as doping, stability, morphology, and charge carrier mobility. Our studies show that self&#8208;n&#8208;doping is best enabled by the use of sterically encumbered ammoniums with short tethers and Lewis basic counterions. Additionally, water is found to inhibit doping, leading us to conclude that thermal degradation is merely a phenomenological feature of certain dopants, and that residual solvent evaporation is the primary driver of thermally activated doping. In&#8208;situ grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering studies show that sample annealing increases the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance and shrinks grain boundaries for improved long&#8208;range ordering. These features are then correlated to contactless carrier mobility measurements with time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity before and after thermal annealing. The collective relationships between structural features and functionality are finally used to establish explicit self&#8208;n&#8208;dopant design principles for the future design of materials with improved functionality.

&lt;p&gt;Self-doping is a particular doping method that has been applied to a wide range of organic semiconductors. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding the relationship between dopant structure and function. We investigated a structurally diverse series of self-n-doped perylene diimides (PDIs) to study the impact of steric encumbrance, counterion selection, and dopant/PDI tether distance on functional parameters such as doping, stability, morphology, and charge carrier mobility. Our studies show that self-n-doping is best enabled by the use of sterically encumbered ammoniums with short tethers and Lewis basic counterions. Additionally, water is found to inhibit doping, leading us to conclude that thermal degradation is merely a phenomenological feature of certain dopants, and that residual solvent evaporation is the primary driver of thermally activated doping. In-situ grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering studies show that sample annealing increases the &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; stacking distance and shrinks grain boundaries for improved long-range ordering.

         <title>Metal Confined in Two&#8208;dimensional Membranes for Molecular Recognition and Sieving towards Ethylene/ethane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Membranes with nanochannels have exhibited great potential in molecular separations, while remain great challenge to separate molecules with very close physical properties and kinetic diameters (e.g., ethylene/ethane) owing to the lack of size sieving property and specific affinity. Herein, we report a metal confined two&#8208;dimensional (2D) sub&#8208;nanometer channel to successfully discriminate ethylene over ethane via molecular recognition and sieving. Transition metal cations are paired with polyelectrolyte anions to achieve high dissociation activity, forming reversible complexation with ethylene. Aberration&#8208;corrected TEM observes that the metals with size of &#8764;2&#160;nm are uniformly confined in GO interlayer channels with averaged height of &#8764;0.44&#160;nm, thereby cooperating size&#8208;sieving effect with molecular recognition ability toward ethylene and stimulating its selective transport over ethane. The resulting ultrathin (&#8764;60&#160;nm) membrane exhibits superior ethylene/ethane separation performance far beyond the polymeric upper&#8208;bound. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the metal@2D interlayer channel provides a molecular recognition pathway for selective gas transport. The proposed metal confined in 2D channel with molecular recognition and sieving properties would have broad application in other related fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensor and energy conversion.

         <title>Etching Bulk COFs into Nanoparticles of Uniform and Controllable Size by the Molecular Exchange Etching Method for Sonodynamic and Immune Combination Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To improve the therapeutic effect of sonodynamic therapy (SDT), more effective and stable sonosensitizers and therapeutic strategies are still required. We developed a covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizer by using a new nanoscale COF preparation strategy. This strategy used molecular etching based on the imine exchange reaction to etch bulk COF into nanoparticles and had universal applicability to imine bond&#8208;based COF. The regular COF structure could prevent the loss of sonodynamic performance caused by the aggregation of porphyrin molecules and improve the chemical stability of the porphyrin unit. In addition, the coordination of Fe3+ to COF endowed the nanoparticle with chemodynamic therapy (CDT) performance and glutathione (GSH) consumption ability. The combination of enhanced SDT and &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody achieved a good antitumor effect. The innovative nanoscale COF sonosensitizer preparation strategy provides a new avenue for clinical antitumor therapy.

         <title>Ultrathin Piezoelectric Resonators Based on Graphene and Free&#8208;Standing Single Crystal BaTiO3</title>

Abstract
Suspended piezoelectric thin films are key elements enabling high&#8208;frequency filtering in telecommunication devices. To meet the requirements of next&#8208;generation electronics, it is essential to reduce device thickness for reaching higher resonance frequencies. Here, we&#160;combine the high&#8208;quality mechanical and electrical properties of graphene electrodes, with the strong piezoelectric performance of the free&#8208;standing complex oxide, BaTiO3 (BTO), to create ultra thin piezoelectric resonators. we&#160;demonstrate that the device can be brought into mechanical resonance by piezoelectric actuation. By sweeping the dc bias voltage on the top graphene electrode, we&#160;switch the BTO membrane between the two poled ferroelectric states. Remarkably, the ferroelectric hysteresis is also observed in the resonance frequency, magnitude and Q&#8208;factor of the first membrane mode. This work demonstrates the potential of combining van der Waals materials with complex oxides for next&#8208;generation electronics, which not only opens up opportunities for increasing filter frequencies, but also enables reconfiguration by poling, via ferroelectric memory effect.

Abstract
Thin&#8208;film transistors using metal oxide semiconductors are essential in many unconventional electronic devices. Nevertheless, further advances will be necessary to broaden their technological appeal. Here we report a new strategy to achieve high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistors (MOTFTs) by introducing a metallic micro&#8208;island array (M&#8208;MIA) on top of the MO back channel, where the MO is a&#8208;IGZO (amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide). Here Al&#8208;MIAs are fabricated using honeycomb cinnamate cellulose films, created by a scalable breath&#8208;figure method, as a shadow mask. For IGZO TFTs, the electron mobility (&#956;e) increases from &#8764;3.6 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1 to near 15.6 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1 for optimal Al&#8208;MIA dimension/coverage of 1.25&#160;&#956;m/51%. The Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFT performance is superior to that of controls using compact/planar Al layers (Al&#8208;PL TFTs) and Au&#8208;MIAs with the same channel coverage. Kelvin probe force microscopy and Technology Computer&#8208;Aided Design simulations reveal that charge transfer occurs between the Al and the IGZO channel which is optimized for specific Al&#8208;MIA dimensions/surface channel coverages. Furthermore, such Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFTs with a high&#8208;k fluoride&#8208;doped alumina dielectric exhibit a maximum &#956;e of &gt;50.2 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1. This is the first demonstration of a micro&#8208;structured MO semiconductor heterojunction with submicron resolution metallic arrays for enhanced transistor performance and broad applicability to other devices

&lt;p&gt;Thin-film transistors using metal oxide semiconductors are essential in many unconventional electronic devices. Nevertheless, further advances will be necessary to broaden their technological appeal. Here we report a new strategy to achieve high-performance solution-processed metal oxide thin-film transistors (MOTFTs) by introducing a metallic micro-island array (M-MIA) on top of the MO back channel, where the MO is a-IGZO (amorphous indium-gallium-zinc-oxide). Here Al-MIAs are fabricated using honeycomb cinnamate cellulose films, created by a scalable breath-figure method, as a shadow mask. For IGZO TFTs, the electron mobility (&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;

Abstract
Glass electronics inspire the emergence of smart functional surfaces. To evolve this concept to the next level, developing new strategies for scalable, inexpensive, and electrically conductive glass&#8208;based robust nanocomposites is crucial. Graphene is an attractive material as a conductive filler; however, integrating it firmly into glass without the need for energy&#8208;intensive sintering, melting, or harsh chemicals has not been possible until now. Moreover, these methods have very limited capability for fabricating robust patterns for electronic circuits. In this work, for the first time, we achieve a conductive (160&#160;Ohm sq&#8211;1) and resilient nanocomposite between glass and graphene via single&#8208;step laser&#8208;induced backward transfer (LIBT). Beyond conventional LIBT involving photonic&#8208;induced mass transfer, our approach simultaneously drives chemical transformations in glass, including silicon compound formation and graphene oxide (GO) reduction. These processes take place together with the generation and transfer of the highest&#8208;quality laser&#8208;reduced GO reported to date (Raman intensity ratio ID/IG = 0.31) and its integration into glass. Our rGO&#8208;LIBT nanocomposite was further functionalized with silver to achieve a highly sensitive (10&#8211;9&#160;M) dual&#8208;channel plasmonic optical and electrochemical sensor. Besides the electrical circuit demonstration, we show an electrothermal heater that can maintain temperatures above 300&#160;&#176;C and continuously operate for over 48&#160;h.

         <title>Super&#8208;Linear&#8208;Threshold&#8208;Switching Selector with Multiple Jar&#8208;Shaped Cu&#8208;Filaments in the Amorphous Ge3Se7 Resistive Switching Layer in a Cross&#8208;Point Synaptic Memristor Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial neural network consisting of a hardware&#8208;based cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array should employ selectors with two&#8208;terminal electrodes to prevent an undesired sneak current and to improve learning and inference efficiencies. Here, a highly reliable super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped Cu&#8208;filaments in the amorphous Ge3Se7 resistive switching layer by controlling the Cu ion concentration depth profile is developed.








Abstract
The learning and inference efficiencies of an artificial neural network represented by a cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array can be achieved using a selector, with high selectivity (Ion/Ioff) and sufficient death region, stacked vertically on a synaptic memristor. This can prevent a sneak current in the memristor array. A selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped conductive Cu filaments in the resistive switching layer is precisely fabricated by designing the Cu ion concentration depth profile of the CuGeSe layer as a filament source, TiN diffusion barrier layer, and Ge3Se7 switching layer. The selector performs super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching with a selectivity of &gt; 107, death region of &#8722;0.70&#8211;0.65 V, holding time of 300 ns, switching speed of 25 ns, and endurance cycle of &gt;&#160;106. In addition, the mechanism of switching is proven by the formation of conductive Cu filaments between the CuGeSe and Ge3Se7 layers under a positive bias on the top Pt electrode and an automatic rupture of the filaments after the holding time. Particularly, a spiking deep neural network using the designed one&#8208;selector&#8208;one&#8208;memory cross&#8208;point array improves the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology classification accuracy by &#8776;3.8% by eliminating the sneak current in the cross&#8208;point array during the inference process.

         <title>Role of Moisture and Oxygen in Defect Management and Orderly Oxidation Boosting Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI2Br Solar Cells to a New Record Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orderly oxidation of CsPbI2Br film in moist air leads to more efficient defect passivation in film by grain boundary oxidation, and higher hole extraction efficiency in device via the energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and oxidation product CsPbIBr2. The champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Large energy loss (Eloss) caused&#160;by defect&#8208;assisted recombination makes the photovoltaic performance of carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) inferior to that of metal&#8208;electrode ones. Herein, the influence of environmental factors (moisture and oxygen) on defect management during re&#8208;annealing process of CsPbI2Br crystalline films is systematically studied. Density functional theory and experimental results indicate that moisture in the air can significantly reduce the oxidation kinetics of crystalline films, resulting in orderly oxidation. Concomitantly, the oxidation decomposition products PbO and CsPbIBr2 are enriched at grain boundaries, passivating surface defects efficiently. Simultaneously, energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 improves the hole extraction efficiency. The photovoltage of corresponding C&#8208;PSCs is increased from 1.05 to 1.32&#160;V, indicating a reduced Eloss derived from orderly oxidation strategy. Correspondingly, the champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a new record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible electronics is an emerging field of research involving multiple disciplines, which include but not limited to physics, chemistry, materials science, electronic engineering, and biology. However, the broad applications of flexible electronics are still restricted due to several limitations, including high Young's modulus, poor biocompatibility, and poor responsiveness. Innovative materials aiming for overcoming these drawbacks and boost its practical application is highly desirable. Hydrogel is a class of 3D crosslinked hydrated polymer networks, and its exceptional material properties render it a promising candidate for the next generation of flexible electronics. Here, we review the latest methods of synthesizing advanced functional hydrogels and the state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications of hydrogel&#8208;based flexible electronics in various fields. More importantly, we discuss on the correlation between properties of the hydrogel and device performance, to have better understanding of the development of flexible electronics by using environmentally responsive hydrogels. Lastly, we provide perspectives on the current challenges and future directions in the development of hydrogel&#8208;based multifunctional flexible electronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible electronics is an emerging field of research involving multiple disciplines, which include but not limited to physics, chemistry, materials science, electronic engineering, and biology. However, the broad applications of flexible electronics are still restricted due to several limitations, including high Young's modulus, poor biocompatibility, and poor responsiveness. Innovative materials aiming for overcoming these drawbacks and boost its practical application is highly desirable. Hydrogel is a class of 3D crosslinked hydrated polymer networks, and its exceptional material properties render it a promising candidate for the next generation of flexible electronics. Here, we review the latest methods of synthesizing advanced functional hydrogels and the state-of-art applications of hydrogel-based flexible electronics in various fields. More importantly, we discuss on the correlation between properties of the hydrogel and device performance, to have better understanding of the development of flexible electronics by using environmentally responsive hydrogels. Lastly, we provide perspectives on the current challenges and future directions in the development of hydrogel-based multifunctional flexible electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Overcoming the Limitations of MXene Electrodes for Solution&#8208;Processed Optoelectronic Devices</title>

Abstract
MXenes constitute a rapidly growing family of two&#8208;dimensional materials that are promising for optoelectronic applications because of numerous attractive properties, including high electrical conductivity. However, the most widely used titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene transparent conductive electrode has insufficient environmental stability and work function (WF), which impede practical applications Ti3C2Tx electrodes in solution&#8208;processed optoelectronics. Herein, we present Ti3C2Tx MXene film with a compact structure and a perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) barrier layer as a promising electrode for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The electrode has excellent environmental stability, high WF of 5.84&#160;eV and low sheet resistance RS of 97.4 &#937;/sq. The compact Ti3C2Tx structure after thermal annealing resists intercalation of moisture and environmental contaminants. In addition, the PFSA surface modification passivates interflake defects and modulates the WF. Thus, the WF and RS changed negligibly even after 22 days of exposure to ambient air. The Ti3C2Tx MXene was applied for large&#8208;area, ten&#8208;by&#8208;ten passive matrix flexible OLEDs on substrates measuring 6 &#215; 6&#160;cm. This work provides a simple but efficient strategy to overcome both the limited environmental stability and low WF of MXene electrodes for solution&#8208;processable optoelectronics.

         <title>Exceptionally High Saturation Magnetic Flux Density and Ultra&#8208;low Coercivity Via an Amorphous&#8208;nanocrystalline Transitional Microstructure in a FeCo&#8208;based Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High saturation magnetic flux density (Bs) of soft magnetic materials is essential for increasing the power density of modern magnetic devices and motor machines. Yet, increasing Bs is always at the expense of high coercivity (Hc), presenting a general trade&#8208;off in soft magnetic material family. Here, the superior comprehensive soft magnetic properties, i.e., an exceptionally high Bs of up to 1.94 T and an Hc as low as 4.3 A m&#8211;1 are unprecedented combined in a FeCo&#8208;based alloy. This alloy is obtained through a composition design strategy to construct a transitional microstructure between amorphous and traditional nanocrystalline alloys, with nanocrystals (with &lt; 5&#8208;nm&#8208;sized crystal&#8208;like regions around) sparsely dispersed in amorphous matrix. Such transitional microstructure possesses extremely low magnetic anisotropy caused by the annihilation of quasi&#8208;dislocation dipole, and a strong magnetic exchange interaction, which leads to excellent comprehensive magnetic properties. The results provide useful guidelines for the development of next generation of soft magnetic materials, which are promising for applications of high frequency, high efficiency and energy saving devices.

         <title>Perovskite Wide&#8208;Angle Field&#8208;of&#8208;View Camera</title>

Abstract
Researchers have attempted to create wide&#8208;angle field&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOV) cameras inspired by the structure of the eyes of animals, including fisheye and compound eye cameras. However, realizing wide&#8208;angle FOV cameras simultaneously exhibiting low distortion and high spatial resolution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we developed a novel wide&#8208;angle FOV camera by combining a single large&#8208;area flexible perovskite photodetector (FP&#8208;PD) using computational technology. With this camera, the proposed single&#8208;photodetector imaging technique can obtain high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution images using only a single detector, and the large&#8208;area FP&#8208;PD can be bent further to collect light from a wide&#8208;angle FOV. The proposed camera demonstrates remarkable features of an extraordinarily tunable wide FOV (greater than 150&#176;), high spatial resolution of 256 &#215; 256 pixels, and low distortion. We believe that the proposed compatible and extensible camera prototype will promote the development of high&#8208;performance versatile FOV cameras.

         <title>A Meta&#8208;Device for Intelligent Depth Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the magic stairs, an innovative and complementary integration of light&#8208;field and structured&#8208;light depth mapping and imaging system using a size of 1.2 &#215; 1.2 mm2 meta&#8208;lens array to measure the depth over a 30 cm range is shown. This compact, lightweight, low power consumption system can be used for autonomous systems in all light levels conditions.








Abstract
The optical illusion affects depth&#8208;sensing due to the limited and specific light&#8208;field information acquired by single&#8208;lens imaging. The incomplete depth information or visual deception would cause cognitive errors. To resolve this problem, an intelligent and compact depth&#8208;sensing meta&#8208;device that is miniaturized, integrated, and applicable for diverse scenes in all light levels is demonstrated. The compact and multifunction stereo vision system adopts an array with 3600 achromatic meta&#8208;lenses and a size of 1.2 &#215; 1.2 mm2 to measure the depth over a 30&#160;cm range with deep&#8208;learning support. The meta&#8208;lens array can act as multiple imaging lenses to collect light field information. It can also work with a light source as an active optical device to project a structured light. The meta&#8208;lens array can serve as the core functional component of a light&#8208;field imaging system under bright conditions or a structured&#8208;light projection system in the dark. The depth information in both ways can be analyzed and extracted by the convolutional neural network. This work provides a new avenue for the applications such as autonomous driving, machine vision, human&#8211;computer interaction, augmented reality, biometric identification, etc.

         <title>Diffusive Memristors with Uniform and Tunable Relaxation Time for Spike Generation in Event&#8208;Based Pattern Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A diffusive memristor is a promising building block for brain&#8208;inspired computing hardware. However, the randomness in the device dynamics limits the wide&#8208;range adoption of diffusive memristors in large arrays. In this work, we engineered the device stack to achieve a much&#8208;improved uniformity in the relaxation time (standard deviation &#963;&#8197;reduced from &#8764;12 to &#8764;0.32&#160;ms). We further connected the memristor with a resistor or a capacitor and tuned the relaxation time between 1.13 &#956;s to 1.25&#160;ms, ranging from three orders of magnitude. We implemented the hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm to utilize the tunable and uniform relaxation behavior for spike generation. We achieved 77.3% accuracy in recognizing moving objects in the neuromorphic MNIST (N&#8208;MNIST) dataset. Our work paves the way for building emerging neuromorphic computing hardware systems with ultralow power consumption.

         <title>Harnessing the Metal&#8212;Insulator Transition of VO2 in Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Future&#8208;generation neuromorphic computing seeks to overcome the limitations of von Neumann architectures by co&#8208;locating logic and memory functions, thereby emulating the function of neurons and synapses in the human brain. Despite remarkable demonstrations of high&#8208;fidelity neuronal emulation, the predictive design of neuromorphic circuits starting from knowledge of material transformations remains challenging. VO2 is an attractive candidate since it manifests a near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature, discontinuous, and hysteretic metal&#8212;insulator transition. The transition provides a nonlinear dynamical response to input signals, as needed to construct neuronal circuit elements. We discuss strategies for tuning the transformation characteristics of VO2 based on modification of material properties, interfacial structure, and field couplings. Dynamical modulation of transformation characteristics through in&#8208;situ material processing is discussed as a means of imbuing synaptic function. We emphasize mechanistic understanding of site&#8208;selective modification; external, epitaxial, and chemical strain; defect dynamics; and interfacial field coupling in modifying local atomistic structure, the implications therein for electronic structure, and ultimately, the tuning of transformation characteristics. We highlight opportunities for inverse design and for using design principles related to thermodynamics and kinetics of electronic transitions learned from VO2 to inform the design of new Mott materials, as well as to go beyond energy&#8208;efficient computation to manifest intelligence.

&lt;p&gt;Future-generation neuromorphic computing seeks to overcome the limitations of von Neumann architectures by co-locating logic and memory functions, thereby emulating the function of neurons and synapses in the human brain. Despite remarkable demonstrations of high-fidelity neuronal emulation, the predictive design of neuromorphic circuits starting from knowledge of material transformations remains challenging.

         <title>Smart Eutectic Gallium&#8208;Indium: from Properties to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Eutectic Gallium&#8208;Indium (EGaIn), a liquid metal with a melting point close to or below room temperature, has attracted extensive attention in recent years due to its excellent properties such as fluidity, high conductivity, thermal conductivity, stretchability, self&#8208;healing capability, biocompatibility, and recyclability. These features of EGaIn can be adjusted by changing the experimental condition, and various composite materials with extended properties can be further obtained by mixing EGaIn with other materials. In this review, not only the unique properties of EGaIn are introduced, but also the working principles for the EGaIn&#8208;based devices are illustrated and the developments of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are summarized. The applications of EGaIn in various fields, such as flexible electronics (sensors, antennas, electronic circuits), molecular electronics (molecular memory, opto&#8208;electronic switches or reconfigurable junctions), energy catalysis (heat management, motors, generators, batteries), biomedical science (drug delivery, tumor therapy, bioimaging and neural interfaces) are reviewed. Finally, a critical discussion of the main challenges for the development of EGaIn&#8208;based techniques are discussed, and the potential applications in new fields are prospected.

         <title>Heterogeneous Interface Enhanced Adsorption of Organic and Hydroxyl for Biomass Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides an efficient way to obtain high value&#8208;added biomass&#8208;derived chemicals.&#160;Compared with other transition metal oxides, CuO exhibits poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, leading to high Faraday efficiency for HMF oxidation.&#160;However, the weak adsorption and activation ability of CuO to OH&#8211; species restricts its further development. Herein, the CuO&#8208;PdO heterogeneous interface is successfully constructed, resulting in an advanced onset&#8208;potential of HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR), a higher current density than CuO. The results of open circuit potential (OCP), in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy, and theoretical calculation indicate that the introduction of PdO enhances the adsorption capacity of the organic molecule.&#160;Meanwhile, CuO&#8208;PdO heterogeneous interface promotes the adsorption and activation of OH&#8211; species, as demonstrated by Zeta potential and electrochemical measurements. This work elucidates the adsorption enhancement mechanism of heterogeneous interface and provides constructive guidance for designing efficient multi&#8208;component electrocatalysts in organic electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Powder metallurgy route to ultrafine&#8208;grained refractory metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrafine&#8208;grained refractory metals are promising materials for applications in aerospace, microelectronics, nuclear and many others under extreme environment. Powder metallurgy (PM) allows to produce such materials with well controlled chemistry and microstructure at multiple length scales and near&#8208;net shape manufacturing. However, sintering refractory metals to full density while maintaining a fine microstructure is still challenging due to the high sintering temperature and the difficulty to separate the kinetics of densification versus grain growth. Here we seek to provide an overview of the sintering issues, microstructural design rules and PM practices towards ultrafine&#8208;grained and nanocrystalline refractory metals. We shall review the previous efforts to address the processing challenges, including the use of fine/nano powders, second&#8208;phase grain growth inhibitors, and field&#8208;assisted sintering techniques. Recently, pressureless two&#8208;step sintering has been successfully demonstrated in producing dense ultrafine&#8208;grained refractory metals down to &#8764;300&#160;nm average grain size with a uniform microstructure and this technological breakthrough shall be reviewed. PM progresses in specific materials systems shall be next reviewed, including elementary metals (W and Mo), refractory alloys (W&#8208;Re), refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys and their composites. Lastly, future developments and the endeavor towards ultrafine&#8208;grained and nanocrystalline refractory metals with exceptional fine microstructure and improved properties are outlined.

         <title>Ag2Q&#8208;based (Q = S, Se, Te) Silver Chalcogenide Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermoelectric technology provides a promising solution to sustainable energy utilization and scalable power supply. Recently, Ag2Q&#8208;based (Q = S, Se, Te) silver chalcogenides have come forth as potential thermoelectric materials that are endowed with complex crystal structures, high carrier mobility coupled with low lattice thermal conductivity, and even exceptional plasticity. This review presents the latest advances in this material family, from binary compounds to ternary and quaternary alloys, covering the understanding of multi&#8208;scale structures and peculiar properties, the optimization of thermoelectric performance, and the rational design of new materials. The &#8220;composition&#8208;phase structure&#8208;thermoelectric/mechanical properties&#8221; correlation is emphasized. Flexible and hetero&#8208;shaped thermoelectric prototypes based on Ag2Q materials are also demonstrated. Several key problems and challenges are put forward concerning further understanding and optimization of Ag2Q&#8208;based thermoelectric chalcogenides.

         <title>Thermal Transport Properties of Phonons in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for various applications, such as photovoltaic, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric applications. The knowledge of the thermal transport of halide perovskites is essential for enhancing the device performance for these applications and improving the understanding of heat transport in complicated material systems with atomic disorders. In this work, we review the current understanding of the experimentally and theoretically obtained thermal transport properties of halide perovskites. We comprehensively examine the reported thermal conductivity of methylammonium lead iodide, which is a prototype material, and provide theoretical frameworks for its lattice vibrational properties. The frameworks and discussions are extended to other halide perovskites and derivative structures. The implications for device applications, such as solar cells and thermoelectrics, are discussed.

         <title>Large Room Temperature Anomalous Transverse Thermoelectric Effect in Kagome Antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 exhibits a maximum transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776; 2.4 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 200 K. More importantly, a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) of &#8776; 2 &#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 at 300 K is observed, which is the highest value for any antiferromagnetic material. This large ANE value can be attributed to the presence of a Dirac point and flat band close to the Fermi level with intrinsic Berry curvature.








Abstract
Kagome magnets possess several novel nontrivial topological features owing to the strong correlation between topology and magnetism that extends to their applications in the field of thermoelectricity. Conventional thermoelectric (TE) devices use the Seebeck effect to convert heat into electrical energy. In contrast, transverse thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect are attracting recent attention due to their unique transverse geometry, which uses a single material to eliminate the need for a multitude of electrical connections compared to conventional TE devices. Here, a large anomalous transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776;2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in a kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 single crystal is obtained. The obtained value is larger than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials and comparable with ferromagnetic systems. The large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) can be attributed to the net Berry curvature near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the ANE of the AFM YMn6Sn6 exceeds the magnetization scaling relationship of conventional ferromagnets. The results clearly illustrate that AFM material YMn6Sn6 is an ideal topological material for room&#8208;temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.

         <title>Balanced Interfacial Ion Concentration and Migration Steric Hindrance Promoting High&#8208;Efficiency Deposition/Dissolution Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The important influence of interfacial ion effect on aqueous zinc&#8211;manganese batteries is proposed. The interfacial ion concentration and steric hindrance in the electric double layer are comprehensively balanced from the perspective of thermodynamics and kinetics, respectively, to achieve both high specific capacity and long cycle stability simultaneously.








Abstract
The solid&#8211;liquid transition reaction lays the foundation of electrochemical energy storage systems with high capacity, but realizing high efficiency remains a challenge. Herein, in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics, this work demonstrates the significant role of both interfacial H+ concentration and Mn2+ migration steric hindrance for the high&#8208;efficiency deposition/dissolution chemistry of zinc&#8211;manganese batteries. Specially, the introduction of formate anions can buffer the generated interfacial H+ to stabilize interfacial potential according to the Nernst equation, which stimulates high capacity. Compared with acetate and propionate anions, the formate anion&#160;also provides high adsorption density on the cathode surface to shield the electrostatic repulsion due to the small spatial hindrance. Particularly for the solvated Mn2+, the formate&#8208;anion&#8208;induced lower energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step during the step&#8208;by&#8208;step desolvation process results in lower polarization and higher electrochemical reversibility. In&#160;situ tests and theoretical calculations verify that the electrolyte with formate anions achieve a good balance between ion concentration and ion&#8208;migration steric hindrance. It exhibits both the high energy density of 531.26&#160;W&#160;h&#160;kg&#8208;1&#160;and long cycle life of more than 300&#160;cycles without obvious decay.

         <title>Recent Progress in 1D Contacts for 2D&#8208;Material&#8208;Based Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals gap&#8208;free 1D contacts to 2D materials, toward their large&#8208;scale application to 2D electronic and quantum devices, are reviewed. 1D edge contacts enable low contact resistivity, scattering&#8208;free carrier transport, high&#8208;density transistor integration, and double&#8208;gate transistor operation. In addition, an outlook of the 1D contact methods is presented.








Abstract
Recent studies have intensively examined 2D materials (2DMs) as promising materials for use in future quantum devices due to their atomic thinness. However, a major limitation occurs when 2DMs are in contact with metals: a van der Waals (vdW) gap is generated at the 2DM&#8208;metal interfaces, which induces metal&#8208;induced gap states that are responsible for an uncontrollable Schottky barrier (SB), Fermi&#8208;level pinning (FLP), and high contact resistance (RC), thereby substantially lowering the electronic mobility of 2DM&#8208;based devices. Here, vdW&#8208;gap&#8208;free 1D edge contact is reviewed for use in 2D devices with substantially suppressed carrier scattering of 2DMs with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation. The 1D contact further enables uniform carrier transport across multilayered 2DM channels, high&#8208;density transistor integration independent of scaling, and the fabrication of double&#8208;gate transistors suitable for demonstrating unique quantum phenomena of 2DMs. The existing 1D contact methods are reviewed first. As a promising technology toward the large&#8208;scale production of 2D devices, seamless lateral contacts are reviewed in detail. The electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices developed via 1D contacts are subsequently discussed. Finally, the challenges regarding the reliability of 1D contacts are addressed, followed by an outlook of 1D contact methods.

         <title>Flat&#8211;Zigzag Interface Design of Chalcogenide Heterostructure toward Ultralow Volume Expansion for High&#8208;Performance Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable interface design strategy is presented that two metal chalcogenides with totally different layer&#8208;morphologies are stacked to form large K+ transport channels, rendering ultralow interlayer expansion. As a proof of concept, the flat&#8211;zigzag MoS2/Bi2S3 heterostructures stacked with zigzag&#8208;morphology Bi2S3 and flat&#8208;morphology MoS2 present an ultralow expansion ratio versus MoS2 and Bi2S3, which deliver an ultrahigh potassium storage capacity.








Abstract
Heterostructure construction of layered metal chalcogenides can boost their alkali&#8208;metal storage performance, where the charge transfer kinetics can be promoted by the built&#8208;in electric fields. However, these heterostructures usually undergo interface separation due to severe layer expansion, especially for large&#8208;size potassium accommodation, resulting in the deconstruction of heterostructures and battery performance fading. Herein, first a stable interface design strategy where two metal chalcogenides with totally different layer&#8208;morphologies are stacked to form large K+ transport channels, rendering ultralow interlayer expansion, is presented. As a proof of concept, the flat&#8211;zigzag MoS2/Bi2S3 heterostructures stacked with zigzag&#8208;morphology Bi2S3 and flat&#8208;morphology MoS2 present an ultralow expansion ratio (1.98%) versus MoS2 (9.66%) and Bi2S3 (9.61%), which deliver an ultrahigh potassium storage capacity of above 600 mAh g&#8722;1 and capacity retention of 76% after 500 cycles, together with the built&#8208;in electric field of heterostructures. Once the heterostructures are used as an anode for potassium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (K&#8208;DIBs), it achieves a superior full&#8208;cell capacity of &#8776;166 mAh g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 71% after 400 cycles, which is an outstanding performance among the reported K&#8208;DIBs. This proposed interface stacking strategy may offer a new way toward stable heterostructure design for metal ions storage and transport applications.

         <title>Achieving Sustainable and Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries by Leaf&#8208;Bioinspired Nanofluidic Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A leaf&#8208;bioinspired electrode configuration with nanofluidic flow is proposed. When applied in K&#63743;CoS2 and K&#63743;S battery systems, the designed sustainable electrodes show advanced steady cycling stability and rapid energy conversion. This biomimetic integrated electrode engineering can enable anisotropic electrolyte flux to achieve regulated surface shielding, which may be a universal way to tackle the shuttle problems facing high&#8208;capacity electrodes.








Abstract
In nature, living systems have evolved integrated structures, matching optimized nanofluidics to adapt to external conditions. In rechargeable batteries, high&#8208;capacity electrodes are often plagued by the crucial and universal bottleneck of dissolution and shuttle of active substance into electrolyte, posing obstacles of inevitable capacity degradation. Introducing the concept of intelligent nanofluidics to electrodes, a leaf&#8208;bioinspired electrode configuration with hierarchical architecture to tackle this problem is proposed. This integrated structure with fine&#8208;tuned surface pores and unobstructed interior porous media, can spatially control the anisotropic nanofluidic flux, in an efficient and self&#8208;protectable way: tailoring the outflow across the electrode's surface and free transport in interior, to ensure speedy and stable energy conversion. As proofs of concept, applications of sustainable electrodes rejuvenated from fallen leaf and spent commercial batteries, are designed with leaf&#8208;bioinspired architecture. Both K&#63743;CoS2 and K&#63743;S battery systems show advanced steady cycling with effectively mitigated shuttle issues in this smart architecture (0.15% and 0.21% capacity decay per cycle), even at high areal mass loading, when compared with open porous structure (0.60% and 0.39%). This work may pave a new way from a biomimetic view to integrated electrode engineering with regulated surface shielding to conquer the universal dissolution&#8211;shuttle problems facing high&#8208;capacity materials.

         <title>4D Printing of Freestanding Liquid Crystal Elastomers via Hybrid Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hybrid 4D printing method, which integrates laser&#8208;assisted direct ink writing and Digital Light Processing, is developed to fabricate freestanding liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; with optional structural or removable materials. Various architectures, including hybrid active lattices, active tensegrities, loading&#8208;bearing actuators, and spatial LCE lattices, can be successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) are appealing candidates among active materials for 4D printing, due to their reversible, programmable and rapid actuation capabilities. Recent progress has been made on direct ink writing (DIW) or Digital Light Processing (DLP) to print LCEs with certain actuation. However, it remains a challenge to achieve complicated structures, such as spatial lattices with large actuation, due to the limitation of printing LCEs on the build platform or the previous layer. Herein, a novel method to 4D print freestanding LCEs on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by using laser&#8208;assisted DIW with an actuation strain up to &#8722;40% is proposed. This process is further hybridized with the DLP method for optional structural or removable supports to create active 3D architectures in a one&#8208;step additive process. Various objects, including hybrid active lattices, active tensegrity, an actuator with tunable stability, and 3D spatial LCE lattices, can be additively fabricated. The combination of DIW&#8208;printed functionally freestanding LCEs with the DLP&#8208;printed supporting structures thus provides new design freedom and fabrication capability for applications including soft robotics, smart structures, active metamaterials, and smart wearable devices.

         <title>A Simple Preheating&#8208;Pyrolysis Strategy Leading to Superior Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity in Fe&#8208;N/Carbon Black</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple pyrolysis strategy by mixing FeSO4, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, and carbon black can impart high oxygen reduction reaction activities and stabilities to commercial carbon black; the catalyst obtained by this simple method has a stronger catalytic activity than metal&#8211;organic frameworks derived carbon, metal&#8208;loaded graphene, and single&#8208;atom sites catalysts. This approach can also be extended to other nitrogen&#8208;containing ligands.








Abstract
Maintaining the high catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while reducing costs is a long&#8208;standing effort to promote the application of polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Here, the binding of nitrogen&#8208;containing ligands and carbon black is enhanced by controlling the pyrolysis conditions of a FeSO4, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), carbon black mixture, which significantly improves the ORR catalytic activity of the pyrolysis products. Preheating is proposed as a process improvement method using a heat treatment at a temperature between the melting and boiling points of phen before high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, which achieves an effective combination of phen and carbon black, and enhances the interaction between phen and ferrous ions. This method substantially increases the number of FeNx active centers in the pyrolysis product, resulting in an impressive Fe&#8208;N/C catalyst with half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) up to 0.93&#160;V and a diffusion&#8208;limited current density (jL) of 5.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 and no obvious decay after 20&#160;000 cyclic voltammetry cycles in 0.1&#160;m&#160;KOH, which are all among the best&#8208;reported data known to date. The interaction between the ratio of Fe/phen and the pyrolysis conditions is also investigated. Under the right conditions, cheap raw materials can also generate highly catalytically active sites.

         <title>Isolating Single and Few Atoms for Enhanced Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts have become an attractive frontier in the field of catalysis. The latest advances in synthesis strategies, local environment regulation, and catalytic applications, covering single&#8208;atom, dual&#8208;atom, and atomic cluster catalysts, are reviewed, while practical solutions to inspire the microenvironment regulation of active sites in the isolated few atom systems are provided.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts have triggered great interest in the field of catalysis owing to their unique features. Isolated single or few metal atoms can be anchored on substrates via chemical bonding or space confinement to maximize atom utilization efficiency. The key challenge lies in precisely regulating the geometric and electronic structure of the active metal centers, thus significantly influencing the catalytic properties. Although several reviews have been published on the preparation, characterization, and application of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the comprehensive understanding of SACs, dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), and atomic clusters has never been systematically summarized. Here, recent advances in the engineering of local environments of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SACs, DACs, and atomic clusters for enhanced catalytic performance are highlighted. Firstly, various synthesis approaches for SACs, DACs, and atomic clusters are presented. Then, special attention is focused on the elucidation of local environments in terms of electronic state and coordination structure. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary of isolated single and few atoms for the applications of thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis is provided. Finally, the potential challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field are presented. This review will pave the way to regulate the microenvironment of the active site for boosting catalytic processes.

         <title>Impact of Side&#8208;Chain Hydrophilicity on Packing, Swelling, and Ion Interactions in Oxy&#8208;Bithiophene Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular dynamics and X&#8208;ray diffraction is used to characterize mixed&#8208;transport conjugated polymers packing, ability to swell, and chelate with ions. It is shown that glycol side chains can induce tilted &#960;&#8208;stacks, allow water flow into the lamellar stack, and form single and double bound chelates.








Abstract
Exchanging hydrophobic alkyl&#8208;based side chains to hydrophilic glycol&#8208;based side chains is a widely adopted method for improving mixed&#8208;transport device performance, despite the impact on solid&#8208;state packing and polymer&#8208;electrolyte interactions being poorly understood. Presented here is a molecular dynamics (MD) force field for modeling alkoxylated and glycolated polythiophenes. The force field is validated against known packing motifs for their monomer crystals. MD simulations, coupled with X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), show that alkoxylated polythiophenes will pack with a &#8220;tilted stack&#8221; and straight interdigitating side chains, whilst their glycolated counterpart will pack with a &#8220;deflected stack&#8221; and an s&#8208;bend side&#8208;chain configuration. MD simulations reveal water penetration pathways into the alkoxylated and glycolated crystals&#8212;through the &#960;&#8208;stack and through the lamellar stack respectively. Finally, the two distinct ways triethylene glycol polymers can bind to cations are revealed, showing the formation of a metastable single bound state, or an energetically deep double bound state, both with a strong side&#8208;chain length dependence. The minimum energy pathways for the formation of the chelates are identified, showing the physical process through which cations can bind to one or two side chains of a glycolated polythiophene, with consequences for ion transport in bithiophene semiconductors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchanging hydrophobic alkyl-based side chains to hydrophilic glycol-based side chains is a widely adopted method for improving mixed-transport device performance, despite the impact on solid-state packing and polymer-electrolyte interactions being poorly understood. Presented here is a molecular dynamics (MD) force field for modeling alkoxylated and glycolated polythiophenes. The force field is validated against known packing motifs for their monomer crystals. MD simulations, coupled with X-ray diffraction (XRD), show that alkoxylated polythiophenes will pack with a &#8220;tilted stack&#8221; and straight interdigitating side chains, whilst their glycolated counterpart will pack with a &#8220;deflected stack&#8221; and an s-bend side-chain configuration. MD simulations reveal water penetration pathways into the alkoxylated and glycolated crystals&#8212;through the &#960;-stack and through the lamellar stack respectively. Finally, the two distinct ways triethylene glycol polymers can bind to cations are revealed, showing the formation of a metastable single bound state, or an energetically deep double bound state, both with a strong side-chain length dependence. The minimum energy pathways for the formation of the chelates are identified, showing the physical process through which cations can bind to one or two side chains of a glycolated polythiophene, with consequences for ion transport in bithiophene semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Phase Transition for Durable Formamidinium&#8208;Dominated Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation and growth mechanisms of the phase transition between &#945; and &#948; phase of formamidinium (FA)1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 are proposed. Based on these understandings, the lifetime of FA&#8208;dominated perovskite solar cells is successfully extended under humidity through either heat healing (leads to &#948;&#8208;to&#8208;&#945; phase transition) or continuous 60&#160;&#176;C heating (kinetically stabilized &#945; phase).








Abstract
Phase instability is one of the major obstacles to the wide application of formamidinium (FA)&#8208;dominated perovskite solar cells (PSCs). An in&#8208;depth investigation on relevant phase transitions is urgently needed to explore more effective phase&#8208;stabilization strategies. Herein, the reversible phase&#8208;transition process of FA1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 perovskite between photoactive phase (&#945; phase) and non&#8208;photoactive phase (&#948; phase) under humidity, as well as the reversible healing of degraded devices, is monitored. Moreover, through in situ atomic force microscopy, the kinetic transition between &#945; and &#948; phase is revealed to be the &#8220;nucleation&#8211;growth transition&#8221; process. Density functional theory calculation implies an enthalpy&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;to&#8208;&#948; degradation process during humidity aging and an entropy&#8208;driven &#948;&#8208;to&#8208;&#945; healing process at high temperatures. The &#945; phase of FA1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 can be stabilized at elevated temperature under high humidity due to the increased nucleation barrier, and the resulting non&#8208;encapsulated PSCs retain &gt;90% of their initial efficiency after &gt;1000 h at 60&#160;&#176;C and 60% relative humidity. This finding provides a deepened understanding on the phase&#8208;transition process of FA1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 from both thermodynamics and kinetics points of view, which also presents an effective means to stabilize the &#945; phase of FA&#8208;dominated perovskites and devices for practical applications.

Abstract
The development of eco&#8208;friendly, ultralow&#8208;power and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process electronics is facing dominant challenges in emerging off&#8208;the&#8208;grid applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) and extreme environment explorations at the south/north&#160;pole, in the deep sea, and in outer space. Eco&#8208;friendly, biodegradable, lightweight and flexible paper&#8208;based electronics can provide many new possibilities for next&#8208;generation devices and circuits. Here, we first built enhancement&#8208;mode (E&#8208;mode, remaining off state at zero gate voltages) carbon nanotube (CNT) complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) on paper substrates through a printing&#8208;based process. Benefitting from the CMOS circuit style and E&#8208;mode transistors, the fabricated CMOS inverters exhibit high voltage gains (more than 11) and noise margins (up to 75% 1/2 VDD at VDD of 0.4&#160;V), and rail&#8208;to&#8208;rail operation down to a VDD as low as 0.2&#160;V and record low power dissipation as low as 0.0124 pW/&#956;m. Furthermore, the transistors and integrated circuits (ICs) show an excellent radiation tolerance of a total ionizing dose (TID) exceeding 2 Mrad with a high dose rate of 365&#8201;rad&#8201;s&#8722;1. The record power consumption and outstanding radiation tolerance behaviour achieved in paper&#8208;based and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process CNT electronics are attractive for emerging energy&#8208;saving and environmentally friendly ICs in harsh environment (such as outer&#8208;space) applications.

         <title>Room Temperature Negative Differential Resistance and High Tunneling Current Density in GeSn Esaki Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors (TFETs) are a promising candidate for low&#8208;power applications owing to their steep subthreshold swing of sub&#8208;60 mV/decade. For silicon or germanium&#8208;based TFETs, the drive current is low due to the indirect band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling (BTBT) process. Direct&#8208;bandgap germanium&#8208;tin (GeSn) can boost the TFET performance since phonon participation is not required during the tunneling process. Esaki diodes with negative differential resistance (NDR) are used to characterize the BTBT properties and calibrate the tunneling rates for TFET applications. This work demonstrates high&#8208;performance GeSn Esaki diodes with clear NDR at room temperature with very high peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios of 15 &#8764; 53 from 300 K to 4 K. We&#160;also report a record high peak current density of 545 kA/cm2 at 4 K for the tensile&#8208;strained Ge0.925Sn0.075 device (strain &#8764; 0.6 %). By applying tensile stresses to n&#8208;GeSn epitaxial films, the direct BTBT process dominates, leading to high tunneling rates. Hall measurements further confirm that more electrons populate in the direct &#915; valley in the tensile&#8208;strained n&#8208;GeSn epitaxial&#160;films.

&lt;p&gt;Tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) are a promising candidate for low-power applications owing to their steep subthreshold swing of sub-60 mV/decade.

         <title>Interspace and Vacancy Modulation: Promoting the Zinc Storage of Alcohol&#8208;Based Organic&#8211;Inorganic Cathode in Water&#8211;Organic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Expanding interspace and introducing vacancies are desired to promote the mobility of Zn ions and unlock the inactive sites of layered cathode. However, this two&#8208;point modulation has not yet been achieved simultaneously in vanadium phosphate. Here, we propose a strategy for fabricating an alcohol&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid material, VO1&#8208;xPO4&#8226;0.56C6H14O4, to realise the conjoint modulation of d&#8208;interspace and oxygen vacancies. Peculiar triglycol molecules with an inclined orientation in the interlayer also boost the improvement in the conversion rate of V5+ to V4+ and the intensity of the P&#8208;O bond. Their synergism can ensure steerable adjustment for intercalation kinetics and electron transport, as well as realise high chemical reactivity and redox&#8208;center optimisation, leading to at least 200% increase in capacity. Using water&#8211;organic electrolyte, the designed Zn&#8208;ion batteries with an ultrahigh&#8208;rate profile delivered a long&#8208;term durability (fivefold greater than pristine material) and an excellent energy density of &#8764;142&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (including masses of cathode and anode), thereby substantially outstripping most recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This work proved the feasibility to realise the two&#8208;point modulation by using organic intercalants for exploiting high&#8208;performance new 2D materials.

Abstract
Suppressing nonradiative recombination at the interface between the organometal halide perovskite (PVK) and the charge transport layer (CTL) is crucial for improving the efficiency and stability of PVK&#8208;based solar cells (PSCs). Here, we synthesized a new bathocuproine (BCP)&#8208;based nonconjugated polyelectrolyte (poly&#8208;BCP) and introduced this as a &#8220;dual&#8208;side passivation layer&#8221; between the tin oxide (SnO2) CTL and the PVK absorber. Poly&#8208;BCP significantly suppressed both bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination by passivating oxygen&#8208;vacancy defects from the SnO2 side and simultaneously scavenging ionic defects from the other (PVK) side. Therefore, PSCs with poly&#8208;BCP exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.4% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.21&#160;V with a reduced voltage loss (PVK bandgap of 1.56&#160;eV). The nonencapsulated PSCs also showed excellent long&#8208;term stability by retaining 93% of the initial PCE after 700 hours under continuous 1&#8208;sun irradiation in nitrogen atmosphere conditions.

         <title>A Novel Multi&#8208;sulfur Source Collaborative Chemical Bath Deposition Technology Enables 8%&#8208;efficiency Sb2S3 Planar Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sb2S3 as a light&#8208;harvesting material has attracted great attention for applications in both single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells. Such solar cell has been faced with current challenge of low power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has stagnated for eight years. It has been recognized that the synthesis of high&#8208;quality absorber film plays a critical role in efficiency improvement. Here, using fresh precursor materials for antimony (antimony potassium tartrate) and combined sulfur (sodium thiosulfate and thioacetamide), we created a unique chemical bath deposition procedure. Due to the complexation of sodium thiosulfate and the advantageous hydrolysis cooperation between these two sulfur sources, the heterogeneous nucleation and the S2&#8211; releasing processes are boosted. As a result, there are noticeable improvements in the deposition rate, film morphology, crystallinity, and preferred orientations. Additionally, the improved film quality efficiently lowers charge trapping capacity, suppresses carrier recombination, and prolongs carrier lifetimes, leading to significantly improved photoelectric properties. Ultimately, the PCE exceeded 8% for the first time since 2014, representing the highest efficiency in all kinds of Sb2S3 solar cells to date. This study is expected to shed new light on the fabrication of high&#8208;quality Sb2S3 film and further efficiency improvement in Sb2S3 solar cells.

         <title>Sprayable hydrogel for instant sealing of vascular anastomosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bleeding&#8208;related complications following vascular surgeries occur in up to half of the patients&#8212;500,000 cases annually in the US alone. This results in additional procedures, increased mortality rate, and prolonged hospitalization, posing a burden on the healthcare system. Commercially&#8208;available materials rely, in large, on forming covalent bonds between the tissue and the biomaterial to achieve adhesion. Here we show that a biomaterial based on oxidized alginate and oxidized dextran together with PAMAM dendrimer amine provides simultaneous electrostatic&#8208; and covalent&#8208;interactions between the biomaterial and the tissue, maximizing adhesion. We found that our material withstands supraphysiological pressures (&#8764;300&#160;mmHg) and prevents bleeding in a rabbit aortic puncture model and in a pig carotid bilateral polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft model&#8212;achieving superior performance to commercially&#8208;available materials such as Tisseel and BioGlue. Material biocompatibility was validated in comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA guidelines, including in&#8208;vitro Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) test, subcutaneous implantation in rabbits, ames genotoxicity and guinea&#8208;pig maximization&#8208;test. This material has the potential to provide with adequate seal and reduced complications following complex vascular surgeries, including hard&#8208;to&#8208;seal tissue:graft interfaces.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Measurement of Cell Mechanics as a Clinically Relevant Readout of an In Vitro Lung Fibrosis Model Established on a Bioinspired Basement Membrane</title>

Abstract
Lung fibrosis, as one of the major post&#8208;COVID complications, is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease without a cure. Here, we introduce an organ&#8208; and disease&#8208;specific&#160;in vitro&#160;mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model equipped with non&#8208;invasive real&#8208;time monitoring of cell mechanics as a functional readout. To establish an intricate multi&#8208;culture model under physiologic conditions, we developed a biomimetic ultrathin basement (BETA) membrane (&lt;1&#160;&#956;m)&#160;with unique properties, including biocompatibility,&#160;permeability, and high elasticity (&lt;10&#160;kPa) for cell culturing under air&#8208;liquid interface (ALI) and cyclic mechanical stretch conditions. The human&#8208;based triple co&#8208;culture fibrosis model, which includes epithelial and endothelial cell lines combined with primary fibroblasts from&#160;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients established on the BETA membrane, is integrated into a millifluidic bioreactor system (CIVIC) with dose&#8208;controlled aerosolized drug delivery, mimicking inhalation therapy. We show the real&#8208;time measurement of cell/tissue stiffness (and compliance) as a clinical biomarker of the progression/attenuation of fibrosis upon drug treatment, which was confirmed for&#160;inhaled&#160;Nintedanib &#8211;an FDA&#8208;approved anti&#8208;fibrosis drug.&#160;The mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model allows the combined longitudinal testing of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs, which is expected to enhance the predictive capacity of&#160;preclinical&#160;models&#160;and hence facilitate the development of approved therapies for lung fibrosis.

         <title>A Silica Reinforced Composite Electrolyte with Greatly Enhanced Interfacial Lithium&#8208;Ion Transfer Kinetics for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes with superior ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength is urgently desired to improve the safety and cycling stability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a novel solid&#8208;like electrolyte with enhanced Li+ interfacial transfer kinetics is rationally designed by soaking bulk nanostructured silica&#8208;polymer composites in liquid electrolytes. Benefiting from the high content of inorganic silica and abundant interfaces for fast Li+ transport channels, the prepared solid&#8208;like electrolyte exhibits superb ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength. Furthermore, fumed silica with a high specific area in the solid&#8208;like electrolyte could homogenize Li+ flux and electrical field gradient. More importantly, a Li2S&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is constructed on lithium metal due to the intimate ion coordination in the solid&#8208;like electrolyte. Therefore, the lithium metal anode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in symmetric Li&#8208;Li cells due to the merits of superior ionic conductivity, high modulus, Li2S rich SEI as well as the homogeneous Li+ flux. Full cells with LiFePO4 cathode can still get a capacity retention of 98% at 0.2C after 400 cycles. The proposed strategy to on quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes provides a promising paradigm for next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Modular Nanostructures Facilitate Low Thermal Conductivity and Ultra&#8208;High Thermoelectric Performance in n&#8208;type SnSe</title>

Abstract
Single crystals of SnSe have gained considerable attention in thermoelectrics due to their unprecedented thermoelectric performance. However, polycrystalline SnSe is more favourable for practical applications due to its facile chemical synthesis procedure, processability and scalability. Though the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of p&#8208;type bulk SnSe polycrystals has reached &gt;2.5, the zT of n&#8208;type counterpart is still lower and lies around &#8764;1.5. Herein, we report record high zT of 2.0 in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe0.92 + x mol% MoCl5 (x = 0 &#8211; 3) samples when measured parallel to the spark plasma sintering (SPS) pressing direction due to the simultaneous optimization of n&#8208;type carrier concentration and enhanced phonon scattering by incorporating modular nano&#8208;heterostructures in SnSe matrix. The successful creation of Se vacancy and substitution of Mo5+ at Sn2+ and Cl&#8722; ions at Se2&#8722; sites effectively enhance the total n&#8208;type carrier concentration, thus improving the electrical conductivity. Modular nanostructures of layered intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n like compounds embedded in SnSe matrix scatters the phonons significantly leading to an ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity of &#8764;0.26&#160;W/mK at 798 K in SnSe0.92 + 3 mol% MoCl5. Here, the 2D layered modular intergrowth compound resembles the nano&#8208;heterostructure and their periodicity of 1.2 &#8211; 2.6&#160;nm in the SnSe matrix matches the phonon mean free path of SnSe, thereby block the heat carrying phonons which result in low &#954;lat and ultra&#8208;high thermoelectric performance in n&#8208;type SnSe.

         <title>Simultaneously Enhancing Exciton/Charge Transport in Organic Solar Cells by Organoboron Additive</title>

Abstract
Efficient exciton diffusion and charge transport play a vital role in advancing power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, a facile strategy is presented to simultaneously enhance exciton/charge transport of the widely studied PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs by employing highly emissive trans&#8208;bis(dimesitylboron)stilbene (BBS) as a solid additive. BBS transforms the emissive sites from more H&#8208;type aggregate into more J&#8208;type aggregate, which benefits the resonance energy transfer for PM6 exciton diffusion and energy transfer from PM6 to Y6. Transient gated photoluminescence spectroscopy measurement indicates that addition of BBS improves exciton diffusion coefficient of PM6 and dissociation of PM6 excitons in PM6:Y6:BBS film. Transient absorption spectroscopy measurement confirms faster charge generation in PM6:Y6:BBS. Moreover, BBS helps improve Y6 crystallization, and current sensing atomic force microscopy characterization reveals improved charge carrier diffusion length in PM6:Y6:BBS. Owing to enhanced exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, charge generation and charge transport, as well as reduced charge recombination and energy loss, a higher PCE of 17.6% with simultaneously improved open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current density and fill factor is achieved for the PM6:Y6:BBS devices compared to the devices without BBS (16.2%).

         <title>Eliminating the Micropore Confinement Effect of Carbonaceous Electrodes for Promoting Zn&#8208;Ion Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Zn2+ storage capability of carbonaceous materials is boosted by eliminating the micropore confinement effect and synchronously enhancing the utilization of active sites. Systematic ex situ characterizations coupled with in situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and Raman spectra certify that the excellent Zn2+ storage capability is attributed to the synergistic effect of Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8211; co&#8208;adsorption mechanism and invertible chemical adsorption.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs) are promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage by integrating the attributes of supercapacitors and zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, the insufficient Zn2+&#8208;storage active sites of carbonaceous cathode materials and the mismatch of pore sizes with charge carriers lead to unsatisfactory Zn2+ storage capability. Herein, new insights for boosting Zn2+ storage capability of activated nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon materials (ANHPC&#8208;x) are&#160;reported by effectively eliminating the micropore confinement effect and synchronously elevating the utilization of active sites. Therefore, the best&#8208;performed ANHPC&#8208;2 delivers impressive electrochemical properties for ZICs in terms of excellent capacity (199.1 mAh g&#8722;1), energy density (155.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), and durability (65&#160;000 cycles). Systematic ex situ&#160;characterizations together with in situ&#160;electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and Raman spectra measurements reveal that the remarkable electrochemical performance is assigned to the synergism of the Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8722; co&#8208;adsorption mechanism and reversible chemical adsorption. Furthermore, the ANHPC&#8208;2&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZIC demonstrates excellent electrochemical capability with an ultralong lifespan of up to 100 000 cycles. This work not only provides a promising strategy to improve the Zn2+ storage capability of carbonaceous materials but also sheds lights on charge&#8208;storage mechanism and advanced electrode materials&#8217; design for ZICs toward practical applications.

         <title>Ionogel&#8208;Based Membranes for Safe Lithium/Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes composed of ionic liquids and solid matrices have attracted extensive interest because of their nonvolatility, nonflammability, and superior chemical and electrochemical properties. The most recent advances of ionogel electrolytes in lithium/sodium batteries are summarized. In addition, the current challenges and insights on the future development of ionogel electrolytes for advanced safe lithium/sodium batteries are proposed.








Abstract
Alkali (lithium, sodium)&#8208;based second batteries are considered one of the brightest candidates for energy&#8208;storage applications in order to utilize the random and intermittent renewable energy to achieve carbon neutrality. Conventional lithium/sodium batteries containing liquid organic electrolytes are vulnerable to electrolytes leakage and even combustion, which hinders their large&#8208;scale and reliable application. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes which are considered to have better safety have been developed in recent years. However, most of them suffer from low ionic conductivity and large interfacial resistance with the electrode. Ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes composed of ionic liquids and solid matrices, have attracted much attention because of their nonvolatility, nonflammability, and superior chemical and electrochemical properties. This review focuses on the most recent advances of ionogel electrolytes that sprang up with the emerging demand and progress of safe lithium/sodium batteries. The ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes are discussed based on the framework components and preparation methods. Their structure and properties, including ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, electrochemical stabilities, and so on, are demonstrated in combination with their applications. The current challenges and insights on the future development of ionogel electrolytes for advanced safe lithium/sodium batteries are also proposed.

         <title>Efficient and Stable 3D/2D Perovskite Solar Cells through Vertical Heterostructures with (BA)4AgBiBr8 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(BA)4AgBiBr8 2D perovskite nanosheets are used to construct vertical heterostructures with 3D perovskite to serve as a barrier layer to suppress the ion diffusion and nonradiation recombination from 3D perovskite to metal electrode. The performance and stability of perovskite solar cells are simultaneously enhanced after the incorporation of the 2D nanosheets.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have drawn great attention due to their high processability and superior photovoltaic properties. However, their further development is often hindered by severe nonradiative recombination at interfaces that decreases power conversion efficiency (PCE). To this end, a facile strategy to construct a 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to reduce the energy loss in PVSCs is developed. The heterostructure is contrived through the van der Waals integration of 2D perovskite ((BA)4AgBiBr8) nanosheets onto the surface of 3D&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites. The large bandgap of (BA)4AgBiBr8 enables the formation of type&#8208;I heterojunction with 3D&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites, which serves as a barrier to suppress the trap&#8208;assisted recombination at the interface. As a result, a satisfying PCE of 24.48% is achieved with an improved open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.13 to 1.17&#160;V. Moreover, the 2D perovskite nanosheets can effectively mitigate the iodide ion diffusion from perovskite to the metal electrode, hence enhancing the device stability. 3D/2D architectured devices retain &#8776;90% of their initial PCE under continuous illumination or heating after 1000 h, which are superior to 3D&#8208;based devices. This work provides an effective and controllable strategy to construct 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to simultaneously boost the efficiency and stability of PVSCs.

&lt;p&gt;(BA)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiBr&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; 2D perovskite nanosheets are used to construct vertical heterostructures with 3D perovskite to serve as a barrier layer to suppress the ion diffusion and nonradiation recombination from 3D perovskite to metal electrode. The performance and stability of perovskite solar cells are simultaneously enhanced after the incorporation of the 2D nanosheets.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have drawn great attention due to their high processability and superior photovoltaic properties. However, their further development is often hindered by severe nonradiative recombination at interfaces that decreases power conversion efficiency (PCE). To this end, a facile strategy to construct a 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to reduce the energy loss in PVSCs is developed. The heterostructure is contrived through the van der Waals integration of 2D perovskite ((BA)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiBr&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) nanosheets onto the surface of 3D-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based perovskites. The large bandgap of (BA)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiBr&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; enables the formation of type-I heterojunction with 3D-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based perovskites, which serves as a barrier to suppress the trap-assisted recombination at the interface. As a result, a satisfying PCE of 24.48% is achieved with an improved open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) from 1.13 to 1.17&#160;V. Moreover, the 2D perovskite nanosheets can effectively mitigate the iodide ion diffusion from perovskite to the metal electrode, hence enhancing the device stability. 3D/2D architectured devices retain &#8776;90% of their initial PCE under continuous illumination or heating after 1000 h, which are superior to 3D-based devices. This work provides an effective and controllable strategy to construct 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to simultaneously boost the efficiency and stability of PVSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A unique &#8220;superconcentrated ionogel&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic&#8221; electrolyte is newly developed by conglutinating garnet with superconcentrated ionogel. Such electrolyte not only demonstrates a superior ionic conductivity of 1.33 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, but also a large Li+&#8208;ion transference number of 0.89. The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries using this electrolyte reveal excellent cycling performance.








Abstract
High room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivities, large Li+&#8208;ion transference numbers, and good compatibility with both Li&#8208;metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes of the solid electrolytes are the essential requirements for practical solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, a unique &#8220;superconcentrated ionogel&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic&#8221; (SIC) electrolyte prepared by an in situ thermally initiated radical polymerization is reported. Solid&#8208;state static 7Li NMR and molecular dynamics simulation reveal the roles of ceramic in Li+ local environments and transport in the SIC electrolyte. The SIC electrolyte not only exhibits an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 1.33 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, but also a Li+&#8208;ion transference number as high as 0.89, together with a low electronic conductivity of 3.14 &#215; 10&#8722;10 S cm&#8722;1 and a wide electrochemical stability window of 5.5&#160;V versus Li/Li+. Applications of the SIC electrolyte in Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 and Li||LiFePO4 batteries further demonstrate the high rate and long cycle life. This study, therefore, provides a promising hybrid electrolyte for safe and high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>3D Printing Flexible Sodium&#8208;Ion Microbatteries with Ultrahigh Areal Capacity and Robust Rate Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prototype of fully 3D&#8208;printed planar flexible sodium&#8208;ion microbatteries is demonstrated with 3D interconnected conductive thick microelectrodes via multilayer printing for ultrahigh areal capacity and robust rate capability, benefiting from the elaborate printable inks and impressive ion/charge&#8208;transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion microbatteries (NIMBs) constructed using low&#8208;cost and abundant raw materials in planar configuration with both cathode and anode on the same substrate hold promise for powering coplanar microelectronics, but are hindered by the low areal capacity owing to the thin microelectrodes. Here, a prototype of planar and flexible 3D&#8208;printed NIMBs is demonstrated with 3D interconnected conductive thick microelectrodes for ultrahigh areal capacity and boosted rate capability. Rationally optimized 3D printable inks with appropriate viscosities and high conductivity allow the multilayer printing of NIMB microelectrodes reaching a very high thickness of &#8776;1200&#160;&#181;m while maintaining effective ion and electron&#8208;transfer pathways in them. Consequently, the 3D&#8208;printed NIMBs deliver superior areal capacity of 4.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 (2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art printed microbatteries. The NIMBs show enhanced rate capability with 3.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and robust long&#8208;term cycle life up to 6000 cycles. Furthermore, the planar NIMB microelectrodes, despite the large thickness, exhibit decent mechanical flexibility under various bending conditions. This work opens a new avenue for the construction of high&#8208;performance NIMBs with thick microelectrodes capable of powering flexible microelectronics.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Site Engineering of Defective Fe&#8211;N4 Nanozymes with Boosted Catalase&#8208;Like Performance for Retinal Vasculopathies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Fe&#8208;SANzyme) with defective Fe&#8211;N4 sites is fabricated by edge&#8208;site engineering. The abundant edge&#8208;hosted Fe&#8211;N4 sites endow Fe&#8208;SANzyme with boosted catalase&#8208;like activity, which is significantly higher than the reference with integral Fe&#8211;N4 sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, pathological vascular dysfunction is effectively alleviated in animal models of retinal vasculopathies treated with antioxidant Fe&#8208;SANzyme.








Abstract
Extensive efforts are devoted to refining metal sites for optimizing the catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SANzymes), while the contribution of the defect environment of neighboring metal sites lacks attention. Herein, an iron&#8208;based SANzyme (Fe&#8208;SANzyme) is rationally designed by edge&#8208;site engineering, which intensively exposes edge&#8208;hosted defective Fe&#8211;N4 atomic sites anchored in hierarchical mesoporous structures. The Fe&#8208;SANzyme exhibits excellent catalase&#8208;like activity capable of efficiently catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 and H2O, with a catalytic kinetic KM value superior to that of natural catalase and reported nanozymes. The mechanistic studies depict that the defects introduce notable charge transfer from the Fe atom to the carbon matrix, making the central Fe more activated to strengthen the interaction with H2O2 and weaken the O&#63743;O bond. By performing catalase&#8208;like catalysis, the Fe&#8208;SANzyme significantly scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviates oxidative stress, thus eliminating the pathological angiogenesis in animal models of retinal vasculopathies without affecting the repair of normal vessels. This work provides a new way to refine SANzymes by engineering the defect environment and geometric structure around metal sites, and demonstrates the potential therapeutic effects of the nanozyme on retinal vasculopathies.

         <title>Dynamic Liquid Metal Catalysts for Boosted Lithium Polysulfides Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium&#8211;tin alloy, one of the promising liquid metals at room temperature, is applied to lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries as a novel liquid electrocatalyst with a dynamic feature, which can drastically reduce the activation energy barrier of the lithium polysulfides redox reaction, enhance the overall electrochemical kinetics, and achieve improvement of the specific energy density of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Designing efficient electrocatalysts with high electroconductivity, strong chemisorption, and superior catalytical efficiency to realize rapid kinetics of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion process is crucial for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery applications.

&lt;p&gt;Gallium&#8211;tin alloy, one of the promising liquid metals at room temperature, is applied to lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries as a novel liquid electrocatalyst with a dynamic feature, which can drastically reduce the activation energy barrier of the lithium polysulfides redox reaction, enhance the overall electrochemical kinetics, and achieve improvement of the specific energy density of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing efficient electrocatalysts with high electroconductivity, strong chemisorption, and superior catalytical efficiency to realize rapid kinetics of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion process is crucial for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery applications. Unfortunately, most current electrocatalysts cannot maintain long-term stability due to the possible failure of catalytic sites. Herein, a novel dynamic electrocatalytic strategy with the liquid metal (i.e., gallium&#8211;tin, EGaSn) to facilitate LiPSs redox reaction is reported. The combined theoretical simulations and microstructure experiment analysis reveal that Sn atoms dynamically distributed in the liquid Ga matrix act as the main active catalytic center.

         <title>Atomically Thin Synapse Networks on Van Der Waals Photo&#8208;Memtransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of an atomistic synaptic network on an atomically thin van der Waals heterostructure, where the ultrasmall cells built with trilayer tungsten disulfide (WS2) semiconductor serve as a gate&#8208;tunable photoactive synapse, is demonstrated. UV pulses onto the memristor generate dopants in atomic&#8208;level precision by direct light&#8211;lattice interactions, leading to the accurate modulation of the synaptic cells.








Abstract
A new type of atomically thin synaptic network on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is reported, where each ultrasmall cell (&#8776;2&#160;nm thick) built with trilayer WS2 semiconductor acts as a gate&#8208;tunable photoactive synapse, i.e., a photo&#8208;memtransistor. A train of UV pulses onto the WS2 memristor generates dopants in atomic&#8208;level precision by direct light&#8211;lattice interactions, which, along with the gate tunability, leads to the accurate modulation of the channel conductance for potentiation and depression of the synaptic cells. Such synaptic dynamics can be explained by a parallel atomistic resistor network model. In addition, it is shown that such a device scheme can generally be realized in other 2D vdW semiconductors, such as MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, and WSe2. Demonstration of these atomically thin photo&#8208;memtransistor arrays, where the synaptic weights can be tuned for the atomistic defect density, provides implications for a new type of artificial neural networks for parallel matrix computations with an ultrahigh integration density.

         <title>A 2D Nanoradiosensitizer Enhances Radiotherapy and Delivers STING Agonists to Potentiate Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) functions as a potent nanoradiosensitizer and a nanocarrier for agonists of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) for cancer treatment. STING agonists are conjugated onto an MOL via phosphate linkages, resulting in prolonged tumor retention and enhanced STING activation. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade extends the scope of this local treatment to elicit systemic antitumor responses.








Abstract
Despite potent preclinical antitumor activity, activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) has shown modest therapeutic effects in clinical studies. Many STING agonists, including 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), show poor pharmacokinetic properties for sustaining STING activation in tumors and achieving optimal antitumor efficacy. Improved delivery of STING agonists and their effective combination with other treatments are needed to enhance their therapeutic effects. Herein, a 2D nanoplatform, cGAMP/MOL, is reported via conjugating cGAMP to a nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) for simultaneous STING activation and radiosensitization. The MOL not only exhibits strong radiosensitization effects for enhanced cancer killing and induction of immunogenic cell death, but also retains cGAMP in tumors for sustained STING activation. Compared to free cGAMP, cGAMP/MOL elicits stronger STING activation and regresses local tumors upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. Further combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor bridges innate and adaptive immune systems by activating the tumor microenvironment to elicit systemic antitumor responses.

         <title>Ultratough Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Bridged Phosphorene Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultratough hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged phosphorene films, which exhibit much higher Young's modulus (316&#160;GPa) than the theoretical value (94&#160;GPa) of black phosphorene, are prepared using the electrochemical intercalation method and further proved by physical characterizations. The underlying mechanism of its excellent mechanical properties is revealed using theoretical calculations.








Abstract
The rapid development of flexible electronic devices, especially based on 2D materials, has triggered the demand for high&#8208;strength materials. Mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer phosphorene with excellent electronic properties has attracted extensive attention. However, phosphorene is affected by its low Young's modulus when applied to flexible electronic devices. Here, a strategy via ion intercalation to significantly improve the mechanical properties of black phosphorus to generate hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged phosphorene films with Young's modulus as high as 316&#160;GPa is reported. This value is several times larger than the theoretical values of 166&#160;GPa in the zigzag direction, 44&#160;GPa in the armchair direction, and the averaged Young's modulus among all directions of 94&#160;GPa. The impact of intercalation on mechanical properties is also explored. Experimental nanoindentation results obtained by atomic force microscopy indicate that the relationship between the ratio of intercalated ions to phosphorus atoms and the corresponding Young's modulus satisfies the formula E=eae&#8722;[ln(x)+b]2c(0&lt;x&#8804;1.80)\[E{\bm{ = }}{e^{a{e^{\frac{{{\bm{ - }}{{[\ln (x){\bm{ + }}b]}^2}}}{c}}}}}(0{\bm{ &amp;lt; }}x{\bm{ \le }}1.80)\]. Furthermore, a flexible NO2 gas sensor device based on this ultratough material presents excellent performance, even after 10&#160;000 bending cycles. The results provide new insight into the potential for practical applications of black phosphorus devices.

         <title>Bionic Regulators Break the Ecological Niche of Pathogenic Bacteria for Modulating Dysregulated Microbiome in Colitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the specific binding between the mannose&#8208;rich yeast cell wall (YCW) and Escherichia coli strains, a bionic regulator (CaWO4@YCW) is developed to regulate the gut microbiome. CaWO4@YCW can efficiently and precisely reprogram the gut microbiome by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and providing prebiotics, resulting in an extraordinary therapeutic advantage for DSS&#8208;induced colitis.








Abstract
Therapeutic approaches that reprogram the gut microbiome are promising strategies to alleviate and cure inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, abnormal expansion of Escherichia coli during inflammation can promote pathogenic bacteria occupying ecological niches to resist reprogramming of the microbiome. Herein, a bionic regulator (CaWO4@YCW) is developed to efficiently and precisely regulate the gut microbiome by specifically suppressing the abnormal expansion of E. coli during colitis and boosting probiotic growth. Inspired by the binding of E. coli strains to the mannose&#8208;rich yeast cell wall (YCW), YCW is chosen as the bionic shell to encapsulate CaWO4. It is demonstrated that the YCW shell endows CaWO4 with superior resistance to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract and adheres to the abnormally expanded E. coli in colitis, specifically as a positioner. Notably, the high expression of calprotectin at the colitis site triggers the release of tungsten ions through calcium deprivation in CaWO4, thus inhibiting E. coli growth by replacing molybdenum in the molybdopterin cofactor. Moreover, YCW functions as a prebiotic and promotes probiotic growth. Consequently, CaWO4@YCW can efficiently and precisely reprogram the gut microbiome by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and providing prebiotics, resulting in an extraordinary therapeutic advantage for DSS&#8208;induced colitis.

         <title>Challenging Bendable Organic Single Crystal and Transistor Arrays with High Mobility and Durability toward Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area, ultrathin, and highly aligned organic single&#8208;crystal arrays are readily available for flexible electronics through a polymer&#8208;template&#8208;assisted molecular&#8208;assembly strategy. The proposed strategy is shown to be applicable to a variety of semiconductor molecules, demonstrating its effectiveness. The resulting transistor devices exhibit high mobility, low operating voltage, and high bendable durability.








Abstract
Bendable organic single crystals are promising candidates for flexible electronics owing to their superior charge&#8208;transport properties. However, large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality organic single crystals are rarely available on the polymer substrates generally used in flexible electronics. Here, a surface&#8208;assisted assembly strategy based on a polymer modification, poly(amic acid) (PAA), is developed to grow large&#8208;area organic singe crystals on polymer substrates using a simple drop&#8208;casting method. The unique surface properties of PAA that enable molecular solution superwetting and promote molecular ordered assembly produce an extraordinary self&#8208;driven &#8220;meniscus&#8208;guided coating&#8221; behavior, enabling the fabrication of millimeter&#8208;sized, highly aligned organic single crystals for a variety of organic semiconductors. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on a mode molecule of 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophene demonstrate the highest (average) mobility of 18.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (15.9 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), attractively low operating voltage of &#8722;3&#160;V, and high flexible durability. The results shed light on the large&#8208;area fabrication of organic single crystals on polymer dielectrics toward high&#8208;performance and integrated plastic electronics.

         <title>Phase Transitional Bismuth&#8208;Based Metals Enabled Rapid Embolotherapy, Hyperthermia and Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Embolization has been an important minimally invasive therapy for occlusion of malfunctioned vasculature and tumor treatment via target delivering embolic agents. The limitation of conventional embolic agents, such as fabrication process, precipitation time, invisibility and lack of integrated functions often leads to insufficient embolization efficacy. To overcome these drawbacks, a multifunctional bismuth&#8208;based liquid embolic agent for simultaneous realization of embolotherapy, thermotherapy as well as high contrast biomedical imaging was proposed. Benefitting from the suitable melting point, flexible nature, metallic merit and easygoing operation via injection, the versatile embolic agent can achieve rapid liquid&#8208;solid phase transition, magnetic hyperthermia and multimodal imaging capability. The bismuth&#8208;based materials are demonstrated with excellent arteriovenous embolization efficiency, and favorable biocompatibility according to in vivo investigations. Introduction of the liquid embolic agent to tumor arteries achieved evident tumor regression and rather clear imaging under CT, MRI and thermograph for consistent tracking the implants over the biological body. Further, the combined therapy coupled with thermotherapy exhibited improved therapeutic efficiency with formation of necrosis and total tumor eradiation at day 15 after the treatment. The present innovative embolic agent and the surgical principle provide a promising modality for embolization and potential theranostic platform of tumors.

         <title>Judicious Design and Rapid Manufacturing of Flexible, Mechanically Resistant Liquid&#8208;like Coating with Strong Bonding and Antifouling Abilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;free liquid&#8208;repellent coatings have been highly demanded for a variety of applications. However, rapid formation of coatings possessing outstanding oil repellency and strong bonding ability as well as good mechanical strength (e.g., bendability, impact resistance, and scratch resistance) remains a grand challenge. Herein, we report a robust strategy to rapidly create fluorine&#8208;free oil&#8208;repellent coatings in only 30 s via rational design of a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer network structure. The resulting coating manifests strong bonding capability both in air and underwater. More importantly, it not only provides unprecedented oil repellency, even to high&#8208;viscosity crude oil, but also achieves both excellent bendability and hardness. Our simple yet effective design strategy opens up a new avenue to manufacture multifunctional materials and devices with desirable features and structural complexities for applications in sustainable antifouling, drag reduction, non&#8208;destructive transportation, liquid collection, and biomedicine, among other areas.

         <title>Tumor Selective Metabolic Reprogramming as a Prospective PD&#8208;L1 Depression Strategy to Reactivate Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Currently, the role of the lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or dictyosome in the transcription and translation of Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) was well revealed, but the role and function of mitochondria in the PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumors was still not fully researched, making it hard to offer a novel PD&#8208;L1 regulation strategy. In this research, we newly revealed that mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) depression could be used as an effective PD&#8208;L1 downregulation method. To offer an ideal and high&#8208;effective tumor mitochondria&#8208;targeted OXPHOS depression nanosystem, IR&#8208;LND was prepared by conjugating mitochondria&#8208;targeted heptamethine cyanine dye IR&#8208;68 with mitochondrial complexes &#8544; and &#8545; depression agent Lonidamine (LND), which then further self&#8208;assembled with albumin (Alb) to form IR&#8208;LND@Alb nanoparticles. By doing this, PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumors was selectively and effectively depressed by IR&#8208;LND@Alb nanoparticles. As we expected, the anti&#8208;tumor efficacy of such a PD&#8208;L1 depression strategy was superior to conventional anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibodies. Interestingly, IR&#8208;LND could also be served as a novel ideal promising photodynamic therapy (PDT) drug with self&#8208;oxygen and self&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 regulation capacity. All in all, this tumor&#8208;selective metabolic reprogramming platform to reactivate immunotherapy and sensitize for PDT effect, which would open a new window for mitochondrial immunotherapy for cancer patients.

         <title>Observation of Superconducting Collective Modes from Competing Pairing Instabilities in Single&#8208;layer NbSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In certain unconventional superconductors with sizable electronic correlations, the availability of closely competing pairing channels leads to characteristic soft collective fluctuations of the order parameters, which leave fingerprints in many observables and allow to scrutinize the phase competition. Superconducting layered materials, where electron&#8208;electron interactions are enhanced with decreasing thickness, are promising candidates to display these correlation effects. In this work, we report the existence of a soft collective mode in single&#8208;layer NbSe2, observed as a characteristic resonance excitation in high resolution tunneling spectra. This resonance is observed along with higher harmonics, its frequency &#937;/2&#916; is anticorrelated with the local superconducting gap &#916;, and its amplitude gradually vanishes by increasing the temperature and upon applying a magnetic field up to the critical values (TC and HC2), which sets an unambiguous link to the superconducting state. Aided by a microscopic model that captures the main experimental observations, we interpret this resonance as a collective Leggett mode that represents the fluctuation towards a proximate f&#8208;wave triplet state, due to subleading attraction in the triplet channel. Our findings demonstrate the fundamental role of correlations in superconducting 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, opening a path towards unconventional superconductivity in simple, scalable and transferable 2D superconductors.

Abstract
We report the first experimental realization of the intrinsic (not dominated by defects) charge conduction regime in lead&#8208;halide perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). The advance has been enabled by: i) a new vapor&#8208;phase epitaxy technique that results in large&#8208;area single crystalline cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) films with excellent structural and surface properties, including atomically&#8208;flat surface morphology, essentially free from defects and traps at the level relevant to device operation; ii) an extensive materials analysis of these films using a variety of thin film and surface probes certifying the chemical and structural quality of the material; iii) the fabrication of nearly ideal (trap&#8208;free) FETs with characteristics superior to any reported to date. These devices have allowed the investigation of the intrinsic FET and a (gated) Hall&#8208;effect carrier mobility as a function of temperature. The intrinsic mobility was found to increase on cooling from &#8764; 30 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1 at room temperature to &#8764; 250 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1 at 50 K, revealing a band transport mostly limited by phonon scattering. Establishing the intrinsic (phonon&#8208;limited) mobility provides a solid test for theoretical descriptions of carrier transport in perovskites, reveals basic limits to the technology, and points to a path for ubiquitous future high&#8208;performance perovskite electronic devices.

         <title>From Ferroelectric Material Optimization to Neuromorphic Devices</title>

Abstract
Due to the voltage driven switching at low to moderate voltages combined with a nonvolatile behavior of the achieved polarization state, ferroelectric materials have a unique potential for a wide class of low power nonvolatile electronic devices. However, for many years, the competitivity of such devices was&#160;hindered by the compatibility issues of well&#8208;known ferroelectric materials based on perovskite crystals with established complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. The discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide and related materials changed this situation and opened up a path towards scalable ferroelectric devices. The natural application of any nonvolatile device is as a memory cell in nonvolatile memories. However, the nonvolatile memory devices also built the basis for other applications like in&#8208;memory computing, nonvolatile logic or neuromorphic devices. Based on the readout mechanism three different basic ferroelectric devices can be constructed: ferroelectric capacitors, ferroelectric field effect transistors and ferroelectric tunneling junctions. In this article after an introduction first the material science of the ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide and related materials will be summarized with a special focus on tailoring the switching characteristics towards different nonvolatile applications. A summary of the current status of nonvolatile semiconductor memories using the three fundamental device architectures then lays the ground for looking into applications like in&#8208;memory computing or nonvolatile logic were&#160;the separation between memory function and switching function can be overcome. Finally a special focus will be given to showcase how the basic building blocks of spiking neural networks, the neuron and the synapse, can be realized using the basic ferroelectric devices and how they can be combined to realize neuromorphic computing systems. A summary, comparison with other technologies like resistive switching devices and finally an outlook complete the&#160;paper.

         <title>Atomically Thin, Ionic Covalent Organic Nanosheets for Stable, High&#8208;Performance Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The incorporation of charged functional groups is effective to modulate the activity of molecular complexes for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet the long&#8208;term heterogeneous electrolysis is often hampered due to catalysts leaching. Herein, for the first time, an electrocatalyst of atomically thin, cobalt porphyrin&#8208;based, ionic covalent organic nanosheets (CoTAP&#8208;iCONs) is synthesized via a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy for high&#8208;performance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The cationic quaternary ammonium groups not only enable the formation of monolayer nanosheets due to steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion, but also facilitate the formation of *COOH intermediate as suggested by theoretical calculations. Consequently, CoTAP&#8208;iCONs exhibit higher CO2RR activity than other cobalt porphyrin&#8208;based structures: an 870% and 480% improvement of CO current densities compared to the monomer and neutral nanosheets, respectively. Additionally, the iCONs structure can accommodate the cationic moieties. In a flow cell, CoTAP&#8208;iCONs attain a very small onset overpotential of 40&#160;mV and a stable total current density of 212&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 with CO Faradaic efficiency of &gt;95% at &#8208;0.6&#160;V for 11&#160;h. Further coupling the flow electrolyzer with commercial solar cells yields a solar&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency of 13.89%. This work indicates that atom&#8208;thin, ionic nanosheet is a promising structure for achieving both tailored activity and high stability.

         <title>All Polymer Bulk Heterojunction Organic Electrochemical Transistors with Balanced Ionic and Electronic Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rapid development of organic electrochemical transistor (OECTs)&#8208;based circuits bring new opportunities for next&#8208;generation integrated bioelectronics. All polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) offers an attractive, inexpensive alternative to achieve efficient ambipolar OECTs, and building blocks of logic circuits constructed from them, but have not been investigated till date. Here, we report the first all polymer BHJ&#8208;based OECTs, consisting of a blend of new p&#8208;type ladder conjugated polymer and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type ladder polymer. The optimized BHJ OECTs exhibit balanced ambipolar transistor performance, having uC* values of 2.72&#177;1.04 and 1.36&#177;0.81 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 as p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type channels, respectively. The whole ladder&#8208;type polymer BHJ also proved that side chains are not necessary for good ion transport. Instead, the polymer nanostructures play a critical role in the ion penetration and transport and thus the device performance. It also provides a facile strategy and simplifies the fabrication process, forgoing the need to pattern multiple active layers. In addition, the development of complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;like OECTs allows us to pursue advanced functional logic circuitry, including inverter and NAND gate as well as for amplifying electrophysiology signals. Our work opens a new approach in the design of new materials for OECTs and will contribute to the development of organic heterojunctions for ambipolar OECTs towards high performing logic circuits.&#8195;

         <title>Fully Depleted Self&#8208;Aligned Heterosandwiched Van Der Waals Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel metal&#8208;mirror&#8208;enhanced n&#8211;p&#8211;n van der Waals heterostructure is designed. The device exhibits excellent performance including high blackbody photoresponsivity up to 0.77 A W&#8722;1, high specific detectivity of 8.61&#160;&#215;&#160;1010 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 under blackbody radiation, and fast response speed of &#8776;4 &#181;s.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;operating highly sensitive mid&#8208;wavelength&#160;infrared (MWIR) photodetectors are utilized in a large number of important applications, including night vision, communications, and optical radar. Many previous studies have demonstrated uncooled MWIR photodetectors using 2D narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductors. To date, most of these works have utilized atomically thin flakes, simple van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, or atomically thin p&#8211;n junctions as absorbers, which have difficulty in meeting the requirements for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MWIR photodetectors with a blackbody response. Here, a fully depleted self&#8208;aligned MoS2&#8208;BP&#8208;MoS2 vdW heterostructure sandwiched between two electrodes is reported. This new type of photodetector exhibits competitive performance, including a high blackbody peak photoresponsivity up to 0.77&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and low noise&#8208;equivalent power of 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;14&#160;W&#160;Hz&#8722;1/2, in the MWIR region. A peak specific detectivity of 8.61&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;cm Hz1/2&#160;W&#8722;1 under blackbody radiation is achieved at room temperature in the MWIR region. Importantly, the effective detection range of the device is twice that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MWIR photodetectors. Furthermore, the device presents an ultrafast response of &#8776;4&#160;&#181;s both in the visible and short&#8208;wavelength infrared bands. These results provide an ideal platform for realizing broadband and highly sensitive room&#8208;temperature MWIR photodetectors.

This new type of photodetector exhibits competitive performance, including a high blackbody peak photoresponsivity up to 0.77&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and low noise-equivalent power of 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;14&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;W&#160;Hz&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, in the MWIR region. A peak specific detectivity of 8.61&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm Hz&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under blackbody radiation is achieved at room temperature in the MWIR region. Importantly, the effective detection range of the device is twice that of state-of-the-art MWIR photodetectors. Furthermore, the device presents an ultrafast response of &#8776;4&#160;&#181;s both in the visible and short-wavelength infrared bands. These results provide an ideal platform for realizing broadband and highly sensitive room-temperature MWIR photodetectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Approaching the External Quantum Efficiency Limit in 2D Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy for constructing 2D photovoltaic devices with high performances is demonstrated. The device based on 2D WS2 exhibits nearly ideal external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 92% and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.0%, which are attributed to the defect&#8208;free interface and recombination&#8208;free channel. The nearly ideal EQE provides great potential for PCE approaching the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for realizing ultrathin and high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of most 2D photovoltaic devices face great challenges in exceeding 50% and 3%, respectively, due to the low efficiency of photocarrier separation and collection. Here, this study demonstrates photovoltaic devices with defect&#8208;free interface and recombination&#8208;free channel based on 2D WS2, showing high EQE of 92% approaching the theoretical limit and high PCE of 5.0%. The high performances are attributed to the van der Waals metal contact without interface defects and Fermi&#8208;level pinning, and the fully depleted channel without photocarrier recombination, leading to intrinsic photocarrier separation and collection with high efficiency. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the strategy can be extended to other TMDs such as MoSe2 and WSe2 with EQE of 92% and 94%, respectively. This work proposes a universal strategy for building high&#8208;performance 2D photovoltaic devices. The nearly ideal EQE provides great potential for PCE approaching the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.

         <title>Machine Learning Enhanced Simultaneous and Multimodal Sensor Based on Moist&#8208;Electric Powered Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Simultaneous multimodal monitoring can greatly perceive intricately multiple stimuli, which is important for the understanding and development of future human&#8208;machine fusion world. However, the integrated multi&#8208;sensor network with the cumbersome structure, huge power consumption, and complex preparation process has heavily restricted the practical application. Herein, a graphene oxide single&#8208;component multimodal sensor (GO&#8208;MS) is developed, which enables simultaneous monitoring of multiple environmental stimuli by a single unit with unique moist&#8208;electric self&#8208;power supply. This GO&#8208;MS can generate a sustainable moist&#8208;electric potential by spontaneously adsorbing water molecules in air, which has the characteristic response behavior when exposed to different stimuli. As a result, the simultaneous monitoring and decoupling of the changes of temperature, humidity, pressure, and light intensity has been achieved by this single GO&#8208;MS with machine learning (ML) assistance. Of practical importance, the moist&#8208;electric&#8208;powered human&#8208;machine interaction wristband based on GO&#8208;MS is constructed to monitor pulse signals, body temperature and sweating in a multidimensional manner, as well as the gestures and sign language commands communication. This ML empowered moist&#8208;electric GO&#8208;MS provides a new platform for the development of continuously self&#8208;powered single&#8208;component multimodal sensors, showing great potential for applications in fields of health detection, artificial electronic skin, and many other Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Interfacial Design of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient and Selective Electrocatalysis of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks enable the integration of electron&#8208;conduction and mass&#8208;transport interfaces via one&#8208;pot polycondensation reaction into well&#8208;defined catalytic skeletons, so that the ordered &#960; skeletons promote electron motion and the hydrophobic channels facilitate CO2 delivery to the catalytic centers. The systematic interface design boosts catalytic activity and selectivity to achieve a benchmark electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Assembling molecular catalytic centers into crosslinked networks is widely used to fabricate heterogeneous catalysts but they often suffer loss in activity and selectivity accompanied by unclear causes. Here, a strategy for the construction of heterogeneous catalysts to induce activity and selectivity by bottom&#8208;up introduction of segregated electron&#8208;conduction and mass&#8208;transport interfaces into the catalytic materials is reported. The catalytic skeletons are designed to possess different &#960; orderings for electron motion and the open channels are tailored to install finely engineered walls for mass transport, so that origins of activity and selectivity are correlated. The resultant covalent organic framework catalysts with ordered &#960; skeletons and solvophobic pores increase activity by two orders of magnitude, enhance selectivity and energy efficiency by 70&#8208;fold, and broaden the voltage range, to promote CO2 transformation under ambient conditions. The results open a way to precise interfacial design of actionable heterogeneous catalysts for producing feedstocks from CO2.

         <title>Surface Co&#8208;Modification of Halide Anions and Potassium Cations Promotes High&#8208;Rate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface fluorine&#8208;bonded, single potassium&#8208;atom&#8208;modified Cu(111) nanocrystal (K&#8211;F&#8211;Cu&#8211;CO2) is prepared by in situ electrochemical reconstruction of KCuF3 perovskite. The K&#8211;F&#8211;Cu&#8211;CO2 electrocatalyst exhibits a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol partial current density of 423 &#177; 30 mA cm&#8722;2 with corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 52.9 &#177; 3.7%, and a high electrochemical stability at large current densities.








Abstract
The high&#8208;rate electrochemical CO2 conversion to ethanol with high partial current density is attractive but challenging, which requires competing with other reduction products as well as hydrogen evolution. This work demonstrates the in situ reconstruction of KCuF3 perovskite under CO2 electroreduction conditions to fabricate a surface fluorine&#8208;bonded, single&#8208;potassium&#8208;atom&#8208;modified Cu(111) nanocrystal (K&#8211;F&#8211;Cu&#8211;CO2). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the co&#8208;modification of both F and K atoms on the Cu(111) surface can promote the ethanol pathway via stabilization of the C&#63743;O bond and selective hydrogenation of the C&#63742;C bond in the CH2&#63742;CHO* intermediate, while the single modification of either F or K is less effective. The K&#8211;F&#8211;Cu&#8211;CO2 electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol partial current density of 423 &#177; 30 mA cm&#8722;2 with the corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 52.9 &#177; 3.7%, and a high electrochemical stability at large current densities, thus suggesting an attractive means of surface co&#8208;modification of halide anions and alkali&#8208;metal cations on Cu catalysts for high&#8208;rate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol electrosynthesis.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Protein Glues with Superior Adhesion Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Naturally inspired proteins have been investigated for the development of bioglues that combine adhesion performance and biocompatibility for biomedical applications. However, engineering such adhesives by rational design of the proteins at the molecular level is rarely reported. Herein, we show that a new generation of protein&#8208;based glues is generated by supramolecular assembly through de novo designed structural proteins in which the arginine triggers robust liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. The encoded arginine moieties significantly strengthened multiple molecular interactions in the complex, leading to ultra&#8208;strong adhesion on various surfaces, outperforming many chemically reacted and biomimetic glues. Such adhesive materials enabled quick visceral hemostasis in 10 seconds and outstanding tissue regeneration due to their robust adhesion, good biocompatibility, and superior anti&#8208;bacterial capacity. Remarkably, their minimum inhibitory concentrations are orders of magnitude lower than clinical antibiotics. These advances offer insights into molecular engineering of de novo designed protein glues and outline a general strategy to fabricate mechanically strong protein&#8208;based materials for surgical applications.

         <title>Advanced Non&#8208;Flammable Organic Electrolyte Promises Safer Li Metal Batteries: From Solvation Structure Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Batteries with Li metal anode have recently attracted extensive attention from battery communities owing to their high energy density. However, severe dendrite growth hinders their practical applications. More seriously, when Li dendrites pierce the separators and trigger short circuit in a highly flammable organic electrolyte, the results would be catastrophe. Although the issues of Li dendrites growth have been almost addressed by various methods, the highly flammable nature of conventional organic liquid electrolyte is still a lingering fear facing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries given the possibility of thermal runaway of high&#8208;voltage cathode. Recently, various kinds of non&#8208;flammable liquid or solid&#8208;state electrolytes have shown great potential towards safer Li metal batteries with minimal detrimental effect on the battery performance or even enhanced electrochemical performance. In this Review, we summarizes recent advances in developing non&#8208;flammable electrolyte for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries including high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, fluorinated electrolyte, ionic liquid electrolyte, and polymer electrolyte. Then, we analyze the solvation structure of different kinds of non&#8208;flammable liquid and polymer electrolytes to provide insight into the mechanism for dendrite suppression and fire extinguishing. Finally, we provide guideline for future design of non&#8208;flammable electrolyte for safer Li metal batteries.

         <title>Transformable ECM Deprivation System Effectively Suppresses Renal Cell Carcinoma by Reversing Anoikis Resistance and Increasing Chemotherapy Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial in various biological functions during tumor progression, including induction of anoikis resistance and cell adhesion&#8208;mediated drug resistance (CAM&#8208;DR). Fibronectin (FN), a vital ECM component with direct regulatory effects on ECM&#8208;mediated anoikis resistance and CAM&#8208;DR, making it an attractive and innovative therapeutic target for depriving ECM in tumor tissue. Herein, we develop an ECM deprivation system (EDS) based on FN targeting self&#8208;assembly peptide for constructing nanofibers in the ECM of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which contributes to (i) targeting and recognizing FN to form nanofibers for long&#8208;term retention in ECM, (ii) reversing anoikis resistance via arresting the FN signaling pathway, and (iii) serving as a drug&#8208;loading platform for sensitizing chemotherapy by ameliorating CAM&#8208;DR. Our results reveal that EDS significantly reverses anoikis resistance of RCC cells through inhibiting the phosphorylation of FAK, a positive regulator of FN signaling pathway. Meanwhile, EDS serves as a chemotherapy&#8208;sensitizer of cancer, exerting significant synergistic effects with DOX. In vivo validation experiments show that EDS effectively suppresses the metastasis and tumor growth with chemotherapy resistance. Collectively, the innovative EDS notably inhibits the tumor&#8208;promoting effect of ECM and might provide a novel approach for suppressing ECM and enhancing chemo&#8208;drug sensitivity.

         <title>3D Printing Nanostructured Solid Polymer Electrolytes with High Modulus and Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of advanced solid&#8208;state energy storage devices is contingent upon finding new ways to produce and manufacture scalable, high modulus solid&#8208;state electrolytes which can simultaneously provide high ionic conductivity and robust mechanical integrity. In this work, we report an efficient one&#8208;step process to manufacture solid polymer electrolytes composed of nano&#8208;scale ion&#8208;conducting channels embedded in a rigid crosslinked polymer matrix, via digital light projection 3D printing. A visible light mediated polymerization induced microphase separation approach is utilized, which produces materials with two chemically independent nanoscale domains with highly tunable nanoarchitectures. By producing materials containing a polyethylene oxide domain swelled with an ionic liquid, robust solid polymer electrolytes with outstanding room temperature (22&#176;C) shear modulus (G&#8217; &gt; 108 Pa) and ionic conductivities up to &#963; = 3 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S/cm are achieved. The nanostructured 3D printed electrolytes were fabricated into a custom geometry and employed in a symmetric carbon supercapacitor, demonstrating the scalability of the fabrication and the functionality of the electrolyte. Critically, these high&#8208;performance materials are manufactured on&#8208;demand using inexpensive and commercially available 3D printers, which allows the facile modular design of solid polymer electrolytes with custom geometries.

         <title>Probing the spin dimensionality in single&#8208;layer CrSBr van der Waals heterostructures by magneto&#8208;transport measurements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) magnetic materials offer unprecedented opportunities for fundamental physics and applied research in spintronics and magnonics. Beyond the pioneering studies on 2D CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6, this emerging field has expanded to 2D antiferromagnets exhibiting different spin anisotropies and textures. Of particular interest is the layered metamagnet CrSBr, a relatively air&#8208;stable semiconductor formed by antiferromagnetically&#8208;coupled ferromagnetic layers (Tc&#8764;150 K) that can be exfoliated down to the single&#8208;layer. It presents a complex magnetic behavior with a dynamic magnetic crossover leading to a low&#8208;temperature hidden&#8208;order below T*&#8764;40 K. Here, we inspect the magneto&#8208;transport properties of CrSBr vertical heterostructures in the 2D limit. Our results demonstrate the marked low&#8208;dimensional character of the ferromagnetic monolayer, with short&#8208;range correlations above Tc and an Ising&#8208;type in&#8208;plane anisotropy, being the spins spontaneously aligned along the easy&#8208;axis b below Tc. By applying moderate magnetic fields along a and c axes, a spin reorientation occurs, leading to a magnetoresistance enhancement below T*. In multilayers, a spin&#8208;valve behavior is observed, with negative magnetoresistance strongly enhanced along the three directions below T*. These results show that CrSBr monolayer/bilayer provides an ideal platform for studying and controlling field&#8208;induced phenomena in two&#8208;dimensions, offering new insights regarding 2D magnets and their integration into vertical spintronic devices.

         <title>Realizing a 10&#176;C Cooling Effect in a Flexible Thermoelectric Cooler using a Vortex Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this study, we use flexible thermoelectric coolers (FTECs) to develop an alternative personalized cooling technology to achieve a large temperature drop of &gt;10 &#176;C and cooling capacity of 256 W&#8729;m&#8211;2. Such an excellent cooling performance is attributed to the innovative design of the quadra&#8208;layered Ag2Se/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate structure in FTECs and the induced air vortices by the vortex generator attached to the hot surface of the device. The applied pulse&#8208;width modulation technique guarantees human body comfort at inconsistent ambient temperature by modulating the duty ratio of the power source, which also saves 35% of the power consumption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared FTECs only consume 68.5&#160;W so as to maintain a comfortable skin temperature (32&#177;0.5 &#176;C) when the ambient temperature is at 31 &#176;C. This technology provides a reliable and adjustable solution for personalized cooling in environments where comfortable temperatures are exceeded.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we use flexible thermoelectric coolers (FTECs) to develop an alternative personalized cooling technology to achieve a large temperature drop of &amp;gt;10 &#176;C and cooling capacity of 256 W&#8729;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Such an excellent cooling performance is attributed to the innovative design of the quadra-layered Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate structure in FTECs and the induced air vortices by the vortex generator attached to the hot surface of the device. The applied pulse-width modulation technique guarantees human body comfort at inconsistent ambient temperature by modulating the duty ratio of the power source, which also saves 35% of the power consumption. As a result, the as-prepared FTECs only consume 68.5&#160;W so as to maintain a comfortable skin temperature (32&#177;0.5 &#176;C) when the ambient temperature is at 31 &#176;C. This technology provides a reliable and adjustable solution for personalized cooling in environments where comfortable temperatures are exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Antiferromagnetic&#8211;Ferromagnetic Heterostructure&#8208;Based Field&#8208;Free Terahertz Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A field&#8208;free spintronic THz emitter is successfully realized in an antiferromagnetic&#8211;ferromagnetic (IrMn3|Co20Fe60B20) heterostructure, which facilitates the exchange bias or interfacial exchange coupling effect. Significantly, stronger spintronic THz radiation is generated using the coherent superposition of two heterojunctions with opposite pinning orientations.








Abstract
Recently, ferromagnetic&#8208;heterostructure spintronic terahertz (THz) emitters have been recognized as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation THz sources, owing to their peculiarities of high efficiency, high stability, low cost, ultrabroad bandwidth, controllable polarization, and high scalability. Despite the substantial efforts, they rely on external magnetic fields to initiate the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion, which hitherto greatly limits their proliferation as practical devices. Here, a unique antiferromagnetic&#8211;ferromagnetic (IrMn3|Co20Fe60B20) heterostructure is innovated, and it is demonstrated that it can efficiently generate THz radiation without any external magnetic field. It is assigned to the exchange bias or interfacial exchange coupling effect and enhanced anisotropy. By precisely balancing the exchange bias effect and enhanced THz radiation efficiency, an optimized 5.6 nm&#8208;thick IrMn3|Co20Fe60B20|W trilayer heterostructure is successfully realized, yielding an intensity surpassing that of Pt|Co20Fe60B20|W. Moreover, the intensity of THz emission is further boosted by togethering the trilayer sample and bilayer sample. Besides, the THz polarization may be flexibly controlled by rotating the sample azimuthal angle, manifesting sophisticated active THz field manipulation capability. The field&#8208;free coherent THz emission that is demonstrated here shines light on the development of spintronic THz optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer&#8208;Particle Electrode Design for Practical Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode with vertically aligned charge&#8208;transport pathways is designed, which address the issue of slow charge transport of common high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity electrodes caused by their high tortuosity and interparticle resistance, and simultaneously realizes a fast&#8208;charging capability and high energy density of Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Efforts to enable fast charging and high energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are hampered by the trade&#8208;off nature of the traditional electrode design: increasing the areal capacity usually comes with sacrificing the fast charge transfer. Here a single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode design is reported, where red&#8208;phosphorus active material is embedded in nanochannels of vertically aligned graphene (red&#8208;P/VAG) assemblies. Such an electrode design addresses the sluggish charge transfer stemming from the high tortuosity and inner particle/electrode resistance of traditional electrode architectures consisting of randomly stacked active particles. The vertical ion&#8208;transport nanochannels and electron&#8208;transfer conductive nanowalls of graphene confine the direction of charge transfer to minimize the transfer distance, and the incomplete filling of nanochannels in the red&#8208;P/VAG composite buffers volume change locally, thus avoiding the variation of electrodes thickness during cycling. The single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode displays a high areal capacity (5.6 mAh cm&#8722;2), which is the highest among the reported fast&#8208;charging battery chemistries. Paired with a high&#8208;loading LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathode, a pouch cell shows stable cycling with high energy and power densities. Such a single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode design can be extended to other advanced battery systems and boost the development of LIBs with fast&#8208;charging capability and high energy density.

         <title>Piezoelectricity across 2D Phase Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric responses at 2D&#8208;material phase boundaries are studied and a strong piezoelectric response at the 2H&#8211;1T&#8242; junction is observed, owing to the charge transfer across the semiconducting and metallic junctions, resulting in the formation of dipoles and excess charge density, allowing the engineering of piezoelectric response in atomically thin materials.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity in low&#8208;dimensional materials and metal&#8211;semiconductor junctions has attracted recent attention. Herein, a 2D in&#8208;plane metal&#8211;semiconductor junction made of multilayer 2H and 1T&#8242; phases of molybdenum(IV) telluride (MoTe2) is investigated. Strong piezoelectric response is observed using piezoresponse force microscopy at the 2H&#8211;1T&#8242; junction, despite that the multilayers of each individual phase are weakly piezoelectric. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations suggest that the amplified piezoelectric response observed at the junction is due to the charge transfer across the semiconducting and metallic junctions resulting in the formation of dipoles and excess charge density, allowing the engineering of piezoelectric response in atomically thin materials.

         <title>Rationally Structured Triboelectric Nanogenerator Arrays for Harvesting Water&#8208;Current Energy and Self&#8208;Powered Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paired nanogenerators capable of integrating massively into a thin flexible layer as a structured triboelectric surface are demonstrated for harvesting water&#8208;current energy. Through novel gas packet exchange structure and rigid&#8211;flexible coupling deformation mechanism, the device can work effectively even in deep water with greatly enhanced performance, providing universal strategies to fabricate high&#8208;frequency triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) under large pressure.








Abstract
Water&#8208;current energy is an enormous and widely distributed clean energy in nature, with different scales from large ocean flow to small local turbulence. However, few effective technologies have been proposed to make use of different forms of water currents as a power source. Here, high&#8208;performance paired triboelectric nanogenerators (P&#8208;TENGs) capable of integrating massively into a thin flexible layer as a structured triboelectric surface (STS) are demonstrated for harvesting water&#8208;current energy. Novel gas packet exchange structure and rigid&#8211;flexible coupling deformation mechanism are introduced to ensure that the device can work very effectively even in deep water under high water pressure. The rationally designed TENG array in the STS enables highly efficient power take&#8208;off from the flow. Typically, the STS demonstrates a high&#8208;frequency output up to 57&#160;Hz, largely superior to current TENG devices, and the power density is improved by over 100 times for triboelectric devices harvesting current energy. The flexible STS is capable of attaching to various surfaces or applying independently for self&#8208;powered sensing and underwater power supply, showing great potential for water&#8208;current energy utilization. Moreover, the work also initiates universal strategies to fabricate high&#8208;frequency devices under large environment pressure, which may profoundly enrich the design of TENGs.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Degradable 3D Microstructures in Aqueous Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoresist for the additive manufacturing technique direct laser writing is realized, which is degradable upon irradiation with visible light (&#955;max&#160;=&#160;415&#8211;435&#160;nm) in water. The degradation of microstructures fabricated using the degradable photoresist is quantified using atomic force microscopy. Multimaterial 3D microstructures that incorporate the degradable material are fabricated.








Abstract
The additive manufacturing technique direct laser writing (DLW), also known as two&#8208;photon laser lithography, is becoming increasingly established as a technique capable of fabricating functional 3D microstructures. Recently, there has been an increasing effort to impart microstructures fabricated using DLW with advanced functionalities by introducing responsive chemical entities into the underpinning photoresists. Herein, a novel photoresist based on the photochemistry of the bimane group is introduced that can be degraded upon exposure to very mild conditions, requiring only water and visible light (&#955;max&#160;=&#160;415&#8211;435&#160;nm) irradiation. The degradation of the microstructures is tracked and quantified using AFM measurements of their height. The influence of the writing parameters as well as the degradation conditions is investigated, unambiguously evidencing effective visible light degradation in aqueous environments. Finally, the utility of the photodegradable resist system is demonstrated by incorporating it into multimaterial 3D microstructures, serving as a model for future applications.

         <title>Unbreakable Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Recoverable 10200% Stretchability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Design of tough hydrogels maintaining structural integrity under multivariable mechanical loads remains huge challenging because the anticipated characteristics such as stretchability, strength, toughness, and fracture resistance can hardly be compatible. Herein, we propose a simple but robust hydrogel network formed by copolymerization of divinyl benzene with acrylamide in micellar solutions to achieve both ultra&#8208;high fracture resistance and self&#8208;recoverable stretchability. The network provides dynamic association of hydrophobic domains and homogenous crosslinking of hydrophilic chains, which showed step&#8208;by&#8208;step deformation process for effective energy dissipation. The dynamic associations allow recoverable small deformations of hydrogels, then the homogenous crosslinking ensures reversible unfolding and alignment of polymer chains to self&#8208;strengthen for ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit comprehensive unbreakable feature with self&#8208;recoverable ultra&#8208;high stretchability (100% recovery from 10200% strain), superior fracture resistance (fracture work &gt; 18.8&#160;MJ m&#8211;3, toughness &gt; 26&#160;kJ m&#8211;2), and anti&#8208;crack propagation and fatigue (fatigue threshold: &#8764; 2.5&#160;kJ m&#8211;2). Even the pre&#8208;notched hydrogels can intriguingly undergo tens cyclic loads at 10200% strain and thousands cyclic loads at 200% strain without noticeable changes in mechanical performance. The robust network prepared from homogenous hydrophobic crosslinking provides a facile approach and a new mechanism to explore tough hydrogels with superior anti&#8208;fracture and extreme self&#8208;recoverable deformability for diverse applications

         <title>Balancing the selective absorption and photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion for semitransparent organic photovoltaics with 5.0% light utilization efficiency</title>

Abstract
Efficiently converting invisible light while allowing full visible light transmission is key to achieving high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs). Here, a detailed balance strategy is explored to optimize the ST&#8208;OPV via taking both absorption and carrier dynamics into consideration. Based on this principle, comprehensive optimizations were carried out, including ternary strategy, donor:acceptor blend ratio, thickness, anti&#8208;reflection, etc., to compromise the invisible energy conversion and visible transmission for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs. As a result, the opaque OPV device exhibits a champion PCE of 19.35% (certificated 19.07%), and most strikingly, the best ST&#8208;OPV show a remarkably high light utilization efficiency of 5.0%, where the efficiency and the average visible transmission are 12.95% and 38.67%, respectively. An efficiency of 12.09% is achieved on the up&#8208;scaled device with an area of 1.05 cm2, demonstrating their promise for large&#8208;area fabrication. These results are among the best values for ST&#8208;OPVs. Besides, we demonstrate that the ST&#8208;OPV exhibits good infrared light reflection capability for thermal control. Our work provides a rational design of balancing the absorbing selectivity and photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs, and may pave the way toward the practical application of solar windows.

         <title>Controlled Covalent Self&#8208;Assembly of a Homopolymer for Multiscale Materials Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism to induce controlled polymer self&#8208;assembly is reported. By crosslinking a ketone homopolymer, it self&#8208;assembles into nano&#8208; to macroscale materials, which is sorely driven by covalent bonding. The covalent self&#8208;assembly demonstrates exceptionally high levels of processability with a simple protocol compared to non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly. Covalent self&#8208;assembly yields materials which are previously complicated to synthesize.








Abstract
Polymer self&#8208;assembly is a crucial process in materials engineering. Currently, almost all polymer self&#8208;assembly is limited to non&#8208;covalent bonding methods, even though these methods have drawbacks as they require complicated synthesis techniques and produce relatively unstable structures. Here, a novel mechanism of covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly is discovered and employed to address drawbacks of non&#8208;covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly. A simple ketone homopolymer is found to self&#8208;assemble into nano&#8208; to macroscale hydrogels during covalent crosslinking. In contrast to non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly, the covalent self&#8208;assembly is independent of and unaffected by solvent conditions (e.g., polarity and ionic strength) and does not require additional agents, e.g., organic solvents and surfactants. The covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly is subjected to a new mechanism of control by tuning the covalent crosslinking rate. This leads to nanogels with an unprecedented and tightly controlled range of dimensions from less than 10&#160;nm to above 100&#160;nm. Moreover, the crosslinking rate also regulates the assembly behavior of microgels fabricated by microfluidics. The microgels self&#8208;assemble into granular fibers, which is 3D printed into stable porous scaffolds. The novel covalent polymer assembly method has enormous potential to revolutionize multiscale materials fabrication for applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and many other fields.

         <title>Microstructured BN Composites with Internally Designed High Thermal Conductivity Paths for 3D Electronic Packaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the magnetically assisted slip casting method, microstructures of boron nitride composites are purposely designed and highly oriented to achieve unusually high thermal conductivity and directional heat transfer toward specific areas along the direction of microplatelet alignment, opening up the solutions for the next&#8208;generation thermal management for 3D electronic packaging.








Abstract
Miniaturized and high&#8208;power&#8208;density 3D electronic devices pose new challenges on thermal management. Indeed, prompt heat dissipation in electrically insulating packaging is currently limited by the thermal conductivity achieved by thermal interface materials (TIMs) and by their capability to direct the heat toward heat sinks. Here, high thermal conductivity boron nitride (BN)&#8208;based composites that are able to conduct heat intentionally toward specific areas by locally orienting magnetically functionalized BN microplatelets are created using magnetically assisted slip casting. The obtained thermal conductivity along the direction of alignment is unusually high, up to 12.1&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, thanks to the high concentration of 62.6 vol% of BN in the composite, the low concentration in polymeric binder, and the high degree of alignment. The BN composites have a low density of 1.3&#160;g cm&#8722;3, a high stiffness of 442.3&#160;MPa, and are electrically insulating. Uniquely, the approach is demonstrated with proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept composites having locally graded orientations of BN microplatelets to direct the heat away from two vertically stacked heat sources. Rationally designing the microstructure of TIMs to direct heat strategically provides a promising solution for efficient thermal management in 3D integrated electronics.

         <title>Coherent Precipitates with Strong Domain Wall Pinning in Alkaline Niobate Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coherent precipitates are introduced in lithium sodium niobate polycrystalline piezoceramics. The strong pinning effect on domain walls is demonstrated by a largely reduced polarization hysteresis and enhanced mechanical quality factor Qm by one order of magnitude from &#8776;80 to &#8776;600. while the piezoelectric coefficient remains nearly unchanged. This enhancement in Qm is stable at a large vibration velocity up to 0.8&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1.








Abstract
High&#8208;power piezoelectric applications are predicted to share approximately one&#8208;third of the lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramic market in 2024 with alkaline niobates as the primary competitor. To suppress self&#8208;heating in high&#8208;power devices due to mechanical loss when driven by large electric fields, piezoelectric hardening to restrict domain wall motion is required. In the present work, highly effective piezoelectric hardening via coherent plate&#8208;like precipitates in a model system of the (Li,Na)NbO3 (LNN) solid solution delivers a reduction in losses, quantified as an electromechanical quality factor, by a factor of ten. Various thermal aging schemes are demonstrated to control the average size, number density, and location of the precipitates. The established properties are correlated with a detailed determination of short&#8208; and long&#8208;range atomic structure by X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function analysis, respectively, as well as microstructure determined by transmission electron microscopy. The impact of microstructure with precipitates on both small&#8208; and large&#8208;field properties is also established. These results pave the way to implement precipitate hardening in piezoelectric materials, analogous to precipitate hardening in metals, broadening their use cases in applications.

         <title>Accurate Wavelength Tracking by Exciton Spin Mixing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for wavelength tracking from a simple single&#8208;pixel sensor is presented. The concept is based on the excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent spin mixing ratio of a blended film comprising organic room&#8208;temperature phosphors and colloid quantum dots, and can discriminate wavelength shifts below 1&#160;nm. Potential application scenarios and the respective adaptations to the material system and evaluation routine are discussed.








Abstract
Wavelength&#8208;discriminating systems typically consist of heavy benchtop&#8208;based instruments, comprising diffractive optics, moving parts, and adjacent detectors. For simple wavelength measurements, such as lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip light source calibration or laser wavelength tracking, which do not require polychromatic analysis and cannot handle bulky spectroscopy instruments, lightweight, easy&#8208;to&#8208;process, and flexible single&#8208;pixel devices are attracting increasing attention. Here, a device is proposed for monotonously transforming wavelength information into the time domain with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence at the heart of its functionality, which demonstrates a resolution down to 1 nm and below. It is solution&#8208;processed from a single host&#8211;guest system comprising organic room&#8208;temperature phosphors and colloidal quantum dots. The share of excited triplet states within the photoluminescent layer is dependent on the excitation wavelength and determines the afterglow intensity of the film, which is tracked by a simple photodetector. Finally, an all&#8208;organic thin&#8208;film wavelength sensor and two applications are demonstrated where this novel measurement concept successfully replaces a full spectrometer.

         <title>Polishing the Lead&#8208;Poor Surface&#160;for Efficient Inverted CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically lead&#8208;poor surface is found on CsPbI3 films and it limits the efficiency improvement of inverted CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells for inferior electron transfer and serious nonradiative recombination at CsPbI3/6,6&#8208;phenyl C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester interface. Compared to molecular passivation, 1,4&#8208;butanediamine can polish the lead&#8208;poor surface for fluent electron transfer, and significantly improve the Voc and fill factor with a recorded efficiency of 19.84% and excellent stability.








Abstract
Triiodide cesium lead perovskite (CsPbI3) has promising prospects in the development of efficient and stable photovoltaics in both single&#8208;junction and tandem structures. However, achieving inverted devices that provide good stability and are compatible to tandem devices remains a challenge, and the deep insights are still not understood. This study finds that the surface components of CsPbI3 are intrinsically lead&#8208;poor and the relevant traps are of p&#8208;type with localized states. These deep&#8208;energy&#8208;level p traps induce inferior transfer or electrons and serious nonradiative recombination at the CsPbI3/PCBM interface, leading to the considerable open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss and reduction of fill factor (FF). Compared to molecular passivation, polishing treatment with 1,4&#8208;butanediamine can eliminate the nonstoichiometric components and root these intrinsically lead&#8208;poor traps for superior electron transfer. The polishing treatment significantly improves the FF and Voc of the inverted CsPbI3 photovoltaics, creating an efficiency promotion from 12.64% to 19.84%. Moreover, 95% of the initial efficiency of the optimized devices is maintained after the output operation for 1000 h.

A novel design and scalable fabrication of zero&#8208;volume&#8208;expansion lithium&#8208;composite anodes with high electrochemical and mechanical stability through simple roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing processes is proposed. The sandwich&#8208;like trilayer structure of zero&#8208;volume&#8208;expansion lithium&#8208;composite anodes can simultaneously suppress dendrite formation, eliminate volume change during cycling, and provides excellent mechanical robustness.








Abstract
The lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anode offers a promising solution for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, the significant volume expansion of the Li metal during charging results in poor cycling stability as a result of the dendritic deposition and broken solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, a facile one&#8208;step roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll fabrication of a zero&#8208;volume&#8208;expansion Li&#8208;metal&#8208;composite anode (zeroVE&#8208;Li) is proposed to realize high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs with outstanding electrochemical and mechanical stability. The zeroVE&#8208;Li possesses a sandwich&#8208;like trilayer structure, which consists of an upper electron&#8208;insulating layer and a bottom lithiophilic layer that synergistically guides the Li deposition from the bottom up, and a middle porous layer that eliminates volume expansion. This sandwich structure eliminates dendrite formation, prevents volume change during cycling, and provides outstanding flexibility to the Li&#8208;metal anode even at a practical areal capacity over 3.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Pairing zeroVE&#8208;Li with a commercial NMC811 or LCO cathode, flexible LMBs that offer a record&#8208;breaking figure of merit (FOM, 45.6), large whole&#8208;cell energy density (375&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1, based on the volume of the anode, separator, cathode, and package), high&#8208;capacity retention (&gt; 99.8% per cycle), and remarkable mechanical robustness under practical conditions are demonstrated.

Abstract
Since the first demonstration, remarkable progress has been made in the theoretical analysis, structural design, numerical simulation, and potential applications of metamaterial absorbers (MAs). With the continuous advancement of novel materials and creative designs, the absorption of MAs is significantly improved over a wide frequency spectrum from microwaves to the optical regime. Further, the integration of active elements into the MA design allows the dynamical manipulation of electromagnetic waves, opening a new platform to push breakthroughs in metadevices. In the last several years, numerous efforts have been devoted to exploring innovative approaches for incorporating tunability to MAs, which is highly desirable because of the progressively increasing demand on designing versatile metadevices. Here, a comprehensive and systematical overview of active MAs with adaptive and on&#8208;demand manner is presented, highlighting innovative materials and unique strategies to precisely control the electromagnetic response. In addition to the mainstream method by manipulating periodic patterns, two additional approaches, including tailoring dielectric spacer and transforming overall structure are called back. Following this, key parameters, such as operating frequency, relative tuning range, and switching speed are summarized and compared to guide for optimum design. Finally, potential opportunities in the development of active MAs are discussed.

         <title>Cooperative Coupling of H2O2 Production and Organic Synthesis over a Floatable Polystyrene&#8208;Sphere&#8208;Supported TiO2/Bi2O3 S&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A floatable polystyrene&#8208;sphere&#8208;supported TiO2/Bi2O3 S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst is fabricated, which exhibits a high yield of H2O2 and furoic acid in the triphase system. Detailed spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal the step&#8208;scheme mechanism and pathways of H2O2 and furoic acid evolution, respectively. The merits of the S&#8208;scheme and triphase system are responsible for the extraordinary photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Cooperative coupling of photocatalytic H2O2 production with organic synthesis has an expansive perspective in converting solar energy into storable chemical energy. However, traditional powder photocatalysts suffer from severe agglomeration, limited light absorption, poor gas reactant accessibility, and reusable difficulty, which greatly hinders their large&#8208;scale application. Herein, floatable composite photocatalysts are synthesized by immobilizing hydrophobic TiO2 and Bi2O3 on lightweight polystyrene (PS) spheres via hydrothermal and photodeposition methods. The floatable photocatalysts are not only solar transparent, but also upgrade the contact between reactants and photocatalysts. Thus, the floatable step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) TiO2/Bi2O3 photocatalyst exhibits a drastically enhanced H2O2 yield of 1.15&#160;mm h&#8722;1 and decent furfuryl alcohol conversion to furoic acid synchronously. Furthermore, the S&#8208;scheme mechanism and dynamics are systematically investigated by in situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectrum analyses. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism of furoic acid evolution. The ingenious design of floatable photocatalysts not only furnishes insight into maximizing photocatalytic reaction kinetics but also provides a new route for highly efficient heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Stacking and Twisting of Freestanding Complex Oxide Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new platform is developed for assembling freestanding oxide thin films with different materials and orientations into artificial stacks of heterointerfaces. The heterointerfaces can be tailored by controlling the stacking sequences, as well as the twist angle between the constituent layers with atomically sharp interfaces, leading to distinct moir&#233; patterns.








Abstract
The integration of dissimilar materials in heterostructures has long been a&#160;cornerstone of modern materials science&#8212;seminal examples are 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures. Recently, new methods have been developed that enable the realization of ultrathin freestanding oxide films approaching the 2D limit. Oxides offer new degrees of freedom, due to the strong electronic interactions, especially the 3d orbital electrons, which give rise to rich exotic phases. Inspired by this progress, a new platform for assembling freestanding oxide thin films with different materials and orientations into artificial stacks with heterointerfaces is developed. It is shown that the oxide stacks can be tailored by controlling the stacking sequences, as well as the twist angle between the constituent layers with atomically sharp interfaces, leading to distinct moir&#233; patterns in the transmission electron microscopy images of the full stacks. Stacking and twisting is recognized as a key degree of structural freedom in 2D materials but, until now, has never been realized for oxide materials. This approach opens unexplored avenues for fabricating artificial 3D oxide stacking heterostructures with freestanding membranes across a broad range of complex oxide crystal structures with functionalities not available in conventional 2D materials.

         <title>Tailoring the Thickness&#8208;Dependent Optical Properties of Conducting Nitrides and Oxides for Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero&#8208;Enhanced Photonic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline titanium nitride and aluminum&#8208;doped zinc oxide with strong thickness&#8208;dependent optical properties are grown. The bilayer stacks support Ferrell&#8211;Berreman modes spanning from 1470 to 1750 nm, and also strongly absorb light in the ultraviolet regime. The resonators exhibit picosecond all&#8208;optical switching. Using field enhancements near the tailorable epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero regime can enable nonlinear optical phenomena across a wide optical wavelength range.








Abstract
The unique properties of the emerging photonic materials, conducting nitrides and oxides, especially their tailorability, large damage thresholds, and, importantly, the so&#8208;called epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) behavior, have enabled novel photonic phenomena spanning optical circuitry, tunable metasurfaces, and nonlinear optical devices. This work explores direct control of the optical properties of polycrystalline titanium nitride (TiN) and aluminum&#8208;doped zinc oxide (AZO) by tailoring the film thickness, and their potential for ENZ&#8208;enhanced photonic applications. This study demonstrates that TiN&#8211;AZO bilayers support Ferrell&#8211;Berreman modes using the thickness&#8208;dependent ENZ resonances in the AZO films operating in the telecom wavelengths spanning from 1470 to 1750&#160;nm. The bilayer stacks also act as strong light absorbers in the ultraviolet regime using the radiative ENZ modes and the Fabry&#8211;Perot modes in the constituent TiN films. The studied Berreman resonators exhibit optically induced reflectance modulation of 15% with picosecond response time. Together with the optical response tailorability of conducting oxides and nitrides, using the field enhancement near the tunable ENZ regime can enable a wide range of nonlinear optical phenomena, including all&#8208;optical switching, time refraction, and high&#8208;harmonic generation.

         <title>Experimental Realization of a Superdispersion&#8208;Enabled Ultrabroadband Terahertz Cloak</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Invisibility has been a topic of long&#8208;standing interest, but still faces an open challenge of narrow bandwidth. In this work, it is found that by judiciously harnessing the material dispersion, one can significantly increase the bandwidth of a cloak. As a proof of concept, an ultrabroadband terahertz carpet cloak is experimentally demonstrated in both time&#8208; and frequency&#8208;domain systems. The work presents a feasible invisibility strategy that is closer to practical applications.








Abstract
Invisibility has been a topic of long&#8208;standing interest owing to the advent of metamaterials and transformation optics, but still faces open challenges after its tremendous development in recent decades. One of the big challenges is the narrow bandwidth, as the realization of an invisibility cloak is usually based on a metamaterial&#8212;an artificial composite material composed of subwavelength resonator structures that are always associated with dispersion. Different from previous works that have tried to eliminate the material dispersion to enhance the bandwidth of an&#160;invisibility cloak, here, it is found that by judiciously harnessing the material dispersion, the bandwidth of the cloak can still be significantly increased. Interestingly, the material dispersion does not violate the law of causality. As a proof of concept, an ultrabroadband terahertz (THz) carpet cloak is experimentally demonstrated through an array of superdispersive microparticles, rendering the target object invisible to detection by both time&#8208; and frequency&#8208;domain wideband systems. The work presents a feasible invisibility strategy that is closer to practical applications and may pave a brand&#8208;new way for the development of dispersion&#8208;dominated ultrabroadband metadevices.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of High&#8208;Optical&#8208;Quality Large&#8208;Area Monolayer Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayers of Janus SeMoS with asymmetric top (Se) and bottom (S) chalcogen atomic planes with respect to the central transition metal (Mo) atoms are synthesized using a one&#8208;pot chemical vapor deposition process and its high optical quality is demonstrated by low&#8208;temperature magneto optical spectroscopy.








Abstract
One&#8208;pot chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of large&#8208;area Janus SeMoS monolayers is reported, with the asymmetric top (Se) and bottom (S) chalcogen atomic planes with respect to the central transition metal (Mo) atoms. The formation of these 2D semiconductor monolayers takes place upon the thermodynamic&#8208;equilibrium&#8208;driven exchange of the bottom Se atoms of the initially grown MoSe2 single crystals on gold foils with S atoms. The growth process is characterized by complementary experimental techniques including Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and the growth mechanisms are rationalized by first principle calculations. The remarkably high optical quality of the synthesized Janus monolayers is demonstrated by optical and magneto&#8208;optical measurements which reveal the strong exciton&#8211;phonon coupling and enable an exciton g&#8208;factor of &#8722;3.3.

         <title>Suppressing Charged Cation Antisites via Se Vapor Annealing Enables p&#8208;Type Dopability in AgBiSe2&#8211;SnSe Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AgBiSe2&#8208;based thermoelectric materials show poor p&#8208;type dopability, but an underlying mechanism remains controversial. In this work, it is revealed that charged antisites are principal hole&#8208;killer defects by density functional theory calculations, and that selenium vapor annealing is an effective strategy to effectively stabilize p&#8208;type conductivity in AgBiSe2&#8211;SnSe solid solutions.








Abstract
Cation disordering is commonly found in multinary cubic compounds, but its effect on electronic properties has been neglected because of difficulties in determining the ordered structure and defect energetics. An absence of rational understanding of the point defects present has led to poor reproducibility and uncontrolled conduction type. AgBiSe2 is a representative compound that suffers from poor reproducibility of thermoelectric properties, while the origins of its intrinsic n&#8208;type conductivity remain speculative. Here, it is demonstrated that cation disordering is facilitated by BiAg charged antisite defects in cubic AgBiSe2 which also act as a principal donor defect that greatly controls the electronic properties. Using density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy, how saturation annealing with selenium vapor can stabilize p&#8208;type conductivity in cubic AgBiSe2 alloyed with SnSe at high temperatures is elucidated. With stable and controlled hole concentration, a peak is observed in the weighted mobility and the density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass in AgBiSnSe3, implying an increased valley degeneracy in this system. These findings corroborate the importance of considering the defect energetics for exploring the dopability of ternary thermoelectric chalcogenides and engineering electronic bands by controlling self&#8208;doping.

         <title>Building a Self&#8208;Adaptive Protective Layer on Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes to Enhance the Cycle Stability of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slide&#8208;ring polymer featuring high elasticity and self&#8208;adaptive ability is designed to improve the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries via relieving the cracks of cathode particles and retarding parasitic interfacial side reactions during cycling.








Abstract
Layered Ni&#8208;rich lithium transition metal oxides are promising battery cathodes due to their high specific capacity, but their poor cycling stability due to intergranular cracks in secondary particles restricts their practical applications. Surface engineering is an effective strategy for improving a cathode's cycling stability, but most reported surface coatings cannot adapt to the dynamic volume changes of cathodes. Herein, a self&#8208;adaptive polymer (polyrotaxane&#8208;co&#8208;poly(acrylic acid)) interfacial layer is built on LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2. The polymer layer with a slide&#8208;ring structure exhibits high toughness and can withstand the stress caused by particle volume changes, which can prevent the cracking of particles. In addition, the slide&#8208;ring polymer acts as a physicochemical barrier that suppresses surface side reactions and alleviates the dissolution of transition metallic ions, which ensures stable cycling performance. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared cathode shows significantly improved long&#8208;term cycling stability in situations in which cracks may easily occur, especially under high&#8208;rate, high&#8208;voltage, and high&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Scale Integration Design of Sn&#8211;ZnO Catalyst toward Efficient and Stable CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To increase the energy efficiency while maintaining long durability of catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to CO, a dual&#8208;scale delicate design of a non&#8208;noble Sn&#8211;ZnO active interface inserted into nanopores of high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon nanospheres, through d&#8208;bandwidth tuning of Sn and ZnO at the electronic scale, and local environment regulation from the nanoconfinement effect of tailored nanopores, is reported.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO is a potential sustainable strategy for alleviating CO2 emission and producing valuable fuels. In the quest to resolve its current problems of low&#8208;energy efficiency and insufficient durability, a dual&#8208;scale design strategy is proposed by implanting a non&#8208;noble active Sn&#8211;ZnO heterointerface inside the nanopores of high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon nanospheres (Sn&#8211;ZnO@HC). The metal d&#8208;bandwidth tuning of Sn and ZnO alters the extent of substrate&#8211;molecule orbital mixing, facilitating the breaking of the *COOH intermediate and the yield of CO. Furthermore, the confinement effect of tailored nanopores results in a beneficial pH distribution in the local environment around the Sn&#8211;ZnO nanoparticles and protects them against leaching and aggregating. Through integrating electronic and nanopore&#8208;scale control, Sn&#8211;ZnO@HC achieves a quite low potential of &#8722;0.53&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with 91% Faradaic efficiency for CO and an ultralong stability of 240 h. This work provides proof of concept for the multiscale design of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Manipulating Offense and Defense Signaling to Fight Cold Tumors with Carrier&#8208;Free Nanoassembly of Fluorinated Prodrug and siRNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new carrier&#8208;free delivery platform consisting of doxorubicin (DOX), melittin (MPI), and anti&#8208;TOX small interfering RNA (thymocyte selection&#8208;associated high mobility group box protein, TOX) is designed as an &#8220;offense&#160;and&#160;defense&#8221; signaling manipulator to fight &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. Such a novel system represents an accessible delivery platform and promising strategy to produce potent immune response through synergistically regulating T&#8208;cell infiltration and exhaustion.








Abstract
Chemoimmunotherapy has shown great potential to activate an immune response, but the immunosuppressive microenvironment associated with T cell exhaustion remains a challenge in cancer therapy. The proper immune&#8208;modulatory strategy to provoke a robust immune response is to simultaneously regulate T&#8208;cell exhaustion and infiltration. Here, a new kind of carrier&#8208;free nanoparticle is developed to simultaneously deliver chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin, DOX), cytolytic peptide (melittin, MPI), and anti&#8208;TOX small interfering RNA (thymocyte selection&#8208;associated high mobility group box protein, TOX) using a fluorinated prodrug strategy. In this way, the enhanced immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by the combination of DOX and MPI can act as &#8220;offense&#8221; signaling to increase CD8+ T&#8208;cell infiltration, while the decreased TOX expression interfered with siTOX can serve as &#8220;defense&#8221; signaling to mitigate CD8+ T&#8208;cell exhaustion. As a result, the integration of DOX, MPI, and siTOX in such a bifunctional system produced a potent antitumor immune response in liver cancer and metastasis, making it a promising delivery platform and effective strategy for converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones.

&lt;p&gt;A new carrier-free delivery platform consisting of doxorubicin (DOX), melittin (MPI), and anti-TOX small interfering RNA (thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box protein, TOX) is designed as an &#8220;offense&#160;and&#160;defense&#8221; signaling manipulator to fight &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. Such a novel system represents an accessible delivery platform and promising strategy to produce potent immune response through synergistically regulating T-cell infiltration and exhaustion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemoimmunotherapy has shown great potential to activate an immune response, but the immunosuppressive microenvironment associated with T cell exhaustion remains a challenge in cancer therapy. The proper immune-modulatory strategy to provoke a robust immune response is to simultaneously regulate T-cell exhaustion and infiltration. Here, a new kind of carrier-free nanoparticle is developed to simultaneously deliver chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin, DOX), cytolytic peptide (melittin, MPI), and anti-TOX small interfering RNA (thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box protein, TOX) using a fluorinated prodrug strategy. In this way, the enhanced immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by the combination of DOX and MPI can act as &#8220;offense&#8221; signaling to increase CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell infiltration, while the decreased TOX expression interfered with siTOX can serve as &#8220;defense&#8221; signaling to mitigate CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell exhaustion. As a result, the integration of DOX, MPI, and siTOX in such a bifunctional system produced a potent antitumor immune response in liver cancer and metastasis, making it a promising delivery platform and effective strategy for converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Sieving Janus Separator toward Planar Electrodeposition for Deeply Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus separator is constructed to continuously regulate the Zn(002) planar electrodeposition on the surface of a&#160;Zn anode and provide single&#8208;ion channels for Zn2+ ions to suppress side reactions. This work provides new insights to stabilize metal anodes (e.g., Li, Na, K, Zn, Al, Ca, and Mg) in rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
The irregular and random electrodeposition of zinc has emerged as a non&#8208;negligible barrier for deeply rechargeable aqueous zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), yet traditional texture regulation of the Zn substrate cannot continuously induce uniform Zn deposition. Here, a Janus separator is constructed via parallelly grown graphene sheets modified with sulfonic cellulose on one side of the commercial glass fiber separator through the spin&#8208;coating technique. The Janus separator can consistently regulate Zn growth toward a locked crystallographic orientation of Zn(002) texture to intercept dendrites. Furthermore, the separator can spontaneously repel SO42&#8722; and anchor H+ while allowing effective transport of Zn2+ to alleviate side reactions. Accordingly, the Zn symmetric cell harvests a long&#8208;term lifespan over 1400&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/10 mAh cm&#8722;2 and endures stable cycling over 220&#160;h even at a high depth of discharge (DOD) of 56%. The Zn/carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8211;MnO2 cell achieves an outstanding capacity retention of 95% at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 1900 cycles. Furthermore, the Zn/NH4V4O10 pouch cell with a Janus separator delivers an initial capacity of 178 mAh g&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of 87.4% after 260 cycles. This work provides a continuous regulation approach to achieve crystallographic homogeneity of the Zn anode, which can be suitable for other metal batteries.
