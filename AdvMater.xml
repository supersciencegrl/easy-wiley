         <title>The Structure&#8208;Mechanics Relationship of Bamboo&#8208;Epidermis and Inspired Composite Design by Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article investigates the micromechanics of bamboo epidermis, focusing on how anisotropic silica particle distributions enhance toughness. By integrating experimental imaging, 3D printing, and generative AI, the study develops bio&#8208;inspired particle&#8208;reinforced composites with mechanical properties akin to bamboo. The findings expand design possibilities for composites, offering innovative solutions for applications demanding high toughness and mechanical reliability.








Abstract
Bamboo culm has been widely used in engineering for its high strength, lightweight, and low cost. Its outermost epidermis is a smooth and dense layer that contains cellulose, silica particles, and stomata and acts as a water and mechanical barrier. Recent experimental studies have shown that the layer has a higher mechanical strength than other inside regions. Still, the mechanism is unclear, especially for how the low silica concentration (&lt;10%) can effectively reinforce the layer and prevent the inner fibers from splitting. Here, theoretical analysis is combined with experimental imaging and 3D printing to investigate the effect of the distribution of silica particles on composite mechanics. The anisotropic partial distribution function of silica particles in bamboo skin yields higher toughness (&gt;10%) than randomly distributed particles. A generative artificial intelligence (AI) model inspired by bamboo epidermis is developed to generate particle&#8208;reinforced composites. Besides the visual similarity, it is found that the samples by the generative model show failure processes and fracture toughness identical to the actual bamboo epidermis. This work reveals the micromechanics of the bamboo epidermis. It illustrates that generative AI can help design bio&#8208;inspired composites of a complex structure that cannot be uniformly represented by a simple building block or optimized around local boundaries. It expands the design space of particle&#8208;reinforced composites for enhanced toughness modulus, offering advantages in industries where mechanical reliability is critical.

         <title>Harnessing the Electronic Spin States of Single Atoms for Precise Electromagnetic Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating their asymmetric electronic spin states, the unique electronic structures and unsaturated coordination environments of single atoms can be effectively harnessed to control their magnetic properties.

Abstract
By manipulating their asymmetric electronic spin states, the unique electronic structures and unsaturated coordination environments of single atoms can be effectively harnessed to control their magnetic properties. In this research, the first investigation is presented into the regulation of magnetic properties through the electronic spin states of single atoms. Magnetic single&#8208;atom one&#8208;dimensional materials, M&#8208;N&#8208;C/ZrO2 (M = Fe, Co, Ni), with varying electronic spin states, are design and synthesize based on the electronic orbital structure model. The SAs 3d electron spin structure of the composite M&#8208;N&#8208;C modulates the magneto physical properties and triggers a unique natural resonance loss, which achieves a controllable tuning of the effective absorption band under low&#8208;frequency conditions. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of M&#8208;N&#8208;C can reach &#8208;69.71&#160;dB, and the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) ratio is as high as 91% (2&#8211;18&#160;GHz). The current work provides a path toward achieving controllable modulation of low&#8208;frequency electromagnetic wave bands by exploring the mechanism through which atomic and even electronic level interactions influence magnetic modulation.

         <title>An NIR&#8208;II Two&#8208;Photon Excitable AIE Photosensitizer for Precise and Efficient Treatment of Orthotopic Small&#8208;Size Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise and efficient treatment of orthotopic small&#8208;size glioblastoma is realized in this work by fully taking advantage of two&#8208;photon excitation and an aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer. The proposed photosensitizer with a large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section, the second near&#8208;infrared excitation, the first near&#8208;infrared emission, and prominent ROS generation, contributes to remarkable tumor growth inhibition and an ultra&#8208;deep imaging depth in the brain.








Abstract
The existence of residual small&#8208;size tumors after surgery is a major factor contributing to the high recurrence rate of glioblastoma (GBM). Conventional adjuvant therapeutics involving both chemotherapy and radiotherapy usually exhibit unsatisfactory efficacy and severe side effects. Recently, two&#8208;photon photodynamic therapy (TP&#8208;PDT), especially excited by the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) light, offers an unprecedented opportunity to address this challenge, attributed to its combinational merits of PDT and TP excitation. However, this attempt has not been explored yet. On the other hand, the lack of high&#8208;performance photosensitizers (PSs) also hinders the progress of TP&#8208;PDT on GBM. Based on those, a robust TP&#8208;PS, termed MeTTh, is constructed intendedly through elaborately integrating multiple beneficial design strategies into a single molecule, which simultaneously achieves excellent NIR&#8208;II excitation, large absorption cross&#8208;section, aggregation&#8208;induced NIR&#8208;I emission, and prominent Type I/II reactive oxygen species generation. Aided by nanofabrication, an impressive brain structure imaging depth of 940&#160;&#181;m is realized. Moreover, MeTTh nanoparticles smoothly implement precise and efficient treatment of small&#8208;size GBM in vivo under a 1040&#160;nm femtosecond laser irradiation. This study represents first&#8208;in&#8208;class using TP&#8208;PDT on GBM, offering new insights for the therapy of small&#8208;size tumors in complex and vital tissues.

         <title>Toward Long&#8208;Life High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Li&#8208;Ion Batteries: from Solvation Chemistry to Solid&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Interphase Layer Optimization Against Electron Tunneling Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel acetamide&#8208;based eutectic electrolyte with enhanced solvation chemistry design, combined with a widened operation voltage range to induce hydrogen evolution reaction, forms a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase layer, mitigating electron tunneling and significantly improving the cycle stability of high&#8208;voltage aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Water is pursued as an electrolyte solvent for its non&#8208;flammable nature compared to traditional organic solvents, yet its narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) limits its performance. Solvation chemistry design is widely adopted as the key to suppress the reactivity of water, thereby expanding the ESW. In this study, an acetamide&#8208;based ternary eutectic electrolyte achieved an ESW ranging from 1.4 to 5.1&#160;V. The electrolyte confines water molecules within the primary solvation sheath of Li&#8208;ions, reducing the free water and breaking the hydrogen bond network. Despite this, initial capacity retention is suboptimal due to inadequate formation of solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (SEI) layers. To address this, additional hydrogen evolution reaction is induced by widening the operation voltage range, thereby optimizing the SEI layer to mitigate the electron tunneling effect. This approach resulted in a denser LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer, effectively preventing water decomposition and improving long&#8208;term cycle stability. The optimized SEI layer reduced the electron tunneling barrier, achieving a discharge capacity of 152 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C and maintaining 76% of its capacity (116 mAh g&#8722;1) after 1000 cycles. This study highlights the critical role of both solvation structure and SEI layer optimization in enhancing the performance of high&#8208;voltage aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Low Thermal Conductivity and Diffusivity at High Temperatures Using Stable High&#8208;Entropy Spinel Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low thermal diffusivity at high temperature (800 &#176;C) is achieved using packed nanoparticles of high&#8208;entropy spinel oxide with 8 cations with low thermal conductivity and relatively high packing density of &#8776;50 %. The high entropy leads to remarkable microstructural stability against coarsening at high temperatures, thus enabling the low thermal conductivity of the packed nanoparticles.








Abstract
The realization of low thermal conductivity at high temperatures (0.11&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 800 &#176;C) in ambient air in a porous solid thermal insulation material, using stable packed nanoparticles of high&#8208;entropy spinel oxide with 8 cations (HESO&#8208;8 NPs) with a relatively high packing density of &#8776;50%, is reported.

         <title>In Situ Modulated Nickel Single Atoms on Bicontinuous Porous Carbon Fibers and Sheets Networks for Acidic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicontinuous mesoporous carbon nanofiber and carbon nanosheet network is developed to enable high site utilization of single&#8208;atom Ni and interfacial CO2 enrichment. The in situ dynamic transformation of the planar Ni&#8722;N4 to an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configuration is revealed, showing enhanced intrinsic electrokinetics for CO2 reduction. The integrated merits of network support and in situ tailored low&#8208;valance&#8208;state Ni site endow outstanding performance in acidic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolysis.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit exceptional properties in acidic CO2 reduction. However, traditional carbon supports fall short in building high&#8208;site&#8208;utilization and CO2&#8208;rich interfacial environments, and the structural evolution of single&#8208;atom metals and catalytic mechanisms under realistic conditions remain ambiguous. Herein, an interconnected mesoporous carbon nanofiber and carbon nanosheet network (IPCF@CS) is reported, derived from microphase&#8208;separated block copolymer, to improve catalytic efficiency of isolated Ni. In IPCF@CS nanostructure, highly mesoporous IPCF hinders stacking of CS that provides additional fully exposed sites and abundant bicontinuous mesochannels of IPCF facilitate smooth CO2 transport. Such unique features enable enhanced Ni utilization and local CO2 enrichment, which cannot be achieved over conventional pore&#8208;deficient and discontinuous porous carbon fibers&#8208;based supports. In situ X&#8208;ray and Infrared spectroscopy coupling constant&#8208;potential calculations reveal the dynamic distortion of the planar Ni&#8722;N4 to an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configuration with expanded Ni&#8722;N bond during operating CO2 electroreduction. The potential&#8208;driven low&#8208;valance&#8208;state Ni&#8722;N4 possesses enhanced intrinsic electrokinetics for CO2 activation and CO desorption yet inhibiting hydrogen evolution. The favorable electronic and interfacial reaction environments, resulted from the in situ tailored Ni site and IPCF@CS support, achieve an FE of near 100% at 540&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a TOF of 55.5 s&#8722;1, and a SPCE of 89.2% in acidic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolysis.

         <title>An &#8220;Outer Piezoelectric and Inner Epigenetic&#8221; Logic&#8208;Gated PANoptosis for Osteosarcoma Sono&#8208;Immunotherapy and Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed biomaterials equipped with an &#8220;outer AND inner&#8221; logic gate are developed by integrating porous piezoelectric sonosensitizers with bioactive glass scaffolds. Ultrasound, acting as the &#8220;outer&#8221; input signal, can generate reactive oxygen species, and bioactive drugs loaded in sonosensitizers serve as the &#8220;inner&#8221; input signal to implement epigenetic demethylation regulation. Combining the AND logic&#8208;triggered effects, cancer&#8208;specific PANoptosis activation is achieved to boost antitumor immune response. Thus, the biomaterial platform enables enhanced sono&#8208;piezoelectric immunotherapy for osteosarcoma, along with related antibacterial effects and bone defect repair.








Abstract
The precise manipulation of PANoptosis, a newly defined cell death pathway encompassing pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, is highly desired to achieve safer cancer immunotherapy with tumor&#8208;specific inflammatory responses and minimal side effects. Nonetheless, this objective remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an &#8220;AND&#8221; logic&#8208;gated strategy for accurately localized PANoptosis activation, utilizing composite 3D&#8208;printed bioactive glasses scaffolds integrated with epigenetic regulator&#8208;loaded porous piezoelectric SrTiO3 nanoparticles is proposed. The &#8220;logic&#8208;gated&#8221; strategy is co&#8208;programmed by an &#8220;outer&#8221; input signal of exogenous ultrasound irradiation to produce reactive oxygen species and an &#8220;inner&#8221; input signal of acid tumor microenvironment to ensure the epigenetic demethylation regulation, guaranteeing the tumor&#8208;specific PANoptosis. Specifically, immunogenic PANoptosis triggers dendritic cell maturation and cytotoxic T cell activation, amplifying antitumor immune responses and significantly suppressing osteosarcoma growth, with a suppression rate of &#8776;73.47&#160;&#177;&#160;5.2%. In addition, the well&#8208;known bioactivities of Sr&#8208;doped scaffolds expedite osteogenic differentiation and reinforce bone regeneration. Therefore, this work provides a paradigm of logic&#8208;gated sono&#8208;piezoelectric biomaterial platform with concurrently exogenous/endogenous activated PANoptosis for controlled sono&#8208;immunotherapy of osteosarcoma, and related bone defects repair.

         <title>Successive Reactions of Trimethylgermanium Chloride to Achieve &gt; 26% Efficiency MA&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cell With 3000&#8208;Hour Unattenuated Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, trimethylgermanium chloride (TGC) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution. Comprehensive experiments find that TGC triggers the successive interactions involving the hydrolysis of Ge&#9472;Cl bond forming Ge&#9472;OH group, then forming O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N/O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I bonds. Benefiting from these successive interactions, the TGC&#8208;treated device realizes a PCE of 26.03% and 26.38% for the conventional (n&#8208;i&#8208;p) and inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) FACsPbI3 PSCs with 3000 h unattenuated operation.








Abstract
The rapidly increased efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) indicates their broad commercial prospects, but the commercialization of perovskite faces complex optimization processes and stability issues. In this work, a simple optimized strategy is developed by the addition of trimethylgermanium chloride (TGC) into FACsPbI3 precursor solution. TGC triggers the successive interactions in perovskite solution and film, involving the hydrolysis of vulnerable Ge&#9472;Cl bond forming Ge&#9472;OH group, then forming the hydrogen bonds (O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N and O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I) with FAI. These successive interactions effectively safeguard FA+ from decomposition, accelerate crystallization, restrict ion migration, and passivate film defects. Thus, a high&#8208;quality perovskite is obtained with the super&#8208;hydrophobic surface, maintaining the light&#8208;active phase (&#945;&#8208;phase) even after exposure to high&#8208;humidity air (RH: 85%) for 10 days. Consequently, the TGC&#8208;treated conventional (n&#8208;i&#8208;p) and inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) FACsPbI3 PSCs achieve 26.03%&#8208; and 26.38%&#8208; efficiencies, respectively, retaining unattenuated operation initial efficiency after tracking at the maximum power point (MPP) under illumination for 3000&#160;h.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Stiff yet Super&#8208;Elastic Graphene Aerogels by Topological Cellular Hierarchy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stiff yet super&#8208;elastic aerogel is realized through the design of a topological cellular hierarchy, enabling it to support high loads through preferably reversible buckling deformation, thereby overcoming the intrinsic conflict between high stiffness and superior recoverability.








Abstract
Lightweight cellular materials with high stiffness and excellent recoverability are critically important in structural engineering applications, but the intrinsic conflict between these two properties presents a significant challenge. Here, a topological cellular hierarchy is presented, designed to fabricate ultra&#8208;stiff (&gt;10 MPa modulus) yet super&#8208;elastic (&gt;90% recoverable strain) graphene aerogels.

&lt;p&gt;An ultra-stiff yet super-elastic aerogel is realized through the design of a topological cellular hierarchy, enabling it to support high loads through preferably reversible buckling deformation, thereby overcoming the intrinsic conflict between high stiffness and superior recoverability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightweight cellular materials with high stiffness and excellent recoverability are critically important in structural engineering applications, but the intrinsic conflict between these two properties presents a significant challenge. Here, a topological cellular hierarchy is presented, designed to fabricate ultra-stiff (&amp;gt;10 MPa modulus) yet super-elastic (&amp;gt;90% recoverable strain) graphene aerogels. This topological cellular hierarchy, composed of massive corrugated pores and nanowalls, is designed to carry high loads through predominantly reversible buckling within the honeycomb framework. The compressive modulus of the as-prepared graphene aerogel is nearly twice that of conventional graphene aerogel. This high-stiff graphene aerogel also exhibits exceptional mechanical recoverability, achieving up to 60% strain recovery over 10&#160;000 fatigue cycles without significant structural failure, outperforming most previously reported porous lattices and monoliths. It is further demonstrated that this graphene aerogel exhibits superior energy dissipation and anti-fatigue dynamic impact properties, with an energy absorption capacity nearly an order of magnitude greater than that of conventional aerogels. These exceptional properties of the topological cellular graphene aerogel open new avenues for high-energy bullet protection, offering great promise for the development of lightweight, armor-like protective materials in transportation and aerospace applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A COF&#8208;based biomimetic artificial photosynthesis system integrates ATP synthase and a light&#8208;responsive photoacid to generate a proton gradient driving ATP production. The system demonstrates regenerative ATP synthesis through repeated light on/off cycles, enabling the biocoupling of monosaccharides into disaccharides and showcasing a sustainable approach for converting solar energy into chemical energy.








Abstract
Biomimetic photosynthesis, which leverages nanomaterials with light&#8208;responsive capabilities, represents an innovative approach for replicating natural photosynthetic processes for green and sustainable energy conversion. In this study, a covalent&#8208;organic framework (COF)&#8208;based artificial photosynthesis system is realized through the co&#8208;assembly of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase and a light&#8208;responsive proton generator onto an imine&#8208;based COF, RT&#8208;COF&#8208;1. This system demonstrates an ATP production rate of 0.64 &#181;mol ATP per mg protein within 90 s of light exposure and, for the first time, exhibites regenerative ATP production through multiple light on/off cycles. Furthermore, the ATP generated by the system facilitates the biocoupling of monosaccharides into disaccharides, confirming the hybrid system's capability to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of organic molecules. This approach shows significant potential for renewable bioenergy generation, offering precise and reliable control over biochemical processes through artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Light&#8208;Directed Self&#8208;Powered Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Based Nanorobots for Deep Tumor Penetration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a strategy involving light&#8208;directed self&#8208;powered metal&#8208;organic framework based nanorobots that exhibit negative phototaxis in the acidic tumor microenvironment for transporting therapeutics in a specific deep&#8208;into&#8208;tumor direction. Such nanorobots achieve deep tumor penetration under red light for highly effective drug delivery. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the nanorobots possess excellent tumor&#8208;killing performance and biosafety.








Abstract
Effective intratumoral distribution of anticancer agents with good tumor penetration is of great practical importance for oncotherapy. How to break the limitation of traditional passive drug delivery relying on blood circulatory system into solid tumors remains a challenge. Herein, a light&#8208;directed self&#8208;powered nanorobot based on zirconium&#8208;based porphyrin metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) is reported for smart delivery of chemodrug and photosensitizer for deep tumor penetration. The MOF&#8208;based carrier transporting the therapeutics is able to responsively generate hydrogen sulfide as propulsion gas and uniquely exhibits negative phototaxis in acidic tumor microenvironment. Under red light irradiation, the nanorobots are accordingly propelled from the tumor surface toward deep tumor far away from the exterior light source in a specific deep&#8208;into&#8208;tumor direction, greatly enhancing tumor penetration. Along with tumor&#8208;responsive release and activation of the delivered therapeutics inside tumor tissues, photo&#8208;chemotherapy with significantly improved efficacy is achieved.

         <dc:description>
Achieving high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) typically involves high fabrication pressure and operation pressure, which poses a significant challenge for the practical application of ASSBs. This review summarizes the pressure&#8208;related challenges and strategies for ASSBs and offers perspectives on how to reduce fabrication and operation pressure. The insights aim to guide the design of low&#8208;pressure ASSBs, thus facilitating their practical application.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are regarded as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technology owing to their inherent safety and high theoretical energy density. However, achieving and maintaining solid&#8211;solid electronic and ionic contact in ASSBs generally requires high&#8208;pressure fabrication and high&#8208;pressure operation, posing substantial challenges for large&#8208;scale production and application. In recent years, significant efforts are made to address these pressure&#8208;related challenges. In this review, the impact of pressure on ASSBs is explored. First, the categories, origins, and challenges associated with pressure in ASSBs are outlined. Second, an overview of recent advancements in addressing pressure&#8208;related issues in ASSBs is provided, focusing on electrode materials and their interfaces with various solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Third, advanced characterizations and simulations employed to unravel the intricate electrochemical&#8211;mechanical interactions in ASSBs are examined. Finally, existing strategies and the insights on achieving low&#8208;stack&#8208;pressure ASSBs are presented.

         <title>Personalized Vascularized Tumor Organoid&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip for Tumor Metastasis and Therapeutic Targeting Assessment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vascularized patient&#8208;derived tumor organoid (PDTO)&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip with a hierarchical, tumor&#8208;specific microvasculature is developed, enabling high&#8208;resolution, real&#8208;time visualization of dynamic interactions within the tumor's perivascular niche. This platform effectively models tumor&#8208;driven angiogenesis and migration, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for assessing metastatic risk and guiding clinical strategies.








Abstract
While tumor organoids have revolutionized cancer research by recapitulating the cellular architecture and behaviors of real tumors in vitro, their lack of functional vasculature hinders their attainment of full physiological capabilities. Current efforts to vascularize organoids are struggling to achieve well&#8208;defined vascular networks, mimicking the intricate hierarchy observed in vivo, which restricts the physiological relevance particularly for studying tumor progression and response to therapies targeting the tumor vasculature. An innovative vascularized patient&#8208;derived tumor organoids (PDTOs)&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip with hierarchical, tumor&#8208;specific microvasculature is presented, providing a versatile platform to explore tumor&#8208;vascular dynamics and antivascular drug efficacy. It is found that highly metastatic tumor cells induced vessel angiogenesis and simultaneously migrated toward blood vessels via the Notch pathway. The evident association between the angiogenic and migratory capacities of PDTOs and their clinical metastatic outcomes underscores the potential of the innovative platform for evaluating tumor metastasis, thus offering valuable insights for clinical decision&#8208;making. Ultimately, the system represents a promising avenue for advancing the understanding of tumor metastasis and developing personalized treatment strategies based on patient&#8208;specific tumor characteristics.

         <title>Time&#8208;Reversal Symmetry Breaking Superconductivity in HfRhGe: A Noncentrosymmetric Weyl Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HfRhGe, a promising noncentrosymmetric material for topological superconductivity, exhibits time&#8208;reversal symmetry (TRS)&#8208;protected Weyl topology in its normal state, featuring disconnected Fermi sheets and multiple surface Fermi arcs. It enters a superconducting phase at low temperatures with a TRS&#8208;breaking ground state, evidenced by muon&#8208;spin rotation and relaxation (&#181;SR) measurements, detecting a spontaneous magnetic field offering potential applications in quantum electronics.








Abstract
Weyl semimetals are a novel class of topological materials with unique electronic structures and distinct properties. HfRhGe stands out as a noncentrosymmetric Weyl semimetal with unconventional superconducting characteristics. Using muon&#8208;spin rotation and relaxation (&#181;SR) spectroscopy and thermodynamic measurements, a fully gapped superconducting state is identified in HfRhGe that breaks time&#8208;reversal symmetry at the superconducting transition. This breaking can trigger a topological phase transition, as time&#8208;reversal symmetry protects the normal&#8208;state Weyl topology characterized by comprehensive first&#8208;principles calculations. Ginzburg&#8208;Landau analysis suggests an unconventional loop supercurrent superconducting state realized in HfRhGe. The presence of multiple Weyl points near the Fermi level and surface Fermi arcs dispersing across the Fermi level further support HfRhGe as a promising platform for topological superconductivity.

     alt="Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking Superconductivity in HfRhGe: A Noncentrosymmetric Weyl Semimetal"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HfRhGe, a promising noncentrosymmetric material for topological superconductivity, exhibits time-reversal symmetry (TRS)-protected Weyl topology in its normal state, featuring disconnected Fermi sheets and multiple surface Fermi arcs. It enters a superconducting phase at low temperatures with a TRS-breaking ground state, evidenced by muon-spin rotation and relaxation (&#181;SR) measurements, detecting a spontaneous magnetic field offering potential applications in quantum electronics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weyl semimetals are a novel class of topological materials with unique electronic structures and distinct properties. HfRhGe stands out as a noncentrosymmetric Weyl semimetal with unconventional superconducting characteristics. Using muon-spin rotation and relaxation (&#181;SR) spectroscopy and thermodynamic measurements, a fully gapped superconducting state is identified in HfRhGe that breaks time-reversal symmetry at the superconducting transition. This breaking can trigger a topological phase transition, as time-reversal symmetry protects the normal-state Weyl topology characterized by comprehensive first-principles calculations. Ginzburg-Landau analysis suggests an unconventional loop supercurrent superconducting state realized in HfRhGe. The presence of multiple Weyl points near the Fermi level and surface Fermi arcs dispersing across the Fermi level further support HfRhGe as a promising platform for topological superconductivity. Additionally, its noncentrosymmetric nature with time-reversal symmetry breaking superconducting state suggests that it can exhibit an intrinsic superconducting diode effect, offering novel optical and transport properties, with potential applications in dissipationless quantum&#160;electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrolysis of 2D Nanosheets Reverses Rheumatoid Arthritis Through Anti&#8208;Inflammation and Osteogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrolysis of the fabricated calcium disilicide nanoparticles (CSNs) produces anti&#8208;oxidative H2, alkaline Ca(OH)2, and silica. These moieties play significant roles in anti&#8208;oxidation, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and pro&#8208;osteogenesis resulting in&#160;considerably outperformed RA therapeutics. The multifunctional performances of CSNs are further confirmed in arthritic mouse and rabbit models, providing an advanced therapeutic strategy against RA with high biocompatibility.








Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a kind of inflammation homeostasis disorder that dysfunctions the joints. Clinically, medications against RA focus simply on mitigating the focal inflammation, without considering pro&#8208;osteogenesis re&#8208;modeling of the bone microenvironment. In the present work, 2D layered calcium disilicide nanoparticles (CSNs) are fabricated by facile aqueous exfoliation. The hydrolysis of CSNs produces anti&#8208;oxidative H2, alkaline Ca(OH)2, and silica. These moieties play significant roles in anti&#8208;oxidation, anti&#8208;inflammation, and pro&#8208;osteogenesis resulting in&#160;considerably better RA therapeutic consequences than anti&#8208;inflammation alone. Hydrogen gas is validated to eliminate excessive hydroxyl radicals and regulate macrophage re&#8208;polarization; the generated Ca(OH)2 can neutralize the acidic microenvironment and inhibit the osteoclast activity; and, the dissolved Ca2+ can effectively complex with phosphates to mineralize Ca3(PO4)2, promoting the osteogenesis of the focal joint. The multifunctional performances of CSNs are further confirmed in arthritic mouse and rabbit models, providing an advanced and robust therapeutic strategy against RA with high biocompatibility and clinical transformable promises.

Ultra&#8208;thin, layered single crystal films of molecular semiconductor 2,9&#8208;dioctylnaphtho[2,3&#8208;b]naphtha[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene (C8&#8208;DNTT&#8208;C8) are studied using conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM), revealing changes in out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrical current as a function of the number of molecular layers. A vertical transfer length method is devised, which enables to estimate the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport properties of an organic semiconductor at an unprecedented molecular length scale.








Abstract
High contact resistance remains the primary obstacle that hinders further advancements of organic semiconductors (OSCs) in electronic circuits. While significant effort has been directed toward lowering the energy barrier at OSC/metal contact interfaces, approaches toward reducing another major contributor to overall contact resistance &#8211; the bulk resistance &#8211; have been limited to minimizing the thickness of OSC films. However, the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane conductivity of OSCs, a critical aspect of bulk resistance, has largely remained unaddressed. In this study, multi&#8208;layered 2D crystalline, solution&#8208;processed films of the high&#8208;mobility molecular semiconductor 2,9&#8208;dioctylnaphtho[2,3&#8208;b] naphtha[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene (C8&#8208;DNTT&#8208;C8) are investigated using conductive&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM) to evaluate out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport. The findings reveal a linear increase in out&#8208;of&#8208;plane resistance with the number of molecular layers in the film, which is modeled using an equivalent circuit model with multiple tunneling barriers connected in series. Building upon these results, a vertical transfer length method (V&#8208;TLM) is developed, allowing one to determine the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane resistivity of OSC and providing insights into charge transport properties at a single molecule length scale. The V&#8208;TLM approach highlights the potential of C&#8208;AFM for investigating out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport in OSC thin films and holds promise for accelerating the screening of molecules for high&#8208;performance electronic devices.

         <title>In Situ Conversion of Artificial Proton&#8208;Rich Shell to Inorganic Maskant Toward Stable Single&#8208;Crystal Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ conversion of proton&#8208;rich shell to sub&#8208;nano F&#8208;&amp;P&#8208;maskant, which protects the single&#8208;crystal Ni&#8208;rich cathode from the attack of electrolyte in the long&#8208;term cycling and enables superhigh capacity retention of 83% after 800 cycles.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;nickel oxide with an integral structure can prevent intergranular cracks and the associated detrimental reactions. Yet, its low surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio makes surficial degradation a more critical factor in electrochemical performance. Herein, artificial proton&#8208;rich (ammonium bicarbonate) shell is successfully introduced on the nickel&#8208;rich LiNi0.92Co0.06Mn0.02O2 single crystals for in situ electrochemically conversing into inorganic maskant to enhance stability of cathode. The process is that the surficial enriched proton, once released from the ammonium bicarbonate shell (proton reservoir) during 1st charge, is immediately captured by LiPF6, in situ electrochemically conversing to LiF and Li3PO4 &#160;(sub&#8208;nano F&#8208;&amp;P&#8208;maskant). The in situ formed compact nano F&#8208;&amp;P&#8208;maskant significantly resists the cathode against electrolyte attack and improves the surface stability of particles during long&#8208;term cycling. Consequently, this surface modification enables 95% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a high voltage of 4.5&#160;V in the half cell and 83% capacity retention after 800 cycles in the full cell. This work demonstrates a strategy for reconstructing the protective layer using the rational design of surficial enriched proton shells for advanced lithium batteries.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Cocatalysts Reinforcing Hole Consumption for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Ultrahigh Apparent Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel strategy is proposed that reinforces hole consumption to boost the oxidation half&#8208;reaction and ultimately the photocatalytic H2 production. This is achieved by the rational design of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free cocatalysts as efficient oxidative sites, promoting the generation of sacrificial agents (CH3O&#8722;). Such a strategy can achieve a record apparent quantum efficiency of up to 65.8%.








Abstract
Achieving efficient and sustainable hydrogen production through photocatalysis is highly promising yet remains a significant challenge, especially when replacing costly noble metals with more abundant alternatives. Conversion efficiency with noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free alternatives is frequently limited by high charge recombination rates, mainly due to the sluggish transfer and inefficient consumption of photo&#8208;generated holes. To address these challenges, a rational design of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free cocatalysts as oxidative sites is reported to facilitate hole consumption, leading to markedly increased H2 yield rates without relying on expensive noble metals. By integrating femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, the rapid hole consumption is compellingly confirmed, which in turn promotes the effective separation and migration of photo&#8208;generated carriers. The optimized catalyst delivers an impressive photocatalytic H2 yield rate of 57.84 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, coupled with an ultrahigh apparent quantum efficiency reaching up to 65.8%. Additionally, a flow&#8208;type quartz microreactor is assembled using the optimal catalyst thin film, which achieves a notable H2 yield efficiency of 0.102 mL min&#8722;1 and maintains high stability over 1260 min of continuous operation. The strategy of reinforcing hole consumption through noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free cocatalysts establishes a promising pathway for scalable and economically viable solar H2 production.

         <title>Photoimmunologic Therapy of Stubborn Biofilm via Inhibiting Bacteria Revival and Preventing Reinfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oligo&#8208;ethylene glycol&#8208;modified lipophilic cationic photosensitizer is developed for photoimmunologic therapy of stubborn biofilm. It not only downregulates the two&#8208;component system, quorum sensing, and virulence factors, thereby reducing intercellular communication, inhibiting persistent bacterial regrowth, and accelerating wound healing but also triggers immunogenetic cell death to promote short&#8208;term immune and long&#8208;term immunological memory enhancement for coping with secondary infections.








Abstract
Stubborn biofilm infections pose serious threats to public health. Clinical practices highly rely on mechanical debridement and antibiotics, which often fail and lead to persistent and recurrent infections. The main culprits are 1) persistent bacteria reviving, colonizing, and rejuvenating biofilms, and 2) secondary pathogen exposure, particularly in individuals with chronic diseases. Addressing how to inhibit persistent bacteria revival and prevent reinfection simultaneously is still a major challenge. Herein, an oligo&#8208;ethylene glycol&#8208;modified lipophilic cationic photosensitizer (PS), TBTCP&#8208;PEG7, is developed. It effectively eradicates Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) under light irradiation. Furthermore, TBTCP&#8208;PEG7&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) not only conquers stubborn biofilm infections by downregulating the two&#8208;component system (TCS), quorum sensing (QS), and virulence factors, thereby reducing intercellular communication, inhibiting persistent bacterial regrowth and biofilm remodeling but also prevents reinfection by upregulating heat shock protein&#8208;related genes to induce immunogenetic cell death (ICD) and establish immune memory. In vivo, TBTCP&#8208;PEG7 efficiently eradicates MRSA biofilm adhered to medical catheters, stimulates angiogenesis, reduces inflammatory factor expression, and accelerates wound healing. Furthermore, ICD promotes short&#8208;term immune and long&#8208;term immunological memory for coping with secondary infections. This two&#8208;pronged strategy not only effectively overcomes stubborn, persistent and recurrent biofilm infection, but also provides theoretical guidance for designing the next generation of antibacterial materials.

         <title>In Situ Programmable, Active, and Interactive Crystallization by Localized Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on deterministic characteristics in the structuring of materials via additive manufacturing, crystals can be grown in an active and interactive manner, which realizes spatiotemporal programming and reprogramming of crystals. In the present study, snowflake&#8208;like camphor crystals are demonstrated with their real&#8208;time seeding and reprogramming via in situ, localized photopolymerization of mixture systems, which launches an era of active crystallization.









Abstract
Additive manufacturing has sought active and interactive means of creating predictable structures with diverse materials. Compared to such active manufacturing tools, current crystallization strategies remain in statistical and passive programs of crystals via macroscale thermodynamic controllers, commonly lacking active means to intervene in crystal growth in a spatiotemporal manner. Herein, a strategy toward active and interactive programming and reprogramming of crystals, realized by real&#8208;time tangible feedback on growing crystals by delicately controlling the degree of in&#8208;situ, localized photopolymerization of polymeric structures via additive manufacturing is presented. Using this strategy, crystals can be seeded, guided, and even reprogrammed in a supersaturated liquid resin. In principle, the localized formation of sparse polymeric networks within supercooled resins can induce density fluctuation to trigger seed nucleation instantaneously, whereas the formation of dense networks can lower molecules&#8217; mobilities to inhibit crystal growth. Assisted by these active triggers and deterministic procedural aspects in additive manufacturing, growing crystals can be tangibly interacted through programmed polymeric structures, strengthening deterministic characteristics in crystal growth. It is suggested that crystal growth can be programmable with deterministic hierarchies within the created crystal's morphologies within the background of inherent stochasticity in crystallization, launching an era of convolutional growth of crystals.

         <title>Na+&#8208;Complexed Dendritic Polyglycerols for Recovery of Frozen Cells and Their Network in Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryoprotectants in biological buffer systems often struggle due to the presence of abundant salts. A precise topological control of polyglycerols provides unique retention&#8208;and&#8208;release of sodium ions, which activates the formation of hydrogen bonding with ice interfaces. This interaction allows the polymer to inhibit ice growths both in intra&#8208; and extracellular spaces, resulting in successful post&#8208;thaw cell survival and network&#8208;forming functionality.








Abstract
In this study, a novel phenomenon is identified where precise control of topology and generation of polyglycerol induce the retention of Na+ ions in biological buffer systems, effectively inhibiting ice crystal growth during cryopreservation. Unlike linear and hyperbranched counterparts, densely&#8208;packed hydroxyl and ether groups in 4th&#8208;generation dendritic polyglycerol interact with the ions, activating the formation of hydrogen bonding at the ice interface. By inhibiting both intra&#8208; and extracellular ice growth and recrystallization, this biocompatible dendritic polyglycerol proves highly effective as a cryoprotectant; hence, achieving the cell recovery rates of &#8776;134&#8211;147%, relative to those of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, which is a conventional cryoprotectant for human tongue squamous carcinoma (HSC&#8208;3) cell line and human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells. Further, it successfully recovers the network&#8208;forming capabilities of HUVEC cells to &#8776;89% in tube formation after thawing. The Na+ ion retention&#8208;driven ice&#8208;growth inhibition activity in biological media highlights the unique properties of dendritic polyglycerol and introduces a new topological concept for cell&#8208;cryoprotectant development.

         <title>Cu&#8208;ZnS Modulated Multi&#8208;Carbon Coupling Enables High Selectivity Photoreduction CO2 to CH3CH2COOH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;ZnS exhibits excellent performance in the selective photoreduction of CO&#8322; to CH&#8323;CH&#8322;COOH, achieving a production rate of 0.45 &#181;mol h&#8722;&#185;, which increases to 16.9 &#181;mol h&#8722;&#185; with triethanolamine while maintaining a high product selectivity of 97%. Using in situ experimental techniques and theoretical calculations, the key C&#8323; intermediates are identified providing crucial insights into the CH&#8323;CH&#8322;COOH formation pathway.








Abstract
The direct photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O into high&#8208;value C3 chemicals holds great promise but remains challenging due to the intrinsic difficulty of C1&#8211;C1 and C2&#8211;C1 coupling processes and the lack of clarity regarding the underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, the design and synthesis of a Cu&#8208;ZnS photocatalyst featuring dispersed Cu single atoms are reported. These Cu single atoms are coordinated with S atoms, forming unique Cu&#8208;S&#8208;Zn active units with tunable charge distributions that interact favorably with surface&#8208;adsorbed intermediates. This configuration stabilizes the *COHCO intermediate and facilitates its subsequent coupling with *CO to form *COCOHCO both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable on the Cu&#8208;ZnS surface. Notably, multiple critical C3 intermediates, including *COCOHCO, *OCCCO, and *CHCHCO, are identified, providing a clear reaction pathway for CO2 to CH3CH2COOH conversion. The Cu&#8208;ZnS photocatalyst achieves a CO2 to CH3CH2COOH conversion rate of 0.45&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;&#185; with an electron selectivity of 91.2%. Remarkably, in the presence of triethanolamine, the production rate increases to 16.9&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;&#185; with a selectivity of 99.8%. These findings underscore the importance of modulating multicarbon coupling processes to enable the efficient photocatalytic transformation of CO2 into C3 products, paving the way for future advancements in sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Assembly of Halide Perovskite Nanoplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates sunlight&#8208;triggered perpetual flipping of halide perovskite nanoplatelets between stacked and scattered configurations, under light and dark, respectively. The photo&#8208;switchable mechanical response is driven by sulfide linkage dynamics and accompanied by a brown&#8208;to&#8208;red color change. The switchable control over electric current and reversible topographical oscillations offers possibilities for nanorobotics, nanoscale switches, and sensors.

Advancements in stimuli&#8208;driven nanoactuators necessitate the discovery of photo&#8208;switchable, self&#8208;contained semiconductor nanostructures capable of precise mechanical responses. The reversible assembly of 0D Cs3Bi2I9 halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) between stacked and scattered configurations are demonstrated under light and dark, respectively. This sunlight&#8208;triggered perpetual flipping of the NPLs, occurring in less than a minute, is associated with a color change between brown and red. The photomechanical response is driven by the formation and cleavage of sulfide linkages at the NPL surface. In the stacked configuration, various stacking modes create moir&#233; superstructures, enhancing the interlayer charge distribution, and increasing the electronic conductivity and optical absorbance. This leads to a decrease in exciton binding energy from 247 meV for scattered NPLs to 162 meV for stacked NPLs, resulting in a 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement in dark current for the stacked NPL films. The switchable control over color and electric current is continuously reversible and retraceable, exhibiting a minor memory effect observed during extended cycling. The self&#8208;flipping NPL nanoactuators demonstrate reversible mechanical responses, with topographical oscillations ranging from 14 nm in scattered NPLs to 50 nm in the vertically stacked configuration. This seamless reversible nano&#8208;assembly with color interchangeability offers numerous possibilities for nanorobotics, nanoscale switches, and sensors.

         <title>Nanozymes and Their Potential Roles in the Origin of Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes, as enzyme mimics, demonstrate not only enzyme&#8208;like structures and activities but also high stability and regulated catalytic functions. Minerals are also known for catalytic roles in the origin of life. Building on this foundation, this study proposes that nanozymes may serve as highly efficient pre&#8208;enzymatic catalysts, potentially participating in the transition from inorganic molecules to primitive cells in chemical evolution.









Abstract
The origin of life has long been a central scientific challenge, with various hypotheses proposed. The chemical evolution, which supposes that inorganic molecules can transform into organic molecules and subsequent primitive cells, laid the foundation for modern theories. Inorganic minerals are believed to play crucial catalytic roles in the process. However, the harsh reaction conditions of inorganic minerals hinder the accumulation of organic molecules, preventing the efficient transition from inorganic molecules to biomacromolecules. Given the inherent physicochemical properties and enzyme&#8208;like activities, this study proposes that nanozymes, nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities, act as efficient prebiotic catalysts in the origin of life. This hypothesis is based on the following: First, unlike traditional minerals, nanominerals can catalyze organic synthesis under milder conditions. Second, nanominerals can not only protect biomolecules from radiation damage but also catalyze polymerization reactions to form functional biomacromolecules and further lipid vesicles. More importantly, nanominerals are abundant in terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments. This perspective will systematically discuss the potential roles of nanozymes in the emergence of life based on the functions of minerals and the characteristics of nanozymes. We hope the research on nanozymes and the origin of life will bridge the gap between inorganic precursors and biomolecules under primitive environments.

         <title>Computational Modeling of Reticular Materials: The Past, the Present, and the Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reticular materials are advanced materials with applications in emerging technologies. A thorough understanding of material properties at operating conditions is critical to accelerate the deployment at an industrial scale. Herein, the status of computational modeling of reticular materials is reviewed, supplemented with topical examples highlighting recent modeling successes. Open challenges in the field are discussed to inspire future model developments.








Abstract
Reticular materials rely on a unique building concept where inorganic and organic building units are stitched together giving access to an almost limitless number of structured ordered porous materials. Given the versatility of chemical elements, underlying nets, and topologies, reticular materials provide a unique platform to design materials for timely technological applications. Reticular materials have now found their way in important societal applications, like carbon capture to address climate change, water harvesting to extract atmospheric moisture in arid environments, and clean energy applications. Combining predictions from computational materials chemistry with advanced experimental characterization and synthesis procedures unlocks a design strategy to synthesize new materials with the desired properties and functions. Within this review, the current status of modeling reticular materials is addressed and supplemented with topical examples highlighting the necessity of advanced molecular modeling to design materials for technological applications. This review is structured as a templated molecular modeling study starting from the molecular structure of a realistic material towards the prediction of properties and functions of the materials. At the end, the authors provide their perspective on the past, present of future in modeling reticular materials and formulate open challenges to inspire future model and method developments.

         <title>Antifouling Immunomodulatory Copolymer Architectures That Inhibit the Fibrosis of Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel copolymer coatings dramatically reduce the formation of fibrotic tissue on medical implants, extending device longevity. In vivo screening reveals that optimizing copolymer architecture is critical for synergizing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art antifouling and immunomodulatory antifibrotic moieties.








Abstract
Immune reactions to medical implants often lead to encapsulation by fibrotic tissue and impaired device function. This process is thought to initiate by protein adsorption, which enables immune cells to attach and mount an inflammatory response. Previously, several antifibrotic materials have been either designed to reduce protein adsorption or discovered via high&#8208;throughput screens (HTS) to favorably regulate inflammation. The present work introduces antifouling immunomodulatory (AIM) copolymer coatings, which combine both strategies to effectively enhance&#160;implant protection. AIM copolymers synergistically integrate zwitterionic moieties to resist protein fouling, HTS&#8208;derived antifibrotics for immunomodulation, and silane monomers for grafting to diverse substrates including elastomers, ceramics, and metals. Interestingly, simply combining these monomers into conventional random or block copolymer architectures yielded no significant advantage over homopolymers. By contrast, an unusual polymer chain architecture &#8212; a zwitterionic block flanked by a mixed zwitterionic immunomodulatory segment &#8212; showed superior fibrosis resistance in both peritoneal and subcutaneous sites over one month in immunocompetent mice. This architecture also improved the performance of two different HTS&#8208;derived antifibrotic monomers, suggesting that tailoring AIM architectures may broadly complement immunomodulatory chemistries and provide a versatile approach to improving implant longevity.

         <title>Bipolar Modulation in a Self&#8208;Powered Ultra&#8208;Wide Photodetector Based on Bi2Se3/AlInAsSb Heterojunction for Wavelength&#8208;Sensitive Imaging and Encrypted Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work constructs a wavelength&#8208;dependent, bipolarity&#8208;modulated self&#8208;powered ultra&#8208;wide Bi2Se3/AlInAsSb heterojunction photodetector (PD) with a response range of 250&#8211;1900&#160;nm, achieving a detectivity&#160;greater than 1010 Jones across the entire spectrum under zero bias. It also enables high&#8208;contrast broad&#8208;spectrum imaging and high&#8208;encryption optical communication.








Abstract
Broadband photodetectors (PDs) have garnered significant attention due to their ability to detect optical signals across a wide wavelength range, with applications spanning military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and medical imaging. However, existing broadband detectors face several practical challenges, including limited detection range, uneven photoresponse, and difficult to distinguish multispectral signals. To address these limitations, this study presents a self&#8208;powered ultra&#8208;wide PD based on the Bi2Se3/AlInAsSb heterojunction. The device can detect signals across a wide wavelength range from 250&#160;nm to 1900&#160;nm, exhibiting outstanding optoelectronic performance with a maximum responsivity of 0.5 A&#160;W&#8722;1, a detectivity of 4.2 &#215; 1012 Jones, a switching ratio of 1.1 &#215; 104, and an external quantum efficiency of 71.4%. Furthermore, the detector achieves a detectivity greater than 1010 Jones across the entire broadband range, significantly improving photoresponse uniformity. Notably, due to the differential band alignment of the two materials across spectral ranges, this detector exhibits a photocurrent polarity reversal in the 650&#8211;680&#160;nm range. Leveraging its broadband and bipolar characteristics, this PD successfully enables secure information encryption in communication systems. This study significantly advances broadband PD technology, enhancing its practical uses and introducing innovative solutions for secure communications, thus strengthening communication security and confidentiality.

A compositionally downgraded BiFeO3 is developed to produce enhanced self&#8208;poling by introducing compressive strain. Utilizing this large&#8208;area film over a 6&#8208;inch wafer, pMUTs with 6 &#215; 6 arrays at the device level are designed and micromanufactured. pMUT demonstrates sensitive converse piezoelectric response, even at a low frequency of 500 Hz and a high temperature of 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducers (pMUTs), especially those using lead&#8208;free materials, are crucial next&#8208;generation microdevices for precise actuation and sensing, driving advancements in medical, industrial, and environmental applications. Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) is emerging as a promising lead&#8208;free piezoelectric material to replace Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 in pMUTs. Despite its potential, the integration of BiFeO3 thin films into pMUTs has been hindered by poling issues. Here, a BiFeO3 heterostructure compositionally downgraded with Gd doping is developed to introduce compressive strain, resulting in strong self&#8208;poling. Utilizing a large&#8208;area self&#8208;poled thin film over an entire 6&#8208;inch wafer, a pMUT with a 6 &#215; 6 array at the device level is designed and evaluated. At a resonant frequency of 21 kHz, the dynamic vibration displacement can reach 24.0 nm. At 500 Hz, far below the resonant frequency of 21 kHz, the pMUT also displays sensitive converse piezoelectric response, even at a high temperature of 200&#160;&#176;C. This work represents a significant breakthrough in lead&#8208;free BiFeO3 thin film for practical sensing applications, paving the way for the transformation of macro&#8208;transducers into next&#8208;generation functional microdevices.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries: Materials, Strategies, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review addresses challenges and recent advances in fast&#8208;charging solid&#8208;state batteries, focusing on solid electrolyte and electrode materials, as well as interfacial chemistries. The role of multiscale modeling and simulation in understanding Li+ transport and interfacial phenomena is emphasized, providing insights into materials, strategies, and future prospects for high&#8208;performance, fast&#8208;charging solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
The ability to rapidly charge batteries is crucial for widespread electrification across a number of key sectors, including transportation, grid storage, and portable electronics. Nevertheless, conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries with organic liquid electrolytes face significant technical challenges in achieving rapid charging rates without sacrificing electrochemical efficiency and safety. Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) offer intrinsic stability and safety over their liquid counterparts, which can potentially bring exciting opportunities for fast charging applications. Yet realizing fast&#8208;charging SSBs remains challenging due to several fundamental obstacles, including slow Li+ transport within solid electrolytes, sluggish kinetics with the electrodes, poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact, as well as the growth of Li dendrites. This article examines fast&#8208;charging SSB challenges through a comprehensive review of materials and strategies for solid electrolytes (ceramics, polymers, and composites), electrodes, and their composites. In particular, methods to enhance ion transport through crystal structure engineering, compositional control, and microstructure optimization are analyzed. The review also addresses interface/interphase chemistry and Li+ transport mechanisms, providing insights to guide material design and interface optimization for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging SSBs.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Oxide&#8208;Ion Synaptic Transistor for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel all&#8208;solid&#8208;state oxide&#8208;ion synaptic transistor is developed, based on a Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 oxide&#8208;ion conductor electrolyte and La0.5Sr0.5FeO3&#8208;&#948; variable&#8208;resistance electrodes (channel, gate). This synaptic transistor efficiently operates at temperatures compatible with conventional electronics, exhibiting key synaptic behaviors with low energy consumption and high endurance. Integrated into an artificial neural network simulation, it achieved 96% accuracy in handwritten digit recognition, demonstrating significant potential for neuromorphic computing applications.








Abstract
Neuromorphic hardware facilitates rapid and energy&#8208;efficient training and operation of neural network models for artificial intelligence. However, existing analog in&#8208;memory computing devices, like memristors, continue to face significant challenges that impede their commercialization. These challenges include high variability due to their stochastic nature. Microfabricated electrochemical synapses offer a promising approach by functioning as an analog programmable resistor based on deterministic ion&#8208;insertion mechanisms. Here, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state oxide&#8208;ion synaptic transistor is developed, employing Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 as a superior oxide&#8208;ion conductor electrolyte and La0.5Sr0.5FeO3&#8208;&#948; as a variable&#8208;resistance channel able to efficiently operate at temperatures compatible with conventional electronics. This transistor exhibits essential synaptic behaviors such as long&#8208; and short&#8208;term potentiation, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, and post&#8208;tetanic potentiation, mimicking fundamental properties of biological neural networks. Key criteria for efficient neuromorphic computing are satisfied, including excellent linear and symmetric synaptic plasticity, low energy consumption per programming pulse, and high endurance with minimal cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle variation. Integrated into an artificial neural network (ANN) simulation for handwritten digit recognition, the presented synaptic transistor achieved a 96% accuracy on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology&#160;(MNIST) dataset, illustrating the effective implementation of the device in ANNs. These findings demonstrate the potential of oxide&#8208;ion based synaptic transistors for effective implementation in analog neuromorphic computing based on&#160;iontronics.

         <title>Directional Chiral Exciton Emission via Topological Polarization Singularities in all Van der Waals Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;symmetry metasurfaces directly patterned in WS2 thin film engender topological polarization singularities in the momentum space, which strongly interact with the exciton emission from the heterogeneously integrated monolayer MoSe2. Consequently, exciton emission with controllable chirality and directionality is achieved by combining both strong exciton emission and optical field manipulation in all van der Waals metasurfaces fully based on 2D materials.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with strong exciton effects have enabled diverse light emitting devices, however, their &#197;ngstrom thickness makes it challenging to efficiently manipulate exciton emission by themselves. Although their nanostructured multi&#8208;layer counterparts can effectively manipulate optical field at deep subwavelength thickness scale, these indirect band gap multi&#8208;layer TMDs are lack of strong luminescence, hindering their applications in light emitting devices. Here, the integration of monolayer TMDs is presented with nanostructured multi&#8208;layer TMDs, combining both strong exciton emission and optical manipulation in a single ultra&#8208;thin platform. Leveraging the topological polarization singularities in the all van der Waals metasurfaces, chiral exciton emission is experimentally demonstrated whose directionality can be controlled by tailoring metasurface's symmetry. These results provide an approach that can realize exciton emitting devices fully based on 2D materials with controllable polarization and directionality, and may unfold a new avenue for multi&#8208;functional 2D semiconductor light sources.

         <title>Ligand Inter&#8208;Relation Analysis Via Graph Theory Predicts Macrophage Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graph theory modeling of RGD nano inter&#8208;relation inversely proportional to the shortest path distance and proportional to the corresponding number of possible instances is harnessed. RGD nano inter&#8208;relation can be regulated by modulating the aspect ratio of magnetic nanobars, which can be increased by unidirectionally aligning or reversibly lifting magnetic nanobars, thereby promoting integrin&#8208;bearing filopodia penetration and adhesion&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of host macrophages.








Abstract
Graph theory has been widely used to quantitatively analyze complex networks of molecules, materials, and cells. Analyzing the dynamic complex structure of extracellular matrix can predict cell&#8208;material interactions but has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, graph theory&#8208;based mathematical modeling of RGD ligand graph inter&#8208;relation is demonstrated by differentially cutting off RGD&#8208;to&#8208;RGD interlinkages with flexibly conjugated magnetic nanobars (MNBs) with tunable aspect ratio. The RGD&#8208;to&#8208;RGD interlinkages are less effectively cut off by MNBs with a lower aspect ratio, which decreases the shortest path while increasing the number of instances thereof, thereby augmenting RGD nano inter&#8208;relation. This facilitates integrin recruitment of macrophages and thus actin fiber assembly and vinculin expression, which mediates pro&#8208;regenerative polarization, involving myosin II, actin polymerization, and rho&#8208;associated protein kinase. Unidirectional pre&#8208;aligning or reversibly lifting highly elongated MNBs both increase RGD nano inter&#8208;relation, which promotes host macrophage adhesion and switches their polarization from pro&#8208;inflammatory to pro&#8208;regenerative phenotype. The latter approach produces nano&#8208;spaces through which macrophages can penetrate and establish RGD links thereunder. Using graph theory, this study presents the example of mathematically modeling the functionality of extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;mimetic materials, which can help elucidate complex dynamics of the interactions occurring between host cells and materials via versatile geometrical nano&#8208;engineering.

This facilitates integrin recruitment of macrophages and thus actin fiber assembly and vinculin expression, which mediates pro-regenerative polarization, involving myosin II, actin polymerization, and rho-associated protein kinase. Unidirectional pre-aligning or reversibly lifting highly elongated MNBs both increase RGD nano inter-relation, which promotes host macrophage adhesion and switches their polarization from pro-inflammatory to pro-regenerative phenotype. The latter approach produces nano-spaces through which macrophages can penetrate and establish RGD links thereunder. Using graph theory, this study presents the example of mathematically modeling the functionality of extracellular-matrix-mimetic materials, which can help elucidate complex dynamics of the interactions occurring between host cells and materials via versatile geometrical nano-engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Scale Defect&#8208;Free Crystalline Membrane for Sieving Small Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Re&#8208;designing the metal source to eliminate cluster&#8208;missing defects and then adding extra ligands to heal the linker&#8208;missing defects realize the construction of angstrom&#8208;scale defect&#8208;free MOF membranes. The MOF membrane with intrinsic angstrom&#8208;sized lattice aperture shows an outstanding molecular sieving performance toward organic azeotropic mixtures, surpassing the upper&#8208;bound of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.








Abstract
Crystalline membranes, represented by the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with well&#8208;defined angstrom&#8208;sized apertures, have shown great potential for molecular separation. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to separate small molecules with very similar molecular size differences due to angstrom&#8208;scale defects during membrane formation. Herein, a stepwise assembling strategy is reported for constructing MOF membranes with intrinsic angstrom&#8208;sized lattice aperture lattice to separate organic azeotropic mixtures separation. The membrane is synthesized by redesigning the metal source, which reduces the coordination reaction rate to avoid cluster&#8208;missing defects. Then, extra ligands are introduced to overcome the coordination steric hindrance to heal the linker&#8208;missing defects. Ultralow&#8208;dose transmission electron microscopy is used to realize a direct observation of the angstrom&#8208;scale defects. For separating the challenging methanol&#8208;containing ester or ether azeotropic mixtures with molecular size difference as small as &lt;1 &#197;, the angstrom&#8208;scale defect&#8208;free MOF membrane exhibits an outstanding flux of &#8776;3700 g&#183;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 and separation factor of &#8776;247&#8211;524, far beyond the upper&#8208;bound of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;arts membranes. This study offers a feasible strategy for precisely constructing angstrom&#8208;confined spaces for diverse applications (e.g., separation, catalysis, and storage).

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Cellular Graphene Aerogel Through Multiscale Joint Strengthening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by employing multiscale modeling, the highly intrinsic anisotropic mechanical properties of the cell wall due to the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacked graphene sheets are uncovered, and multiscale joint strengthening strategies are proposed to improve fatigue performance of CGA.








Abstract
Despite fatigue free of monolayer graphene, its assemblies, like cellular graphene aerogels (CGA), are usually suffering of frequent fatigue and inherent strength degradation in repeated loading. In this work, by employing multiscale modeling, the highly intrinsic anisotropic mechanical properties of the cell wall due to the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacked graphene sheets are uncovered, which easily trigger the unique skeleton joints damage during repeated loading and contribute the primary fatigue mechanism of CGA. Conversely, multiscale joint strengthening strategies are proposed by interlayer crosslinking and joint curvation, improving the interlayer interaction, and decreasing interlayer stress during compression, respectively, so as to effectively suppress joint damage to improve fatigue performance of CGA. This work not only clarifies the underlying fatigue mechanism of 2D cellular materials but also highlights optimal design strategies for developing anti&#8208;fatigue graphene cellular structures.

         <title>Ionic Diode&#8208;Based Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic diode&#8208;based drug delivery system is demonstrated, which uses electric potential for spatiotemporally controlled yet sustained drug release with minimal leakage. It provides flow&#8208;free drug delivery at scales ranging from nanogram to microgram. In a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, it shows superior anti&#8208;tumor efficacy and reduced off&#8208;target immune toxicity compared to intratumoral drug injection.








Abstract
Drug delivery systems hold promise for delivering cytotoxic drugs by controlling the timing and location of the drug release. However, conventional delivery mechanisms often fall short of achieving spatiotemporally controlled yet sustained release, which is crucial for ensuring drug efficacy and minimizing impact on surrounding tissues. Here, an ionic diode&#8208;based drug delivery system is reported that is controlled by an electric potential and capable of releasing drugs at scales ranging from nanogram to microgram. The migrated drug is slowly but continuously diffused to the lesion through the hydrogel at the desired rate. The ionic diode provides flow&#8208;free drug delivery while minimizing unintended drug leakage over prolonged periods. Implanted in a freely moving tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, the system filled with doxorubicin demonstrated superior anti&#8208;tumor efficacy and minimal off&#8208;target immune toxicity compared to the intratumoral injection of free doxorubicin. With its mechanically compliant and biocompatible components, the system offers a safe and readily translatable approach to patients with surgically unresectable tumors.

         <title>Rationally Engineering Pro&#8208;Proteins and Membrane&#8208;Penetrating &#945;&#8209;Helical Polypeptides for Genome Editing Toward Choroidal Neovascularization Treatment</title>

         <dc:description>
Adenosine triphosphate&#8208;tagged pro&#8208;proteins are engineered to form stable nanocomplexes with guanidyl&#8208;rich, &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide and enable robust cytosolic delivery. By delivering ribonucleoprotein, this system induces pronounced genome editing against hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; after intravitreal injection, inhibiting neovascularization and subretinal fibrosis in choroidal neovascularization mice.









Abstract
Ribonucleoprotein (RNP)&#8208;based CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing holds great potential for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which however, is challenged by the lack of efficient cytosolic protein delivery tools. Herein, reversibly&#8208;phosphorylated pro&#8208;proteins (P&#8208;proteins) with conjugated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) tags are engineered and coupled with a membrane&#8208;penetrating, guanidine&#8208;enriched, &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide (LGP) to mediate robust and universal cytosolic delivery. LGP forms salt&#8208;stable nanocomplexes (NCs) with P&#8208;proteins via electrostatic interaction and salt bridging, and the helix&#8208;assisted, strong membrane activities of LGP enabled efficient cellular internalization and endolysosomal escape of NCs. Therefore, this approach allows efficient cytosolic delivery of a wide range of protein cargoes and maintains their bioactivities due to endolysosomal acidity&#8208;triggered traceless restoration of P&#8208;proteins. Notably, intravitreally delivered LGP/P&#8208;RNP NCs targeting hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) induce pronounced gene disruption to downregulate pro&#8208;angiogenic factors and alleviate subretinal fibrosis, ultimately provoking robust therapeutic efficacy in CNV mice. Such a facile and versatile platform provides a powerful tool for cytosolic protein delivery and genome editing, and it holds promising potential for the treatment of CNV&#8208;associated diseases, such as age&#8208;related macular degeneration.

         <title>Self&#8208;Wrinkling&#8208;Induced Mechanically Adaptive Patterned Surface of Photocuring Coating for Abrasion Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unravels a self&#8208;wrinkled mechanically adaptive patterned surface (SWMAPS) by a one&#8208;step UV&#8208;curing and self&#8208;wrinkling technique. Thanks to the mechanically adaptive performance of the bionic wrinkled microstructure, the SWMAPS with both random and programmable&#8208;irradiated wrinkles can withstand more than 600 cycles of reciprocating friction, which establishes a new field of mechanically adaptive patterned surface for mechanical enhancement.








Abstract
Providing mechanically adaptive performance to surfaces is significant in preserving materials from damage in variable environments, however, it has rarely been studied. Inspired by the mechanically adaptive behaviors of the surface microstructure on the carapace of desert scorpions and bark of desert tamarisks, a self&#8208;wrinkled mechanically adaptive patterned surface (SWMAPS) using one&#8208;step UV&#8208;curing and self&#8208;wrinkling technique is reported. Because of the fluorinated polyurethane photo&#8208;initiator formed by self&#8208;assembly at the top surface, UV&#8208;induced photo&#8208;crosslinking can spontaneously generate a gradient&#8208;crosslinked structure and wrinkled patterns with different morphology. With mechanically adaptive behavior originating from self&#8208;assembled fluorinated polyurethane photo&#8208;initiators, gradient&#8208;crosslinked structures, and self&#8208;wrinkled patterns, the SWMAPS remains intact under 600 cycles of reciprocating friction with little variation in the coefficient of friction and water contact angle. The SWMAPS prepared by programmable UV irradiation maintains integral under 1800 cycles of reciprocating friction with a stable friction coefficient. Furthermore, the SWMAPS is fabricated with high efficiency, regulated morphology, good surface mechanical properties, and self&#8208;recovery performance. This strategy establishes a new field of mechanically adaptive patterned surfaces, which significantly improves durability and prolongs the service life of materials in variable environments.

&lt;p&gt;This study unravels a self-wrinkled mechanically adaptive patterned surface (SWMAPS) by a one-step UV-curing and self-wrinkling technique. Thanks to the mechanically adaptive performance of the bionic wrinkled microstructure, the SWMAPS with both random and programmable-irradiated wrinkles can withstand more than 600 cycles of reciprocating friction, which establishes a new field of mechanically adaptive patterned surface for mechanical enhancement.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing mechanically adaptive performance to surfaces is significant in preserving materials from damage in variable environments, however, it has rarely been studied. Inspired by the mechanically adaptive behaviors of the surface microstructure on the carapace of desert scorpions and bark of desert tamarisks, a self-wrinkled mechanically adaptive patterned surface (SWMAPS) using one-step UV-curing and self-wrinkling technique is reported. Because of the fluorinated polyurethane photo-initiator formed by self-assembly at the top surface, UV-induced photo-crosslinking can spontaneously generate a gradient-crosslinked structure and wrinkled patterns with different morphology. With mechanically adaptive behavior originating from self-assembled fluorinated polyurethane photo-initiators, gradient-crosslinked structures, and self-wrinkled patterns, the SWMAPS remains intact under 600 cycles of reciprocating friction with little variation in the coefficient of friction and water contact angle. The SWMAPS prepared by programmable UV irradiation maintains integral under 1800 cycles of reciprocating friction with a stable friction coefficient. Furthermore, the SWMAPS is fabricated with high efficiency, regulated morphology, good surface mechanical properties, and self-recovery performance. This strategy establishes a new field of mechanically adaptive patterned surfaces, which significantly improves durability and prolongs the service life of materials in variable environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Clarifying the Active Structure and Reaction Mechanism of Atomically Dispersed Metal and Nonmetal Sites with Enhanced Activity for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel atomically dispersed catalyst (Co&#9472;Se/Co/NC) with the coexistence of Co single&#8208;atom sites and Co&#9472;Se dual&#8208;atom sites, exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability. The introduction of Se single atoms and the synergistic effect of Co single&#8208;atom and Co&#9472;Se dual atom can modulate the d&#8208;band center of metal sites and promote the desorption of *OH, thereby significantly accelerating the ORR process.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed transition metal (ADTM) catalysts are widely implemented in energy conversion reactions, while the similar properties of TMs make it difficult to continuously improve the activity of ADTMs via tuning the composition of metals. Introducing nonmetal sites into ADTMs may help to effectively modulate the electronic structure of metals and significantly improve the activity. However, it is difficult to achieve the co&#8208;existence of ADTMs with nonmetal atoms and clarify their synergistic effect on the catalytic mechanism. Therefore, elucidating the active sites within atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nonmetal materials and unveiling catalytic mechanism is highly important. Herein, a novel hybrid catalyst, with coexistence of Co single&#8208;atoms and Co&#9472;Se dual&#8208;atom sites (Co&#9472;Se/Co/NC), is successfully synthesized and exhibits remarkable performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Theoretical results demonstrate that the Se sites can effectively modulate the charge redistribution at Co active sites. Furthermore, the synergistic effect between Co single&#8208;atom sites and Co&#9472;Se dual&#8208;atom sites can further adjust the d&#8208;band center, optimize the adsorption/desorption behavior of intermediates, and finally accelerate the ORR kinetics. This work has clearly clarified the reaction mechanism and shows the great potential of atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nonmetal nanomaterials for energy conversion and storage applications.

         <title>Scintillating Glass Fiber Arrays Enable Remote Radiation Detection and Pixelated Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite quantum dots with efficient scintillating luminescence are incorporated in glass fibers with low&#8208;loss waveguiding, enabling remote, real&#8208;time radiation detection. More importantly, the scintillating glass fibers can be regularly arranged into a fiber array with controlled thickness and length for use in remote pixilated X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
The emerging metal halide perovskites are challenging the traditional scintillators in the field of radiation detection and radiography. However, they lack the capability for remote and real&#8208;time radiation monitoring and imaging in confined and hostile conditions. To address this issue, details on an inorganic scintillating glass fiber incorporating perovskite quantum dots (QDs) as highly efficient pixelated radiation emitters are reported, while the glass fibers themselves serve at the same time as low&#8208;loss waveguides, enabling long&#8208;distance and underwater X&#8208;ray detection. The multi&#8208;color emissions and controllable radiation sensitivities endow CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) QD scintillating glass fibers with the potential as wearable and visualized radiation indicators. Furthermore, these scintillating glass fibers can be regularly arranged into a fiber array plate with a thickness of 7.5&#160;mm to enhance X&#8208;ray absorption for X&#8208;ray imaging. Leveraging the light&#8208;guiding character of glass fibers, a 5 &#215; 5 fiber array with fiber lengths up to 11&#160;cm has demonstrated the potential of remote pixelated X&#8208;ray imaging. This study offers a novel platform for the development of remote detectors and imagers for X&#8208;ray radiation.

         <title>Highly Oriented WS2 Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale, highly oriented (almost monocrystalline) WS2 monolayers are synthesized on C/A&#8208;plane sapphire substrates by chemical vapor deposition. A record high saturation current density of 675&#160;&#181;A&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 is achieved based on field&#8208;effect transistors made of such films, outperforming the index required for high&#8208;density integration circuits in IRDS 2025.








Abstract
2D&#160;transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors represent the most promising channel materials for post&#8208;silicon microelectronics due to their unique structure and electronic properties. However, it remains challenging to synthesize wide&#8208;bandgap TMDCs monolayers featuring large areas and high performance simultaneously. Herein, highly oriented WS2 monolayers are reproducibly synthesized through a templated growth strategy on vicinal C/A&#8208;plane sapphire wafers. Various spectroscopic characterizations confirm the high crystallographic orientation and uniformity across the entire wafers. Electronic measurements for samples transferred onto SiO2/Si substrates reveal high average field&#8208;effect mobilities of 62 and 180 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 at room temperature and 8 K, respectively. On hexagonal boron nitride substrates, these mobilities increase to 94 and 473 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1, respectively. A record high saturation current density of 675&#160;&#181;A&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 is observed, outperforming the index required for high&#8208;density integration circuits in IRDS 2025. This work paves the way for the application of wide&#8208;bandgap TMDC monolayers in post&#8208;silicon electronics.

         <title>Multiple Polarization States in Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 Thin Films by Ferroelectric and Antiferroelectric Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the three&#8208;step domain switching characteristic in Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 thin films with ferroelectric and antiferroelectric coupling, in the form of triple&#8208;peak coercive electric field (EC) distribution. By fully switching individual peaks in the triple&#8208;peak EC distribution, the long&#8208;sought reliable operation of 3&#8208;bit per cell are realized in the Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 films, including high endurance, small device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation, and long data retention.








Abstract
HfO2&#8208;based multi&#8208;bit ferroelectric memory combines non&#8208;volatility, speed, and energy efficiency, rendering it a promising technology for massive data storage and processing. However, some challenges remain, notably polarization variation, high operation voltage, and poor endurance performance. Here we show Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 (x&#160;=&#160;0.65 to 0.75) thin films grown through sequential atomic layer deposition (ALD) of HfO2 and ZrO2 exhibiting three&#8208;step domain switching characteristic in the form of triple&#8208;peak coercive electric field (EC) distribution. This long&#8208;sought behavior shows nearly no changes even at up to 125&#160;&#176;C and after 1 &#215; 108 electric field cycling. By combining the electrical characterizations and integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM), we&#160;reveal that the triple&#8208;peak EC distribution is driven by the coupling of ferroelectric switching and reversible antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric transition. We further demonstrate the 3&#8208;bit per cell operation of the Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 capacitors with excellent device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation and long data retention,&#160;by the full switching of individual peaks in the triple&#8208;peak EC. The work represents a significant step in implementing reliable non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;state ferroelectric devices.

         <title>STING&#8208;Activating Polymers Boost Lymphatic Delivery of mRNA Vaccine to Potentiate Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LNP is modified by a novel STING&#8208;activating polymer (PD) to enhance immune effect of mRNA vaccines by boosting cellular uptake and triggering robust immune activation. Optimizing the polymerization of PD significantly amplifies mRNA translation efficiency and STING&#8208;mediated immune responses, offering a powerful approach to advance mRNA&#8208;based immunotherapy.









Abstract
The unprecedented success of mRNA vaccines against COVID&#8208;19 has inspired scientists to develop mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy. However, using nucleoside modified mRNA as vaccine, though evading innate immune toxicity, diminishes its therapeutic efficacy for cancers. Here, we report a polyvalent stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activating polymer (termed as PD) to bolster the immunogenicity of mRNA vaccine. PD is made of tertiary amine units and conjugated with a biodegradable alkyl chain. Co&#8208;formulation of PDs bearing different number of tertiary amines with lipid materials and mRNA resulted in the lipid&#8208;like nanoparticles (PD LNPs) which effectively promoted lymphatic delivery and elicited robust immune activation via the STING signaling pathway. Notably, PD with eighteen tertiary amines (PD18) is predominant in balancing immune activity and tolerability. Subcutaneous administration of PD18 LNPs containing ovalbumin (OVA) mRNA enhanced the frequency of antigen specific CD8+ T cell with immune memory, leading to potent anticancer efficacy that surpassed 2&#8242;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP in both prophylactic and therapeutic cancer models. Additionally, PD18 LNP&#8208;based mRNA vaccine showed conferred resistance to cancer challenge for up to 60 days. Overall, this study offers a new perspective of using STING&#8208; activating polymer for imparting synergistic activity in mRNA vaccine&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.

Chiral MnO2 supraparticles as renal&#8208;clearance biosensors for dual&#8208;mode in vivo detection of metalloproteinase&#8208;9 in early cancer diagnosis via circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).








Abstract
In this study, polypeptide TGGGPLGVARGKGGC&#8208;induced chiral manganese dioxide supraparticles (MnO2 SPs) are prepared for sensitive quantification of matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9) in vitro and in vivo. The results show that L&#8208;type manganese dioxide supraparticles (L&#8208;MnO2 SPs) exhibited twice the affinity for the cancer cell membrane receptor CD47 (cluster of differentiation, integrin&#8208;associated protein) than D&#8208;type manganese dioxide supraparticles (D&#8208;MnO2 SPs) to accumulate at the tumor site after surface modification of the internalizing arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (iRGD) ligand, specifically reacting with the MMP&#8208;9, disassembling into ultrasmall nanoparticles (NPs), and efficiently underwent renal clearance. Furthermore, L&#8208;MnO2 facilitates the quantification of MMP&#8208;9 in mouse tumor xenografts, as demonstrated by circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 2 h. A strong linear relationship is observed between MMP&#8208;9 concentration and both CD and MRI intensity, ranging from 0.01 to 10&#160;ng&#160;mL&#8722;1. The corresponding limits of detection (LOD) are 0.0054&#160;ng mL&#8722;1 for CD and 0.0062&#160;ng mL&#8722;1 for MRI, respectively. hese SPs provide a new approach for exploring chiral advanced biosensors for early diagnosis of cancer.

         <title>A Wet&#8208;Adhesion and Swelling&#8208;Resistant Hydrogel for Fast Hemostasis, Accelerated Tissue Injury Healing and Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogel bioadhesive taking the structural advantage of phenylalanine derivative for interfacial drainage and matrix toughening as well as various electrostatic interactions mediated by zwitterions is reported. The hydrogel adhesive can not only realize fast hemostasis and accelerated tissue/organ injuries healing in vivo but also can be assembled as bioelectronics for precise and long&#8208;term health monitoring under humid environments.








Abstract
Hydrogel bioadhesives with adequate wet adhesion and swelling resistance are urgently needed in clinic. However, the presence of blood or body fluid usually weakens the interfacial bonding strength, and even leads to adhesion failure. Herein, profiting from the unique coupling structure of carboxylic and phenyl groups in one component (N&#8208;acryloyl phenylalanine) for interfacial drainage and matrix toughening as well as various electrostatic interactions mediated by zwitterions, a novel hydrogel adhesive (PAAS) is developed with superior tissue adhesion properties and matrix swelling resistance in challenging wet conditions (adhesion strength of 85 kPa, interfacial toughness of 450 J m&#8722;2, burst pressure of 514 mmHg, and swelling ratio of &lt;4%). The PAAS hydrogel can not only realize fast hemostasis of liver, heart, artery rupture, and sealing of pulmonary air&#8208;leakage but also accelerate the recovery of stomach and liver defects in rat, rabbit, and pig models. Moreover, PAAS hydrogel can precisely and durably monitor various physiological activities (pulse, electrocardiogram, and electromyogram) even under humid environments (immersion in water for 3 days), and can be employed for the evaluation of in vivo sealing efficiency for artery rupture. The work provides a promising hydrogel adhesive for clinical hemostasis, tissue injury repair, and bioelectronics.

         <title>Amorphous High&#8208;entropy Phosphide Nanosheets With Multi&#8208;atom Catalytic Sites for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable electrodeposition combined phosphorization method is reported to synthesize a high&#8208;entropy phosphide/carbon (FeCoNiCuYP/C) composite. The Fe and Co/Ni sites in FeCoNiCuYP preferentially stabilize HO* and HOO* intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), disrupting the traditional scaling relation of Gibbs free energy for these intermediates. The FeCoNiCuYP/C demonstrates excellent OER performance, requiring low overpotentials of 316 mV@100 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mainly encompasses four elementary reactions, involving intermediates such as HO*, O*, and HOO*. Balancing the Gibbs free energies of these intermediates at a single active site is a challenging task. In this work, a high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, and Y metal elements is synthesized using an electrodeposition method, which then serves as a template for preparing a high&#8208;entropy phosphide/carbon (FeCoNiCuYP/C) composite. Notably, the obtained composite exhibits an amorphous structure with multiple catalytically active sites. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental measurements reveal the critical roles of Co/Ni and Fe atoms in tuning the electronic structure of FeCoNiCuYP and optimizing the binding strength of intermediates. Furthermore, Fe and Ni/Co sites prefer to stabilize the HO* and HOO* intermediates respectively, conducive to breaking their scaling relation of Gibbs free energy during OER. Owing to its fine&#8208;tuned composition and the synergistic effect of multiple active sites, the FeCoNiCuYP/C electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance in alkaline solutions, requiring a mere 316 mV overpotential to yield 100 mA cm&#8722;2 current density with excellent stability. This work provides an innovative route to design efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts, holding significant promise for cutting&#8208;edge electrocatalytic applications.

     alt="Amorphous High-entropy Phosphide Nanosheets With Multi-atom Catalytic Sites for Efficient Oxygen Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A controllable electrodeposition combined phosphorization method is reported to synthesize a high-entropy phosphide/carbon (FeCoNiCuYP/C) composite. The Fe and Co/Ni sites in FeCoNiCuYP preferentially stabilize HO* and HOO* intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), disrupting the traditional scaling relation of Gibbs free energy for these intermediates. The FeCoNiCuYP/C demonstrates excellent OER performance, requiring low overpotentials of 316 mV@100 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mainly encompasses four elementary reactions, involving intermediates such as HO*, O*, and HOO*. Balancing the Gibbs free energies of these intermediates at a single active site is a challenging task. In this work, a high-entropy metal-organic framework incorporating Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, and Y metal elements is synthesized using an electrodeposition method, which then serves as a template for preparing a high-entropy phosphide/carbon (FeCoNiCuYP/C) composite. Notably, the obtained composite exhibits an amorphous structure with multiple catalytically active sites. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental measurements reveal the critical roles of Co/Ni and Fe atoms in tuning the electronic structure of FeCoNiCuYP and optimizing the binding strength of intermediates. Furthermore, Fe and Ni/Co sites prefer to stabilize the HO* and HOO* intermediates respectively, conducive to breaking their scaling relation of Gibbs free energy during OER. Owing to its fine-tuned composition and the synergistic effect of multiple active sites, the FeCoNiCuYP/C electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance in alkaline solutions, requiring a mere 316 mV overpotential to yield 100 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density with excellent stability. This work provides an innovative route to design efficient high-entropy electrocatalysts, holding significant promise for cutting-edge electrocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chlorine Axial Coordination Activated Lanthanum Single Atoms for Efficient Oxygen Electroreduction with Maximum Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a universal synthesis method for rare&#8208;earth single&#8208;atom catalysts with Cl axially coordination for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which exhibits excellent ORR activity and successful applications in zinc&#8208;air batteries. The strong d&#8208;p orbital coupling between La and Cl significantly improves the electronic structure of the La site, ensuring efficient activation of O2 and suitable adsorption of *OH.








Abstract
Currently, there are still obstacles to rationally designing the ligand fields to activate rare&#8208;earth (RE) elements with satisfactory intrinsic electrocatalytic reactivity. Herein, axial coordination strategies and nanostructure design are applied for the construction of La single atoms (La&#8208;Cl SAs/NHPC) with satisfactory oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The nontrivial LaN4Cl2 motifs configuration and the hierarchical porous carbon substrate that facilitates maximized metal atom utilization ensure high half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#160;V) and significant robustness in alkaline media. The aqueous and flexible Zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) integrating La&#8208;Cl SAs/NHPC as the cathode catalyst exhibits a maximum power density of 260.7 and 68.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, representing one of the most impressive RE&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts to date. Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the Cl coordination evidently modulate the electronic structures of La sites, which promoted electron transfer efficiency by d&#8208;p orbital couplings. With enhanced electroactivity of La sites, the adsorptions of key intermediates are optimized to alleviate the energy barriers of the potential&#8208;determining step. Importantly, this preparation strategy is also successfully applied to other REs. This work provides perspectives for near&#8208;range electronic structure modulation of RE&#8208;SAs based on a nonplanar coordination micro&#8208;environment for efficient electrocatalysis.

         <title>Matching P&#8208; and N&#8208;type Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance Enables a Record High&#8208;gain Complementary Inverter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;smart&#8221; n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with glycolated side chains that forms a more ordered assembly when electrochemically doped, is reported along with a newly synthesized p&#8208;type conjugated polymer. The n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type polymers complement each other perfectly to construct an organic complementary inverter, achieving a record voltage gain of 307 VV&#8722;1.








Abstract
The charge transport of channel materials in n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is greatly limited by the adverse effects of electrochemical doping, posing a long&#8208;standing puzzle for the community. Herein, an&#160;n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with glycolated side chains (n&#8208;PT3) is introduced. This polymer can adapt to electrochemical doping and create more organized nanostructures, mitigating the adverse effects of electrochemical doping. This unique characteristic gives n&#8208;PT3 excellent charge transport in the doped state and reversible ion storage, making it highly suitable as an n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting (OMIEC) material. n&#8208;PT3 exhibits a high electron mobility of &#181; &#8776; 1.0 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a figure of merit value of &#181;C* &#8776; 100 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, representing one of the best results for n&#8208;type OMIEC materials. A new p&#8208;type OMIEC polymer has been synthesized as the channel material for constructing a complementary inverter to match the n&#8208;type OECT channel layer based on n&#8208;PT3. As a result, a voltage gain value of up to 307 VV&#8722;1 has been achieved, which is a record value for sub&#8722;1&#160;V complementary inverters based on OECTs. This work offers valuable insights into designing electrochemical doping adaptive n&#8208;type OMIEC materials and fabricating high&#8208;gain organic complementary inverters.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Metal Complexes in Biomedical Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal complexes are widely used in biomedical research due to their excellent properties. To further overcome the pharmacological limitations of metal complexes, the multifunctional nanomaterials are developed. This review introduces the self&#8208;assembly of metal complexes into nanoparticles of various shapes, the mechanism of self&#8208;assembly, and their applications in biomedical fields such as detection, imaging, and antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Cisplatin is widely used in clinical cancer treatment; however, its application is often hindered by severe side effects, particularly inherent or acquired resistance of target cells. To address these challenges, an effective strategy is to modify the metal core of the complex and introduce alternative coordination modes or valence states, leading to the development of a series of metal complexes, such as platinum (IV) prodrugs and cyclometalated complexes. Recent advances in nanotechnology have facilitated the development of multifunctional nanomaterials that can selectively deliver drugs to tumor cells, thereby overcoming the pharmacological limitations of metal&#8208;based drugs. This review first explores the self&#8208;assembly of metal complexes into spherical, linear, and irregular nanoparticles in the context of biomedical applications. The mechanisms underlying the self&#8208;assembly of metal complexes into nanoparticles are subsequently analyzed, followed by a discussion of their applications in biomedical fields, including detection, imaging, and antitumor research.

         <title>Creating Single&#8208;Crystalline &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 for High&#8208;Performance Dielectric Packaging Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum doping strategy is used to form less aggregated structural domains, creating a favorable environment for the precipitation of nanoscale polycrystalline CaSiO3. Through the process of anomalous grain growth, the nanoscale &#945;&#8208;CaSiO3 crystals are fully absorbed, rearranged, and transformed into micrometer&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3. The highly ordered layered structure of &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 provides efficient pathways for ion and electron transport, reducing its dielectric constant, while the single&#8208;crystalline structure enhances the mechanical properties of the electronic substrate.








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 based glass&#8208;ceramics are among the most reliable materials for electronic packaging. However, developing a CaSiO3 glass&#8208;ceramic substrate with both high strength (&gt;230&#160;MPa) and low dielectric constant (&lt;5) remains challenging due to its polycrystalline nature. The present work has succeeded in synthesizing single&#8208;crystalline &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 for a high&#8208;performance glass&#8208;ceramic substrate. This is accomplished by introducing Al3+ into the CaO&#8208;B2O3&#8208;SiO2 glass system, and by optimizing the sintering condition. Al3+ doping facilitates a heterogeneous network structure that energetically favors the precipitation of polycrystalline particles, including nanosized &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 crystals and sub&#8208;nanosized &#945;&#8208;CaSiO3 crystals. As the sintering temperature increases, the nano &#945;&#8208;CaSiO3 crystals (2&#8211;10&#160;nm) are gradually absorbed by the &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 crystals. Through atomic rearrangement, &#945;&#8208;CaSiO3 crystals transform into micrometer&#8208;sized single crystal &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 (1&#8211;2&#160;&#181;m) with layered structure. The low temperature co&#8208;fired &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 glass&#8208;ceramics exhibit exceptional properties, including a low dielectric constant of 4.04, a low dielectric loss of 3.15 &#215; 10&#8722;3 at 15&#160;GHz, and a high flexural strength of 256&#160;MPa. This work provides a new strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystalline glass&#8208;ceramics for electronic packaging and other applications.

The low temperature co-fired &#946;-CaSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; glass-ceramics exhibit exceptional properties, including a low dielectric constant of 4.04, a low dielectric loss of 3.15 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 15&#160;GHz, and a high flexural strength of 256&#160;MPa. This work provides a new strategy for fabricating high-performance single-crystalline glass-ceramics for electronic packaging and other applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetointeractive Cr2Te3&#8208;Coated Liquid Metal Droplets for Flexible Memory Arrays and Wearable Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy for coating liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials. The fabricated chromium(III)&#8208;telluride&#8208;coated liquid metal droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, nonadhesion to surfaces, and cost&#8208;effective recyclability. Their functionality is demonstrated in magnetointeractive memory devices and wearable sensors for dynamic gesture recognition, broadening the potential applications of flexible electronics.








Abstract
Magnetic liquid metal droplets, featured by unique fluidity, metallic conductivity, and magnetic reactivity, are of growing significance for next&#8208;generation flexible electronics. Conventional fabrication routes, which typically incorporate magnetic nanoparticles into liquid metals, otherwise encounter the pitfall pertaining to surface adhesivity and corrosivity over device modules. Here, an innovative approach of synergizing liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials is presented, accordingly creating chromium(III)&#8208;telluride&#8208;coated liquid metal (CT&#8211;LM) droplets via a simple self&#8208;assembly process. The CT&#8211;LM droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, demonstrate nonadherence to various surfaces, and enable cost&#8208;effective recycling of components. The functionality of CT&#8211;LM droplets is validated through their use in magnetointeractive memory devices to enable sensing/storing 64 magnetic paths and in wearable sensors as the flexible vibrator for dynamic gesture recognition with machine learning assistance. This work opens new avenues for the functional droplet design and broadens the horizons of flexible electronics.

         <title>Stabilizing Electron Transport of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials are a potential candidate for beyond&#8208;silicon electronics. However, the stability is one of the key bottlenecks in the progress of 2D materials. Here, a strategy is developed that greatly improves the performance and stability of 2D materials and devices by using vitamin C. The increase in mobility is more than ten times, and the performance can be maintained in air conditions for more than 327 days.








Abstract
2D materials are promising candidates for beyond&#8208;Si electronic devices. However, their stability is a key bottleneck in their industrial applications. The instability of 2D materials is mainly attributed to their intrinsic susceptibility to O2 and H2O&#8212;particularly to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have strong oxidizing properties. Inspired by the antioxidant effect of vitamin C (VC) in organisms, a strategy based on the use of VC to stabilize electron transport in 2D materials is developed, which significantly improves the performance and stability of these materials and devices. The mobility is increased by more than an order of magnitude, and excellent performance of the device is maintained in air for &gt;327 days, which is the best reported stability for MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors to date. VC scavenges existing ROS via oxidation reactions and inhibits the generation of ROS by shielding excitons from oxygen quenching, which provides 2D materials lasting protection from electron trapping and oxidative damage, stabilizing electron transport. This approach, which is based on the simple utilization of readily available VC, has considerable potential for large&#8208;scale applications in the 2D material electronics industry.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoflower Array Electrodes with Optimizable Reaction Pathways for Low&#8208;Voltage Hydrogen Production at Industrial&#8208;Grade Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing sufficiently effective bifunctional electrodes for low&#8208;voltage hydrogen production at industrial&#8208;grade current density is highly significant but challenging. This work innovatively engineers high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoflower array electrodes with abundant high&#8208;activity sites and optimizable reaction pathways, and achieves unprecedented performance for two&#8208;electrode hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen production at industrial&#8208;grade current densities.








Abstract
Developing sufficiently effective non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for large&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen production is highly significant but challenging, especially in low&#8208;voltage hydrogen production systems. Here, we innovatively report high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoflower array (HEANFA) electrodes with optimizable reaction pathways for hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen production at industrial&#8208;grade current densities. Atomic&#8208;resolution structural analyses confirm the single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;solution structure of HEANFA. The HEANFA electrodes exhibit the top&#8208;level electrocatalytic performance for both the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Furthermore, the hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted splitting (OHzS) system assembled with HEANFA as both anode and cathode exhibits a record&#8208;breaking performance for hydrogen production. It achieves ultralow working voltages of 0.003, 0.081, 0.260, 0.376, and 0.646&#160;V for current densities of 10, 100, 500, 1&#160;000, and 2&#160;000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, and remarkable stability for 300&#160;h, significantly outperforming those of previously reported OHzS systems and other chemicals&#8208;assisted hydrogen production systems. Theoretical calculations reveal that extraordinary performance of HEANFA for OHzS is attributed to its abundant high&#8208;activity sites and optimizable reaction pathways in HER and HzOR. In particular, HEANFA enables intelligent migration of key intermediates during HzOR, thereby optimizing the reaction pathways and creating high&#8208;activity sites, ultimately endowing the extraordinary performance for OHzS.

         <title>HClO&#8208;Activated Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescent Probes with a Malononitrile Group for In&#8208;Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight chemiluminescence (CL) probes with a malononitrile group are easily synthesized by introducing donors to regulate HClO&#8208;activated CL emissions from 600 to 750&#160;nm, with comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations supporting a concerted decomposition of the oxidized CL molecule, achieving high&#8208;contrast imaging of acute inflammation in vivo with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) of 24.77.









Abstract
Chemiluminescence (CL)&#160;imaging has emerged as a powerful approach to molecular imaging that allows exceptional sensitivity with virtually no background interference because of its unique capacity to emit photons without an external excitation source. Despite its high potential, the application of this nascent technique faces challenges because the current chemiluminescent agents have limited reactive sites, require complex synthesis, are insufficiently bright, and lack near&#8208;infrared emission. Herein, a series of HClO&#8208;activated chemiluminescent probes that exhibit robust near&#8208;infrared emission are studied. Specifically engineered to respond to HClO, a known biomarker of acute inflammation, these probes achieve high&#8208;contrast in vivo imaging by eliminating the need for constant external excitation. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the CL of the probes depends on the reactivity of the vinylene bonds, following a concerted decomposition of the oxidized chemiluminescent molecule. The application of these chemiluminescent nanoparticles in vivo facilitates high&#8208;contrast imaging of acute inflammation, providing real&#8208;time, high&#8208;contrast visualization of inflammatory conditions. This advancement signifies a leap forward for chemiluminescent nanoplatforms in biomedical imaging and expands the available methodologies in this field.

         <title>Coherent&#8208;Precipitation&#8208;Stabilized Phase Formation in Over&#8208;Stoichiometric Rocksalt&#8208;Type Li Superionic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase formation mechanisms of the over&#8208;stoichiometric rocksalt&#8208;type Li superionic conductor are systematically investigated. The spinel&#8208;like phase with unconventional stoichiometry forms as coherent precipitate from the cation&#8208;disordered rocksalt phase upon fast cooling, preventing decomposition into equilibrium phases and kinetically trapping the metastable face&#8208;sharing configurations. The ionic conductivity is further optimized to 1.45&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature through low&#8208;temperature post&#8208;annealing.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;The phase formation mechanisms of the over-stoichiometric rocksalt-type Li superionic conductor are systematically investigated. The spinel-like phase with unconventional stoichiometry forms as coherent precipitate from the cation-disordered rocksalt phase upon fast cooling, preventing decomposition into equilibrium phases and kinetically trapping the metastable face-sharing configurations. The ionic conductivity is further optimized to 1.45&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature through low-temperature post-annealing.

         <title>A One&#8208;Stone&#8208;Two&#8211;Birds Strategy for Intervertebral Disc Repair: Constructing a Reductive Chelation Hydrogel to Mitigate Oxidative Stress and Promote Disc Matrix Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HA&#8208;NCSN/Cu is a new type of hydrogel formed by reducing crosslinking, which shows multi&#8208;functions such as injectable, self&#8208;healing, reactive oxygen species clearance, photothermal properties, and so on. The successful application of HA&#8208;NCSN/Cu in combination with mild photothermal therapy in the treatment of disc degeneration strongly proves its promising application potential.








Abstract
Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is characterized by fibrosis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and accelerated surrounding extracellular matrix catabolism. Bioactive hydrogels have shown significant potential in regulating cellular functions and tissue homeostasis. In this work, a dynamic hydrogel (HA&#8208;NCSN/Cu) is designed via the reductive chelation of hyaluronic acid grafted with thiourea (HA&#8208;NCSN) and Cu2+. The reductivity of the grafted thiourea groups of HA&#8208;NCSN can quickly reduce part of the chelated Cu2+ to Cu+. Therefore, during the gelation process, the color of hydrogel become dark immediately, which endowed hydrogel with remarkable photothermal effect. The abundant thiourea groups inside hydrogel can effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species to mitigate the inflammatory stress of NP cells. RNA sequencing analysis further reveals that glutathione signaling pathway is significantly altered. Meanwhile, mild photothermal therapy could activate the TGF&#8208;&#946;/Smad pathway in NP cells, promoting the expression and secretion of Aggrecan and Collagen II. Ultimately, the combined modulation of inflammation alleviation and matrix regeneration achieves the restoration of the structure and function of the damaged intervertebral disc, which is also strongly demonstrated by the in vivo animal experiments. All of these results demonstrate the great potential of the dynamic HA&#8208;NCSN/Cu hydrogel in IVDD treatment.

         <title>Tough Polyurethane Hydrogels with a Multiple Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Interlocked Bicontinuous Phase Structure Prepared by In Situ Water&#8208;Induced Microphase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough polyurethane hydrogels with a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond interlocked bicontinuous phase structure are prepared by in situ water&#8208;induced microphase separation. The outstanding mechanical performances endow the hydrogels with the capability to resist abdominal pressure and prevent hernia formation in vivo.








Abstract
Hydrogels with mechanical performances similar to load&#8208;bearing tissues are in demand for in vivo applications. In this work, inspired by the self&#8208;assembly behavior of amphiphilic polymers, polyurethane&#8208;based tough hydrogels with a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond interlocked bicontinuous phase structure through in situ water&#8208;induced microphase separation strategy are developed, in which poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based polyurethane (PEG&#8208;PU, hydrophilic) and poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#8208;based polyurethane (PCL&#8208;PU, hydrophobic) are blended to form dry films followed by water swelling. A multiple hydrogen bonding factor, imidazolidinyl urea, is introduced into the synthesis of the two polyurethanes, and the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between PEG&#8208;PU and PCL&#8208;PU can promote homogeneous microphase separation for the construction of bicontinuous phase structures in the hydrogel network, by which the hydrogel features break strength of 12.9 MPa, fracture energy of 2435 J m&#8722;2, and toughness of 48.2 MJ m&#8722;3. As a biomedical patch, the outstanding mechanical performances can withstand abdominal pressure to prevent hernia formation in the abdominal wall defect model. Compared to the commercial PP mesh, hydrogel can prevent tissue/organ adhesion to reduce inflammatory responses and promote angiogenesis, thereby accelerating the repair of abdominal wall defects. This work may provide useful inspiration for researchers to design different gel materials through solvent&#8208;induced microphase separation.

         <title>A Critical Perspective on Photothermal De&#8208;Icing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective provides a comprehensive overview of three distinct photothermal mechanisms. It discusses recent advancements in photothermal de&#8208;icing and elucidates key challenges in their application. Through a detailed presentation of a comparative dataset and critical insights, valuable guidance is provided for future research, particularly in the strategic selection of materials and structure designs, to advance practical de&#8208;icing solutions in real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
To tackle the formidable challenges posed by extreme cold weather events, significant advancements have been made in developing functional surfaces capable of efficiently removing accreted ice. Nevertheless, many of these surfaces still require external energy input, such as electrical power, which raises concerns regarding their alignment with global sustainability goals. Over the past decade, increasing attention has been directed toward photothermal surface designs that harness solar energy&#8722;a resource available on Earth in quantities exceeding the total reserves of coal and oil combined. By converting solar energy into heat, these designs enable the transformation of the interfacial solid&#8208;solid contact (ice&#8208;substrate) into a liquid&#8208;solid contact (water&#8208;substrate), significantly reducing interfacial adhesion and facilitating rapid ice removal. This critical perspective begins by emphasizing the advantages of photothermal design over traditional de&#8208;icing methods. It then delves into an in&#8208;depth analysis of three primary photothermal mechanisms, examining how these principles have expanded the scope of de&#8208;icing technologies and contributed to advancements in photothermal surface design. Finally, key fundamental and technical challenges are identified, offering strategic guidelines for future research aimed at enabling practical, real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>PEDOTs&#8208;Based Conductive Hydrogels: Design, Fabrications, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the authors comprehensively examine the design strategies, fabrication technologies, and diverse applications of P&#8208;CHs. By summarizing design strategies, such as molecular, network, phase, and structural engineering, and exploring both 2D and 3D fabrication techniques, it offers a comprehensive overview of P&#8208;CHs applications in diverse fields including bioelectronics, soft actuators, energy devices, and solar evaporators.








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels combine the benefits of soft hydrogels with electrical conductivity and have gained significant attention over the past decade. These innovative materials, including poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOTs)&#8208;based conductive hydrogels (P&#8208;CHs), are promising for flexible electronics and biological applications due to their tunable flexibility, biocompatibility, and hydrophilicity. Despite the recent advances, the intrinsic correlation between the design, fabrications, and applications of P&#8208;CHs has been mostly based on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error&#8208;based Edisonian approaches, significantly limiting their further development. This review comprehensively examines the design strategies, fabrication technologies, and diverse applications of P&#8208;CHs. By summarizing design strategies, such as molecular, network, phase, and structural engineering, and exploring both 2D and 3D fabrication techniques, this review offers a comprehensive overview of P&#8208;CHs applications in diverse fields including bioelectronics, soft actuators, energy devices, and solar evaporators. Establishing this critical internal connection between design, fabrication, and application aims to guide future research and stimulate innovation in the field of functional P&#8208;CHs, offering broad benefits to multidisciplinary researchers.

         <title>Interface Storage Mechanism in Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Supercapacitors with Keggin&#8208;Type Polyoxometalates&#8208;Modified Ag&#8208;BTC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
{PMo12} and {PW12}, which possess many metal&#8208;Ox active sites, have been used as aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion supercapacitor materials to achieve extremely high&#8208;activity charge storage through a surface&#8208;interface energy storage mechanism. Supercapacitor devices assembles with the same energy storage mechanism but different redox potential electrode materials for the positive and negative electrodes can attain ultrahigh energy density and effectively enhance stability.








Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion supercapacitors (AISCs) offer considerable potential for future development owing to their low cost, high safety, environmental sustainability, and efficient electrochemical energy storage capabilities. The rapid and efficient charge&#8208;transfer process at the AISC can endow them with high capacitive and cycling stabilities. However, the prolonged intercalation/deintercalation of NH4+ in layered and framework materials often results in the cleavage of the active sites and the deconstruction of the framework, which makes it difficult to achieve long&#8208;term stable energy storage while maintaining high capacitance in the electrode materials. Herein, highly redox&#8208;active polyoxometalates (POMs) modified [Ag3(&#181;&#8208;Hbtc)(&#181;&#8208;H2btc)]n (Ag&#8208;BTC) is used as electrode materials. POMs effectively promote the pseudocapacitance storage of NH4+ through a similar interface storage mechanism. At a current density of 1 A g&#8722;1, {PMo12}@Ag&#8208;BTC exhibited a specific capacitance of 619.4 mAh g&#8722;1 and retained 100% of its capacitance after 20,000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. An asymmetrical battery with {PMo12}@Ag&#8208;BTC and {PW12}@Ag&#8208;BTC as positive and negative electrode materials, respectively, achieved an energy density of 125.3 Wh kg&#8722;1. The interface&#8208;capacitance process enables the full utilization of metal&#8208;Ox (x = b, c, t) sites within the POMs, significantly enhancing charge storage. This study emphasizes the considerable potential of POM&#8208;based electrode materials for NH4+ intercalation/deintercalation energy storage.

Single&#8208;particle analysis has seen significant success in structural biology, yet its potential applications in synthetic chemical systems remain underexplored.

Abstract
Single&#8208;particle analysis (SPA) is a fundamental method of cryo&#8208;electron microscopy developed to resolve the structures of biological macromolecules. This method has seen significant success in structural biology, yet its potential applications in synthetic chemical systems remain underexplored. In this perspective article, SPA and associated electron microscopy techniques are first briefly introduced. It is then proposed that SPA is well&#8208;suited for structural analysis of chemical systems where discrete, identical macromolecules can be readily obtained. Applicable systems include various clusters such as coinage metal clusters, metal&#8208;oxo/sulfur clusters, metal&#8211;organic clusters, and supramolecular compounds like coordination cages and metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages. When high&#8208;quality large single crystals are unattainable, SPA provides an alternative method for determining their structures. Beyond these end products, it is suggested that SPA can be instrumental in studying synthetic intermediates of materials with specific building units, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks and zeolites. Given that various intermediates coexist in the reaction system, a purification step is necessary before conducting SPA, which can be facilitated by soft&#8208;landing electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

         <title>Passivation Layers in Mg&#8208;Metal Batteries: Robust Interphases for Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inert passivation layer formed on the Mg&#8208;metal anode that blocks the transport of Mg2+ emerges as a good conductor for Li+ transport and provides sturdy protection on Li&#8208;metal anodes in carbonate ester electrolytes.








Abstract
In advanced batteries, interphases serve as the key component in stabilizing the electrolyte with reactive electrode materials far beyond thermodynamic equilibria. While an active interphase facilitates the transport of working ions, an inactive interphase obstructs ion flow, constituting the primary barrier to the realization of battery chemistries. Here, a successful transformation of a traditionally inactive passivating layer on Mg&#8208;metal anode, characteristic of Mg&#8208;metal batteries with typical carbonate electrolytes, into an active and robust interphase in the Li&#8208;metal scenario is presented. By further strategically designing magnesiated Li+ electrolytes, the in situ development of this resilient interphase on Li&#8208;metal anodes, imparting enduring stability to Li&#8208;metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes is induced. It is identified that the strong affinity between Mg2+ and anions in magnesiated Li+ electrolytes assembles ionic clusters with a bias for reducibility, thereby catalyzing the creation of anion&#8208;derived interphases rich in inorganic constituents. The prevalence of ionic clusters induced by magnesiation of electrolytes has brought properties only available in high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, suggesting a fresh paradigm of tailing electrolytes for highly reversible LMBs.

         <title>Lubricated Surface in a Vertical Double&#8208;Sided Architecture for Radiative Cooling and Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lubricated surface (LS) coating on the condenser side in a vertical double&#8208;sided architecture is used. The design not only effectively doubles the local cooling power, but also eliminates contact&#8208;line pinning, enabling passive, gravity&#8208;driven collection of water. This system achieves a condensation rate &#8776;87% of the theoretical limit with up to 90% of the total condensate passively collected.








Abstract
Radiative cooling significantly lowers condenser temperatures below ambient levels, enabling atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) without additional energy. However, traditional sky&#8208;facing condensers have low cooling power density, and water droplets remain pinned on surface, requiring active condensate collection. To overcome these challenges, a lubricated surface (LS) coating&#8212;consisting of highly scalable polydimethylsiloxane elastomer lubricated with silicone oil&#8212;is introduced on the condenser side in a vertical double&#8208;sided architecture. The design not only effectively doubles the local cooling power, but also eliminates contact&#8208;line pinning, enabling passive, gravity&#8208;driven collection of water. Robust AWH is demonstrated from a 30 &#215; 30 cm2 sample in outdoor environments (of varying humidity levels and wind speeds in different months) and with no artificial flow of humidified air. In one outdoor test, the passive water collection rate of LS coating reaches 21 g m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 double that on superhydrophobic surface, 10 g m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. In indoor testing (20&#160;&#176;C and 80% relative humidity), this system achieves a condensation rate &#8776;87% of the theoretical limit with up to 90% of the total condensate passively collected. this approach achieves effective AWH in a decentralized approach that removes the need for piping infrastructure and external energy input.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Transfer of MXene Films with Enhanced Device Performance via 2D Liquid Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and straightforward transfer process is developed for 4&#8208;inch wafer&#8208;scale Ti3C2Tx MXene films, in which damage and deformation are minimized. Uniform vdW stacking of several types of large&#8208;area heterojunctions MXene/MoS2/MXene are well demonstrated. By utilizing 2D liquid reductants to modify the MXene/MoS2 interface, a more than 100&#8208;fold increase in carrier transfer efficiency is achieved.

Wafer&#8208;scale transfer processes of 2D materials significantly expand their application space in scalable microelectronic devices with excellent and tunable properties through van der Waals (vdW) stacking. Unlike many 2D materials, wafer&#8208;scale transfer of MXene films for vdW contact engineering has not yet been reported. With their rich surface chemistry and tunable properties, the transfer of MXenes can enable enormous possibilities in electronic devices using interface engineering. Taking advantage of the MXene hydrophilic surface, a straightforward, green, and fast process for the transfer of MXene films at the wafer scale (4&#8208;inch) is developed. Uniform vdW stacking of several types of large&#8208;area heterojunctions including MXene/MXene (Ti3C2Tx, Nb2CTx, and V2CTx), MXene/MoS2, and MXene/Au is further demonstrated. Multilayer support is applied to minimize damage or deformation in the transfer process of patterned Ti3C2Tx film. It allows us to fabricate thin film transistors and manipulate the MXene/MoS2 interface through the intercalation of various 2D liquids. Particularly noteworthy is the significant enhancement of the interfacial carrier transfer efficiency by &#8776;2 orders of magnitude using hydrogen iodide (HI) intercalation. This finding indicates a wide range of possibilities for interface engineering by transferring MXene films and employing liquid&#8208;assisted interfacial intercalation.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of MoxSy via Boron&#8208;Doping for Electrochemical N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed boron&#8208;doped molybdenum sulfide (B&#8208;Mo&#8208;MoxSy) electrocatalyst demonstrates improved N2 reduction at an onset potential of &#8722;0.15 V versus. RHE, achieving Faradaic efficiencies of 78% and an NH3 yield of 5.83 &#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in 0.05 m H2SO4(aq). The outstanding NRR performance is attributed to the phase transition of MoxSy, Mo sites, and B doping, which promotes N2 reduction to NH3.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3) through the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient temperature and pressure is emerging as an alternative approach to the conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, it remains a significant challenge due to poor kinetics, low nitrogen (N2) solubility in aqueous electrolytes, and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which can significantly impact NH3 production rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, a rationally designed boron&#8208;doped molybdenum sulfide (B&#8208;Mo&#8208;MoxSy) electrocatalyst is reported that effectively enhances N2 reduction to &#160;NH3 with an onset potential of &#8722;0.15&#160;V versus RHE, achieving a FE of 78% and an NH3 yield of 5.83&#160;&#181;g h&#8315;&#185; cm&#8315;2 in a 0.05&#160;m H2SO4(aq). Theoretical studies suggest that the effectiveness of NRR originates from electron density redistribution due to boron (B) doping, which provides an ideal pathway for nitrogenous species to bind with electron&#8208;deficient B sites. This work demonstrates a significant exploration, showing that Mo&#8208;based electrocatalysts are capable of facilitating artificial N2 fixation.

         <title>The Effect of Relative Humidity in Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the impact&#160;of relative humidity (RH) on conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) measurements is investigated. For insulating and ultra&#8208;thin (less than 5 nm) semiconducting samples, a RH at 4% results in lower and more inhomogeneous currents compared to RH = 54%. In contrast, for thicker&#160;semiconducting (above 5 nm) and metallic samples, RH has no significant effect. These observations are confirmed by over 17,000 tests at different locations of ten samples.








Abstract
Conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) analyzes electronic phenomena in materials and devices with nanoscale lateral resolution, and it is widely used by companies, research institutions, and universities. Most data published in the field of CAFM is collected in air at a relative humidity (RH) of 30&#8211;60%. However, the effect of RH in CAFM remains unclear because&#160;previous studies often made contradictory claims, plus the number of samples and locations tested is scarce. Moreover, previous studies on this topic did&#160;not apply current limitations, which can degrade the CAFM tips and generate false data. This article systematically analyzes the effect of RH in CAFM by applying ramped voltage stresses at over 17,000 locations on ten different samples (insulating, semiconducting, and conducting) under seven different RH. An ultra&#8208;reliable setup with a 110&#8208;pA current limitation during electrical stresses is employed, and&#160;excellent CAFM tip integrity after thousands of tests is demonstrated. It is found that higher RH results in increased currents due to the presence of a conductive&#160;water meniscus at the tip/sample junction, which increases the effective area for&#160;electron flow. This trend is observed in insulators and ultra&#8208;thin semiconductors; however, in thicker semiconductors the electron mean free path is high enough to mask this effect. Metallic samples show no dependence on RH. This study clarifies the effect of relative humidity in CAFM, enhances understanding of the technique, and teaches researchers how to improve the reliability of their studies in this field.

         <title>Hydroxyl&#8208;Functionalized Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity and Dual&#8208;Functionalized Blends for High&#8208;Performance Membrane&#8208;Based Gas Separations</title>

High&#8208;performance OH&#8208;functionalized triptycene&#8208; and Tr&#246;ger's base&#8208;derived&#160;PIMs and a series of dual&#8208;functionalized PIM&#8208;PI blends containing both hydroxyl&#8208; and carboxyl functional groups are demonstrated for membrane&#8208;based gas separations. Physical crosslinking induced by strong hydrogen bonding of functionalized PIMs and PIM&#8208;PI blends forms tight polymer networks, providing an efficient strategy for developing plasticization resistant, robust, and highly&#8208;selective PIM&#8208;based membrane materials.








Abstract
Membrane technology has shown significant growth during the past two decades in the gas separation industry due to its energy&#8208;savings, compact and modular design, continuous operation, and environmentally benign nature. Robust materials with higher permeability and selectivity are key to reduce capital and operational cost, pushing it forward to replace or debottleneck conventional energy&#8208;intensive unit operations such as distillation. Recently designed ladder polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) and polyimides of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;PI) with pores &lt;20 &#197; have demonstrated excellent gas permeation performance. Here, a series of plasticization&#8208;resistant PIM&#8208;based membrane materials is reported, including the first example of a hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized triptycene&#8208; and Tr&#246;ger's base&#8208;derived ladder PIM and two PIM&#8208;PI homopolymers and a series of dual&#8208;functionalized polyimide blends containing hydroxyl&#8208; and carboxyl&#8208;functionalized groups. Specifically, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride (6FDA)&#8208;based PIM&#8208;PI blends demonstrated extremely high selectivity for a variety of industrially important applications. An optimized polyimide blend containing &#9472;OH and &#9472;COOH groups showed permselectivity values of 136 for CO2/CH4, 11.4 for O2/N2 and 636 for H2/CH4. Such extreme size&#8208;sieving capabilities are attributed to physical crosslinking induced by strong hydrogen bonding forming tightly structured polymer networks. The study provides a new general strategy for developing plasticization resistant, robust, and highly&#8208;selective PIM&#8208;based membrane materials.

Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glasses composed of zinc and imidazole derivatives are employed to prepare large&#8208;area and continuous MOF films. The MOF glass detector achieves an outstanding X&#8208;ray sensitivity of 112.8 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a detection limit of 0.41 &#181;Gyair s&#8722;1. These findings pave the way for large&#8208;area MOF&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors with practical applications in medical and security screening domains.








Abstract
Cutting&#8208;edge techniques utilizing continuous films made from pure, novel semiconductive materials offer promising pathways to achieve high performance and cost&#8208;effectiveness for X&#8208;ray detection. Semiconductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glass films are known for their remarkably smooth surface morphology, straightforward synthesis, and capability for large&#8208;area fabrication, presenting a new direction for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors. Here, a novel material centered on MOF glasses for highly uniform glass film fabrication customized for X&#8208;ray detection is introduced. MOF glasses, composed of zinc and imidazole derivatives, enable the transition from solid to liquid at low temperatures, facilitating the straightforward preparation of large&#8208;area and continuous MOF films with high mobility for X&#8208;ray device fabrication. Remarkably, MOF glass detectors demonstrate an exceptional sensitivity of 112.8 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a detection limit of 0.41 &#181;Gyair s&#8722;1, making them one of the most sensitive and with the best detection limits reported to date for MOF X&#8208;ray detectors. Clear X&#8208;ray images are successfully conducted using these developed MOF glass detectors for the first time. This breakthrough in X&#8208;ray sensitivity, and detection limit along with the spatial imaging resolution establishes a new standard for developing large&#8208;area and efficient MOF&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors with practical applications in medical and security screening.

         <title>The Role of Side Chains and Hydration on Mixed Charge Transport in n&#8208;Type Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most conjugated polymers require polar ethylene glycol (EG) side chains for mixed ion&#8208;electron conduction. Yet, this study finds that longer EG chains reduce transport efficiency in n&#8208;type conductors. Using various in situ techniques, this study highlights swelling's detrimental effect on mixed charge transport. Surprisingly, n&#8208;type films maintain mixed conduction even without a crystalline phase.








Abstract
Introducing ethylene glycol (EG) side chains to a conjugated polymer backbone is a well&#8208;established synthetic strategy for designing organic mixed ion&#8208;electron conductors (OMIECs). However, the impact that film swelling has on mixed conduction properties has yet to be scoped, particularly for electron&#8208;transporting (n&#8208;type) OMIECs. Here, the authors investigate the effect of the length of branched EG chains on mixed charge transport of n&#8208;type OMIECs based on a naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetracarboxylic&#8208;diimide&#8208;bithiophene backbone. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) are used to establish the similarities between the common&#8208;backbone films in dry conditions. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8208;D) and in situ GIWAXS measurements reveal stark changes in film swelling properties and microstructure during electrochemical doping, depending on the side chain length. It is found that even in the loss of the crystallite content upon contact with the aqueous electrolyte, the films can effectively transport charges and that it is rather the high water content that harms the electronic interconnectivity within the OMIEC films. These results highlight the importance of controlling water uptake in the films to impede charge transport in n&#8208;type electrochemical devices.

         <title>Balancing Pd&#8211;H Interactions: Thiolate&#8208;Protected Palladium Nanoclusters for Robust and Rapid Hydrogen Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiolate&#8208;protected palladium nanoclusters (Pd8SR16) enhance hydrogen gas (H2) sensing by leveraging metal&#8208; thiolate synergy, balancing palladium&#8211;hydrogen (Pd&#8211;H) interactions, and preventing excessive binding and phase transitions. Pd8SR16 surpass traditional Pd metals in durability and reversibility, enabling rapid H2 detection at parts per million (ppm) levels. A portable, wireless prototype highlights the practicality of ligand&#8208;protected nanoclusters in real&#8208;world scenarios.








Abstract
The transition toward hydrogen gas (H2) as an eco&#8208;friendly and renewable energy source necessitates advanced safety technologies, particularly robust sensors for H2 leak detection and concentration monitoring. Although palladium (Pd)&#8208;based materials are preferred for their strong H2 affinity, intense palladium&#8211;hydrogen (Pd&#8211;H) interactions lead to phase transitions to palladium hydride (PdHx), compromising sensors&#8217; durability and detection speeds after multiple uses. In response, this study introduces a high&#8208;performance H2 sensor designed from thiolate&#8208;protected Pd nanoclusters (Pd8SR16), which leverages the synergistic effect between the metal and protective ligands to form an intermediate palladium&#8211;hydrogen&#8211;sulfur (Pd&#8211;H&#8211;S) state during H2 adsorption. Striking a balance, it preserves Pd&#8211;H binding affinity while preventing excessive interaction, thus lowering the energy required for H2 desorption. The dynamic adsorption&#8208;dissociation&#8208;recombination&#8208;desorption process is efficiently and highly reversible with Pd8SR16, ensuring robust and rapid H2 sensing at parts per million (ppm). The Pd8SR16&#8208;based sensor demonstrates exceptional stability (50 cycles; 0.11% standard deviation in response), prompt response/recovery (t90 = 0.95 s/6 s), low limit of detection (LoD, 1&#160;ppm), and ambient temperature operability, ranking it among the most sensitive Pd&#8208;based H2 sensors. Furthermore, a multifunctional prototype demonstrates the practicality of real&#8208;world gas sensing using ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Revisiting the Epitaxial Growth Mechanism of 2D TMDC Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>

This study uncovers the pivotal role of sulfur evaporation rates in directing the growth modes of MoS2 on sapphire. Low sulfur levels preserve O/Al&#8208;terminated step edges, fostering atomic&#8208;edge epitaxy, while high sulfur levels favor S&#8208;terminated edges, promoting van der Waals epitaxy. The findings highlight that van der Waals epitaxy achieves superior MoS2 alignment (&#8776;99%) on a 2 in. wafer, offering new insights into precise 2D material fabrication.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) on sapphire substrates has been recognized as a pivotal method for producing wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal films. Both step&#8208;edges and symmetry of substrate surfaces have been proposed as controlling factors. However, the underlying fundamental still remains elusive. In this work, through the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) growth on C/M sapphire, it is demonstrated that controlling the sulfur evaporation rate is crucial for dictating the switch between atomic&#8208;edge guided epitaxy and van der Waals epitaxy. Low&#8208;concentration sulfur condition preserves O/Al&#8208;terminated step edges, fostering atomic&#8208;edge epitaxy, while high&#8208;concentration sulfur leads to S&#8208;terminated edges, preferring van der Waals epitaxy. These experiments reveal that on a 2 in. wafer, the van der Waals epitaxy mechanism achieves better control in MoS2 alignment (&#8776;99%) compared to the step edge mechanism (&lt;85%). These findings shed light on the nuanced role of atomic&#8208;level thermodynamics in controlling nucleation modes of TMDCs, thereby providing a pathway for the precise fabrication of single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on a wafer scale.

         <title>Manipulation of Oxidation States on Phase Boundary via Surface Layer Modification for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterostructure of crystalline Ni4W and amorphous WOx is constructed through a phase engineering strategy. The oxidation state of W in WOx is adjusted to optimize the phase boundary properties with enhanced intrinsic activity for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction process. This advancement is supported by operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, offering insights for designing more effective catalysts.








Abstract
In alkaline water electrolysis and anion exchange membrane water electrolysis technologies, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode is significantly constrained by a high energy barrier during the water dissociation step. This study employs a phase engineering strategy to construct heterostructures composed of crystalline Ni4W and amorphous WOx aiming to enhance catalytic performance in the HER under alkaline conditions. This work systematically modulates the oxidation states of W within the amorphous WOx of the heterostructure to adjust the electronic states of the phase boundary, the energy barriers associated with the water dissociation step, and the adsorption/desorption properties of intermediates during the alkaline HER process. The optimized catalyst, Ni4W/WOx&#8208;2, with a quasi&#8208;metallic state of W coordinated by a low oxygen content in amorphous WOx, demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance (22 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), outperforming commercial Pt/C (30 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, the operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the optimized W atoms in amorphous WOx serve as active sites for water dissociation and the nearby Ni atoms in crystalline Ni4W facilitated the release of H2. These findings provide valuable insights into designing efficient heterostructured materials for energy conversion.

         <title>Silicon Clathrate&#8208;Supported Catalysts with Low Work Functions for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamond&#8208;type Si has a high work function, but here it is shown how this can be drastically lowered in its alkali clathrate form K7.5Si46. These group 14 clathrates are previously examined for thermoelectric and photovoltaic properties, but the low work function enables it to function as an effective catalyst support for ammonia synthesis, thus expanding material applications.








Abstract
Diamond&#8208;type silicon has a work function of &#8776;4.8&#160;eV, and conventional n&#8208; or p&#8208;type doping modifies the value only between 4.6 and 5.05&#160;eV. Here, it is shown that the alkali clathrates AxSi46 have substantially lower work functions approaching 2.6&#160;eV, with clear trends between alkali electropositivity and clathrate cage size. The low work function enables alkali clathrates such as K8Si46 to be effective Haber&#8208;Bosch catalyst supports for NH3 synthesis. The catalytic properties of Si, Ge, and Sn&#8208;based clathrates are investigated while supporting Fe and Ru on the surface. The activity largely scales with the work function, and low activation energies below 60&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 are observed due to strong electron donation effects from the support. Ru metal and Sn clathrates seem to be unsuitable for stability issues. Compared to other similar hydride/electride catalysts, the simple structure and composition combined with stability in air/water make a systematic study of these clathrates possible and open the door to other electron&#8208;rich Zintl phases and related intermetallics as low&#8208;work function materials suitable for catalysis. The observed low work function may also have implications for other existing electronic applications.

Atmospheric Water Harvesting
Radiative cooling uses material's innate ability to emit mid&#8208;infrared radiation into outer space, cooling surfaces below the dew point and condensing atmospheric water without external energy. A vertical double&#8208;sided architecture with a lubricated surface (LS) coating on the condenser side not only doubles the local cooling power but also eliminates contact&#8208;line pinning, allowing passive, gravity&#8208;driven water collection. More details can be found in article number 2404037 by Dan Daniel, Qiaoqiang Gan, and co&#8208;workers.

High&#8208;Performance Membrane&#8208;Based Gas Separations
In article number 2406076, Ingo Pinnau and co&#8208;workers report membrane materials for a series of plasticization&#8208;resistant, robust, and highly selective hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized triptycene&#8208;based PIMs and dual&#8208;functionalized polyimide blends. The physical crosslinking induced by strong hydrogen bonding in dual&#8208;functionalized blends forms tight polymer networks, leading to extreme size&#8208;sieving and unprecedented gas&#8208;pair selectivity.

Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy
In article number 2405932, Yue Yuan and Mario Lanza clarify what is the effect of relative humidity in conductive atomic force microscopy. They measure over 17,000 different locations on the surface of ten different samples (insulating, semiconducting and conducting) under seven different relative humidity levels. In insulators and thick (&gt;5 nm) semiconductors, the water meniscus at the tip/sample junction increases the currents registered.

         <title>Catalyst Design and Engineering for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formic Acid Electrosynthesis for a Low&#8208;Carbon Economy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>

Electrochemical CO2 reduction to formic acid using low&#8208;carbon electricity presents a promising pathway to produce an H2 energy carrier with minimal fugitive hydrogen emissions. However, for this process to become scalable, the development of highly stable and selective catalysts is essential. This article reviews and examines catalyst engineering approaches aimed at enabling economically viable solutions.








Abstract
Formic acid (FA) has emerged as a promising candidate for hydrogen energy storage due to its favorable properties such as low toxicity, low flammability, and high volumetric hydrogen storage capacity under ambient conditions. Recent analyses have suggested that FA produced by electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (eCO2RR) using low&#8208;carbon electricity exhibits lower fugitive hydrogen (H2) emissions and global warming potential (GWP) during the H2 carrier production, storage and transportation processes compared to those of other alternatives like methanol, methylcyclohexane, and ammonia. eCO2RR to FA can enable industrially relevant current densities without the need for high pressures, high temperatures, or auxiliary hydrogen sources. However, the widespread implementation of eCO2RR to FA is hindered by the requirement for highly stable and selective catalysts. Herein, the aim is to explore and evaluate the potential of catalyst engineering in designing stable and selective nanostructured catalysts that can facilitate economically viable production of FA.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Formation of III&#8208;Nitride Nanowires: Past, Present, and Future for Photonic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article explores the development and application of plasma&#8208;assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA&#8208;MBE) grown group&#8208;III&#8208;nitride nanowires. It covers growth kinetics, characterization, and traditional device applications for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes (LDs), and photodetectors. The article also delves into emerging areas such as heterogeneous integrations, photoelectrochemical photodetectors for optical communications and logic gates, and single&#8208;photon emitters/detectors for quantum application.








Abstract
The realization of semiconductor heterostructures marks a significant advancement beyond silicon technology, driving progress in high&#8208;performance optoelectronics and photonics, including high&#8208;brightness light emitters, optical communication,&#160;and quantum technologies. In less than a decade since 1997, nanowires research has expanded into new application&#8208;driven areas,&#160;highlighting a significant shift toward more challenging and exploratory research avenues. It is therefore essential to reflect&#160;on the past motivations for nanowires development, and explore&#160;the new opportunities it can enable. The advancement of heterogeneous integration using dissimilar substrates, materials, and nanowires&#8208;semiconductor/electrolyte operating platforms is ushering in new research frontiers, including the development of perovskite&#8208;embedded solar cells, photoelectrochemical (PEC) analog and digital photonic systems, such as PEC&#8208;based&#160;photodetectors and logic circuits, as well as quantum elements, such as&#160;single&#8208;photon emitters and detectors. This review offers&#160;rejuvenating perspectives on the progress of these group&#8208;III nitride nanowires,&#160;aiming to highlight the continuity of research toward high impact, use&#8208;inspired research&#160;directions in photonics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Advances in the Catalytic Conversion of Ethanol into Nonoxygenated Added&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethanol is mainly derived from biomass, such as starch&#8208;based crops, cellulosic feedstocks, and CO/CO2. Metal oxide or zeolite catalysts can convert ethanol into valuable chemicals, including light olefins, 1,3&#8208;butadiene, aromatics, and gasoline, which are important commodities serving as crucial raw materials for manufacturing various products essential to the modern society, such as plastics, tires, medicines, and perfumes.








Abstract
Given that ethanol can be obtained from abundant biomass resources (e.g., crops, sugarcane, cellulose, and algae), waste, and CO2, its conversion into value&#8208;added chemicals holds promise for the sustainable production of high&#8208;demand chemical commodities. Nonoxygenated chemicals, including light olefins, 1,3&#8208;butadiene, aromatics, and gasoline, are some of the most important of these commodities, substantially contributing to modern lifestyles. Despite the industrial implementation of some ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons processes, several fundamental questions and technological challenges remain unaddressed. In addition, the utilization of ethanol as an intermediate provides new opportunities for the direct valorization of CO and CO2. Herein, the recent advances in the design of ethanol conversion catalysts are summarized, providing mechanistic insights into the corresponding reactions and catalyst deactivation, and discussing the related future research directions, including the exploitation of active site proximity to achieve better synergistic effects for reactions involving ethanol.

         <title>Imaging Locally Inhomogeneous Properties of Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the locally inhomogeneous properties of metal halide perovskites. The available microscopic imaging techniques crucial for mapping these inhomogeneities are discussed. The insights into the impact of various inhomogeneities on performance of perovskite solar cells are provided. The technical aspects and experimental considerations of microscopic techniques are introduced, offering a comprehensive guide for researchers in the field.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are a perfect example of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photovoltaic materials whose compositional and structural diversity,&#160;coupled with utilization of low&#8208;temperature processing, can undesirably result in spatially inhomogeneous properties that locally vary within the material. This complexity of MHPs requires sensitive imaging characterization methods at the microscopic level to gauge the impact of such inhomogeneities on device performance and to formulate mitigation strategies. This review consolidates properties of MHPs that are susceptible to local variations and highlights appropriate imaging techniques that can be employed to map them. Inhomogeneities in morphology, emission, electrical response, and chemical composition of MHP thin films are specifically considered, and possible microscopic techniques for their visualization are reviewed. For each type of microscopy, a short discussion about spatial resolution, sample requirements, advantages, and limitations is provided, thus leaving the reader with a guide of available imaging characterization tools to evaluate inhomogeneities of their MHPs.

         <title>Harnessing Extrinsic Dissipation to Enhance the Toughness of Composites and Composite Joints: A State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Review of Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights how toughness of laminated structures can be manipulated by engineering heterogeneity and microstructure of interfaces, bond lines and substrates. These techniques favor dissipation&#8208;enhancing mechanisms such as fragmentation, long&#8208;range bridging and can only be described by innovative modeling&#160;approaches.








Abstract
Interfaces play a critical role in modern structures, where integrating multiple materials and components is essential to achieve specific functions. Enhancing the mechanical performance of these interfaces, particularly their resistance to delamination, is essential to enable extremely lightweight designs and improve energy efficiency. Improving toughness (or increasing energy dissipation during delamination) has traditionally involved modifying materials to navigate the well&#8208;known strength&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off. However, a more effective strategy involves promoting non&#8208;local or extrinsic energy dissipation. This approach encompasses complex degradation phenomena that extend beyond the crack tip, such as long&#8208;range bridging, crack fragmentation, and ligament&#160;formation. This work explores this innovative strategy within the arena of laminated structures, with a particular focus on fiber&#8208;reinforced polymers. This review highlights the substantial potential for improvement by presenting various strategies, from basic principles to proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications. This approach represents a significant design direction for integrating materials and structures, especially relevant in the emerging era of additive manufacturing. However, it also comes with new challenges in predictive modeling of such mechanisms at the structural scale, and here the latest development in this direction is highlighted. Through this perspective, greater durability and performance in advanced structural applications can be&#160;achieved.

         <title>Beyond Flexible: Unveiling the Next Era of Flexible Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible electronics are essential in various fields like wearables, healthcare, and environmental sensing due to their flexibility, lightweight construction, and low profile. These systems conform to diverse surfaces, enhancing or replacing bulky instruments in many applications. This study reviews key components of standalone flexible electronics, integration strategies, and recent advancements, emphasizing flexible hybrid and transformational electronics, and concludes with future research directions and challenges.








Abstract
Flexible electronics are integral in numerous domains such as wearables, healthcare, physiological monitoring, human&#8211;machine interface, and environmental sensing, owing to their inherent flexibility, stretchability, lightweight construction, and low profile. These systems seamlessly conform to curvilinear surfaces, including skin, organs, plants, robots, and marine species, facilitating optimal contact. This capability enables flexible electronic systems to enhance or even supplant the utilization of cumbersome instrumentation across a broad range of monitoring and actuation tasks. Consequently, significant progress has been realized in the development of flexible electronic systems. This study begins by examining the key components of standalone flexible electronic systems&#8211;sensors, front&#8208;end circuitry, data management, power management and actuators. The next section explores different integration strategies for flexible electronic systems as well as their recent advancements. Flexible hybrid electronics, which is currently the most widely used strategy, is first reviewed to assess their characteristics and applications. Subsequently, transformational electronics, which achieves compact and high&#8208;density system integration by leveraging heterogeneous integration of bare&#8208;die components, is highlighted as the next era of flexible electronic systems. Finally, the study concludes by suggesting future research directions and outlining critical considerations and challenges for developing and miniaturizing fully integrated standalone flexible electronic systems.

         <title>Solid Additive Engineering for Next&#8208;generation Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a comprehensive summary of significant breakthroughs and pivotal contributions of emerging solid additives (SAs), focusing on their roles in governing film&#8208;forming dynamics, stabilizing phase separation, and addressing other crucial aspects. These insights contribute to the development of rationale and design rules for SAs enabling highly efficient and stable organic solar cells (OSCs), thereby enhancing their commercial viability.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as a promising next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology. In this emerging field, there is a growing trend of employing solid additives (SAs) to fine&#8208;tune the BHJ morphology and unlock the full potential of OSCs. SA engineering offers several significant benefits for commercialization, including the ability to i) control film&#8208;forming kinetics to expedite high&#8208;throughput fabrication, ii) leverage weak noncovalent interactions between SA and BHJ materials to enhance the efficiency and stability of OSCs, and iii) simplify procedures to facilitate cost&#8208;effective production and scaling&#8208;up. These features make SA engineering a key catalyst for accelerating the development of OSCs. Recent breakthroughs have shown that SA engineering can achieve an efficiency of 19.67% in single&#8208;junction OSCs, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting the commercialization of organic photovoltaic devices. This review provides a comprehensive overview of significant breakthroughs and pivotal contributions of emerging SAs, focusing on their roles in governing film&#8208;forming dynamics, stabilizing phase separation, and addressing other crucial aspects. The rationale and design rules for SAs in highly efficient and stable OSCs are also discussed. Finally, the remaining challenges are summarized, and perspectives on future advances in SA engineering are offered.

         <title>Surface Defects Control Bulk Carrier Densities in Polycrystalline Pb&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping, the controlled addition of imperfections or impurities to a material, is crucial for semiconductors. This study shows that for&#160;Halide Perovskites, which have (very) low (intrinsic) defect densities because of&#160;effective self&#8208;healing and defect tolerance,&#160;the title's statement holds in an unprecedented fashion.








Abstract
The (opto)electronic behavior of semiconductors depends on their (quasi&#8208;)free electronic carrier densities. These are regulated by semiconductor doping, i.e., controlled &#8220;electronic contamination&#8221;. For metal halide perovskites (HaPs), the functional materials in several device types, which already challenge some of the understanding of semiconductor properties, this study shows that doping type, density and properties derived from these, are to a first approximation controlled via their surfaces. This effect, relevant to all semiconductors, and already found for some, is very evident for lead (Pb)&#8208;HaPs because of their intrinsically low electrically active bulk and surface defect densities. Volume carrier densities for most polycrystalline Pb&#8208;HaP films (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m grain diameter) are below those resulting from even &lt; 0.1% of surface sites being electrically active defects. This implies and is consistent with interfacial defects controlling HaP devices in multi&#8208;layered structures with most of the action at the two HaP interfaces. Surface and interface passivation effects on bulk electrical properties are relevant to all semiconductors and are crucial for developing those used today. However, because bulk dopant introduction in HaPs at controlled ppm levels for electronic&#8208;relevant carrier densities is so difficult, passivation effects are vastly more critical and dominate, to first approximation, their optoelectronic characteristics in devices.

         <title>Microenvironment Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanomedicine Promotes Spinal Cord Repair by Suppressing Inflammation Cascade and Neural Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanomedicine (RHNP&#8208;Cur) is capable of consistently crossing the blood spinal cord barrier and selectively targeting inflammatory cells and neural cells based on different stages of spinal cord injury through changes of surface structure and targeted peptide modification, promoting spinal cord repair by suppressing inflammation cascade and neural apoptosis.








Abstract
Despite various biomaterial&#8208;based strategies are tried in spinal cord injury (SCI), developing safe and effective microinvasive pharmacotherapy strategies is still an unmet clinical need. Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomedicine has emerged as a promising non&#8208;invasion technology, which enhances drug delivery and promotes functional recovery following SCI. Considering the multiple progressive pathological events and the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) associating SCI, a microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanoparticle (custom&#8208;designed with rabies virus glycoprotein 29&#8208;RVG29 and hyaluronic acid&#8208;HA, RHNP) capable of consistently crossing the BSCB and selectively targeting inflammatory cells and neural cells based on different stages of SCI are developed. The data indicated that RHNP can effectively traverse the BSCB through RVG29, and adaptively modulate cellular internalization by selectively exposing either HA or RVG29 through diselenide bonds, depending on pathological reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals. Furthermore, curcumin is loaded into RHNP (RHNP&#8208;Cur) to improve motor function and coordination of hind&#8208;limbs in a traumatic SCI mouse model. This study finds that RHNP&#8208;Cur exhibited inhibitory effects on the inflammatory cascade originating from M1 microglia/macrophages and neurotoxic astrocytes, and protected neural cells from inflammation&#8208;induced apoptosis during nerve regeneration. Collectively, the work provides a microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanomedicine which enables efficient microinvasive treatment of SCI.

A novel ether&#8208;modified nonflammable phosphate, DMEP, is designed to enhance the miscibility of high&#8208;concentration phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes with diluent. The DMEP&#8208;based electrolyte features a cation&#8208;anion aggregate&#8208;dominated solvation structure, which promotes the formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphases, enabling long&#8208;term cycling stability in 4.7&#160;V high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.8Co0.10Mn0.10O2 ||Li pouch cells with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.33.








Abstract
Phosphate&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCE) feature high flame retardant and satisfactory cathodic stability for lithium metal batteries. However, stable cycling of those electrolytes at ultra&#8208;high upper cut&#8208;off voltages for long&#8208;term stability remains challenging. Herein, an ether&#8208;modified phosphate, diethyl (2&#8208;methoxy ethoxy) methylphosphonate (DMEP), is designed for high&#8208;voltage applications. The ether modification enhances the stability of the Li+&#8208;DMEP&#8208;FSI&#8722; coordination structure, promoting the formation of cation&#8208;anion aggregates (AGG) dominated solvation structure, which favors the generation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase layers compared to triethyl phosphate (TEP)&#8208;based LHCE. Consequently, cathode degradation, including transition&#8208;metal dissolution and electrode cracking, is well&#8208;suppressed. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Li full cells using DMEP&#8208;based LHCEs show more than 90.7% capacity retention at an ultrahigh upper cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.7 V after 100 cycles. Notably, DMEP&#8208;LHCE exhibits enhanced safety than that of TEP&#8208;LHCE, suggesting its versatility and potential for next&#8208;generation lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores novel advancements in capillary cooling schemes for ultra&#8208;high heat flux and temperature. Micromodel experiment helps provide visualized evidence for evaporation&#8208;driven mechanisms behind capillary flow phenomenon in porous media. Nanoengineering significantly improves thermal protection capacity of capillary cooling. Results show that nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling holds significant potential as a reliable and sustained thermal protection scheme in the future.








Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, thermal protection ability depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow, enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials, is proposed. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4 (titanium alloy, Ti&#8208;6Al&#8208;4V), and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50&#8211;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. The authors&#8217; scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8211;3.1 MW m&#8722;2 and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Further, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, this scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

         <title>Nucleus&#8208;Targeting Photosensitizers Enhance Neutrophil Extracellular Traps for Efficient Eradication of Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleus&#8208;targeting photosensitizer, NCP, with strong ROS generation and DNA&#8208;binding capabilities has been developed for efficient neutrophil&#8208;mediated antibacterial therapy. NCP utilize the intrinsic NET&#8208;associated antibacterial mechanism to achieve precise eradication of bacteria, providing a novel strategy to reinforce host immune defense against multi&#8208;resistant bacterial wound infections.








Abstract
Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web&#8208;like complexes of DNA and proteins that are extruded by activated neutrophils and play critical roles as major components of the innate immune response against pathogen invasion. However, some microbes have developed strategies to evade NET attacks, leading to impaired immune defenses and persistent infections. In this study, an engineered neutrophil strategy for enhancing the antibacterial activity of NETs is developed. A nucleus&#8208;targeting photosensitizer (NCP) with strong reactive oxygen species production and a strong DNA&#8208;binding capacity is synthesized. NCP&#8208;loaded neutrophils are subsequently constructed via direct incubation of NCP with neutrophils, and the NCP is closely inserted into the nucleus DNA. Upon activation by bacteria&#8208;related toxins, NCP&#8208;coupled NETs can be released rapidly, actively trapping bacteria and providing a high local concentration of NCP around them. Both in vitro and in vivo results revealed that NCP&#8208;coupled NETs can effectively eradicate various multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilms through photodynamic therapy, overcome bacterial immune evasion, and promote tissue recovery from severe wound infections. This design can significantly strengthen NET function, providing a non&#8208;antibiotic alternative platform for treating bacterial infectious diseases.

This paper proposes an optical synapse based on van der Waals heterojunction. Based on this device, an optical reservoir neural network and a visible light communication system were developed, which successfully imitated the signal preprocessing and data transmission process of the human visual system for color images. This provides new ideas for the development of intelligent imaging systems.








Abstract
The rapid development of visual neuromorphic hardware can be attributed to their ability to capture, store and process optical signals from the environment. The main limitation of existing visual neuromorphic hardware is that the realization of complex functions is premised on the increase of manufacturing cost, hardware volume and energy consumption. In this study, we demonstrated an optical synaptic device based on a three&#8208;terminal van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction that can realize the sensing functions of light wavelength and intensity as well as short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. In the image recognition task, we constructed an optical reservoir neural network (ORNN) and a visible light communication system (VLC) composed of this optical synaptic device. The ORNN has a recognition rate of up to 84.9% for 50 000 color images in 10 categories in the CIFAR&#8208;10 color image dataset, and the VLC system can achieve high&#8208;speed transmission with an ultra&#8208;low power consumption of only 0.4 nW. This work shows that through reasonable design, vdW heterojunction structures have great application potential in low&#8208;power multifunctional fusion application tasks such as visual bionics.

         <title>Sensitive Self&#8208;Driven Single&#8208;Component Organic Photodetector Based on Vapor&#8208;Deposited Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully thermally evaporated single&#8208;component organic photodetector is demonstrated with high photoresponsivity at zero bias, resulting in a specific detectivity of 1 &#183; 1013&#160;Jones based on noise measurements. Ultrafast charge generation within one&#160;picosecond is observed in the neat photoactive material, which is attributed to the strong electronic coupling of the molecular exciton and charge&#8208;transfer states in the small molecule.








Abstract
Typically, organic solar cells (OSCs) and photodetectors (OPDs) comprise an electron donating and accepting material to facilitate efficient charge carrier generation. This approach has proven successful in achieving high&#8208;performance devices but has several drawbacks for upscaling and stability. This study presents a fully vacuum&#8208;deposited single&#8208;component OPD, employing the neat oligothiophene derivative DCV2&#8208;5T in the photoactive layer. Free charge carriers are generated with an internal quantum efficiency of 20 % at zero bias. By optimizing the device structure, a very low dark current of 3.4 &#183; 10&#8722;11&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.1&#160;V is achieved, comparable to the dark current of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bulk heterojunction OPDs. This optimization results in specific detectivities of 1&#183; 1013&#160;Jones (based on noise measurements), accompanied by a fast photoresponse (f&#8208;3dB = 200&#160;kHz) and a broad linear dynamic range (&gt;&#160;150&#160;dB). Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy unveils that charge carriers are already formed at very short time scales (&lt;&#160;1&#160;ps). The surprisingly efficient bulk charge generation mechanism is attributed to a strong electronic coupling of the molecular exciton and charge transfer states.

&lt;p&gt;A fully thermally evaporated single-component organic photodetector is demonstrated with high photoresponsivity at zero bias, resulting in a specific detectivity of 1 &#183; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Jones based on noise measurements. Ultrafast charge generation within one&#160;picosecond is observed in the neat photoactive material, which is attributed to the strong electronic coupling of the molecular exciton and charge-transfer states in the small molecule.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, organic solar cells (OSCs) and photodetectors (OPDs) comprise an electron donating and accepting material to facilitate efficient charge carrier generation. This approach has proven successful in achieving high-performance devices but has several drawbacks for upscaling and stability. This study presents a fully vacuum-deposited single-component OPD, employing the neat oligothiophene derivative DCV2-5T in the photoactive layer. Free charge carriers are generated with an internal quantum efficiency of 20 % at zero bias. By optimizing the device structure, a very low dark current of 3.4 &#183; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;11&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.1&#160;V is achieved, comparable to the dark current of state-of-the-art bulk heterojunction OPDs. This optimization results in specific detectivities of 1&#183; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;Jones (based on noise measurements), accompanied by a fast photoresponse (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;-3dB&lt;/sub&gt; = 200&#160;kHz) and a broad linear dynamic range (&amp;gt;&#160;150&#160;dB). Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy unveils that charge carriers are already formed at very short time scales (&amp;lt;&#160;1&#160;ps). The surprisingly efficient bulk charge generation mechanism is attributed to a strong electronic coupling of the molecular exciton and charge transfer states. This work demonstrates the very high performance of single-component OPDs and proves that this novel device design is a successful strategy for highly efficient, morphological stable and easily manufacturable devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Nanostructures as Acoustically Manipulatable Multifunctional Agents in Dynamic Fluid Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flower&#8208;like hierarchical nanostructure microparticles can be trapped by focused ultrasound and manipulated within high&#8208;velocity dynamic fluid flow. The wide range of design versatility, substantial surface area, and biocompatibility enable such microparticles to function as acoustically manipulatable medical imaging contrast agents and microrobots.








Abstract
Acoustic waves provide a biocompatible and deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrating tool suitable for contactless manipulation in in vivo environments. Despite the prevalence of dynamic fluids within the body, previous studies have primarily focused on static fluids, and manipulatable agents in dynamic fluids are limited to gaseous core&#8208;shell particles. However, these gas&#8208;filled particles face challenges in fast&#8208;flow manipulation, complex setups, design versatility, and practical medical imaging, underscoring the need for effective alternatives. In this study, flower&#8208;like hierarchical nanostructures (HNS) into microparticles (MPs) are incorporated, and demonstrated that various materials fabricated as HNS&#8208;MPs exhibit effective and reproducible acoustic trapping within high&#8208;velocity fluid flows. Through simulations, it is validated that the HNS&#8208;MPs are drawn to the focal point by acoustic streaming and form a trap through secondary acoustic streaming at the tips of the nanosheets comprising the HNS&#8208;MPs. Furthermore, the wide range of materials and modification options for HNS, combined with their high surface area and biocompatibility, enable them to serve as acoustically manipulatable multimodal imaging contrast agents and microrobots. They can perform intravascular multi&#8208;trap maneuvering with real&#8208;time imaging, purification of wastewater flow, and highly&#8208;loaded drug delivery. Given the diverse HNS materials developed to date, this study extends their applications to acoustofluidic and biomedical fields.

         <title>Engineering Radiocatalytic Nanoliposomes with Hydrophobic Gold Nanoclusters for Radiotherapy Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoliposomes containing hydrophobic gold nanoclusters are engineered, characterized, and evaluated for their radiocatalytic properties for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. These nanoliposomes exhibit promising radiotherapy&#8208;enhancing properties, potential for radiotherapy&#8208;controlled drug delivery, and improved chemoradiotherapy outcomes on 3D pancreatic microtumors. The nanoliposomes exhibit excellent tumor accumulation and also identify further innovations to pave the way toward more effective chemoradiotherapy strategies.








Abstract
Chemoradiation therapy is on the forefront of pancreatic cancer care, and there is a continued effort to improve its safety and efficacy. Liposomes are widely used to improve chemotherapy safety, and may accurately deliver high&#8208;Z element&#8208; radiocatalytic nanomaterials to cancer tissues. In this study, the interaction between X&#8208;rays and long&#8208;circulating nanoliposome formulations loaded with gold nanoclusters is explored in the context of oxaliplatin chemotherapy for desmoplastic pancreatic cancer. Hydrophobic gold nanoclusters stabilized with dodecanethiol (AuDDT) are efficiently incorporated in nanoliposomal bilayers. AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes significantly augmented radiation&#8208;induced &#8226;OH production, which is most effective with monochromatic X&#8208;rays at energies that exceed the K&#8208;shell electron binding energy of Au (81.7&#160;keV). Cargo release assays reveal that AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes can permeabilize lipid bilayers in an X&#8208;ray dose&#8208; and formulation&#8208;dependent manner. The radiocatalytic effect of AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes significantly augments radiotherapy and oxaliplatin&#8208;chemoradiotherapy outcomes in 3D pancreatic microtumors. The PEGylated AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes display high tumor accumulation in an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer, showing promise for nanoliposomes as carriers for radiocatalytic nanomaterials. Altogether, compelling proof for chemo&#8208;radiation dose&#8208;enhancement using AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes is presented. Further improving the nanoliposomal loading of high&#8208;Z elements will advance the safety, efficacy, and translatability of such chemoradiation dose&#8208;enhancement approaches.

         <title>Viscoelastic High&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogels Support Rapid Glioblastoma Cell Invasion with Leader&#8211;Follower Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glioblastoma spheroids invade faster in stress&#8208;relaxing, high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (HMW) hyaluronic acid hydrogels than in more elastic&#8208;like, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight counterparts. The long HMW chains create entanglement&#8208;based crosslinks capable of viscous dissipation that cells rearrange to facilitate invasion. While invading, cells leave a trail of hyaluronidase&#8208;2 (HYAL2) in their wake to prime a path for the advancement of follower cells and thus rapid invasion.








Abstract
Hyaluronic acid (HA), the primary component of brain extracellular matrix, is increasingly used to model neuropathological processes, including glioblastoma (GBM) tumor invasion. While elastic hydrogels based on crosslinked low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (LMW) HA are widely exploited for this purpose and have proven valuable for discovery and screening, brain tissue is both viscoelastic and rich in high&#8208;MW (HMW) HA, and it remains unclear how these differences influence invasion. To address this question, hydrogels comprised of either HMW (1.5 MDa) or LMW (60 kDa) HA are introduced, characterized, and applied in GBM invasion studies. Unlike LMW HA hydrogels, HMW HA hydrogels relax stresses quickly, to a similar extent as brain tissue, and to a greater extent than many conventional HA&#8208;based scaffolds. GBM cells implanted within HMW HA hydrogels invade much more rapidly than in their LMW HA counterparts and exhibit distinct leader&#8211;follower dynamics. Leader cells adopt dendritic morphologies similar to invasive GBM cells observed in vivo. Transcriptomic, pharmacologic, and imaging studies suggest that leader cells exploit hyaluronidase, an enzyme strongly enriched in human GBMs, to prime a path for followers. This study offers new insight into how HA viscoelastic properties drive invasion and argues for the use of highly stress&#8208;relaxing materials to model GBM.

         <title>Using a Supramolecular Monomer Formulation Approach to Engineer Modular, Dynamic Microgels, and Composite Macrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microgels with engineerable properties are created using supramolecular monomers. The inherent modularity offers versatility, allowing inclusion of functionalities, e.g. dyes and cell adhesive additives, providing control over microgel composition. Integrated into robust and dynamic macrogels, microgels act as modular micro&#8208;building blocks, introducing multi&#8208;compartmentalization and reinforcing mechanical properties. This modular control spans across the nano, micro, and macro length scale.








Abstract
Microgels show advantages over bulk hydrogels due to convenient control over microgel size and composition, and the ability to use microgels to modularly construct larger hierarchical scaffold hydrogel materials. Here, supramolecular chemistry is used to formulate supramolecular polymer, dynamic microgels solely held together by non&#8208;covalent interactions. Four&#8208;fold hydrogen bonding ureido&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) monomers with different functionalities are applied to precisely tune microgel properties in a modular way, via variations in monomer concentration, bifunctional crosslinker ratio, and the incorporation of supramolecular dyes and peptides. Functionalization with a bioactive supramolecular cell&#8208;adhesive peptide induced selectivity of cells toward the bioactive microgels over non&#8208;active, non&#8208;functionalized versions. Importantly, the supramolecular microgels can also be applied as microscale building blocks into supramolecular bulk macrogels with tunable dynamic behavior: a robust and weak macrogel, where the micro&#8208; and macrogels are composed of similar molecular building blocks. In a robust macrogel, microgels act as modular micro&#8208;building blocks, introducing multi&#8208;compartmentalization, while in a weak macrogel, microgels reinforce and enhance mechanical properties. This work demonstrates the potential to modularly engineer higher&#8208;length&#8208;scale structures using small molecule supramolecular monomers, wherein microgels serve as versatile and modular micro&#8208;building units.

&lt;p&gt;Microgels with engineerable properties are created using supramolecular monomers. The inherent modularity offers versatility, allowing inclusion of functionalities, e.g. dyes and cell adhesive additives, providing control over microgel composition. Integrated into robust and dynamic macrogels, microgels act as modular micro-building blocks, introducing multi-compartmentalization and reinforcing mechanical properties. This modular control spans across the nano, micro, and macro length scale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microgels show advantages over bulk hydrogels due to convenient control over microgel size and composition, and the ability to use microgels to modularly construct larger hierarchical scaffold hydrogel materials. Here, supramolecular chemistry is used to formulate supramolecular polymer, dynamic microgels solely held together by non-covalent interactions. Four-fold hydrogen bonding ureido-pyrimidinone (UPy) monomers with different functionalities are applied to precisely tune microgel properties in a modular way, via variations in monomer concentration, bifunctional crosslinker ratio, and the incorporation of supramolecular dyes and peptides. Functionalization with a bioactive supramolecular cell-adhesive peptide induced selectivity of cells toward the bioactive microgels over non-active, non-functionalized versions. Importantly, the supramolecular microgels can also be applied as microscale building blocks into supramolecular bulk macrogels with tunable dynamic behavior: a robust and weak macrogel, where the micro- and macrogels are composed of similar molecular building blocks. In a robust macrogel, microgels act as modular micro-building blocks, introducing multi-compartmentalization, while in a weak macrogel, microgels reinforce and enhance mechanical properties. This work demonstrates the potential to modularly engineer higher-length-scale structures using small molecule supramolecular monomers, wherein microgels serve as versatile and modular micro-building units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Higher&#8208;Order Topological Confinement via Acoustic Non&#8208;Hermitian Textures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors develop a non&#8208;Hermitian second&#8208;order topological insulator by incorporating electro&#8208;thermoacoustic gain and loss in a cavity&#8208;based sonic lattice. Controlled via electrically biased carbon nanotube films, they engineer unconventional interface and corner&#8208;confining topologies through precise manipulation of gain and loss textures. This work may open new avenues for studying non&#8208;Hermitian topological physics in classical wave systems and designing versatile functional devices.









Abstract
Higher&#8208;order topological insulators are a newly unveiled category of topological materials, distinguished by their exceptional characteristics absent in conventional topological insulators, e.g., 1D hinge states, or zero&#8208;dimensional corner states, for instance. Adding attenuating or amplifying components manifest even richer and more intricate non&#8208;Hermitian topological properties. While losses, for the most part, come for free, decorating topological systems with the gain counterpart poses significant challenges. Here, a non&#8208;Hermitian second&#8208;order topological insulator (SOTI) is constructed for a sonic demonstration, by bestowing a cavity&#8208;based lattice both with electro&#8208;thermoacoustic gain and loss. The inner cavity walls are decorated with electrically biased carbon nanotube films to be able to manipulate spatially and in strength, a non&#8208;Hermitian response at will. These measurements demonstrate that this flexibility allows us to design highly unconventional interface and corner confining topologies by decisively engineering gain and loss textures within the unit cell. It is foreseen that the advances may enable new avenues for energy harvesting and fundamental understanding in condensed matter and classical topological&#160;physics.

         <title>Programmable Robotic Shape Shifting and Color Morphing Dynamics Through Magneto&#8208;Mechano&#8208;Chromic Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a design strategy for smart soft robots, which borrows the idea of how chameleons transform their body color during locomotion in the wild. The proposed soft magneto&#8208;mechano&#8208;chromic (SoMMeC) robots redefine robotic functionality through fast, dynamic, and durable appearance modulation, making robotic systems more versatile, adaptive, and suitable for unexplored integrative functions.








Abstract
Recreating natural organisms&#8217; dynamic shape&#8208;morphing and adaptive color&#8208;changing capabilities in a compact structure poses significant challenges but unlocks unprecedented hybridized robotic&#8208;visual applications. Overcoming programmability and predictability obstacles is key to achieving real&#8208;time, responsive changes in appearance and functionality, enhancing robot&#8208;environment&#8208;user interactions in ways previously unattainable. Herein, a Soft Magneto&#8208;Mechano&#8208;Chromic (SoMMeC) structure comprising a magnetic actuating and a synthetic photonic film, mirroring the intricate color&#8208;tuning mechanism of chameleons is devised. A model combining numerical simulation and a strain&#8208;dependent color evolution map enables precise predictions and controllable shape&#8208;color alterations across various geometrical and magnetization profiles. The SoMMeC exhibits rapid (0.1s), broad (full&#8208;visible spectrum), tether&#8208;free (remote magnetic manipulation), and programmable (model&#8208;guided control) color transformations, surpassing traditional limitations with its real&#8208;time response, broad and omnidirectional coloration for enhanced visibility, and robustness against external disturbances. The SoMMeC translates into dynamic advertising iridescence, adaptive camouflage, self&#8208;sensing, and multi&#8208;level encryption, and transcends traditional robotics by seamlessly blending dynamic movement with nuanced visual changes. It opens up a spectrum of applications that redefine robotic functionality through dynamic appearance modulation, making robotic systems more versatile, adaptive, and suitable for unexplored integrative functions.

         <title>Synthesis of SrZnOSe Crystals with Low Phonon Energy for Enhancing Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of lanthanide&#8208;doped SrZnOSe crystals has been developed for the self&#8208;sustained generation of near&#8208;infrared light under mechanical excitation. Due to the low phonon energy of the selenide hosts, the SrZnOSe crystals can generate bright near&#8208;infrared emission by external forces for transmitting encrypted optical signals through tissues (up to 8&#160;mm thick).








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is promising for bioimaging and information technology due to its high penetration ability and resistance to interference with environmental radiation. Here, a new class of lanthanide&#8208;doped SrZnOSe crystals are developed for the self&#8208;sustainable generation of NIR emissions under mechanical excitation. It is shown that the SrZnOSe crystals render &#8776;5&#8208;fold stronger NIR emissions than the well&#8208;established CaZnOS due to the low phonon energies of the selenide host, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The potential utility of the crystals is demonstrated by integration with a mouthguard, which can generate bright NIR emissions by bite force to transmit encrypted optical signals through thick tissues (up to 8&#160;mm) in ambient environments. The findings provide a powerful addition to the toolbox of self&#8208;recovery mechanoluminescent materials and open new possibilities for applied research.

         <title>Programmable Artificial Skins Accomplish Antiscar Healing with Multiple Appendage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel regeneration&#8208;directing artificial skin (RDAS) system is introduced, which is constructed from DNA supramolecular hydrogels. This multi&#8208;layered RDAS effectively mimics natural skin matrices with high fidelity, thereby creating a supportive environment conducive to wound healing. It also precisely modulates the regenerative activities of repair cells throughout the healing process. Ultimately, the RDAS facilitates rapid&#160;scarless healing and promotes the in situ regeneration of multiple functional skin appendages in damaged skin.








Abstract
Functional appendage regeneration is essential for skin rehabilitation, but it has always failed by current existing healing approaches, owing to their inefficacy in preventing disfiguring scars. In this study, a novel regeneration&#8208;directing artificial skin (RDAS) system is presented, which is based on the rational design of multi&#8208;layered hydrogels that closely mimic natural skin matrices. By leveraging the programmability and architectural rigidity of DNA components, without the need for exogenous cell transplantation, such RDAS effectively minimizes tissue fibrosis by accurately guiding the regenerative process in wound fibroblasts, enabling rapid scarless wound repair, restoration of dermal function, and successful in situ regeneration of multiple appendages, such as hair follicles (HFs), sebaceous glands (SGs), and sweat glands (SwGs). Therefore, the RDAS offers a cell&#8208;free antiscarring therapeutic strategy for regenerative wound healing, resulting in improved outcomes. This innovative approach holds great potential for future clinical applications and burn rehabilitation.

This study explores composition&#8208;structure&#8208;performance relationships in high&#8208;entropy La0.8Sr0.2MnxCoyFezO3&#177;&#120749; perovskite oxides for oxygen electrodes in Solid Oxide Cells. Using six high&#8208;throughput experimental techniques and machine learning, Fe&#8208;rich oxides are identified as optimal. The model yields an unambiguous statistical correlation between the distortion of the oxygen sublattice and the highest electrochemical performances and oxygen kinetics.








Abstract
Perovskite oxides form a large family of materials with applications across various fields, owing to their structural and chemical flexibility. Efficient exploration of this extensive compositional space is now achievable through automated high&#8208;throughput experimentation combined with machine learning. In this study, we investigate the composition&#8211;structure&#8211;performance relationships of high&#8208;entropy La0.8Sr0.2MnxCoyFezO3&#177;&#120749; perovskite oxides (0 &lt; x, y, z &lt;1; x+y+z&#8776;1) for application as oxygen electrodes in Solid Oxide Cells. Following the deposition of a continuous compositional map using thin&#8208;film combinatorial pulsed laser deposition, compositional, structural, and performance properties are characterized using six different techniques with mapping capabilities. Random forests effectively model electrochemical performance, consistently identifying Fe&#8208;rich oxides as optimal compounds with the lowest area&#8208;specific resistance values for oxygen electrodes at 700 &#176;C. Additionally, the models identify a statistical correlation between oxygen sublattice distortion&#8212;derived from spectral analysis of Raman&#8208;active modes&#8212;and enhanced performance.

         <title>Voxel Interface Control in Multimaterial Extrusion 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfaces are vital in natural and synthetic systems, enhancing performance and functionality, but are difficult to control in manufacturing. Voxel&#8208;Interface 3D Printing (VI3DP) is introduced, enabling precise control of voxel&#8208;to&#8208;voxel interfaces in extrusion 3D&#8208;printed objects. With interface thicknesses significantly smaller than voxel size, VI3DP unlocks applications in data encoding, mechanisms, bio&#8208;inspired composites, and capacitive touch sensors, among others.








Abstract
Interfaces are crucial in natural and engineered systems, dictating essential biological, ecological, and technological properties that augment performance, functionality, and user experience. Yet, achieving precise interfacial control poses significant challenges in both conventional and additive manufacturing, where scalability constraints impede the controlled deposition of quasi&#8208;2D layers within 3D objects. This paper introduces Voxel&#8208;Interface 3D Printing (VI3DP), which enables comprehensive control over extruded voxel interfaces irrespective of the printhead diameter that conventionally dictates feature size. Various optical, mechanical, and electrical functionalizations, attaining interface thicknesses up to three orders of magnitude smaller than the voxel size are reported. Notable applications include encoding data in soft matter through fluorescent interfaces, creating tight fits and movable mechanisms through non&#8208;adhesive interfaces, fabricating bio&#8208;inspired composites with tailored failure modes, and developing a single filament capacitive touch sensor. VI3DP opens new avenues for enhanced functionality and efficiency across multiple fields, including biomedical technology, electronics, optics, and&#160;nanotechnology.

         <title>Modulating Fibrotic Mechanical Microenvironment for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is exacerbated by injurious mechanical forces that destabilize the pulmonary mechanical microenvironment homeostasis. The ZDFPR NPs effectively regulate this disordered mechanical microenvironment by remodeling alveolar epithelia to alleviate mechanical tension in AEC IIs, and disrupting malignant interactions between myofibroblast contractility and ECM stiffness during mechanotransduction, thereby improving the therapeutic effects for IPF.








Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is exacerbated by injurious mechanical forces that destabilize the pulmonary mechanical microenvironment homeostasis, leading to alveolar dysfunction and exacerbating disease severity. However, given the inherent mechanosensitivity of fibrotic lungs, where type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC IIs) are subjected to persistent stretching and overactivated myofibroblasts experience malignant interactions during mechanotransduction, it becomes imperative to develop effective strategies to modulate the pulmonary mechanical microenvironment. Herein, cyclo (RGDfC) peptide&#8208;decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoparticles (named ZDFPR NPs) are constructed to target and repair the aberrant mechanical force levels in pathological lungs. Specifically, reduces mechanical tension in AEC IIs by pH&#8208;responsive ZDFPR NPs that release zinc ions and 7, 8&#8208;dihydroxyflavone to promote alveolar repair and differentiation. Meanwhile, malignant interactions between myofibroblast contractility and extracellular matrix stiffness during mechanotransduction are disrupted by the fasudil inhibition ROCK signaling pathway. The results show that ZDFPR NPs successfully restored pulmonary mechanical homeostasis and terminated the fibrosis process in bleomycin&#8208;induced fibrotic mice. This study not only presents a promising strategy for modulating pulmonary mechanical microenvironment but also pioneers a novel avenue for IPF treatment.

         <title>Regulation of Wide Bandgap Perovskite by Rubidium Thiocyanate for Efficient Silicon/Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rubidium thiocyanate as additive is incorporated in 1.66 eV bandgap perovskites to regulate film crystallization, significantly reduced device hysteresis, non&#8208;radiative recombination, ion&#8208;migration, and phase segregation. The perovskite solar cell achieved state&#8208;of&#8208;art 1.3 V VOC and 24.3% efficiency, with T80 lifetime of 944&#160;h under 1&#160;sun/65&#176;C. After integrating with flat silicon subcell, 30% efficiency is obtained for silicon/perovskite tandem device.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;quality wide bandgap (WBG) perovskites with &#8776;1.7&#160;eV bandgap (Eg) is critical to couple with silicon and create efficient silicon/perovskite tandem devices. The sufferings of large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss and unstable power output under operation continuously highlight the criticality to fully develop high&#8208;quality WBG perovskite films. In this study, rubidium and thiocyanate as additive regulators in WBG perovskites are incorporated, significantly reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination, ion&#8208;migration, and phase segregation. The optimized 1.66 eV Eg perovskite solar cells achieved state&#8208;of&#8208;art 1.3&#160;V VOC (0.36&#160;V deficit), and delivered a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 24.3%, along with good device stability (20% degradation (T80) after over 994&#160;h of operation under 1 sun at &#8776;65&#176;C). When integrated with a flat front side silicon cell, silicon/perovskite two&#8208;terminal tandem device (30% efficient) is obtained with a 1.97&#160;V VOC, and T90 operational lifetime of more than 600&#160;h at room temperature.

         <title>High Performance and Colorful Polymer Thermoelectrics with Imprinted Porous Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer films featuring highly ordered periodic porous structures not only demonstrate exceptional thermoelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit, reaching up to 0.52, but also exhibit captivating structural colors and remarkable stretchability.








Abstract
The rapid development of the Internet of Things and wearable electronics has generated growing interest in creating high&#8208;performance and visually striking polymer thermoelectric (TE) devices. However, existing polymer TE materials have yet to fully meet these diverse demands. In this study, imprinted porous polymer films are introduced that exhibit both high TE performance and a spectrum of structural colors. The porous architecture not only preserves excellent charge transport properties but also significantly enhances phonon&#8208;like scattering, resulting in a more than 50% reduction in thermal conductivity for the PDPPSe&#8208;12 film. This leads to a 170% increase in the figure of merit (ZT), achieving a peak value of 0.52 at 363&#160;K. Furthermore, the highly ordered porous structure imparts the PDPPSe&#8208;12 films with both a wide range of structural colors and remarkable stretchability, making them ideal for wearable TE generators.

&lt;p&gt;Polymer films featuring highly ordered periodic porous structures not only demonstrate exceptional thermoelectric figure-of-merit, reaching up to 0.52, but also exhibit captivating structural colors and remarkable stretchability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid development of the Internet of Things and wearable electronics has generated growing interest in creating high-performance and visually striking polymer thermoelectric (TE) devices. However, existing polymer TE materials have yet to fully meet these diverse demands. In this study, imprinted porous polymer films are introduced that exhibit both high TE performance and a spectrum of structural colors. The porous architecture not only preserves excellent charge transport properties but also significantly enhances phonon-like scattering, resulting in a more than 50% reduction in thermal conductivity for the PDPPSe-12 film. This leads to a 170% increase in the figure of merit (ZT), achieving a peak value of 0.52 at 363&#160;K. Furthermore, the highly ordered porous structure imparts the PDPPSe-12 films with both a wide range of structural colors and remarkable stretchability, making them ideal for wearable TE generators. This approach is widely applicable to various polymeric systems, offering a novel strategy for advancing state-of-the-art plastic TE materials through microstructural engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Charge and Exciton Diffusion in Monolayer Films of 9&#8208;Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons</title>

         <dc:description>Schematic representation of 9&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbons subjected to a pump pulse, which generates charge carriers. The spatial and temporal dynamics of these carriers are investigated using a probe pulse with variable time delay &#916;t and a controllable spatial offset.








Abstract
Determining the electronic transport properties of graphene nanoribbons is crucial for assessing their suitability for applications. So far, this has been highly challenging both through experimental and theoretical approaches. This is particularly the case for graphene nanoribbons that are prepared by chemical vapor deposition, which is a scalable and industry&#8208;compatible bottom&#8208;up growth method that results in closely packed arrays of ribbons with relatively short lengths of a few tens of nanometers. In this study, the experimental technique of spatiotemporal microscopy is applied to study monolayer films of 9&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbons prepared using this growth method, and combined with linear&#8208;scaling quantum transport calculations of arrays of thousands of nanoribbons. Both approaches directly resolve electronic spreading in space and time through diffusion and give an initial diffusivity approaching 200 cm2 s&#8722;1 during the first picosecond after photoexcitation. This corresponds to a mobility up to 550 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The quasi&#8208;free carriers then form excitons, which spread with a diffusivity of tens of cm2 s&#8722;1. The results indicate that this relatively large charge carrier mobility is the result of electronic transport not being hindered by defects nor inter&#8208;ribbon hopping. This confirms their suitability for applications that require efficient electronic&#160;transport.

         <title>4.6&#160;V Moisture&#8208;Tolerant Electrolytes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique salt lithium cyano(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiCTFSI) provides an opportunity to develop advanced electrolytes with distinctive physical and chemical properties, outperforming the conventional LiPF6 and lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) salts under various operating conditions, paving the way for extreme batteries and offering a promising direction for future high&#8208;energy, cost&#8208;effective lithium&#8208;ion batteries.









Abstract
Commercial LiPF6&#8208;based electrolytes face limitations in oxidation stability (4.2 V) and water tolerance (10 ppm). While replacing LiPF6 with lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) improves water tolerance, it induces Al current collector corrosion above 3.7 V vs. Li/Li+. To address this, lithium cyano(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiCTFSI) is proposed here as a non&#8208;corrosive, moisture&#8208;tolerant alternative. The 2.0 M LiCTFSI/propylene carbonate (PC)&#8208;fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (7:3 by volume) electrolyte enables LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes to reach 210 mAh g&#8722;1 (2.8&#8208;4.6 V) with a cycle life of 500. Full cells with NCM811||graphite (2.0 mAh cm&#8722;2) show 77.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles. Even with 2000 ppm moisture in the electrolyte, full cells maintain high cycling stability, reducing the need for costly dry rooms. The electrolyte&#8217;s low freezing point and high thermal stability enable the operation from &#8208;20 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C, delivering 168 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8208;20 &#176;C and retaining 94% capacity after 100 cycles at 60 &#176;C. In contrast, cells with commercial LiPF6 electrolyte deliver 71 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8208;20&#176;C and retain 52.7% after 100 cycles at 60 &#176;C. This novel salt offers a cost&#8208;effective solution for developing robust, high&#8208;performance batteries suitable for extreme conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrahigh Elastic Energy Storage in Nanocrystalline Alloys with Martensite Nanodomains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;level nanostructure featuring martensite nanodomains embedded in a ferroelastic nanocrystalline matrix is utilized for high&#8208;performance elastic energy storage. The synergy of grain boundary strengthening and nucleation&#8208;free reversible transformation enables these alloys to achieve an ultrahigh elastic energy density (&gt;40 MJ m&#8722;3) with ultrahigh efficiency (&gt;93%). Moreover, these properties are maintained at the microscale, demonstrating exceptional durability with over two million cycles.








Abstract
Elastic materials that store and release elastic energy play pivotal roles in both macro and micro mechanical systems. Uniting high elastic energy density and efficiency is crucial for emerging technologies such as artificial muscles, hopping robots, and unmanned aerial vehicle catapults, yet it remains a significant challenge. Here, a nanocrystalline structure embedded with elliptical martensite nanodomains in ferroelastic alloys was&#160;utilized to enable high yield strength, large recoverable strain, and low energy dissipation simultaneously. As a result, the designed Ti&#8211;Ni&#8211;V alloys demonstrate ultrahigh energy density (&gt;40 MJ m&#8722;3) with ultrahigh efficiency (&gt;93%) and exceptional durability. This concept, which combines nano&#8208;sized embryos to minimize energy dissipation of psuedo&#8208;elasticity and employs a fine&#8208;grained structure to enhance yield strength, can be applied to other ferroelastic materials. Furthermore, it holds promise for the development of phase transformation&#8208;involved functionalities such as high&#8208;performance dielectric energy storage, ultralow&#8208;hysteresis magnetostrain, and high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state caloric&#160;cooling.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency, Prevascularization&#8208;Free Macroencapsulation System for Subcutaneous Transplantation of Pancreatic Islets for Enhanced Diabetes Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency, prevascularization&#8208;free macroencapsulation system for the subcutaneous transplantation of pancreatic islets is developed. This novel system demonstrates excellent long&#8208;term blood glucose control at the subcutaneous site, even with the transplantation of &#8776;250 IEQ of islets. Furthermore, the system enables the local delivery of antifibrotic drugs, indicating its high applicability for islet xenotransplantation.








Abstract
Pancreatic islet macroencapsulation systems for subcutaneous transplantation have garnered significant attention as a therapy for Type I diabetes due to their minimal invasiveness and low complication rates. However, the low vascular density of subcutaneous tissue threatens the long&#8208;term survival of islets. To address this issue, prevascularized systems are introduced but various challenges remain, including system complexity and vascular&#8208;cell immunogenicity. Here, a novel prevasculature&#8208;free macroencapsulation system designed as a multilayer sheet, which ensures sufficient mass transport even in regions with sparse vasculature, is presented. Islets are localized in top/bottom micro&#8208;shell layers (&#8776;300&#160;&#181;m thick) to maximize proximity to the surrounding host vasculature. These sheets, fabricated via bioprinting using rat islets and alginate&#8208;based bio&#8208;ink, double islet viability and optimize islet density, improving insulin secretion function by 240%. The subcutaneous transplantation of small islet masses (&#8776;250 islet equivalent) into diabetic nude mice enable rapid (&lt;1 day) recovery of blood glucose, which remain stable for &gt;120 days. Additionally, antifibrotic drug&#8208;loaded multilayer sheets facilitate blood glucose regulation by rat islets at the subcutaneous sites of diabetic immunocompetent mice for &gt;35 days. Thus, this macroencapsulation system can advance the treatment of Type I diabetes and is also effective for islet xenotransplantation in subcutaneous tissue.

Here, a novel prevasculature-free macroencapsulation system designed as a multilayer sheet, which ensures sufficient mass transport even in regions with sparse vasculature, is presented. Islets are localized in top/bottom micro-shell layers (&#8776;300&#160;&#181;m thick) to maximize proximity to the surrounding host vasculature. These sheets, fabricated via bioprinting using rat islets and alginate-based bio-ink, double islet viability and optimize islet density, improving insulin secretion function by 240%. The subcutaneous transplantation of small islet masses (&#8776;250 islet equivalent) into diabetic nude mice enable rapid (&amp;lt;1 day) recovery of blood glucose, which remain stable for &amp;gt;120 days. Additionally, antifibrotic drug-loaded multilayer sheets facilitate blood glucose regulation by rat islets at the subcutaneous sites of diabetic immunocompetent mice for &amp;gt;35 days. Thus, this macroencapsulation system can advance the treatment of Type I diabetes and is also effective for islet xenotransplantation in subcutaneous tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ru&#8208;Incorporation&#8208;Induced Phase Transition in Co Nanoparticles for Low&#8208;Concentration Nitric Oxide Electroreduction to Ammonia at Low Potential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic low&#8208;concentration NO conversion can effectively alleviate the artificially destroyed N&#8208;cycle balance. RuCo alloy nanoparticles in the hexagonal close&#8208;packed phase are synthesized and demonstrated as an electrocatalyst for efficient NO electroreduction. It exhibits a record&#8208;high Faraday efficiency of 99.2% and an NH3 yield of 77.76&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at a low potential. With this RuCo electrocatalyst, a Zn&#8208;NO battery is assembled to simultaneously achieve NO removal, NH3 synthesis, and power output.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) represents a potential solution for improving the disrupted nitrogen cycle balance. Unfortunately, designing efficient electrocatalysts for NO reduction reaction (NORR) remains a notable challenge, especially at low concentrations. Herein, a displacement&#8208;alloying strategy is reported to successfully induce the phase transition of Co nanoparticles supported on carbon nanosheets from face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) to hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) structure through Ru incorporation. The obtained RuCo alloy with hcp phase structure (hcp&#8208;RuCo) exhibits apparent NORR activity with a record&#8208;high Faraday efficiency of 99.2% and an NH3 yield of 77.76&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.1&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode at a NO concentration of 1&#160;vol %, surpassing Co nanoparticles with fcc phase structure and most reported catalysts. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the excellent NORR activity of hcp&#8208;RuCo can be attributed to the optimized electronic structure of Co site and lowered energy barrier of the potential rate&#8208;determining step through phase transition. Furthermore, the assembled Zn&#8208;NO battery using hcp&#8208;RuCo as the cathode achieves a power density of 2.33&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and an NH3 yield of 45.94&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. This work provides a promising research perspective for low&#8208;concentration NO conversion.

         <title>All&#8208;In&#8208;One Epoxy/MXene Nanocomposites with Bead&#8208;Type Polymeric Imidazole Latent Curing Agent for Enhancing Storage Stability and Flame Retardancy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The all&#8208;in&#8208;one epoxy/MXene nanocomposite system, comprising epoxy resin, polymeric imidazole latent curing agent beads (PILCAB), and surface&#8208;functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene, exhibits excellent storage stability, improved flame retardancy, and enhanced mechanical strength, due to the homogeneous dispersibility, synergistic charring capability of MXene and bismaleimide (BMI), and the catalytic effect of the MXene flakes.








Abstract
Developing a single&#8208;component epoxy system is challenging but crucial for advanced thermoset applications. Unfortunately, conventional latent curing agents using chemical or physical passivation do not provide satisfactory storage stability and the necessary property requirements. Here, it is demonstrated that all&#8208;in&#8208;one epoxy/MXene nanocomposite system, comprising epoxy resin, polymeric imidazole latent curing agent beads (PILCAB), and Ti3C2Tx MXene, exhibits excellent storage stability, improved flame retardancy, and enhanced mechanical strength. PILCABs, prepared through a Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) crosslinking reaction between furan groups of poly(imidazolyl methacrylate)&#8208;random poly (furfuryl methacrylate) (PIm&#8208;r&#8208;PFu) copolymer and bismaleimide (BMI), exhibit excellent storage stability, as stable as under 60 &#176;C storage due to the imidazole reactivity being suppressed synergistically by both physical and chemical passivation mechanisms. Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes, surface&#8208;functionalized with alkylated 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine, exhibit excellent compatibility with the epoxy matrix. Consequently, the enhanced storage stability, flame retardancy, and mechanical strength of the all&#8208;in&#8208;one epoxy/MXene nanocomposite are attributed to the strong DA bond formation in latent curing agent, efficient charring capability of MXene and BMI, and the catalytic effect of the MXene. This study opens new avenues for designing and developing single&#8208;component epoxy systems that satisfy demanding requirements, including storage stability, mechanical strength, and flame retardancy, which are essential for practical applications.

N&#8208;doped MXene&#8208;encapsulated vanadium oxide hollow spheres (VOx@N&#8208;MXene HSs) that enable reversible Na+ storage through multidirectional pathways and ample vacancies are developed here. Machine learning simulations indicate increased pore density within the amorphous VOx structure and highlight atomic&#8208;scale transformations during cycling. These findings advance the design of amorphous electrodes, contributing to the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.








Abstract
Sodium ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) address the high power and energy requirements in energy storage devices but face significant challenges arising from the slow kinetics and cycling instability of the anode side. Introducing atomic disorder and employing structural engineering in anode materials proves to be effective strategies for achieving rapid charge storage. Here, it is demonstrated that N&#8208;doped MXene encapsulated amorphous vanadium oxide hollow spheres (VOx@N&#8208;MXene HSs) offer multidirectional open pathways and sufficient vacancies, enabling reversible and fast Na+ insertion/extraction. Machine learning potentials, coupled with molecular simulation techniques, confirm the presence of more abundant pores within the amorphous vanadium oxide (VOx) structure. The simulation of the charging/discharging process elucidates the authentic reaction path and structural evolutions of the VOx@N&#8208;MXene HSs, providing sufficient insight into the atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms associated with these structural superiorities. The full SIHCs devices demonstrate a high energy density of 198.3 Wh kg&#8722;1, along with a long&#8208;term cycling lifespan of 8000 cycles. This study offers valuable strategies into the intricate design and exploration of amorphous electrodes, contributing to the advancement of next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy devices.

         <title>A DNAzyme&#8208;Based Nanohybrid for Ultrasound and Enzyme Dual&#8208;Controlled mRNA Regulation and Combined Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled DNAzyme nanohybrid is developed for ultrasound&#8208;controlled, enzyme&#8208;activatable mRNA regulation and combined tumor treatment. This system enables ultrasound&#8208;enhanced endosomal escape and specific enzyme activation of DNAzyme function, thereby improving efficacy and cell&#8208;type specificity in target gene silencing and combinational tumor therapy.








Abstract
Despite the significant potential of RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes for gene regulation, their application is limited by low therapeutic efficacy and lack of cell&#8208;specific control. Here, a DNAzyme&#8208;based nanohybrid designed for ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled, enzyme&#8208;activatable mRNA regulation is presented, enabling tumor cell&#8208;selective combination therapy. The nanohybrid is constructed by coordination&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly of an enzymatically&#8208;triggerable therapeutic DNAzyme (En&#8208;Dz) and natural sonosensitizer hemoglobin (Hb). Controlled US exposure induces reactive oxygen species generation from Hb units, which not only facilitates efficient endosomal escape of En&#8208;Dz, but also promotes the translocation of specific enzyme from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby enhancing gene regulation efficacy. Notably, the enzyme&#8208;triggered, spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled activation of En&#8208;Dz's catalytic activity results in enhanced cancer&#8208;cell selectivity in the therapeutic treatment. Furthermore, the combination of enzyme&#8208;activated mRNA regulation and sonodynamic therapy significantly enhances anti&#8208;tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo.

     alt="A DNAzyme-Based Nanohybrid for Ultrasound and Enzyme Dual-Controlled mRNA Regulation and Combined Tumor Treatment"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-assembled DNAzyme nanohybrid is developed for ultrasound-controlled, enzyme-activatable mRNA regulation and combined tumor treatment. This system enables ultrasound-enhanced endosomal escape and specific enzyme activation of DNAzyme function, thereby improving efficacy and cell-type specificity in target gene silencing and combinational tumor therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant potential of RNA-cleaving DNAzymes for gene regulation, their application is limited by low therapeutic efficacy and lack of cell-specific control. Here, a DNAzyme-based nanohybrid designed for ultrasound (US)-controlled, enzyme-activatable mRNA regulation is presented, enabling tumor cell-selective combination therapy. The nanohybrid is constructed by coordination-directed self-assembly of an enzymatically-triggerable therapeutic DNAzyme (En-Dz) and natural sonosensitizer hemoglobin (Hb). Controlled US exposure induces reactive oxygen species generation from Hb units, which not only facilitates efficient endosomal escape of En-Dz, but also promotes the translocation of specific enzyme from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby enhancing gene regulation efficacy. Notably, the enzyme-triggered, spatiotemporally-controlled activation of En-Dz's catalytic activity results in enhanced cancer-cell selectivity in the therapeutic treatment. Furthermore, the combination of enzyme-activated mRNA regulation and sonodynamic therapy significantly enhances anti-tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the potential of integrating a sonodynamic strategy to overcome the current limitations of DNAzyme-based gene regulators, providing a spatiotemporally-controlled approach for precise tumor treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling 2D Electron Gas with High Room&#8208;Temperature Electron Mobility Exceeding 100&#160;cm2 Vs&#8722;1 at a Perovskite Oxide Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, using a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modes in molecular beam epitaxy, the controlled creation of a 2D electron gas at the epitaxial interface between perovskite oxides BaSnO3 and LaInO3 is demonstrated. The enhanced room&#8208;temperature electron mobility values are up to 119 cm2 Vs&#8722;1&#8212;the highest room&#8208;temperature value reported so far for a perovskite oxide 2D electron gas.








Abstract
In perovskite oxide heterostructures, bulk functional properties coexist with emergent physical phenomena at epitaxial interfaces. Notably, charge transfer at the interface between two insulating oxide layers can lead to the formation of a 2D electron gas (2DEG) with possible applications in, e.g., high&#8208;electron&#8208;mobility transistors and ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors. So far, the realization of oxide 2DEGs is, however, largely limited to the interface between the single&#8208;crystal substrate and epitaxial film, preventing their deliberate placement inside a larger device architecture. Additionally, the substrate&#8208;limited quality of perovskite oxide interfaces hampers room&#8208;temperature (RT) 2DEG performance due to notoriously low electron mobility. In this work, the controlled creation of an interfacial 2DEG at the epitaxial interface between perovskite oxides BaSnO3 and LaInO3 is demonstrated with enhanced RT electron mobility values up to 119 cm2 Vs&#8722;1&#8212;the highest RT value reported so far for a perovskite oxide 2DEG. Using a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art deposition modes during oxide molecular beam epitaxy, this approach opens up another degree of freedom in optimization and in situ control of the interface between two epitaxial oxide layers away from the substrate interface. Thus this approach is expected to apply to the general class of perovskite oxide 2DEG systems and to enable their improved compatibility with novel device concepts and integration across materials&#160;platforms.

         <title>Lateral Phase Heterojunction for Perovskite Microoptoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perovskite lateral phase heterojunction (LPH) polycrystalline film is first demonstrated by a developed contact&#8208;diffusion lithography (CDL) for the fabrication of microscale perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (micro&#8208;PeLEDs). Based on the &#945;/&#948;&#8208;formamidiniumPbI3 (FAPbI3) LPH film with high&#8208;resolution patterns and superior radiative performance, a record&#8208;efficiency near&#8208;infrared micro&#8208;PeLED device is achieved to validate the versatile applications of LPHs in perovskite microoptoelectronics and photonics.









Abstract
Perovskite heterojunction engineering is the prerequisite but still a deficiency in the fabrication of micro&#8208;optoelectronic devices, where the present top&#8208;down or bottom&#8208;up techniques mainly focus on preparing the vertical heterojunction stacks. Perovskite lateral heterojunction structures generally rely on epitaxial growth, which cannot meet the demands of mass production of micro&#8208;devices. Here, a contact diffusion lithography technique is proposed to demonstrate a perovskite lateral phase heterojunction (LPH) polycrystalline film by ion&#8208;driven local phase transition. Under the guidance of thermodynamic simulations, methylamine contact and migration collectively promote in situ formation of &#945;&#8208;phase formamidine&#8208;based perovskite patterns surrounded by &#948;&#8208;phase polymorphs. Spontaneous type&#8208;I heterojunction alignment between &#945;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;phases establishes energy funnels in the LPH film to facilitate carrier utilization and radiative recombination. The wide&#8208;bandgap &#948;&#8208;phase also serves as the coplanar isolator to achieve local anti&#8208;leakage for device integration. Based on the bright and stable LPH pattern layer, the near&#8208;infrared microscale perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode (micro&#8208;PeLED) with impressive device performance is achieved by following conventional device fabrication protocol. The proposed LPH enriches the perovskite heterojunction family, creates a new optoelectronic processing platform, and advances its versatile applications in micro&#8208;optoelectronics and photonics.

         <title>Impact of Dilute DIO Additive on Local Microstructure of Fluorinated, pNDI&#8208;Based Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of PBDBT: N2200&#8208;based all&#8208;polymer solar cells can be enhanced by processing with dilute diiodooctane solvent additive. This study reveals the microstructural mechanisms that drive charge transport enhancements in these solar cells by combining X&#8208;ray techniques with electron microscopy. Ultimately, the study finds that processing with dilute diiodooctane promotes efficient vertical charge transport pathways while preserving donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial connectivity.








Abstract
The performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells is often enhanced by incorporating solvent additives during solution processing. In particular, blends based on the model all&#8208;polymer system PBDBT:N2200 have been shown to have increased short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor when processed with dilute diiodooctane (DIO). However, the morphological mechanism that drives the increase in performance is often not well understood due to limitations in common characterization techniques. In this study, it is shown that a combination of X&#8208;ray techniques with cryogenic high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis can provide a quantitative and spatially resolved picture of polymer chain orientation and alignment in all&#8208;polymer blends. It is found that DIO induces vertical phase separation in PBDBT&#8208;2F:F&#8208;N2200 and increases donor crystallite thickness in the pi&#8208;stacking direction leading to an acceptor&#8208;rich film surface. However, it is also shown that DIO does not disrupt the formation of face&#8208;on donor&#8211;acceptor interfaces. These findings suggest that dilute DIO primarily affects crystalline domain formation in single component regions as opposed to mixed regions; thus, dilute DIO can impact vertical charge transport pathways without sacrificing donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial connectivity.

         <title>Inhibiting Mitochondrial Damage for Efficient Treatment of Cerebral Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury Through Sequential Targeting Nanomedicine of Neuronal Mitochondria in Affected Brain Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript synthesized a nanomaterial (MHT) with strong antioxidant properties that can sequentially target the mitochondria of CIRI brain tissue neurons (a&#8211;c). After sublingual intravenous injection, MHT uses its high affinity for damaged vascular matrix proteins and mitochondrial membrane protein Tom20 to sequentially target neuronal mitochondria, effectively reducing neuronal death by efficiently clearing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and eliminating the inflammatory storm(d).








Abstract
Oxidative stress, predominantly from neuronal mitochondrial damage and the resultant cytokine storm, is central to cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, delivering drugs to neuronal mitochondria remains challenging due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), which impedes drug entry into affected brain tissues. This study introduces an innovative tannic acid (TA) and melanin&#8208;modified heteropolyacid nanomedicine (MHT), which highly specifically eliminates the neuronal mitochondrial reactive oxygen radicals burst to efficiently reduce neuronal mitochondrial damage through a strategically designed sequential targeting strategy from affected brain tissue to neuronal mitochondria. TA endows MHT with sequential targeting ability by binding to matrix proteins exposed to the damaged BBB and mitochondrial outer membrane proteins of neurons, while melanin significantly enhances the antioxidant capacity of MHT. Consequently, MHT effectively inhibits neuronal apoptosis by protecting mitochondria and reversing the inflammatory immune environment through the deactivation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway. MHT demonstrated a strong therapeutic effect on CIRI, with an ultralow dose (2 mg&#160;kg&#8722;1) proving effective in reversing the condition. This work not only introduces a new avenue to significantly reduce CIRI through sequential targeting therapy but also offers a new paradigm for treating other ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury diseases.

This study introduces an innovative tannic acid (TA) and melanin-modified heteropolyacid nanomedicine (MHT), which highly specifically eliminates the neuronal mitochondrial reactive oxygen radicals burst to efficiently reduce neuronal mitochondrial damage through a strategically designed sequential targeting strategy from affected brain tissue to neuronal mitochondria. TA endows MHT with sequential targeting ability by binding to matrix proteins exposed to the damaged BBB and mitochondrial outer membrane proteins of neurons, while melanin significantly enhances the antioxidant capacity of MHT. Consequently, MHT effectively inhibits neuronal apoptosis by protecting mitochondria and reversing the inflammatory immune environment through the deactivation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway. MHT demonstrated a strong therapeutic effect on CIRI, with an ultralow dose (2 mg&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) proving effective in reversing the condition. This work not only introduces a new avenue to significantly reduce CIRI through sequential targeting therapy but also offers a new paradigm for treating other ischemia-reperfusion injury diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Reversible and Robust Mechano&#8208;Responsive Ultralong Phosphorescence of Polyurethane Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ, sensitive, and rapidly reversible mechano&#8208;responsive (MR) phosphorescence from a doped polyurethane (PU) elastomer has been achieved from the reversible MR polymer chain orientation and hydrogen bonding interactions among the system. Based on their MR afterglow, these PU materials have demonstrated various applications without interruption of background, including micro&#8208;crack detection, material damage prediction, limb movement monitoring, and information encryption.








Abstract
Though mechano&#8208;responsive luminescent materials obtained much attention, most of their responses are non&#8208;reversible, let alone in situ reversible. Here, the study presents a new strategy to push through this limitation for their applications, which relies on the reversible mechano&#8208;responsive (MR) hydrogen bonding interactions and polymer chain orientation among a doped polyurethane (PU) elastomer. The radiative and nonradiative transitions inside these phosphorescent triphenylene&#8208;based aromatic secondary amines (TpNP and TpNPO) doped in the PU matrix can be accordingly modulated by these MR variations, including the PU chains orientation and the interactions between emitters and PU, respectively. Surprisingly, the intensities, quantum yields, and even lifetimes of their ultralong phosphorescence correlate well with the stress of PU, showing triple mechano&#8208;enhancement with a small threshold value of 7.9&#160;MPa. Importantly, these in situ and rapidly reversible MR phosphorescences possess excellent repeatability, which is still displayed even after &gt;500 cycles of loading/unloading. Based on such a robust and highly sensitive MR afterglow, these PU materials have been demonstrated applications with no interruption of background in several fields, including micro&#8208;crack detection, material damage prediction, limb movement monitoring, and information encryption. This work provides new insights for developing innovative ultralong phosphorescence materials with improved luminescence and reversible mechano&#8208;responsive behavior.

         <title>A General Approach for Metal Nanoparticle Encapsulation Within Porous Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust nanocasting approach is demonstrated to synthesize encapsulated nanoparticles in metal oxides. First, colloidal nanoparticles are encapsulated in a porous polymer matrix. Then, metal oxide precursor is infiltrated, and materials are calcined to form a porous metal oxide network. Various combinations of nanoparticles encapsulated in metal oxide materials can be synthesized, and their surface area and porosity can be tuned using this method.








Abstract
Encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within oxide materials has been shown as an effective strategy to improve activity, selectivity, and stability in several catalytic applications. Several approaches have been proposed to encapsulate nanoparticles, such as forming core&#8208;shell structures, growing ordered structures (zeolites or metal&#8208;organic frameworks) on nanoparticles, or directly depositing support materials on nanoparticles. Here, a general nanocasting method is demonstrated that can produce diverse encapsulated metal@oxide structures with different compositions (Pt, Pd, Rh) and multiple types of oxides (Al2O3, Al2O3&#8208;CeO2, ZrO2, ZnZrOx, In2O3, Mn2O3, TiO2) while controlling the size and dispersion of nanoparticles and the porous structure of the oxide. Metal@polymer structures are first prepared, and then the oxide precursor is infiltrated into such structures and the resulting material is calcined to form the metal@oxide structures. Most Pt@oxides catalysts show similar catalytic activity, demonstrating the availability of surface Pt sites in the encapsulated structures. However, the Pt@Mn2O3 sample showed much higher CO oxidation activity, while also being stable under aging conditions. This work demonstrated a robust nanocasting method to synthesize metal@oxide structures, which can be utilized in catalysis to finely tune metal&#8208;oxide interfaces.

         <title>Designing Impact Resistance and Robustness into Slippery Lubricant Infused Porous Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slippery lubricant infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) are presented which seek to address the lubricant drainage issue that impairs such surfaces. The strong lubricant retention achieved enables the SLIPS to maintain their slipperiness under high&#8208;speed liquid impact and other dynamic/flow conditions. These findings should widen the practical applications of SLIPS.








Abstract
Slippery lubricant infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have the potential to address daunting challenges such as undesirable surface fouling/biofouling, icing, etc. However, the depletion of lubricants hampers their practical utility. As a solution, here a rational strategy is introduced that operates synergistically in three parts. First, ultra&#8208;high capillary pressure is exploited from the reticular structure of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with sub&#8208;nanometer pores. Second, the need for geometric compatibility is demonstrated; the lubricant chain diameter must be smaller than the MOF pore to enable lubricant chain intercalation. Lastly, the MOF pore chemistry is tailored to achieve a strong intermolecular interaction for any given MOF/lubricant combination. The strategy is investigated through experiments and quantum/molecular simulations, which show that the approach helps lock the intercalated lubricant chains inside the MOF pores and forms a non&#8208;conventional supramolecular structure. The resulting SLIPS (including those with fluorine&#8208;free chemistry) not only show typical low wetting hysteresis, friction, and ice adhesion but are uniquely resistant to more stringent tests such as continuous dripping and sliding of water droplets (up to 50&#160;hrs), repeated impacts of high&#8208;speed water jets (liquid impact Weber number &gt;&#160;4&#160;&#215;&#160;104) and prevent bacterial biofilm formation even in dynamic flow conditions. The findings may widen the practical applications of SLIPS.

         <title>An Antagonistic Photovoltaic Memristor for Bioinspired Active Contrast Adaptation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired optoelectronic memristor incorporating two antagonistic photovoltaic junctions can autonomously adjust its response to varying light stimuli, enabling the amplification of shadows and inhibition of highlight saturation. The memristor arrays are capable of capturing a high&#8208;contrast scene up to 94 dB with a faster active adaptation speed (less than 1.2 s) than that of biological systems.








Abstract
Machine vision systems that consist of cameras and image&#8208;processing components for visual inspection and identification tasks play a critical role in various intelligent applications, including pilotless vehicles and surveillance systems. However, current systems usually possess a limited dynamic range and fixed photoresponsivity, restricting their capability of gaining high&#8208;fidelity images when encoding a high&#8208;contrast scene. Here, it is shown that a photovoltaic memristor incorporating two antagonistic photovoltaic junctions can autonomously adjust its response to varying light stimuli, enabling the amplification of shadows and inhibition of highlight saturation. Due to the dynamic photodoping effect at the p&#8208;n junction with an asymmetrical profile, the photocurrent polarities of the antagonistic memristor can be changed as the light intensity increases. The light&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent switchable photovoltaic behaviors match Weber's law where photosensitivity is inversely proportional to the light stimuli. An 11&#160;&#215;&#160;11 memristor array is used to detect a high&#8208;contrast scene with light intensities ranging from 1 to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;104 &#181;W cm&#8722;2, achieving a similar active contrast adaptation performance compared with the human visual systems (less than 1.2 s at 94 dB). This work paves the way for innovative neuromorphic device designs and may lead to the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art active visual adaptation photosensors.

         <title>Hydronium&#8208;Crosslinked Inorganic Hydrogel Comprised of 1D Lepidocrocite Titanate Nanofilaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently discovered, 1D lepidocrocite titanate nanofilaments (1DL) represent a highly scalable &#8220;truly 1D&#8221; material, featuring a cross&#8208;section 2&#160;x&#160;2 TiO6 octahedra thick. Given its extreme dimensionality, 1DL can be considered a TiO&#8208;based analog to polymeric strands and possesses unique self&#8208;assembly properties. Ion exchange with hydronium produces a crosslinked network of the first ever 1&#8208;D titanate&#8208;based, robust, biocompatible hydrogel.








Abstract
When a few drops of acid (hydrochloric, acrylic, propionic, acetic, or formic) are added to a colloid comprised of 1D lepidocrocite titanate nanofilaments (1DLs)&#8211;2 &#215; 2 TiO6 octahedra in cross&#8208;section&#8211;a hydrogel forms, in many cases, within seconds. The 1DL synthesis process requires the reaction between titanium diboride with tetramethylammonium (TMA+), hydroxide. Using quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the mass percent of TMA+ after synthesis is determined to be &#8776; 13.1&#160;&#177;&#160;0.1%. The TMA+ is completely removed from the gels after 2 water soak cycles, resulting in the first completely inorganic, TiO2&#8208;based hydrogels. Ion exchanging the TMA+ with hydronium results in gels with relatively strong hydrogen bonds. The hydrogels' compression strengths increased linearly with 1DL colloid concentration. At a 1DL concentration of 45&#160;g&#160;L&#8722;1, the compressive strength, at 80% deformation when acrylic acid is used, is &#8776;325&#160;kPa. The strengths are &#8776; 50% greater after the TMA+ is removed. The removal of all residual organic components in the hydrogels, including TMA+, is confirmed by qNMR, Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and TGA/DSC. The 1DL phase is retained after gelation, TMA+ removal, and 80% compression.

         <title>A Frustrated Antipolar Phase Analogous to Classical Spin Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
EuAl12O19 crystals realize an electric analogue to one of the famous models of frustrated magnetism: the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet. Electric dipoles on a triangular lattice preferentially align antiparallel to their neighbors yet fail to form any long&#8208;range order, even at the lowest temperatures. The resulting frustrated antipolar phase is analogous to classical spin liquids.








Abstract
The study of magnetic frustration in classical spin systems is motivated by the prediction and discovery of classical spin liquid states. These uncommon magnetic phases are characterized by a massive degeneracy of their ground state implying a finite magnetic entropy at zero temperature. While the classical spin liquid state is originally predicted in the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet in 1950, this state has never been experimentally observed in any triangular magnets. The discovery of an electric analogue of classical spin liquids on a triangular lattice of uniaxial electric dipoles in EuAl12O19 is reported here. This new type of frustrated antipolar phase is characterized by a highly&#8208;degenerate state at low temperature implying an absence of long&#8208;range antiferroelectric order, despite short&#8208;range antipolar correlations. Its dynamics are governed by a thermally activated process, slowing down upon cooling toward a complete freezing at zero&#160;temperature.

         <title>A Universal Ternary Solvent System of Surface Passivator Enables Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 26%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A suitable solvent system of passivator can maximize the passivation effect, further improving the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This work proposes a ternary solvent system of 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;PEAI, which can inhibit the solvent&#8208;induced additional defects and achieve a sufficient passivated perovskite surface simultaneously. The resulting PSCs achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.05%, and the devices can maintain 95.23% and 95.68% of their initial PCE after 2000&#160;h storage in ambient air and 800&#160;h light&#8208;soaking in N2&#8208;glovebox.








Abstract
Surface passivation is a vital approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), in which the passivator solvent is an inevitable but easy&#8208;ignored factor on passivation effects. Herein, a universal ternary solvent system of surface passivators is proposed through comprehensively considering the solubility and selective perovskite dissolution of the solvent to maximize the passivation effect. Tetrahydrothiophene 1&#8208;oxide (THTO) is selected as the passivation promoter by comparing the binding energy with perovskite and the ability to distort the perovskite lattice among various aprotic polar solvent molecules, which can facilitate the passivator's reaction with perovskite and achieve sufficient passivation on perovskite surface. Besides, chlorobenzene (CB) is used as the diluting agent to minimize the amount of isopropanol (IPA), inhibiting the additional solvent&#8208;induced defects. As a result, the planar PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.05%, (certificated 25.66%). Besides, the unencapsulated devices exhibit enhanced stability, which can maintain 95.23% and 95.68% of their initial PCE after 2000&#160;h of storage in ambient air and 800&#160;h of light&#8208;soaking in N2&#8208;glovebox. Moreover, this ternary solvent system also exhibits a well applicability and reliability in different passivator such as PEAI, BAI, and so on.

         <title>Thresholding Computing with Heterogeneous Integration of Memristive Kernel with Metal&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Semiconductor Capacitor for Temporal Data Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an integrated thresholding kernel with two Pt/HfO2/TiN (PHT) memristors and Ni/HfO2/n&#8208;Si (NHS) metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor capacitor (2M1MOS) for precise thresholding in time&#8208;series data. This kernel system demonstrates an improved detection scheme in ECG analysis and achieved high accuracy in spoken digit classification, utilizing the capacitive thresholding to enhance memristive event detection ability for bio&#8208;indicator applications.








Abstract
Precise event detection within time&#8208;series data is increasingly critical, particularly in noisy environments. Reservoir computing, a robust computing method widely utilized with memristive devices, is efficient in processing temporal signals. However, it typically lacks intrinsic thresholding mechanisms essential for precise event detection. This study introduces a new approach by integrating two Pt/HfO2/TiN (PHT) memristors and one Ni/HfO2/n&#8208;Si (NHS)&#160;metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor capacitor (2M1MOS) to implement a tunable thresholding function. The current&#8208;voltage nonlinearity of memristors combined with the capacitance&#8208;voltage nonlinearity of the capacitor forms the basis of the 2M1MOS kernel system. The proposed kernel hardware effectively records feature&#8208;specified information of the input signal onto the memristors through capacitive thresholding. In electrocardiogram analysis, the memristive response exhibited a more than ten&#8208;fold difference between arrhythmia and normal beats. In isolated spoken digit classification, the kernel achieved an error rate of only 0.7% by tuning thresholds for various time&#8208;specific conditions. The kernel is also applied to biometric authentication by extracting personal features using various threshold times, presenting more complex and multifaceted uses of heartbeats and voice data as bio&#8208;indicators. These demonstrations highlight the potential of thresholding computing in a memristive framework with heterogeneous integration.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Sensitivity Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Landslide Surface Deformation via Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for monitoring surface deformation of landslides via triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) is proposed. By utilizing an ultra&#8208;low&#8208;speed triboelectric displacement sensor (US&#8208;TDS) to build the monitoring and early warning system, achieving highly sensitive real&#8208;time monitoring of surface deformation displacement and speed under ultra&#8208;low&#8208;speed conditions. This work provides a feasible solution for the scientific monitoring of the latent processes of landslides.








Abstract
Monitoring surface deformation is crucial for the early warning of landslides, facilitating timely preventive measures. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) demonstrates great potential for self&#8208;powered distributed monitoring in remote and power&#8208;scarce landslide areas. However, landslides deform typically at a rate of a few millimeters per day (mm d&#8722;1), making it challenging for TENG to directly monitor the deformation process. Herein, a method for monitoring surface deformation of landslides by constructing an ultra&#8208;low&#8208;speed triboelectric displacement sensor (US&#8208;TDS) is reported. Utilizing a force storage&#8208;release device and an accelerator, the US&#8208;TDS can produce obvious sensing signals at a linear input speed of 4.32&#160;mm d&#8722;1. The coefficient of determination (R2) for the fitting curve of the pulse signals within the speed range of 21.6 to 129.6&#160;mm d&#8722;1 reaches 0.999. Moreover, US&#8208;TDS can detect deformation displacement as small as 0.0382&#160;mm. The stability of US&#8208;TDS displacement measurements is confirmed at a speed of 108&#160;mm d&#8722;1, with relative errors under 1%. Ultimately, a real&#8208;time monitoring and early warning system for landslide surface deformation is constructed and verified through a combination of indoor simulations and outdoor experiments. This work provides a feasible solution for the scientific monitoring and early warning of the landslide development.

         <title>A Versatile Microporous Design toward Toughened yet Softened Self&#8208;Healing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed microporous design is demonstrated to transform soft and weak into soft yet ultra&#8208;tough self&#8208;healing materials. This approach not only achieves unprecedented improvements in crack propagation resistance and centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive lengths, but also enhances mechanical softness while preserving self&#8208;healing kinetics, which is crucial for fully exploiting the potential of soft yet tough self&#8208;healing materials in stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Realizing the full potential of self&#8208;healing materials in stretchable electronics necessitates not only low modulus to enable high adaptivity, but also high toughness to resist crack propagation. However, existing toughening strategies for soft self&#8208;healing materials have only modestly improves mechanical dissipation near the crack tip (&#1043;D), and invariably compromise the material's inherent softness and autonomous healing capabilities. Here, a synthetic microporous architecture is demonstrated that unprecedently toughens and softens self&#8208;healing materials without impacting their intrinsic self&#8208;healing kinetics. This microporous structure spreads energy dissipation across the entire material through a bran&#8208;new dissipative mode of adaptable crack movement (&#1043;A), which substantially increases the fracture toughness by 31.6 times, from 3.19 to 100.86 kJ m&#8722;2, and the fractocohesive length by 20.7 times, from 0.59 mm to 12.24 mm. This combination of unprecedented fracture toughness (100.86 kJ m&#8722;2) and centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive length (1.23 cm) surpasses all previous records for synthetic soft self&#8208;healing materials and even exceeds those of light alloys. Coupled with significantly enhanced softness (0.43 MPa) and nearly perfect autonomous self&#8208;healing efficiency (&#8776;100%), this robust material is ideal for constructing durable kirigami electronics for wearable devices.

         <title>Single Atom Engineered Antibiotics Overcome Bacterial Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atoms of manganese, tightly bonded to nitrogen&#8208;doped carboxylated graphene, exhibit potent antibacterial properties and bypass bacterial resistance development, even after thirty bacterial generations. Antibacterial activity is observed against both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, as well as in in&#8208;vivo models, while the material is nontoxic to human cells.








Abstract
The outbreak of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria, or &#8220;superbugs&#8221;, poses a global public health hazard due to their resilience against the most effective last&#8208;line antibiotics. Identifying potent antibacterial agents capable of evading bacterial resistance mechanisms represents the ultimate defense strategy. This study shows that &#8211;the otherwise essential micronutrient&#8211; manganese turns into a broad&#8208;spectrum potent antibiotic when coordinated with a carboxylated nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene. This antibiotic material (termed NGA&#8208;Mn) not only inhibits the growth of a wide spectrum of multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria but also heals wounds infected by bacteria in vivo and, most importantly, effectively evades bacterial resistance development. NGA&#8208;Mn exhibits up to 25&#8208;fold higher cytocompatibility to human cells than its minimum bacterial inhibitory concentration, demonstrating its potential as a next&#8208;generation antibacterial agent. Experimental findings suggest that NGA&#8208;Mn acts on the outer side of the bacterial cell membrane via a multimolecular collective binding, blocking vital functions in both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The results underscore the potential of single&#8208;atom engineering toward potent antibiotics, offering simultaneously a long&#8208;sought solution for evading drug resistance development while being cytocompatible to human cells.

         <title>Kirigami&#8208;Inspired Three&#8208;Dimensional Metamaterials with Programmable Isotropic and Orthotropic Thermal Expansion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of 3D metamaterials capable of programmable negative/zero/positive thermal expansion (NTE/ZTE/PTE) is developed based on the one&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom kirigami polyhedrons. An ultra&#8208;wide range of CTEs from &#8722;2354.3 to 3006.7 ppm/&#176;C is achieved in isotropic metamaterials. Furthermore, orthotropic metamaterials, where each of three directions can be assigned with an independently programmed NTE, ZTE, or PTE, are realized for the first time.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials with specifically designed cells can provide unusual thermal expansion properties for diverse applications. Limited by very few available cell topologies and complicated non&#8208;linear structural deformation, most existing thermal expansion metamaterials can only achieve orthogonally isotropic negative/zero/positive thermal expansion (NTE/ZTE/PTE) within a mild range, especially the 3D ones. Here, based on one&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom kirigami polyhedrons proposed with a kinematic design strategy, a family of 3D isotropic and orthotropic metamaterials capable of programmable NTE, PTE, and even ZTE over ultra&#8208;wide range is developed. Incorporating bi&#8208;material strips as creases for isotropic polyhedrons, NTE and PTE metamaterials with coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) ranging from &#8722;2354.3 to 3006.7&#160;ppm/&#176;C are designed and programmed by the theoretical model. Meanwhile, isotropic ZTE metamaterials are constructed by either homogeneous tessellation of ZTE cells or hybrid tessellation of NTE and PTE cells. Furthermore, by allowing distinct geometric parameters in the three orthogonal directions of the kirigami polyhedrons while preserving the kinematic motion, orthotropic metamaterials, in which each of the three directions can be assigned with an independently programmed NTE, ZTE, or PTE, are also achieved. This study paves a novel pathway for the development of thermal expansion metamaterials with potential applications for space optical systems, MEMS, and so on.

         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a flexible, wearable light&#8208;emitting device for skin anti&#8208;aging. The mask, based on a 3D origami structure, achieves conformal contact with the face, maximizing phototherapeutic effects. Notably, improvements in the elasticity of deep skin were 340% greater compared to a conventional LED mask. The blister&#8208;actuated laser&#8208;induced transfer achieves a 99.61% yield for microLEDs at a rate of 50 chips per second, enabling mass production.








Abstract
Photobiomodulation therapy based on micro light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#181;LEDs) holds remarkable potential for the beauty industry. Here, a cosmetically effective face&#8208;fit surface&#8208;lighting &#181;LED mask for skin anti&#8208;aging is introduced. The face&#8208;conformable mask enables deep tissue treatment through proximal light irradiation, with a 3D origami structure capable of adapting to complex facial contours with closed adherence. A blister&#8208;assisted laser transfer achieves rapid and accurate &#181;LEDs transfer at a high throughput of 50 chips per second, facilitating a mass&#8208;producible and large&#8208;area process. Finally, clinical trials demonstrate significant improvements in elasticity, sagging, and wrinkles across six facial areas, with a maximum enhancement of 340% in deep skin elasticity of the perioral area compared to the conventional LED mask group.

         <title>Force&#8208;Induced Ultraviolet C Luminescence of Pr3+&#8208;Doped Sr2P2O7 for X&#8208;Ray Dosimetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon stimulation of force, Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ emits trap&#8208;controlled UVC mechanoluminescence with the peak wavelength at 230&#160;nm. The UVC mechanoluminescence can be used for X&#8208;ray dosimetry.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescent materials have broad application prospects in advanced displays, stress imaging, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting owing to their ability to convert mechanical stimuli into light. However, most previous studies have focused on the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Although natural ultraviolet C (UVC) light is nearly absent on the Earth's surface, it plays an important role in many fields. Therefore, the development of smart materials capable of emitting UVC mechanoluminescence (ML) and expanding the application scenarios of UVC ML are significant but challenging. Here the ML property of Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ is examined, which stems from the 5d&#8594;4f transition of Pr3+ and is located over the UVC region. The peak wavelength of the UVC ML of Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ is &#8776;230&#160;nm, which is, to the best of this knowledge, the shortest ML wavelength reported to date. It is further demonstrated that the UVC ML of Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ is associated with trapped charge carriers and can be conveniently regulated by adjusting the X&#8208;ray excitation time. Relying on this unique characteristic, the potential of the UVC ML of Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ as an indicator of the X&#8208;ray radiation dose is demonstrated. This study enriches the family of mechanoluminescent materials and expands the available wavelength of ML to the UVC region.

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Inspired Flexible Phase Change Materials for Ambient Energy Harvesting and Respiration Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuron&#8208;inspired flexible phase change materials (PCMs) are fabricated via a self&#8208;assembly strategy, demonstrating high photothermal conversion efficiency and excellent thermal cycle stability. Due to the ultrasensitive humidity responsiveness, the flexible materials are directly utilized as sensors for human respiratory monitoring, which shows great potential for moisture electric generators (MEGs).








Abstract
The global energy crisis and climate change pose unprecedented challenges. Wearable devices with personal thermoregulation and energy harvesting hold great promise for achieving energy savings and human thermal comfort. Here, inspired by neurons, a novel phase change material (PCM) is reported for efficient energy harvesting and respiratory monitoring via a self&#8208;assembly strategy. The use of gum arabic (GA) enabled the encapsulation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the targeted distribution of carboxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (cMWCNTs) simultaneously in poly (ethylene vinyl acetate) (EVA) matrix. The material exhibits an outstanding toughness value of 14.88&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 and high elongation at a break of 565.67%, exhibiting remarkable flexibility. The material with sufficient melting enthalpy (71.11 J g&#8722;1) demonstrates high photothermal conversion efficiency (95.27%) under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation (105&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). In addition, due to the synergistic effect of GA and PEG, especially the formation of microdome structures on the surface, the material demonstrates ultrasensitive humidity responsiveness for respiratory monitoring with high precision, excellent repeatability, and fast response/recovery time (50.4/50.5&#160;ms). Notably, it shows great potential for moisture&#8208;electric generators (MEGs) with the function of non&#8208;contact sensing. This material opens the path toward next&#8208;generation wearable devices in energy conversion and health monitoring.

         <title>Evolution of Nitrogen&#8208;Coordinated Metal Single Atoms Toward Single&#8208;Atom Alloys on MgH&#8322; as Efficient and Stable Hydrogen Spillover Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single atoms (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) into single&#8208;atom alloys (SAA) are revealed during the catalysis of hydrogen spillover on MgH&#8322;. High&#8208;valence Ni in the NiN&#8324; sites is reduced, leaves the NiN&#8324; coordination, and diffuses into the surface lattice of Mg, forming a Ni&#8321;&#8210;Mg SAA. This Ni&#8321;&#8210;Mg SAA exhibits superior activity and stability compared to NiN&#8324; and most other known Ni&#8208;based catalysts for hydrogen storage reactions.








Abstract
M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom active sites have demonstrated high activity for hydrogen storage materials, but their stability in this application remains uncertain. This study addresses this issue by using nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) molecules on MgH&#8322; particles as a model system. It is found that the N&#8208;coordinated high&#8208;valence Ni single atoms in the NiN&#8324; active site are unstable in the reducing environment of hydrogen storage, spontaneously evolving into zero&#8208;valence Ni, forming a Ni&#8321;&#8208;Mg single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA). The Ni&#8321;&#8208;Mg SAA exhibits remarkable stability in catalyzing Mg hydrogen storage reactions. Furthermore, it demonstrates comprehensive catalytic activity for each step of hydrogen absorption and desorption from Mg, surpassing the efficiency of the NiN&#8324; active site, especially in the critical steps of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. Overall, the catalytic performance of Ni&#8321;&#8208;Mg SAA is superior to most known nickel&#8208;based catalysts. This evolutionary process is also observed in FePc, CoPc, and tetraphenylporphyrin nickel (Ni&#8208;TPP), suggesting that this reducing transformation is a universal phenomenon for MN&#8324;&#8208;type active sites in hydrogen storage catalysis.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils an aggregation&#8208;driven mechanism for synthesizing spinel oxides via hot injection that enables single&#8208;nanometer (1.2 nm) spinel. The resulting single&#8208;nanometer CoMn2O4 exhibits precise cation distribution with maximal octahedral Mn occupancy to form highly active catalytic centers, leading to superior electrocatalytic activity. This advancement offers a novel way for specifically engineering spinel structures and elucidating crucial structure&#8211;property relationships.








Abstract
Designing spinel nanocrystals (NCs) with tailored structural composition and cation distribution is crucial for superior catalytic performance but remarkably challenging due to their intricate nature. Here, an aggregation growth restricted hot&#8208;injection method is presented by meticulously investigating the fundamental nucleation and aggregation&#8208;driven growth kinetics governing spinel NC formation to address this challenge. Through controlled collision probability of nuclei during growth, this approach enables the synthesis of spinel NCs with unprecedented, single nanometer (1.2&#160;nm). Single&#8208;nanometer CoMn2O4 spinel via this method exhibits a highly tailored structure with a maximized population of highly active octahedral Mn atoms, thereby optimizing oxygen intermediate adsorption during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Consequently, it exhibits a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.88&#160;V in ORR and leads to a superior power density (170.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) in zinc&#8211;air battery, outperforming commercial Pt/C and most reported spinel oxides, revealing a clear structure&#8211;property relationship. This structure design strategy is readily adaptable for the precise synthesis and engineering of various spinel structures, opening new avenues for developing advanced electrocatalysts and energy storage materials.

         <title>Bifunctional Fluorocarbon Electrode Additive Lowers the Salt Dependence of Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional fluorocarbon electrode additive (BFEA) is proposed to construct solid electrolyte interphase independent of aqueous electrolyte. The LiF from reduction of BFEA suppresses hydrogen evolution, increasing coulombic efficiency while the carbon byproduct lowers battery polarization, improving round&#8208;trip efficiency. The unique advantages of BFEA make it highly compatible with aqueous batteries and promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications.








Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a crucial role in extending the life of aqueous batteries. The traditional anion&#8208;derived SEI formation in aqueous electrolytes highly depends on high&#8208;concentrated organic fluorinating salts, resulting in low forming efficiency and long&#8208;term consumption. In response, this study proposes a bifunctional fluorocarbon electrode additive (BFEA) that enables electrochemical pre&#8208;reduction instead of TFSI anion to form the LiF&#8208;rich SEI and in situ produce conductive graphite inside the anode before the lithiation. The BFEA lowers the salt dependence of aqueous electrolytes, enabling the inorganic LiCl electrolyte to work first, but also successfully achieves a high SEI formation efficiency in the relatively low 10&#160;m LiTFSI without mass transfer concerns, suppressing the parasitic hydrogen evolution from 11.24 to 4.35&#160;nmol min&#8722;1. Besides, BFEA strengthens the intrinsic superiority of Li storage reaction by lowering battery polarization resulting from the in situ production of graphite, promoting charge transfer of electrode kinetics. Compared with the control group, the demonstrated Ah&#8208;level pouch cell employing BFEA exhibits better cycle stability above 300 cycles with higher capacity retention of 78.2% and the lower decay of the round&#8208;trip efficiency (&#9651;RTE = 2%), benefiting for maintaining the high efficiency and reducing heat accumulation in large&#8208;scale electric energy storage.

         <title>Strong, Spontaneous, and Self&#8208;Healing Poly(Ionic Liquid) Elastomer Underwater Adhesive with Borate Ester Dynamic Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borate ester dynamically crosslinked poly(ionic liquid) elastomer adhesives (PIEA) are prepared. The dissociation of the borate ester in water leads to a spontaneous increase in the adhesion strength of PIEA from almost no adhesion to 314 kPa after 12 h without any external preloading, providing promising applications for the development of novel underwater smart adhesives.








Abstract
Adhesion in aqueous environments is often hindered by the water layer on the surface of the substrate due to the water sensitivity of the adhesive, greatly limiting the application environment. Here, a borate ester dynamically crosslinked poly(ionic liquid) elastomer adhesive (PIEA) with high strength, toughness, self&#8208;healing abilities, and ionic conductivity is synthesized by copolymerizing hydrophobic ionic liquid monomer ([HPVIm][TFSI]) and 2&#8208;methoxyethyl acrylate (MEA). The adhesion strength of PIEA can increase spontaneously from almost no adhesion to 314 kPa after 12 h without any external preloading due to the dissociation of the borate ester in water, leading to noncovalent interactions between the hydroxyl groups of PIEA and the substrate. Additionally, PIEA can be developed for soft sensors or ion electrodes to enable underwater detection and communication. This strategy offers broad application potential for the development of novel underwater smart adhesives.

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Selective Cell Catcher for Endogenous Stem Cell Recruitment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;stem cell catcher&#8221; system, inspired by gold prospectors in the game &#8220;Gold Miner,&#8221; is a tFNA&#8208;based structure embedded in a hyaluronic acid hydrogel for in vivo recruitment of stem cells in bone injuries. It mimics the process of mining for gold, targeting and capturing cellular gold necessary for craniofacial bone regeneration in challenging microenvironments.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;surface engineering holds great promise in boosting endogenous stem cell attraction for tissue regeneration. However, challenges such as cellular internalization of ligand and the dynamic nature of cell membranes often complicate ligand&#8211;receptor interactions. The aim of this study is to harness the innovative potential of programmable tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (tFNA) to enable precise, tunable ligand&#8211;receptor interactions, thereby improving stem cell recruitment efficiency. This approach involves experimental screening and theoretical analysis using dissipative particle dynamics. The results demonstrate that altering the flexibility and topology of ligands on tFNA changes their cellular internalization and membrane binding efficiency. Furthermore, optimizing the distribution of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)&#8208;binding aptamer 19S (Apt19S) on the tFNA enhances the stem cell capture efficiency. Following successful in vitro MSC capture, Apt19S&#8208;modified tFNA is chemically linked to a hyaluronic acid hydrogel, forming an efficient &#8220;stem cell catcher&#8221; system. Subsequent in vivo experiments demonstrate that this system effectively promotes early stem cell recruitment and accelerates bone regeneration in different bone healing scenarios, including cranial and maxillary defects.

         <title>Intrinsic Out&#8208;Of&#8208;Plane and In&#8208;Plane Ferroelectricity in 2D AgCrS2 with High Curie Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D AgCrS2 with superior ferroelectricity and high Curie temperature are synthesized in large&#8208;scale via chemical vapor deposition growth. The AgCrS2 nanosheet possesses a non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure which endows it with prominent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane ferroelectric properties, and thus realizing the ferroelectric memory application in AgCrS2 devices. This work opens new prospects for exploring 2D ferroelectrics and accompanying various ferroelectric functional devices.








Abstract
2D ferroelectric materials have attracted extensive research interest due to potential applications in nonvolatile memory, nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. However, the available 2D ferroelectric materials are scarce and most of them are limited by the uncontrollable preparation. Herein, a novel 2D ferroelectric material AgCrS2 is reported that are controllably synthesized in large&#8208;scale via salt&#8208;assist chemical vapor deposition growth. By tuning the growth temperature from 800 to 900&#160;&#176;C, the thickness of AgCrS2 nanosheets can be precisely modulated from 2.1 to 40&#160;nm. Structural and nonlinear optical characterizations demonstrate that AgCrS2 nanosheet crystallizes in a non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure with high crystallinity and remarkable air stability. As a result, AgCrS2 of various thicknesses display robust ferroelectric polarization in both in&#8208;plane (IP) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP)&#160;directions with strong intercorrelation and high ferroelectric phase transition temperature (682 K). Theoretical calculations suggest that the ferroelectricity in AgCrS2 originates from the displacement of Ag atoms in AgS4 tetrahedrons, which changes the dipole moment alignment. Moreover, ferroelectric switching is demonstrated in both lateral and vertical AgCrS2 devices, which exhibit exotic nonvolatile memory behavior with distinct high and low resistance states. This study expands the scope of 2D ferroelectric materials and facilitates the ferroelectric&#8208;based nonvolatile memory applications.

Theoretical calculations suggest that the ferroelectricity in AgCrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; originates from the displacement of Ag atoms in AgS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedrons, which changes the dipole moment alignment. Moreover, ferroelectric switching is demonstrated in both lateral and vertical AgCrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; devices, which exhibit exotic nonvolatile memory behavior with distinct high and low resistance states. This study expands the scope of 2D ferroelectric materials and facilitates the ferroelectric-based nonvolatile memory applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Strain&#8208;Defects to Enhance Enzymatic Therapy and Induce Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;defect engineering is used to design a hollow MMSR&#8208;pS&#8208;PEG nanozyme by modifying MnMoOx with poly (ethylene glycol) grafted phosphorylated serine and loading sorafenib. The oxygen defects induce excellent catalase&#8208;like&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like catalytic activities, ensuring the disruption of the internal redox balance in tumor cells. Sorafenib restrains the system xc&#8722; and synergistically interacts with GSH depletion to induce ferroptosis.








Abstract
The effect of mimetic enzyme catalysis is often limited by insufficient activity and a single therapy is not sufficient to meet the application requirements. In this study, a multifunctional nanozyme, MMSR&#8208;pS&#8208;PEG, is designed and fabricated by modifying poly (ethylene glycol) grafted phosphorylated serine (pS&#8208;PEG) on mesoporous hollow MnMoOx spheres, followed by loading sorafenib (SRF) into the pores. Strain engineering&#8208;induced oxygen defects endow the nanozyme with enhanced dual&#8208;enzymatic activity to mimic catalase and oxidase&#8208;like activities, which catalyze the conversion of endogenous H2O2 into oxygen and subsequently into superoxide ions in the acidic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, as an n&#8208;type semiconductor, MnMoOx generates reactive oxygen species by separating electrons and holes upon ultrasonic irradiation and simultaneously deplete glutathione by holes, thereby further augmenting its catalytic effect. As a ferroptosis inducer, SRF restrains the system xc&#8722; and indirectly inhibits glutathione synthesis, synergistically interacting with the nanozyme to stimulate ferroptosis by promoting lipid peroxidation and accumulation and the downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4. These results provide valuable insights into the design of enzymatic therapy with high performance and highlight a promising approach for the synergism of ferroptosis and enzymatic tumor therapy.

         <title>Multiple Defect&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Resolution Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanoluminescent Materials for Non&#8208;Destructive Detection of Blood Glucose and Lipids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical co&#8208;substitution method of [Si4++Mg2+] &#8594; [Ga3++Ga3+] is used to achieve continuous defect distribution. Combined with Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the impact of different defect types on electronic structure is discussed in detail, and the potential application of broadband NIR ML in non&#8208;destructive detection technology is explored.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) materials, known for their ability to convert mechanical energy into light, are increasingly recognized for their potential applications, such as in intelligent stress sensing, in vivo bioimaging, and stress non&#8208;destructive monitoring. However, the low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) and narrow&#8208;band emission of single&#8208;defect&#8208;induced ML materials usually limit their biological&#8208;related practical applications. Here, these limitations will be addressed by modulating the microstructure evolution in Y3Ga3MgSiO12:Cr3+ through the [Si4++Mg2+] &#8594; [Ga3++Ga3+] chemical substitution strategy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals the defect types and dynamic charge migration processes. In addition, Y3Ga3MgSiO12: Cr3+ with continuously distributed &#8220;shallow&#8208;deep&#8221; defects (0.68&#8211;1.61&#160;eV) can avoid persistent luminescence (PersL) and bright&#8208;field environment interference. Herein, such high SNR near&#8208;infrared broadband ML emission may provide a reliable way for high&#8208;quality biological non&#8208;destructive sensing and detection. Finally, benefiting from the different absorption of ML signals in glucose/lipid, one may find a novel non&#8208;invasive blood glucose/lipid testing technology in patients.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Proton Channels Constructed via Hierarchical Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors present proton nanochannels prepared by hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of cyclic peptides with transfer rates closely matching those of natural protein channels while maintaining transport over microns. Proton density is controlled by a counter ion doping effect. The span of proton transport allows for their use in energy solutions, biomedicine, and bioelectronics.









Abstract
The quest to understand and mimic proton translocation mechanisms in natural channels has driven the development of peptide&#8208;based artificial channels facilitating efficient proton transport across nanometric membranes. It is demonstrated here that hierarchical peptide self&#8208;assembly can form micrometers&#8208;long proton nanochannels. The fourfold symmetrical peptide design leverages intermolecular aromatic interactions to align self&#8208;assembled cyclic peptide nanotubes, creating hydrophilic nanochannels between them. Titratable amino acid sidechains are positioned adjacent to each other within the channels, enabling the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded chains upon hydration, and facilitating efficient proton transport. Moreover, these chains are enriched with protons and water molecules by interacting with immobile counter ions introduced into the channels, increasing proton flow density and rate. This system maintains proton transfer rates closely resembling those in natural protein channels over micrometer distances. The functional behavior of these inherently recyclable and biocompatible systems opens the door for their exploitation in diverse applications in energy storage and conversion, biomedicine, and bioelectronics.

         <title>Highly Responsive Polar Vortices in All&#8208;Ferroelectric Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar vortex formation is shown in all&#8208;ferroelectric (PbTiO3)n/(PbxSr1&#8722;xTiO3)n heterostructures wherein the in&#8208;plane polarization of PbxSr1&#8722;xTiO3 provides the required boundary conditions. These superlattices show superior piezoelectric and ferroelectric responses as the polarization in all layers can freely rotate to the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. In the plane, the layers exhibit strong coupling during switching and show multistate switching when heterostructured with ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric blocks.








Abstract
The discovery of polar vortices and skyrmions in ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric superlattices [such as (PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n] has ushered in an era of novel dipolar topologies and corresponding emergent phenomena. The key to creating such emergent features has generally been considered to be related to counterpoising strongly polar and non&#8208;polar materials thus creating the appropriate boundary conditions. This limits the utility these materials can have, however, by rendering (effectively) half of the structure unresponsive to applied stimuli. Here, using advanced thin&#8208;film deposition and an array of characterization and simulation approaches, polar vortices are realized in all&#8208;ferroelectric trilayers, multilayers, and superlattices built from the fundamental building block of (PbTiO3)n/(PbxSr1&#8722;xTiO3)n wherein in&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization in the PbxSr1&#8722;xTiO3 provides the appropriate boundary conditions. These superlattices exhibit substantially enhanced electromechanical and ferroelectric responses in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction that arise from the ability of the polarization in both layers to rotate to the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction under field. In the in&#8208;plane direction, the layers are found to be strongly coupled during switching and when heterostructured with ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric building blocks, it is possible to produce multistate switching. This approach expands the realm of systems supporting emergent dipolar texture formation and does so with entirely ferroelectric materials thus greatly improving their responses.

Here, using advanced thin-film deposition and an array of characterization and simulation approaches, polar vortices are realized in all-ferroelectric trilayers, multilayers, and superlattices built from the fundamental building block of (PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/(Pb&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; wherein in-plane ferroelectric polarization in the Pb&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; provides the appropriate boundary conditions. These superlattices exhibit substantially enhanced electromechanical and ferroelectric responses in the out-of-plane direction that arise from the ability of the polarization in both layers to rotate to the out-of-plane direction under field. In the in-plane direction, the layers are found to be strongly coupled during switching and when heterostructured with ferroelectric-dielectric building blocks, it is possible to produce multistate switching. This approach expands the realm of systems supporting emergent dipolar texture formation and does so with entirely ferroelectric materials thus greatly improving their responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Layered Oxide Cathode Materials with Moderated Interlayer Spacing and Enhanced Kinetics for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy doping strategy is employed to improve structure stability and enhance reaction kinetics of the layered oxide cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The homogeneous stress distribution, moderated interlayer spacing, and suppressed John&#8211;Teller effect of the high&#8208;entropy cathode materials contribute to the improved cycling stability and rate performance.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with low cost and environmentally friendly features have recently attracted significant attention for renewable energy storage. Sodium layer oxides stand out as a type of promising cathode material for SIBs owing to their high capacity, good rate performance, and high compatibility for manufacturing. However, the poor cycling stability of layer oxide cathodes due to structure distortion greatly impacts their practical applications. Herein, a high entropy doped Cu, Fe, and Mn&#8208;based layered oxide (HE&#8208;CFMO), Na0.95Li0.05Mg0.05Cu0.20Fe0.22Mn0.35Ti0.13O2 for high&#8208;performance SIBs, is designed. The HE&#8208;CFMO cathode possesses high&#8208;entropy transition metal (TM) layers with a homogeneous stress distribution, providing a moderated interlayer spacing to maintain the structure stability and enhance Na+ ion diffusion. In addition, Li doping in TM layers increases the Mn valence state, which effectively suppresses John&#8211;Teller effect, thus stabilizing the layered structure during cycling. Furthermore, the use of nontoxic and low&#8208;cost raw materials benefits future commercialization and reduces the risk of environmental pollution. As a result, the HE&#8208;CFMO cathode exhibits a super cycling performance with a 95% capacity retention after 300 cycles. This work provides a promising strategy to improve the structure stability and reaction kinetics of cathode materials for SIBs.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing Guided Multienzymatic Hydrogel Design for Self&#8208;Regenerative Repair in Diabetic Mandibular Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing technology, the crucial role of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in suppressing the repolarization of proinflammatory macrophages to anti&#8208;inflammatory macrophages within the diabetic microenvironment is revealed. Consequently, a multienzymatic hydrogel equipped with dual ROS and NO&#8208;scavenging capabilities is meticulously designed, enabling the mandible to regain its self&#8208;regenerative capacity in the diabetic microenvironment.








Abstract
Conventional bone tissue engineering materials struggle to reinstate physiological bone remodeling in a diabetic context, primarily due to the compromised repolarization of proinflammatory macrophages to anti&#8208;inflammatory macrophages. Here, leveraging single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) technology, the pivotal role of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) is unveiled in impeding macrophage repolarization during physiological bone remodeling amidst diabetes. Guided by scRNA&#8208;seq analysis, we engineer a multienzymatic bone tissue engineering hydrogel scaffold (MEBTHS) composed is engineered of methylpropenylated gelatin hydrogel integrated with ruthenium nanozymes, possessing both Ru0 and Ru4+ components. This design facilitates efficient NO elimination via Ru0 while simultaneously exhibiting ROS scavenging properties through Ru4+. Consequently, MEBTHS orchestrates macrophage reprogramming by neutralizing ROS and reversing NO&#8208;mediated mitochondrial metabolism, thereby rejuvenating bone marrow&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells within diabetic mandibular defects, producing newly formed bone with quality comparable to that of normal bone. The scRNA&#8208;seq guided multienzymatic hydrogel design fosters the restoration of self&#8208;regenerative repair, marking a significant advancement in bone tissue engineering.

         <title>The Combination of a Donor&#8211;Acceptor TADF and a MR&#8208;TADF Emitting Core Results in Outstanding Electroluminescence Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>

The ToC illustrates the molecular structure of DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2 along with a brief overview of the performance of the corresponding OLED. The green and blue&#8208;colored moieties represent the MR&#8208;TADF emitting core and the pendant D&#8211;A TADF shield, respectively.








Abstract
Here the utility and potential of an emitter design are demonstrated, consisting of a narrowband&#8208;emitting multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) core that is decorated with a suitably higher energy donor&#8208;acceptor TADF moiety. Not only does this D&#8211;A TADF group offer additional channels for triplet exciton harvesting and confers faster reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) kinetics but it also acts as a steric shield, insulating the emissive MR&#8208;TADF core from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Two emitters, DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT1 and DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2, demonstrate enhanced photophysical properties leading to outstanding performance of the organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2, containing a D&#8211;A TADF moiety, has a faster kRISC (1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1) and higher photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL: 97%) compared to DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT1 (0.2&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1, &#934;PL: 90%), which contains a D&#8211;A moiety that itself is not TADF. The sensitizer&#8208;free OLEDs with DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2 achieve a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 40.2% and showed milder efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000 of 20.7%) compared to the DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT1&#8208;based devices (EQEmax of 37.1% and EQE1000 of 11.9%).

         <title>Interstitial Oxygen Acts as Electronic Buffer Stabilizing High&#8208;Entropy Alloys for Trifunctional Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>

The Cr element with strong oxygen affinity can introduce oxygen atoms into the high&#8208;entropy alloy system. Interstitial oxygen acts as an electronic buffer making the binding energy of other metal elements move to a higher level and increasing vacancy formation energies of metal active sites leading to super stability.








Abstract
Understanding the effect of elements&#8217; oxygen affinity is essential for comprehending high&#8208;entropy alloys&#8217; (HEAs) complete properties. However, the origin of HEAs' oxygen&#8208;containing structure and stability remains poorly understood, primarily due to their diverse components, hindering synthesis and analysis. Herein, the O&#8208;doping HEAs (HEA&#8208;O) have demonstrated outstanding performance and stability in electrolyzed water and Zinc&#8211;air batteries which can be reassembled after being stable for more than 1600&#160;h when the zinc consumption is over. The experiment and DFT simulation demonstrate that Cr with strong oxygen affinity can introduce more oxygen into the system of HEAs. Consequently, interstitial oxygens act as electronic buffers making the binding energy of other metal elements move to a higher level. Additionally, O&#8208;doping lowers the d&#8208;band center promoting electrochemical activity and increasing vacancy formation energies of metal active sites leading to super stability. The study provides significant insights into the design and comprehension of interstitial oxygen&#8208;doped HEAs.

Interstitial oxygen acts as an electronic buffer making the binding energy of other metal elements move to a higher level and increasing vacancy formation energies of metal active sites leading to super stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the effect of elements&#8217; oxygen affinity is essential for comprehending high-entropy alloys&#8217; (HEAs) complete properties. However, the origin of HEAs' oxygen-containing structure and stability remains poorly understood, primarily due to their diverse components, hindering synthesis and analysis. Herein, the O-doping HEAs (HEA-O) have demonstrated outstanding performance and stability in electrolyzed water and Zinc&#8211;air batteries which can be reassembled after being stable for more than 1600&#160;h when the zinc consumption is over. The experiment and DFT simulation demonstrate that Cr with strong oxygen affinity can introduce more oxygen into the system of HEAs. Consequently, interstitial oxygens act as electronic buffers making the binding energy of other metal elements move to a higher level. Additionally, O-doping lowers the d-band center promoting electrochemical activity and increasing vacancy formation energies of metal active sites leading to super stability. The study provides significant insights into the design and comprehension of interstitial oxygen-doped HEAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azatriangulene&#8208;Based Conductive C&#9552;C Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Near&#8208;Infrared Emission</title>

Knoevenagel condensation of an electron&#8208;rich azatriangulenetricarbaldehyde with arenediacetonitriles produces 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers as crystalline porous Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs). The donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in these polymers lead to a low optical bandgap (1.6&#160;eV) and near&#8208;infrared emission (&gt;750 nm). p&#8208;Doping with magic blue increases the electrical conductivity of the COFs by 8 orders of magnitude, reaching the value of 0.65&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Two near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) pTANG1 and pTANG2 are synthesized using Knoevenagel condensation of trioxaazatriangulenetricarbaldehyde (TATANG) with benzene&#8208; and biphenyldiacetonitriles, respectively. The morphology of the COFs is affected by the size of TATANG precursor crystals. Donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in these COFs result in small bandgaps (&#8776;1.6&#160;eV) and NIR emission (&#955;max = 789 nm for pTANG1). pTANG1 can absorb up to 9 molecules of water per unit cell, which is accompanied by a marked quenching of the NIR emission, suggesting applications as humidity sensors. p&#8208;Doping with magic blue significantly increases the electrical conductivities of the COFs by up to 8 orders of magnitude, with the room temperature conductivity of pTANG1 reaching 0.65&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, the highest among reported C&#9552;C linked COFs. 1H NMR relaxometry, temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence spectroscopy, and DFT calculations reveal that the higher rigidity of the shorter phenylene linker is responsible for the more extended conjugation (red&#8208;shifted emission, higher electrical conductivity) of pTANG1 compared to pTANG2.

2D Ferroelectric Memory
In article number 2407655, Hua Xu and coworkers present a novel 2D ferroelectric material AgCrS2 synthesized by chemical vapor deposition growth. The 2D AgCrS2 crystal displays robust ferroelectric polarization in both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane directions with strong intercorrelation and high Curie temperature (682 K). Consequently, the 2D AgCrS2 crystal is successfully utilized to construct ferroelectric memory device, demonstrating significant potential for advancing the development of future artificial intelligence (AI).

More details can be found in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202404514"&gt;2404514&lt;/a&gt; by Daniel Razansky, Metin Sitti, and co-workers.

Endogenous Stem Cell Recruitment
Using the precise programmability of tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNA), Yunfeng Lin, Taoran Tian, and co&#8208;workers introduce a novel strategy for endogenous stem cell enrichment. This strategy employs the MSC&#8208;targeting aptamer Apt19S, optimizing its distribution and topology on tFNA to address challenges like cellular internalization and low affinity, thereby improving MSC binding and capture efficiency. This acellular, regenerative platform holds great potential for various clinical applications in tissue regeneration. More details can be found in article number 2406118.

         <title>All&#8208;Aqueous Embedded 3D Printing for Freeform Fabrication of Biomimetic 3D Constructs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent progress in freeform fabrication of 3D biomimetic constructs via all&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing. The fundamental properties of all&#8208;aqueous system, the key influences on printing stability and shape fidelity of biomimetic constructs as well as biomimetic applications are thoroughly discussed, offering insights and future research directions in this field.








Abstract
All&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing, which involves extruding inks in an aqueous bath, has emerged as a transformative platform for the freeform fabrication of 3D constructs with precise control. The use of a supporting bath not only enables the printing of arbitrarily designed 3D constructs but also broadens ink selection for various soft matters, advancing the wide application of this technology. This review focuses on recent progress in the freeform preparation of 3D constructs using all&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing. It begins by discussing the significance of ultralow interfacial tension in all&#8208;liquid embedded printing and highlights the fundamental concepts and properties of all&#8208;aqueous system. The review then introduces recent advances in all&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing and clarifies the key factors affecting printing stability and shape fidelity, aiming to guide expansion and assessment of emerging printing systems used for various representative applications. Furthermore, it proposes the potential scope and applications of this technology, including in vitro models, cytomimetic microreactors, and soft ionic electronics. Finally, the review discusses the challenges facing current all&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing and offers future perspectives on possible improvements and developments.

         <title>Charge Generation and Enhancement of Key Components of Triboelectric Nanogenerators: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review classifies and summarizes innovative approaches to enhance the charge density of charge generation, charge trapping, and charge collection layers. The milestone of high charge density TENG is reviewed based on material selection and innovative mechanisms.








Abstract
The past decade has witnessed remarkable progress in high&#8208;performance Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) with the design and synthesis of functional dielectric materials, the exploration of novel dynamic charge transport mechanisms, and the innovative design of architecture, making it one of the most crucial technologies for energy harvesting. High output charge density is fundamental for TENG to expand its application scope and accelerate industrialization; it depends on the dynamic equilibrium of charge generation, trapping, de&#8208;trapping, and migration within its core components. Here, this review classifies and summarizes innovative approaches to enhance the charge density of the charge generation, charge trapping, and charge collection layers. The milestone of high charge density TENG is reviewed based on material selection and innovative mechanisms. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art principles and techniques for generating high charge density and suppressing charge decay are discussed and highlighted in detail, and the distinct charge transport mechanisms, the technologies of advanced materials preparation, and the effective charge excitation strategy are emphatically introduced. Lastly, the bottleneck and future research priorities for boosting the output charge density are summarized. A summary of these cutting&#8208;edge developments intends to provide readers with a deep understanding of the future design of high&#8208;output TENG.

         <title>Engineering of Single&#8208;Atomic Sites for Electro&#8208; and Photo&#8208;Catalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically discusses recent advancements in metal and nonmetal single&#8208;atom sites for the electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 via the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction and water oxidation reaction pathways. Comprehensive discussions cover the influence of local physicochemical environments on the electronic structures and catalytic behaviors of isolated sites, the atomic catalytic mechanisms underlying these pathways for H2O2 production, and recent applications of H2O2 in advanced chemical transformations.








Abstract
Direct electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 through the 2e&#8722; O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and H2O oxidation reaction (WOR) offer promising alternatives for on&#8208;demand and on&#8208;site production of this chemical. Exploring robust and selective active sites is crucial for enhancing H2O2 production through these pathways. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), featuring isolated active sites on supports, possess attractive properties for promoting catalysis and unraveling catalytic mechanisms. This review first systematically summarizes significant advancements in atomic engineering of both metal and nonmetal single&#8208;atom sites for electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;catalytic 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2, as well as the dynamic behaviors of active sites during catalytic processes. Next, the progress of single&#8208;atom sites in H2O2 production through 2e&#8722; WOR is overviewed. The effects of the local physicochemical environments on the electronic structures and catalytic behaviors of isolated sites, along with the atomic catalytic mechanism involved in these H2O2 production pathways, are discussed in detail. This work also discusses the recent applications of H2O2 in advanced chemical transformations. Finally, a perspective on the development of single&#8208;atom catalysis is highlighted, aiming to provide insights into future research on SACs for electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 and other advanced catalytic applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the integration of omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, with nanomedicine for cancer therapy. Leveraging advanced next&#8208;generation sequencing techniques, it explores how these synergistic approaches enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize therapeutic strategies, and assess nanomedicine&#8208;mediated biological responses, offering insights into future development in personalized cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer nanomedicine has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the limitations of conventional cancer therapies, offering enhanced efficacy and safety in cancer management. However, the inherent heterogeneity of tumors presents increasing challenges for the application of cancer nanomedicine in both diagnosis and treatment. This heterogeneity necessitates the integration of advanced and high&#8208;throughput analytical techniques to tailor nanomedicine strategies to individual tumor profiles. Omics technologies, encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and more, provide unparalleled insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cancer. By dissecting tumor heterogeneity across multiple levels, these technologies offer robust support for the development of personalized and precise cancer nanomedicine strategies. In this review, the principles, techniques, and applications of key omics technologies are summarized. Especially, the synergistic integration of omics and nanomedicine in cancer therapy is explored, focusing on enhanced diagnostic accuracy, optimized therapeutic strategies and the assessment of nanomedicine&#8208;mediated biological responses. Moreover, this review addresses current challenges and outlines future directions in the field of omics&#8208;enhanced nanomedicine. By offering valuable insights and guidance, this review aims to advance the integration of omics with nanomedicine, ultimately driving improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cancer.

         <title>Atom Probe Tomography: a Local Probe for Chemical Bonds in Solids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallic, covalent, and metavalent solids can clearly be distinguished based on their bond bond&#8208;breaking behavior, i.e. their probability of multiple events (PME) and probability of molecular ions (PMI) values. These findings open new avenues in understanding and designing advanced materials since they allow quantification of bonds in solids on a nanometer scale.








Abstract
Atom probe tomography is frequently employed to characterize the elemental distribution in solids with atomic resolution. Here the potential of this technique to locally probe chemical bonds is reviewed and discussed. Two processes characterize the bond rupture in laser&#8208;assisted field emission, the probability of molecular ions (PMI), i.e., the probability that molecular ions are evaporated instead of single (atomic) ions, and the probability of multiple events (PME), i.e., the correlated field&#8208;evaporation of more than a single fragment upon laser&#8208; or voltage pulse excitation. Here it is demonstrated that one can clearly distinguish solids with metallic, covalent, and metavalent bonds based on their bond rupture, i.e., their PME and PMI values. These findings open new avenues in understanding and designing advanced materials, since they allow a quantification of bonds in solids on a nanometer scale, as will be shown for several examples. These possibilities would even justify calling the present approach bonding probe tomography (BPT).

         <title>In&#8208;situ Reconstruction of Catalyst in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ reconstruction of the catalyst may lead to an uncontrollable catalytic process. This review summarizes the strategies for achieving targeted reconstruction via various methods, such as structural design, composition engineering, electrolyte selection, and control of electrocatalytic conditions for optimal catalytic performance in electrocatalysis. In addition, the challenging issues and perspectives are given for rationally designing pre&#8208;catalysts.








Abstract
Reconstruction of catalysts is now well recognized as a common phenomenon in electrocatalysis. As the reconstructed structure may promote or hamper the electrochemical performance, how to achieve the designed active surface for highly enhanced catalytic activity through the reconstruction needs to be carefully investigated. In this review, the genesis and electrochemical effects of reconstruction in various electrochemical catalytic processes, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) are first described. Then, the strategies for optimizing the reconstruction, such as valence states control, active phase retention, phase evolution engineering, and surface poisoning prevention are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the general rules of reconstruction optimization are summarized and give perspectives for future study. It is believed that the review shall provide deep insights into electrocatalytic mechanisms and guide the design of pre&#8208;catalysts with highly improved activity.

Then, the strategies for optimizing the reconstruction, such as valence states control, active phase retention, phase evolution engineering, and surface poisoning prevention are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the general rules of reconstruction optimization are summarized and give perspectives for future study. It is believed that the review shall provide deep insights into electrocatalytic mechanisms and guide the design of pre-catalysts with highly improved activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge Carrier Density in Organic Semiconductors Modulates the Effective Capacitance: A Unified View of Electrolyte Gated Organic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A framework for electrolyte gated organic transistors (EGOTs) that unifies electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) with organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is proposed. The effective capacitance that drives the device response arises from in series capacitances of device interfaces and the chemical capacitance of the organic semiconductor. The model predicts the shape of the transfer curve of EGOTs (p&#8208;/n&#8208;type and ambipolar).








Abstract
A framework for electrolyte&#8208;gated organic transistors (EGOTs) that unifies the view of interfacial capacitive coupling of electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) with the volumetric capacitive coupling in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is proposed. The EGOT effective capacitance arises from in&#8208;series capacitances of the electrolyte/gate electrode and electrolyte/channel interfaces, and the chemical capacitance of the organic semiconductor channel whose weight with respect to the interfacial capacitance is modulated by the charge carrier density, hence by the gate voltage. The expression for chemical capacitance is derived from the DOS of the organic semiconductor, which it is assumed to exhibit exponential energy disorder in the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. The analytical expression of the EGOT current is assessed on experimental data and shown to accurately predict the shape of the whole transfer curve of an EGOT thus allowing to extract accurate values for the switch&#8208;on voltage and the interfacial transconductance, without assumptions on specific response regime and, in OECT, without invoking the volumetric capacitance. Interestingly, the EGOT model recovers EGOFET and OECT as limit cases and, in the latter case, explicitly represents the volumetric capacitance in terms of the energy disorder and the bandgap of the organic semiconductor.

         <title>Scanning Acousto&#8208;Optoelectric Spectroscopy on a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy and surface acoustic waves provide a powerful tool for investigating charge carrier dynamics in 2D materials. When interacting with the 2D semiconductor WSe2, dynamic acoustic Poole&#8211;Frenkel activation of traps enhances the optical emission efficiency. The sub&#8208;nanosecond modulation of the optical signal serves as a sensitive local probe of defects and charge carrier trapping sites.








Abstract
The charge carrier dynamics are investigated by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) inside a WSe2 monolayer on LiNbO3 by scanning acousto&#8208;optoelectric spectroscopy. A strong enhancement of the PL emission intensity is observed almost over the entire area of the flake. This enhancement increases with increasing amplitude of the wave and is especially strong at or in the vicinity to defects. The latter is attributed to the SAW&#8208;driven Poole&#8211;Frenkel activation of trapped charge carriers bound to trapping sites at these defects. In addition, the PL intensity exhibit clear periodic modulations at the SAW's frequency&#160;fSAW and at 2 fSAW. These modulations are clear and unambiguous fingerprints of spatio&#8208;temporal carrier dynamics driven by the SAW. These occur on sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales which are found in good agreement with calculated exciton dissociation times. Mapping and analyzing both effects, this study shows that scanning acousto&#8208;electric spectroscopy provides a highly sensitive and local contact&#8208;free probe which uncovers distinct local features not resolved by conventional quasi&#8208;static photoluminescence techniques. The method is ideally suited to study carrier transport in 2D and other types of nanoscale materials and to reveal dynamic exciton modulation, and carrier localization and activation dynamics in the technologically important megahertz to gigahertz frequency range.

         <title>Selective Control of Electric Charge of Weyl Fermions in Pyrochlore Iridates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous studies about Weyl fermions have mostly focused on the magnetic charges, while the electric charges are rarely explored. This work reports an intriguing linear scaling relationship between the anomalous Hall conductivity and Hall carrier density in strained Nd2Ir2O7 thin films, which points to the essential role of correlation between magnetic and electric charges in Weyl fermions.








Abstract
Weyl fermions can exhibit exotic phenomena due to their magnetic charge in momentum space, while Weyl nodes are usually located away from Fermi energy, which forms electron or hole pockets as the electric charges. Previous studies have mostly focused on the magnetic charge, however, the electric charges are rarely explored. Here, the intriguing Hall responses arising from the interplay between magnetic and electric charges of Weyl fermions in pyrochlore iridates are reported. Explicitly, unexpected linear scaling is observed between the anomalous Hall conductivity and Hall carrier density in strained Nd2Ir2O7 thin films, and its slope shows a sign change approaching the N&#233;el temperature of Nd. Theoretical calculations unveil that the cluster magnetic multipoles induce local energy inversion of Weyl nodes, which alters the electric charge of Weyl fermions and accounts for the observed nontrivial Hall responses. Moreover, the correlation between the magnetic and electric charges is further probed by voltage&#8208;controlled hydrogenation, which leads to the suppression of the anomalous Hall effect through electron filling. This work not only reveals the essential role of the both magnetic and electric charges of Weyl fermions, but also demonstrates the hydrogenation as an effective tuning knob in exploring correlated topological properties.

         <title>Measurement of Enhanced Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling Strength for Donor&#8208;Bound Electron Spins in Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant enhancement in spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) within multi&#8208;donor silicon quantum dots is demonstrated, showing SOC strengths up to 40 &#181;eV, surpassing previous benchmarks by two orders of magnitude. This advancement paves the way for precise all&#8208;electrical control of donor&#8208;bound spins and improved coupling to superconducting resonators, marking a crucial step forward in quantum computing.








Abstract
While traditionally considered a deleterious effect in quantum dot spin qubits, the spin&#8208;orbit interaction is recently being revisited as it allows for rapid coherent control by on&#8208;chip AC electric fields. For electrons in bulk silicon, spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) is intrinsically weak, however, it can be enhanced at surfaces and interfaces, or through atomic placement. Here it is showed that the strength of the spin&#8208;orbit coupling can be locally enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude in the manybody wave functions of multi&#8208;donor quantum dots compared to a single donor, reaching strengths so far only reported for holes or two&#8208;donor system with certain symmetry. These findings may provide a pathway toward all&#8208;electrical control of donor&#8208;bound spins in silicon using electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR).

         <title>Atomic Dispersed Co on NC@Cu Core&#8208;Shells for Solar Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell photocatalyst comprising atomic&#8208;dispersed Co and plasmonic Cu nanoparticles is developed for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production from seawater. This photocatalyst achieves strong synergy between the reaction environment, broad light absorption, plasmonic electric field, and active atomic sites, thereby enabling optimal seawater hydrogen production through redox reactions.








Abstract
With freshwater resources becoming increasingly scarce, the photocatalytic seawater splitting for hydrogen production has garnered widespread attention. In this study, a novel photocatalyst consisting of a Cu core coated is introduced with N&#8208;doped C and decorated with single Co atoms (Co&#8208;NC@Cu) for solar to hydrogen production from seawater.

&lt;p&gt;A core-shell photocatalyst comprising atomic-dispersed Co and plasmonic Cu nanoparticles is developed for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production from seawater. This photocatalyst achieves strong synergy between the reaction environment, broad light absorption, plasmonic electric field, and active atomic sites, thereby enabling optimal seawater hydrogen production through redox reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With freshwater resources becoming increasingly scarce, the photocatalytic seawater splitting for hydrogen production has garnered widespread attention. In this study, a novel photocatalyst consisting of a Cu core coated is introduced with N-doped C and decorated with single Co atoms (Co-NC@Cu) for solar to hydrogen production from seawater. This catalyst, without using noble metals or sacrificial agents, demonstrates superior hydrogen production effficiency of 9080 &#181;molg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e., 4.78% solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, and exceptional long-term stability, operating over 340&#160;h continuously. The superior performance is attributed to several key factors. First, the focus-light induced photothermal effect enhances redox reaction capabilities, while the salt-ions enabled charge polarization around catalyst surfaces extends charge carrier lifetime. Furthermore, the Co&#9472;NC@Cu exhibits excellent broad light absorption, promoting photoexcited charge production. Theoretical calculations reveal that Co&#9472;NC acts as the active site, showing low energy barriers for reduction reactions. Additionally, the formation of a strong surface electric field from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Cu nanoparticles further reduces energy barriers for redox reactions, improving seawater splitting activity.

         <title>A Strategy Involving Microporous Microneedles Integrated with CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Macrophages for Scar Management by Regulating Fibrotic Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;macrophages (CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms) capable of targeting DPP4+ fibroblasts and modulating ECs subtype within the scar microenvironment are engineered to effectively prevent scarring. Hydrogel microporous microneedles (mMNs) are employed to deliver CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, which can effectively alleviate scar. The study demonstrates that mMNs attached to CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms may exert vital influences on skin scarring, providing a promising approach for treating posttraumatic scarring.








Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) positive fibroblasts play a pivotal role in scar development following skin injury. Heterogeneous vascular endothelial cells (ECs) within scarred areas retain the capacity to drive tissue regeneration and repair. Simultaneously, TREM2 macrophages play a crucial role in the progression and resolution of fibrosis by engaging in mutual regulation with ECs. However, effective strategies to inhibit scar formation through multi&#8208;factor regulation of the scar microenvironment remain a challenge. Here, CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;macrophages (CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms) capable of targeting DPP4+ fibroblasts and modulating ECs subtype within the scar microenvironment are engineered to effectively prevent scarring. Hydrogel microporous microneedles (mMNs) are employed to deliver CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, which can effectively alleviate scar. Single&#8208;cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) analysis reveals that CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms can modify ECs fibrotic phenotype and regulate fibrosis by suppressing the profibrotic gene leucine&#8208;rich&#8208;alpha&#8208;2&#8208;glycoprotein 1 (Lrg1). In vitro experiments further demonstrate that CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms improve the scar microenvironment by phagocytosing DPP4+ fibroblasts and suppressing TGF&#946; secretion. This, in turn, inhibits the phenotypic conversion of LRG1 ECs and provides multifactorial way of alleviating scars. This study uncovers the evidence that mMNs attached to CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms may exert vital influences on skin scarring through the regulation of the skin scar microenvironment, providing a promising approach for treating posttraumatic scarring.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Healing, Flowable, Yet Solid Electrolyte Suppresses Li&#8208;Metal Morphological Instabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries encounter challenges including dendrite penetration, electrode&#8211;electrolyte delamination, and void/crack formation. Here, by deploying a novel composite electrolyte system comprising nonconstrained ceramics within dynamic polymers, self&#8208;healing capability, flowability, and solid properties are successfully integrated into one material. Utilizing this electrolyte, the Li0&#8208;NMC811 full cell demonstrates stable operation at high current density (5 mA cm&#8722;2) for 1100 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal (Li0) solid&#8208;state batteries encounter implementation challenges due to dendrite formation, side reactions, and movement of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface in cycling. Notably, voids and cracks formed during battery fabrication/operation are hot spots for failure. Here, a self&#8208;healing, flowable yet solid electrolyte composed of mobile ceramic crystals embedded in a reconfigurable polymer network is reported. This electrolyte can auto&#8208;repair voids and cracks through a two&#8208;step self&#8208;healing process that occurs at a fast rate of 5.6&#160;&#181;m h&#8722;1. A dynamical phase diagram is generated, showing the material can switch between liquid and solid forms in response to external strain rates. The flowability of the electrolyte allows it to accommodate the electrode volume change during Li0 stripping. Simultaneously, the electrolyte maintains a solid form with high tensile strength (0.28&#160;MPa), facilitating the regulation of mossy Li0 deposition. The chemistries and kinetics are studied by operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Solid&#8208;state NMR reveals a dual&#8208;phase ion conduction pathway and rapid Li+ diffusion through the stable polymer&#8208;ceramic interphase. This designed electrolyte exhibits extended cycling life in Li0&#8211;Li0 cells, reaching 12&#160;000 h at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5000 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, owing to its high critical current density of 9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the Li0&#8211;LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) full cell demonstrates stable cycling at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1100 cycles, retaining 88% of its capacity, even under near&#8208;zero stack pressure conditions.

         <title>Pulling the Rug Out from Under: Biomechanical Microenvironment Remodeling for Induction of Hepatic Stellate Cell Quiescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In HSCs, PPNH&#8208;LQs trigger ascorbic acid oxidation and LOXL2 expression inhibition (Gear I). These effects impair processes of collagen I hydroxylation and enzyme&#8208;mediated crosslinking, leading to the impeded deposition and crosslinking of collagen I (Gear II). Consequently, the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment can be remodeled and subsequently induce HSC quiescence, which facilitates the reversal of hepatic fibrosis (Gear III).








Abstract
Hepatic fibrosis progresses concomitantly with a variety of biomechanical alternations, especially increased liver stiffness. These biomechanical alterations have long been considered as pathological consequences. Recently, growing evidence proposes that these alternations result in the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment, which drives the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Here, an inorganic ascorbic acid&#8208;oxidase (AAO) mimicking nanozyme loaded with liquiritigenin (LQ) is developed to trigger remodeling of the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment. The AAO mimicking nanozyme is able to consume intracellular ascorbic acid, thereby impeding collagen I deposition by reducing its availability. Simultaneously, LQ inhibits the transcription of lysyl oxidase like 2 (LOXL2), thus impeding collagen I crosslinking. Through its synergistic activities, the prepared nanosystem efficiently restores the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment to a near&#8208;normal physiological condition, promoting the quiescence of HSCs and regression of fibrosis. This strategy of remodeling the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment, akin to &#8220;pulling the rug out from under&#8221;, effectively treats hepatic fibrosis in mice, thereby highlighting the importance of tissue biomechanics and providing a potential approach to improve hepatic fibrosis treatment.

3D&#8208;printed soft multifunctional composites enhance thermoelectric energy conversion by 70%. These stretchable thermoelectric generators exhibit exceptional structural robustness and damage tolerance, with 230% stretchability and functionality maintained even after being damaged by sharp objects and strained for thousands of cycles. Their 3D architecture also enables sufficient energy harvesting from body heat to power LEDs and wearable sensors at room temperature.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric devices (TEDs) exhibit adaptability to curved surfaces, holding significant potential for small&#8208;scale power generation and thermal management. However, they often compromise stretchability, energy conversion, or robustness, thus limiting their applications. Here, the implementation of 3D soft architectures, multifunctional composites, self&#8208;healing liquid metal conductors, and rigid semiconductors is introduced to overcome these challenges. These TEDs are extremely stretchable, functioning at strain levels as high as 230%. Their unique design, verified through multiphysics simulations, results in a considerably high power density of 115.4&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8315;2 at a low&#8208;temperature gradient of 10&#160;&#176;C. This is achieved through 3D printing multifunctional elastomers and examining the effects of three distinct thermal insulation infill ratios (0%, 12%, and 100%) on thermoelectric energy conversion and structural integrity. The engineered structure is lighter and effectively maintains the temperature gradient across the thermoelectric semiconductors, thereby resulting in higher output voltage and improved heating and cooling performance. Furthermore, these thermoelectric generators show remarkable damage tolerance, remaining fully functional even after multiple punctures and 2000 stretching cycles at 50% strain. When integrated with a 3D&#8208;printed heatsink, they can power wearable sensors, charge batteries, and illuminate LEDs by scavenging body heat at room temperature, demonstrating their application as self&#8208;sustainable electronics.

         <title>Triggering Reversible Intercalation&#8208;Conversion Combined Chemistry for High&#8208;Energy&#8211;Density Lithium Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing both intercalation and conversion mechanisms within a single phase represents an optimal approach for achieving high energy density in cathode materials. For the purposes of reversible operation and achieving a high redox voltage, the amorphization process is proposed as a strategic design method for cathode materials. The influence of amorphization on electrode materials is meticulously confirmed in thermodynamics and kinetics.








Abstract
Combining intercalation and conversion reactions maximizes the utilization of redox&#8208;active elements in electrodes, providing a means for overcoming the current capacity ceiling. However, integrating both mechanisms within a single electrode material presents significant challenges owing to their contrasting structural requirements. Intercalation requires a well&#8208;defined host structure for efficient lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, whereas conversion reactions entail structural reorganization, which can undermine intercalation capabilities. Based on the previous study that successfully demonstrated reversible intercalation&#8211;conversion chemistry in amorphous LiFeSO4F, this study aims to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding on how this can be enabled. Experimental and theoretical investigations of a model system based on tavorite&#8208;structured LiFeSO4F revealed that amorphization governs the activation and reversibility of the combined reactions. Enhanced reversibility is achieved through the facile migration of transition metals within the amorphous matrix. Unexpectedly, it is found that amorphization also narrowed the voltage gap between the intercalation and conversion reactions. This voltage&#8208;gap reduction is explained by the thermodynamic metastability of the amorphous phase. The applicability of the approach to other intercalation hosts is further demonstrated, showing that amorphization enables reversible intercalation and conversion. These findings suggest a new strategy that leverages the full potential of intercalation and conversion reactions, introducing new avenues for cathode design.

         <title>Unlocking Intracellular Protein Delivery by Harnessing Polymersomes Synthesized at Microliter Volumes using Photo&#8208;PISA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins is challenging due to poor cell membrane permeation and endolysosomal entrapment. An oxygen tolerant Photo&#8208;PISA process is reported for the microliter&#8208;scale synthesis of polymersomes that deliver proteins into the cytosol and activate antigen&#8208;presenting cells. This high throughput approach is a highly promising strategy for the screening of early&#8208;stage therapeutic proteins and vaccine antigen candidates.








Abstract
Efficient delivery of therapeutic proteins and vaccine antigens to intracellular targets is challenging due to generally poor cell membrane permeation and endolysosomal entrapment causing degradation. Herein, these challenges are addressed by developing an oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoinitiated polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (Photo&#8208;PISA) process, allowing for the microliter&#8208;scale (10&#160;&#181;L) synthesis of protein&#8208;loaded polymersomes directly in 1536&#8208;well plates. High&#8208;resolution techniques capable of analysis at a single particle level are employed to analyze protein encapsulation and release mechanisms. Using confocal microscopy and super&#8208;resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) imaging, their ability to deliver proteins into the cytosol following endosomal escape is subsequently visualized. Lastly, the adaptability of these polymersomes is exploited to encapsulate and deliver a prototype vaccine antigen, demonstrating its ability to activate antigen&#8208;presenting cells and support antigen cross&#8208;presentation for applications in subunit vaccines and cancer immunotherapy. This combination of ultralow volume synthesis and efficient intracellular delivery holds significant promise for unlocking the high throughput screening of a broad range of otherwise cost&#8208;prohibitive or early&#8208;stage therapeutic protein and vaccine antigen candidates that can be difficult to obtain in large quantities. The versatility of this platform for rapid screening of intracellular protein delivery can result in significant advancements across the fields of nanomedicine and biomedical engineering.

         <title>Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte in Li&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Reduction for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates LHCE (localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte) as an effective electrolyte engineering strategy to enhance the efficiency of the Li&#8208;NRR process.








Abstract
The lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (Li&#8208;NRR) is a promising green alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ammonia synthesis. The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for high efficiency and stability, as it regulates reactant diffusion and suppresses side reactions. The SEI properties are greatly influenced by the Li+ ion solvation structure, which is controllable through electrolyte engineering. Although anion&#8208;derived SEI enhances selectivity and stability, it has typically been engineered using high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (HCEs), which face mass transfer, viscosity, and cost issues. In this study, a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) in the Li&#8208;NRR is first introduced, enabling the formation of anion&#8208;derived SEI in a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LCE) by enhancing the Li&#8211;anion coordination using an antisolvent. Among various antisolvents, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) achieves the highest ammonia Faradaic efficiency (73.6 &#177; 2.5%), more than double that of the LCE (34.3 &#177; 2.8%) and exceeding the HCE (56.0 &#177; 2.8%). Systematic calculations and experimental analyses show that the LHCE exhibits anion&#8208;rich solvation structures and forms&#160;thin, inorganic SEI. Moreover, the LHCE has advantages of low viscosity and high N2 solubility, which facilitate mass transport. This study suggests the application of LHCE as an effective electrolyte engineering strategy to enhance the Li&#8208;NRR efficiency.

         <title>Strong Silkworm Silk Fibers through CNT&#8208;Feeding and Forced Reeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural silkworm silk exhibiting strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa, on par with spider silk, has been developed through the integration of carbon nanotube feeding and in situ forced reeling. This method significantly enhances the &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystal content and alignment within silk, resulting in notable mechanical improvements. This work presents a scalable and eco&#8208;friendly approach for producing high&#8208;strength natural fibers.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance silk fibers, with their eco&#8208;friendly degradability and renewability, have long captivated researchers as an alternative to synthetic fibers. Spider dragline silk, renowned for its exceptional strength (&gt;1 GPa), has an extremely low yield, hindering its widespread use. While domesticated silkworms (Bombyx mori) can produce silk fibers industrially, their moderate strength (&#8776;0.5 GPa) pales in comparison to the formidable spider dragline silk. In this study, naturally produced strong silkworm silk fibers are reported with a tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa achieved through combining feeding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to silkworms and in situ forced reeling for alignment. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the interaction between the CNTs and silk fibroin, while the forced reeling process aligns these reinforcing fillers and the silk fibroin &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystals along the fiber axis. Structural analysis reveals a significant enhancement in the content and alignment of &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystals within the silk fibers, accounting for their superior mechanical properties, including tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa and Young's modulus of 24.4 GPa, surpassing various types of silkworm silk and spider silk. This advancement addresses the historical trade&#8208;off between the strength and scalability of silk, potentially paving the way for eco&#8208;friendly, biodegradable, and renewable alternatives to synthetic fibers in a variety of applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-performance silk fibers, with their eco-friendly degradability and renewability, have long captivated researchers as an alternative to synthetic fibers. Spider dragline silk, renowned for its exceptional strength (&amp;gt;1 GPa), has an extremely low yield, hindering its widespread use. While domesticated silkworms (&lt;i&gt;Bombyx mori&lt;/i&gt;) can produce silk fibers industrially, their moderate strength (&#8776;0.5 GPa) pales in comparison to the formidable spider dragline silk. In this study, naturally produced strong silkworm silk fibers are reported with a tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa achieved through combining feeding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to silkworms and in situ forced reeling for alignment. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the interaction between the CNTs and silk fibroin, while the forced reeling process aligns these reinforcing fillers and the silk fibroin &#946;-sheet nanocrystals along the fiber axis. Structural analysis reveals a significant enhancement in the content and alignment of &#946;-sheet nanocrystals within the silk fibers, accounting for their superior mechanical properties, including tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa and Young's modulus of 24.4 GPa, surpassing various types of silkworm silk and spider silk. This advancement addresses the historical trade-off between the strength and scalability of silk, potentially paving the way for eco-friendly, biodegradable, and renewable alternatives to synthetic fibers in a variety of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Electroluminescence from Organic Fluorophore&#8208;Containing Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In light&#8208;emitting diodes using an organic fluorophore&#8208;containing 2D perovskite as the emitter, carrier transport, and exciton formation take place in the metal halide sheets. Then, the bright triplet excitons formed in the metal halide sheets are transferred to singlet states of the organic fluorophores. With these processes, efficient electroluminescence is observed from the organic fluorophores inside the perovskite.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional perovskites containing an organic fluorophore can be a unique emitter for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of fluorophore&#8208;containing perovskite LEDs reported thus far are still very low. In this study, these are able to boost the EQE to &#8776;10% by choosing an organic fluorophore with appropriate energy levels for the perovskite structure organization. In the fluorophore&#8208;containing perovskite LEDs, carrier transport and exciton formation take place in the perovskite's metal halide framework, thereby avoiding the direct formation of nonradiative triplet excitons on the organic fluorophores. Subsequently, the bright triplet excitons formed in the metal halide framework are transferred to form the radiative singlet states of the organic fluorophores, leading to efficient electroluminescence (EL) from the organic fluorophores regularly dispersed inside the perovskite structure. Unexpectedly higher light&#8208;outcoupling efficiency, which is caused by the light scattering in the polycrystalline perovskite layer, will be another reason for efficient EL. These findings will contribute toward the fabrication of LED&#8208;based products with high performance at a low cost.

         <title>Highly Reversible Zn Anode Design Through Oriented ZnO(002) Facets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnO(002) lattice plane with low lattice mismatch to Zn(002) endows fast ion diffusion, high Coulombic efficiency, and uniform Zn deposition, while ZnO(100) plane tends to exacerbate dendrite growth and provoke unwanted side reactions compared to bare Zn. Therefore, ZnO(002) protection layer on Zn realizes more stable performance for Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The practical implementation of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries presents formidable hurdles, including uncontrolled dendrite growth, water&#8208;induced side reactions, suboptimal Zn metal utilization, and intricate Zn anode manufacturing. Here, large&#8208;scale construction of a highly oriented ZnO(002) lattice plane on Zn anode (ZnO(002)@Zn) with thermodynamic inertia and kinetic zincophilicity is designed to address such problems. Both theoretical calculations and experiment results elucidate that the ZnO(002)@Zn possesses high Zn chemical affinity, hydrogen evolution reaction suppression, and dendrite&#8208;free deposition ability due to the abundant lattice oxygen species in ZnO(002) and its low lattice mismatch with Zn(002). These features synergistically promote ion transport and enable homogeneous Zn deposition. Consequently, the ZnO(002)@Zn anode displays a stable and prolonged cycling lifespan exceeding 500&#160;h even under a larger depth of discharge (85.6%) and realizes an impressive average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. Moreover, its efficacy is also evident in V2O5&#8208;cathode coin cells and pouch cells with not only high discharge capacity but also exceptional cycling stability. This integrated approach presents a promising avenue for addressing the challenges associated with Zn metal anodes, thereby advancing the prospects of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery technologies.

         <title>Efficient and Ultrastable Seawater Electrolysis at Industrial Current Density with Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction and Dual Cl&#8722;&#8208;Repelling Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a novel Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 micropillar catalyst with strong metal&#8208;support interaction, this work presents a high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis. It highlights the innovative dual Cl&#8722;&#8208;repelling layer to suppress chloride oxidation, significantly enhancing stability and catalytic activity, representing a revolutionary advancement in catalyst development for seawater electrolysis.








Abstract
Direct seawater electrolysis is emerging as a promising renewable energy technology for large&#8208;scale hydrogen generation. The development of Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 micropillar arrays with strong metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis is reported. The micropillar structure enhances electron and mass transfer, extending catalytic reaction steps and improving seawater electrolysis efficiency. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the strong MSI between Os and Ni4Mo/MoO2 optimizes the surface electronic structure of the catalyst, reducing the reaction barrier and thereby improving catalytic activity. Importantly, for the first time, a dual Cl&#8722; repelling layer is constructed by electrostatic force to safeguard active sites against Cl&#8722; attack during seawater oxidation. This includes a strong Os&#9472;Cl adsorption and an in situ&#8208;formed MoO42&#8722; layer. As a result, the Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 catalyst exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 113 and 336&#160;mV to reach 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for HER and OER in natural seawater from the South China Sea (without purification, with 1&#160;m KOH added). Notably, it demonstrates superior stability, degrading only 0.37 &#181;V h&#8722;1 after 2500 h of seawater oxidation, significantly surpassing the technical target of 1.0 &#181;V h&#8722;1 set by the United States Department of Energy.

         <title>Boolean Computation in Single&#8208;Transistor Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an in situ reconfigurable &#8220;computing neuron&#8221; prototype with wafer&#8208;scale fabrication distinguished from a widespread collapsed integrator artificial neuron. The ambipolar nature can be further adapted to construct highly efficient soft&#8208;XOR&#8208;based neural networks.








Abstract
Brain neurons exhibit far more sophisticated and powerful information&#8208;processing capabilities than the simple integrators commonly modeled in neuromorphic computing. A biological neuron can in fact efficiently perform Boolean algebra, including linear nonseparable operations. Traditional logic circuits require more than a dozen transistors combined as NOT, AND, and OR gates to implement XOR. Lacking biological competency, artificial neural networks require multilayered solutions to exercise XOR operation. Here, it is shown that a single&#8208;transistor neuron, harnessing the intrinsic ambipolarity of graphene and ionic filamentary dynamics, can enable in situ reconfigurable multiple Boolean operations from linear separable to linear nonseparable in an ultra&#8208;compact design. By leveraging the spatiotemporal integration of inputs, bio&#8208;realistic spiking&#8208;dependent Boolean computation is fully realized, rivaling the efficiency of a human brain. Furthermore, a soft&#8208;XOR&#8208;based neural network via algorithm&#8208;hardware co&#8208;design, showcasing substantial performance improvement, is demonstrated. These results demonstrate how the artificial neuron, in the ultra&#8208;compact form of a single transistor, may function as a powerful platform for Boolean operations. These findings are anticipated to be a starting point for implementing more sophisticated computations at the individual transistor neuron level, leading to super&#8208;scalable neural networks for resource&#8208;efficient brain&#8208;inspired information processing.

         <title>Responsive Magnetic Particle Imaging Tracer: Overcoming &#8220;Always&#8208;On&#8221; Limitation, Eliminating Interference, and Ensuring Safety in Adaptive Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This responsive MPI tracer for subtraction&#8208;enhanced MPI imaging, accurate molecular imaging, and environment&#8208;adaptive therapy, offers the potential to maximize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects. This technique effectively eliminates interference signals originating from non&#8208;specific liver uptake.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a novel technology utilizing superparamagnetic nanoparticles as tracers, essential for disease diagnosis and treatment guidance in preclinical animal models. Unlike other modalities, MPI provides high sensitivity, deep tissue penetration, and no signal attenuation. However, existing MPI tracers suffer from &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; signals, which complicate organ&#8208;specific imaging and hinder accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a responsive MPI tracer using pH&#8208;responsive PdFe alloy particles coated with a gatekeeper polymer. This tracer exhibits pH&#8208;sensitive Fe release and modulation of the MPI signal, enabling selective imaging with a higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and intratumoral pH quantification. Notably, this responsive tracer facilitates subtraction&#8208;enhanced MPI imaging, effectively eliminating interference from liver uptake and expanding the scope of abdominal imaging. Additionally, the tracer employs a dual&#8208;function mechanism for adaptive cancer therapy, combining pH&#8208;switchable enzyme&#8208;like catalysis with dual&#8208;key co&#8208;activation of ROS generation, and Pd skeleton that scavenges free radicals to minimize Fe&#8208;related toxicity. This advancement promises to significantly expand MPI's applicability in diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring, marking a leap forward in imaging technology.

         <title>A Metalgel with Liquid Metal Continuum Immobilized in Polymer Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new liquid metal&#8208;polymer gel material termed &#8220;metalgel&#8221;. The 92.40% vol interconnected liquid metal expands throughout the whole volume of 3D polymer networks with polymer domain size down to nanometer scale. Liquid metal is stably immobilized in metalgel via electrostatic interactions. Metalgel exhibits ultrahigh electrical conductivity (up to 3.18 &#215; 106 S&#183;m&#8722;1) and tissue&#8208;like softness (Young's modulus as low as 70 kPa).








Abstract
Gels are formed by fluids that expand throughout the whole volume of 3D polymer networks. To unlock unprecedented properties, exploring new fluids immobilized in polymer networks is crucial. Here, a new liquid metal&#8208;polymer gel material termed &#8220;metalgel&#8221; is introduced via fluid replacement strategy, featuring 92.40%&#160;vol liquid metal fluid as a continuum immobilized by interconnected nanoscale polymer network. The unique structure endows metalgel with high electrical conductivity (up to 3.18&#160;&#215;&#160;106 S&#183;m&#8210;1), tissue&#8208;like softness (Young's modulus as low as 70&#160;kPa), and low gas permeability (4.50&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8210;22&#160;m2&#183;s&#8210;1&#183;Pa&#8210;1). Besides, metalgel demonstrates electrical stability under extreme deformations, such as being run over by a 4.5&#8208;metric&#8208;tonne truck, and maintains its integrity in various environments for up to 180 days. The immobilization of high&#8208;volume&#8208;fraction liquid metal fluid is realized by electrostatic interactions is further revealed. Potential applications for metalgel are diverse and include soft electromagnetic shielding, hermetic sealing, and stimulating/sensing electrodes in implantable bioelectronics, underscoring its broad applicability.

         <title>Instantaneous Tiltmeter Triggered by Dynamic Wetting Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic motion of liquid metal in a wheat awn modeled microchannel induces high precision tiltmeter, which realizes surface topography scanning after being equipped with three dimensions platform.








Abstract
A novel instantaneous tiltmeter with dynamic and static monitoring functions is reported that is based on liquid metal dynamic wetting behavior in a bio&#8208;fabricated anisotropic microchannel. The proposed system achieves instantaneous tiltmeter functionality, offering a broad detection range (&#8722;90&#176;&#8211;90&#176;) with high precision (0.05&#176;), a rapid reaction time (0.11 s), and enhanced durability. Moreover, a seamless integration has enabled water wave detection, language programming, and human limb monitoring. Especially, the integration of tiltmeter and a 3D motion platform results in a surface structure scanning system capable of effectively performing large area (&gt;200 cm2) and height difference scanning functions. This innovative approach holds great potential for transformative changes in the fields of advanced manufacturing, flexible robotics, and the flexible sensing, further facilitating widespread adoption.

The ether/ketonic&#8208;oxygen and Lewis&#8208;acid sites contribute to a high ionic conductivity (5.7 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.84). A 1.5 Ah pouch cell with an areal capacity of &#8776;4 mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 delivers a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density of 446&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Utilizing solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) in high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries is a promising strategy for achieving high energy density and safety. However, the SPEs face the challenges such as undesirable mechanical strength, low ionic conductivity and incompatible high&#8208;voltage interface. Here, a novel crosslinked poly(ether&#8208;urethane)&#8208;based SPE with a molecular cross&#8208;linked structure is fabricated to create high&#8208;throughput Li+ transport pathway. The amino&#8208;modified Zr&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (ZrMOF) are introduced as multisite cross&#8208;linking nodes and polymer chain extenders. The abundant ether/ketonic&#8208;oxygen and Lewis acid sites in the SPE achieve high Li+ conductivity (5.7 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C) and Li+ transference number (0.84). The interpenetrating cross&#8208;linked structure of SPE with robust mechanical strength results in a record cycle life of 8000&#160;h in Li||Li symmetric cell. The high structural stability of ZrMOF and abundant electron&#8208;withdrawing urethane/ureido groups in the SPE with high oxidation potential (5.1&#160;V) enables a discharge capacity of 182 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.3 C over 500 cycles in a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li cell. Remarkably, a high energy density of 446&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in a 1.5&#8208;Ah pouch cell is obtained with high loading cathode (&#8776;4 mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating a great prospect of the current SPE for practical application in solid&#8208;state, high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Semiconductor Device Enabling Optoelectronic Detection and Neuromorphic Processing with Extended Spectral Responsivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;mode device is developed using a PbS/Si hybrid heterojunction with an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 passivation layer, enabling both optoelectronic detection and neuromorphic operation. In mode 1, it achieves ultra&#8208;wide spectral response and reproduces high&#8208;quality 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixel images. In mode 2, it acts as a neuromorphic device, achieving 96.5% accuracy in classifying standard digits.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance semiconductor devices capable of multiple functions are pivotal in meeting the challenges of miniaturization and integration in advanced technologies. Despite the inherent difficulties of incorporating dual functionality within a single device, a high&#8208;performance, dual&#8208;mode device is reported. This device integrates an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 passivation layer with a PbS/Si hybrid heterojunction, which can simultaneously enable optoelectronic detection and neuromorphic operation. In mode 1, the device efficiently separates photo&#8208;generated electron&#8208;hole pairs, exhibiting an ultra&#8208;wide spectral response from ultraviolet (265&#160;nm) to near&#8208;infrared (1650&#160;nm) wavelengths. It also reproduces high&#8208;quality images of 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixels, achieving a Q&#8208;value as low as 0.00437&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a light intensity of 8.58&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, when in mode 2, the as&#8208;assembled device with typical persistent photoconductivity (PPC) behavior can act as a neuromorphic device, which can achieve 96.5% accuracy in classifying standard digits underscoring its efficacy in temporal information processing. It is believed that the present dual&#8208;function devices potentially advance the multifunctionality and miniaturization of chips for intelligence applications.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Organic Neurohybrid Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic artificial synapse interacts with non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters present in the central nervous system by exploiting key electroactive species (i.e., H2O2) produced by neurotransmitter&#8208;specific enzymatic reactions as synaptic modulator in an electrochemical neruomorphic organic device. This enzyme&#8208;mediated neurohybrid synapse can mimic biological learning&#8208;forgetting processes, showing a faster learning phase once previously learned information is forgotten compared to the initial learning stage.








Abstract
The development of organic artificial synapses that exhibit biomimicry features also may enable a more seamless integration of neuroelectronic devices in the nervous system, allowing artificial neuromodulation to be perceived as natural behavior by neuronal cells. Nevertheless, the capability to interact with both electroactive and non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters remains a challenge since state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices mainly rely on the oxidation of electroactive species. Here, the study proposes an organic artificial synapse engineered to enable interaction with non&#8208;electroactive species present in the central nervous system. By integrating a conductive polymeric film functionalized with platinum nanoparticles, the device can catalyze the oxidation of electroactive molecules (i.e., H2O2) resulting from neurotransmitter&#8208;specific enzymatic reactions following an enzymatic functionalization, therefore exhibiting neuromorphic functions driven by non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters. The creation of devices that can interact with or monitor these neurotransmitters can be seen as a significant step toward innovative technologies to expand the understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurological disorders and the development of novel, more effective treatments for them.

         <title>Peripheral Substitution Engineering of MR&#8208;TADF Emitters Embedded With B&#8210;N Covalent Bond Towards Efficient BT.2020 Blue Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a novel B&#8211;N embedded framework, a peripheral substitution engineering has been proposed to afford ultrapure blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters, revealing a record&#8208;high EQE of 20.3%, a narrow FWHM of 20&#160;nm and CIE coordinates of (0.152, 0.046) that align with the BT.2020 blue standard.








Abstract
Compared with the classical boron/nitrogen (B/N) doped ones, multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters embedded with B&#8211;N covalent bond behave a significantly blue&#8208;shifted narrowband TADF, and thus show a greater potential in ultrapure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). As a proof of concept, herein a peripheral substitution engineering is demonstrated based on such a B&#8210;N embedded parent core. The simple approach is found to ensure easy synthesis via a one&#8208;pot lithium&#8208;free borylation&#8208;annulation, manipulate the excited states through different electronic coupling between core and substituent, and introduce the steric hindrance to minimize the unwanted spectral broadening. Impressively, ultrapure blue OLEDs are realized to give a high external quantum efficiency of 20.3% together with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.152, 0.046). The performance is well competent with those of B/N doped MR&#8208;TADF emitters, clearly highlighting that the B&#8210;N embedded framework is a novel promising paradigm towards efficient BT.2020 blue standard.

         <title>A High&#8208;Voltage n&#8208;type Organic Cathode Materials Enabled by Tetraalkylammonium Complexing Agents for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;voltage n&#8208;type organic electrode material featuring hexacyano&#8208;substituted cyclopropane dianion (CpCN62&#8211;) is reported. By leveraging the common&#8208;ion effect of tetrabutylammonium (TBA) cation in the electrolyte, the TBA salt of CpCN62&#8211; exhibits reversible two&#8208;electron redox process at 1.43 V discharge potential with stable long&#8208;term cycling, underscoring its potential as a high&#8208;performance and sustainable organic cathode material.








Abstract
Tetrabutylammonium (TBA) salt of hexacyano&#8208;substituted cyclopropane dianion (Cp(CN)62&#8722;) is prepared through a facile two&#8208;step synthetic protocol from commercially available materials and fully characterized as a high&#8208;voltage n&#8208;type organic cathode in rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The addition of tetrabutylammonium triflate (TBAOTf)&#160;to the electrolyte mitigates dissolution issues, leading to enhanced cycling stability. Remarkably, the Cp(CN)62&#8722; cathode demonstrates a high discharge voltage of 1.43&#160;V in AZIBs and retains 85% of its capacity after 1000 cycles at a high loading of 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and a cycling rate of 10C. These results, combined with spectroscopic analyses, elucidate a reversible two&#8208;electron redox process of Cp(CN)62&#8722; facilitated by the insertion/de&#8208;insertion of TBA cation. These findings underscore the potential of Cp(CN)62&#8722; as a conversion&#8208;based n&#8208;type cathode in energy storage applications.

         <title>Internal Capsulation Via Self&#8208;Cross&#8208;linking and &#960;&#8208;Effects Achieves Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an internal encapsulation strategy utilizing the synergistic effect of in situ cross&#8208;linking and &#960;&#8208;effects, achieving an upgrade of the protective layer from linear to mesh&#8208;like coverage. The internal encapsulated device exhibits an enhanced efficiency of 25.31 % and noticeably improved stability.








Abstract
Pursuing high stability becomes the core challenge in realizing the widespread application of perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Here, a practical internal&#8208;capsulation strategy is proposed by introducing cross&#8208;linkable methacrylate analogs upon the perovskite layer, hindering ion migration and preventing lead leakage to achieve stable PerSCs. Butyl methacrylate (UMA) and benzyl methacrylate (BMA) can chemically interact with the perovskite layer, especially for the BMA dimer with significant &#960;&#8208;interactions among the hanging benzene rings. Such configuration facilitated more compact coordination, thereby restoring the Fermi level of perovskite to a defect&#8208;free state and reducing carrier recombination losses. Moreover, by integrating the self&#8208;cross&#8208;linking and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;effect, the application of BMA upgraded the internal capsulation from linear protection to a compact mesh&#8208;like scale. Consequently, the application of BMA not only boosted the efficiency to 25.31% but also greatly enhanced the stability of the perovskite layer, especially for water resistance and preventing lead linkage. The internal capsulation strategy upgrading from linear to mesh&#8208;like marked an innovative direction in protecting the perovskite layer, paving the way for more sustainable PerSCs in further application.

         <title>Eradication of Large Tumors by Nanoscale Drug Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale self&#8208;assemblies constructed from Ce6 and mitoxantrone through hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking achieve photodynamic, photothermal, chemotherapy, and subsequently immunotherapy, under a single laser irradiation, to eradicate large tumors and prevent recurrence in various tumor models. The easy preparation, simple treatment process, and excellent therapeutic effect make this formulation a promising potential for clinical translation.








Abstract
Most patients with cancer are first diagnosed at an advanced disease stage, when tumors are already large and/or metastases are present. This circumstance has a negative impact on the prognosis and therapeutic effect of anticancer drugs. In this study, it is demonstrated that photosensitizer chlorin e6 and the photochemotherapy drug mitoxantrone self&#8208;assemble into relatively stable nanoassemblies (CM NAs) through hydrogen&#8208;bonding effect, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. Administration of CM NAs in combination with 660&#160;nm laser irradiation shows chemotherapeutic, photothermal, and photodynamic effects, causing tumor cell apoptosis and pyroptosis and enabling noninvasive tumor ablation without compromising the surrounding normal tissue. More importantly, treatment with CM NAs increases tumor immunogenicity, leading to a strong and long&#8208;term antitumor immune response that eradicates large tumors and provides long&#8208;term protection against tumor recurrence on various tumor models.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Lifetime Probe for Detecting Intramolecular Noncovalent Interaction in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular noncovalent interactions boost the device performance in the optoelectronic field, but cannot be directly detected in organic semiconductor films thus far. Spin lifetime as a probe to detect intramolecular noncovalent interaction is innovatively used since it can influence the spin&#8208;orbit coupling strength and thus modulate the spin lifetime. This work will significantly advance the interdisciplinary research of organic spintronics and electronics.








Abstract
Intramolecular noncovalent interaction (INCI), a crucial strategy for effectively enhancing molecular planarity and extending &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization in organic semiconductors (OSCs), has played an increasingly important role in optoelectronic applications. However, though the INCI formation is regularly considered to improve the device performance by literature, there is no feasible approach to directly and reliably characterizing its formation in practical&#8208;OSC films thus far. Here in this study, by theoretical analysis and calculation, the generation of INCIs in OSCs is found, normally consisting of relatively heavy elements, such as O&#183;&#183;&#183;Se, O&#183;&#183;&#183;S, N&#183;&#183;&#183;S interactions, etc., can induce enhanced strength of spin&#8208;orbit coupling, the primary factor dominating spin lifetime in OSCs. Based on this newly discovered theory, spin lifetime is creatively employed as a probe for sensitively detecting INCIs in OSC films via spin valves or field&#8208;induced electron paramagnetic resonance, respectively. This study will highly promote academic and applicable developments of the cross&#8208;cutting frontier research field between organic spintronics and electronics.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Additives as Repairable Reinforcements for Dynamic Covalent Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative non&#8208;covalent reinforcement strategy for dynamic covalent networks (DCNs) using a supramolecular additive (S&#8208;T) that can depolymerize and reform on demand. Acting as both compatibilizer and filler, S&#8208;T improves mechanical properties while providing a tool to control processability, thus offering an alternative to traditional non&#8208;repairable reinforcements. 








Abstract
Employing rigid (in)organic materials as reinforcement for dynamic covalent networks (DCNs) is an effective approach to develop high&#8208;performance materials. Yet, recycling of these materials after failure often necessitates inefficient chemical reprocessing or inevitably alters their performance due to unrepairable inert components. Here, a non&#8208;covalent reinforcement strategy is presented by introducing a supramolecular additive to a DCN that can reversibly depolymerize and reform on demand, therefore acting as an adaptive and repairable reinforcement. The strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions in the supramolecular polymer of triazine&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tribenzenecarboxamide (S&#8208;T) strengthen the DCN at room temperature, while its non&#8208;covalent nature allows for easy one&#8208;pot reprocessing at high temperatures. Depending on wether S&#8208;T is covalently bond to the DCN or not, it can play either the role of compatibilizer or filler, providing a synthetic tool to control the relaxation dynamics, reprocessability and mechanical properties. Moreover, the S&#8208;T reinforcement can be chemically recovered with high yield and purity, showcasing the recyclability of the composite. This conceptually novel supramolecular reinforcement strategy with temperature&#8208;controlled dynamics highlights the potential of supramolecular polymer additives to replace conventional unrepairable reinforcements.

         <title>Sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;Soldier Effect in an Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Host&#8208;Guest System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel host&#8208;guest system, wherein TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;BI is doped into TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;Cz crystals, is experimentally shown to enhance room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence quantum yields 10&#8208;fold. Groundbreaking visualization of typically undetectable guest molecules is achieved for the first time within the host crystal structure. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a unique &#8220;sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;soldier&#8221; effect, where the guest molecules control the conformations of the host, significantly influencing crystal packing. This system also exhibits efficient triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer from host to guest, promoting improved radiative decay.








Abstract
Host&#8208;guest systems have emerged as an efficient strategy for promoting organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Despite the advantages of doping guest molecules into a host matrix, the complexity of these systems and the lack of techniques to visualize host&#8208;guest interactions at the molecular scale pose significant challenges in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here, a novel host&#8208;guest RTP system is developed by incorporating low concentrations (1&#8211;10 mol%) of TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;BI (guest) into crystalline TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;Cz (host). Utilizing structural isomerism, the guest molecules are regularly incorporated into the host crystal lattice, resulting in phosphorescence quantum yields almost ten times higher than the pure compounds. The system enabled resolution of the molecular packing of the single crystal through X&#8208;ray diffraction, providing unprecedented visualization of host&#8208;guest interactions. A &#8220;sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;soldier&#8221; effect, where the minority dopant molecules (sergeants) significantly influence the packing arrangement of the host molecules (soldiers), enhances RTP is identified. Further analyses revealed that due to the host molecule's inefficient phosphorescence pathway, its long&#8208;lived dark triplets are channeled to the guest via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTET), allowing the excited energy to radiatively decay more efficiently. These insights advance the understanding of RTP mechanisms and offer practical implications for designing high&#8208;efficiency phosphorescent materials.

Groundbreaking visualization of typically undetectable guest molecules is achieved for the first time within the host crystal structure. Single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals a unique &#8220;sergeant-and-soldier&#8221; effect, where the guest molecules control the conformations of the host, significantly influencing crystal packing. This system also exhibits efficient triplet-triplet energy transfer from host to guest, promoting improved radiative decay.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host-guest systems have emerged as an efficient strategy for promoting organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Despite the advantages of doping guest molecules into a host matrix, the complexity of these systems and the lack of techniques to visualize host-guest interactions at the molecular scale pose significant challenges in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here, a novel host-guest RTP system is developed by incorporating low concentrations (1&#8211;10 mol%) of TPP-4C-BI (guest) into crystalline TPP-4C-Cz (host). Utilizing structural isomerism, the guest molecules are regularly incorporated into the host crystal lattice, resulting in phosphorescence quantum yields almost ten times higher than the pure compounds. The system enabled resolution of the molecular packing of the single crystal through X-ray diffraction, providing unprecedented visualization of host-guest interactions. A &#8220;sergeant-and-soldier&#8221; effect, where the minority dopant molecules (sergeants) significantly influence the packing arrangement of the host molecules (soldiers), enhances RTP is identified. Further analyses revealed that due to the host molecule's inefficient phosphorescence pathway, its long-lived dark triplets are channeled to the guest via triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTET), allowing the excited energy to radiatively decay more efficiently. These insights advance the understanding of RTP mechanisms and offer practical implications for designing high-efficiency phosphorescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This study presents VO&#8322;&#8208;based photothermoelectric near&#8208;infrared photodetectors showing electrode&#8208;dependent and tunable super&#8208;linear photoresponse with ultralow modulation bias. The device demonstrates an exceptional photocurrent on/off ratio and high detectivity. The electrode dependence, driven by the polarity difference in the Seebeck coefficient, is also elucidated. It is ideal for intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing and night vision pattern reorganization even with noisy inputs, making it a low&#8208;power and integrative technology for future smart edge sensors.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;like intelligence is ushering humanity into an era of the Internet of Perceptions (IoP), where the vast amounts of data generated by numerous sensing nodes pose significant challenges to transmission bandwidth and computing hardware. A recently proposed near&#8208;sensor computing architecture offers an effective solution to reduce data processing delays and energy consumption. However, a pressing need remains for innovative hardware with multifunctional near&#8208;sensor image processing capabilities. In this work, Mott material (vanadium dioxide)&#8208;based photothermoelectric near&#8208;infrared photodetectors are developed that exhibit electrode&#8208;dependent and tunable super&#8208;linear photoresponse (exponent &#945; &gt; 33) with ultralow modulation bias. These devices demonstrate an opto&#8208;thermo&#8208;electro&#8208;coupled phase transition, resulting in a large photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;105), high responsivity (&#8776;500 A W&#8722;1), and well detectivity (&#8776;3.9&#160;&#215; 1012 Jones), all while maintaining rapid response speeds (&#964;r = 2 &#181;s and &#964;d = 5 &#181;s) under the bias of 1&#160;V. This electrode&#8208;dependent super&#8208;linear response is found to arise from the electron doping effect determined by the polarity of the Seebeck coefficient. Furthermore, the work showcases intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing and night vision pattern reorganization, even with noisy inputs. This work paves the way for developing near&#8208;sensor devices with potential applications in medical image preprocessing, flexible electronics, and intelligent edge sensing.

Through the meticulous design of a type&#8208;I heterojunction with a single&#8208;side barrier on the valence band and near&#8208;zero offset on the conduction band, the Sb2Te3/WSe2 heterojunction achieves the best&#8208;reported combined performance in light and gas detection. This enabled the development of the first visual&#8208;olfactory dual&#8208;mode sensor, boosting recognition accuracy of electric and fuel&#8208;powered vehicles from &#8776;50% to &#8776;96%.








Abstract
The design and fabrication of materials that can concurrently respond to light and gas within the dual&#8208;modal recognition domain present a significant challenge due to contradictory structural requirements. This innovative strategy introduces a type&#8208;I heterojunction, combining the properties of Sb2Te3 and WSe2 nanosheets, to overcome these obstacles. The heterojunction is prepared through a precise stacking approach to create a single&#8208;side barrier on the valence band and a near&#8208;zero offset on the conduction band. The resulting Sb2Te3/WSe2 heterojunction demonstrates unparalleled performance, showcasing the best integrated photoelectric and gas sensing performance in a single device to date. Based on the above features, the heterojunction successfully integrates visual and olfactory sensing performance, achieving the first biomimetic visual&#8208;olfactory dual&#8208;mode recognition in a single device. This simulation increased the accuracy of distinguishing electric and fuel&#8208;powered cars from &#8776;50% to &#8776;96%. This work introduces a novel approach to creating efficient, self&#8208;powered sensing materials, paving the way for next&#8208;generation biomimetic dual&#8208;model devices with broad applications in environmental protection, medical care, and other fields.

         <title>Plasmonic Supramolecular Nanozyme&#8208;Based Bio&#8208;Cockleburs for Synergistic Therapy of Infected Diabetic Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of the plasmonic&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalysis and self&#8208;cascade reaction strategy is employed to construct a bimetallic nanozyme&#8208;based biomimetic nano&#8208;cocklebur (GNR@CeO2@GNPs) for diabetic wound healing. Experimental results demonstrate that this promising approach maximizes the utilization of endogenous hyperglycemia and oxidative stress for downregulating hyperglycemia, non&#8208;antibiotic antibacterial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and accelerating skin regeneration.








Abstract
Diabetic wounds are a major devastating complication of diabetes due to hyperglycemia, bacterial invasion, and persistent inflammation, and the current antibiotic treatments can lead to the emergence of multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria. Herein, a bimetallic nanozyme&#8208;based biomimetic bio&#8208;cocklebur (GNR@CeO2@GNPs) is designed and synthesized for diabetic wound management by depositing spiky ceria (CeO2) shells and gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on a gold nanorod (GNR) nanoantenna. The plasmonic&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalysis and self&#8208;cascade reaction properties simultaneously boost the two&#8208;step enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity of GNR@CeO2@GNPs, leading to a significant improvement in overall therapeutic efficacy rather than mere additive effects. Under the glucose activation and 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, GNR@CeO2@GNPs material captures photons and promotes the transfer of hot electrons from GNR and GNPs into CeO2, realizing a &#8220;butterfly effect&#8221; of consuming local glucose, overcoming the limited antibacterial efficiency of an individual PTT modality, and providing substantial reactive oxygen species. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the material's exceptional antibacterial and antibiofilm properties against Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, which can reduce inflammation, promote collagen deposition, and facilitate angiogenesis, thereby accelerating wound healing. This study provides a promising new strategy to develop plasmonic&#8208;enhanced nanozymes with a catalytic cascade mode for the antibiotic&#8208;free synergistic treatment of infected diabetic wounds.

         <title>Light&#8208;Operated Diverse Logic Gates Enabled by Modulating Time&#8208;Dependent Fluorescence of Dissipative Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly systems with variable optical signals are achieved to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time&#8208;dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. It develops diverse light&#8208;operated logic gates, incorporating AND, and XOR operations, by utilizing the on/off irradiation wavelength of photoreaction and fluorescence excitation wavelength as optical inputs, while monitoring time&#8208;dependent changes in fluorescence as outputs.








Abstract
Light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly possesses enormous potential in the field of optical information due to controllable time&#8208;dependent optical signals, but remains a great challenge for constructing intelligent light&#8208;operated logic circuits due to the limited availability of optical signal inputs and outputs. Herein, a series of light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly systems with variable optical signals are reported to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time&#8208;dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. Three kinds of alkyl trimethylammonium homologs are employed to co&#8208;assemble with a merocyanine&#8208;based photoinduced amphiphile separately to construct a series of dissipative self&#8208;assemblies, showing unexpectedly different fluorescence control behaviors of loaded fluorophores during light irradiation and thermal relaxation processes. The opposite monotonicity of time&#8208;dependent emission intensity is achieved just by changing the excitation wavelength.

     alt="Light-Operated Diverse Logic Gates Enabled by Modulating Time-Dependent Fluorescence of Dissipative Self-Assemblies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-fueled dissipative self-assembly systems with variable optical signals are achieved to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time-dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. It develops diverse light-operated logic gates, incorporating AND, and XOR operations, by utilizing the on/off irradiation wavelength of photoreaction and fluorescence excitation wavelength as optical inputs, while monitoring time-dependent changes in fluorescence as outputs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-fueled dissipative self-assembly possesses enormous potential in the field of optical information due to controllable time-dependent optical signals, but remains a great challenge for constructing intelligent light-operated logic circuits due to the limited availability of optical signal inputs and outputs. Herein, a series of light-fueled dissipative self-assembly systems with variable optical signals are reported to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time-dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. Three kinds of alkyl trimethylammonium homologs are employed to co-assemble with a merocyanine-based photoinduced amphiphile separately to construct a series of dissipative self-assemblies, showing unexpectedly different fluorescence control behaviors of loaded fluorophores during light irradiation and thermal relaxation processes. The opposite monotonicity of time-dependent emission intensity is achieved just by changing the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, by varying the types of trimethylammoniums and excitation wavelengths, a robust logic system is accomplished, integrating AND, XNOR, and XOR functions, which provides an effective pathway for advancing information transmission applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Nanotheranostics with a Switchable Irradiation Mode for Immunogenic Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents new insights into a multifunctional drug delivery system (NPRBOXA) with a sequentially switching irradiation mode for cancer theranostics. NPRBOXA enables a combination of sonodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for tumor treatment. The versatile design of NPRBOXA holds promise for advancing precision oncology through enhanced therapeutic efficacy and imaging guidance.








Abstract
Nanotheranostics, which integrate diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities, offer significant potential for tumor treatment. However, current nanotheranostic systems typically involve multiple molecules, each providing a singular diagnostic or therapeutic function, leading to challenges such as complex structural composition, poor targeting efficiency, lack of spatiotemporal control, and dependence on a single therapeutic modality. This study introduces NPRBOXA, a nanoparticle functionalized with surface&#8208;bound cRGD for targeted delivery to &#945;v&#946;3/&#945;v&#946;5 receptors on tumor cells, achieving theranostic integration by sequentially switching its irradiation modes. Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, NPRBOXA emits NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, which aids in identifying the nanoparticle's location and fluorescence intensity, thereby determining the optimal treatment window. Following this, the irradiation mode switches to ultrasound irradiation at the optimal treatment window. Ultrasound irradiation induces NPRBOXA to generate reactive oxygen species, promoting the reduction of OXA&#8208;IV to OXA&#8208;II, which in turn triggers immunogenic cell death. This mechanism enables a combination of sonodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for tumor treatment. The versatile design of NPRBOXA holds promise for advancing precision oncology through enhanced therapeutic efficacy and real&#8208;time imaging guidance.

Liquid crystalline network (LCN)&#8208;based actuators grafted with Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) are fabricated. The LCN&#8208;DASAs films present synergistic effects and interactions of photochemical and photothermal effects under visible light. Furthermore, multiple applications of films including information encryptions, off&#8208;equilibrium motions grippers, and reconfigurable deformations are achieved.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline network (LCN)&#8211;based soft actuators have opened up great opportunities to fabricate emerging and intriguing smart materials, serving as potential building blocks for intelligent soft robotics. Endowing LCN actuators with complex responsive behaviors to enhance their intelligence is both challenging and highly demanded. Herein, Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) molecules with rod&#8208;like mesogen and the polymerizable group are judiciously designed and synthesized, which is strong&#8208;colored at linear form and de&#8208;coloration at cyclic form after visible light. In the colored state, the DASA presents a striking photothermal effect that is capable of driving the motions of LCN film. Upon visible light irradiation, the DASA becomes colorless, making the diminishing photothermal effect. The light&#8208;gated switching of the photothermal effect renders the LCN films to be reconfigurable and perform off&#8208;equilibrium motions. The varying glass transition temperature of LCN matrix endowing tunable isomerization rates of DASAs and the equilibrium balance of photo&#8208; and thermal&#8208;isomerization at different temperatures in LCN&#8208;P&#8208;DASA film mainly guiding the off&#8208;equilibrium or stable motions, providing high adjustability of the novel visible light&#8208;driven LCN actuators. The multiply modulated LCN&#8208;P&#8208;DASA film holds great potential in constructing complex visible light&#8208;driven soft actuators based on the synergetic effect and interactions of photochemical and photothermal effects.

         <title>2D Titanium Carbide MXene and Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence: Distance&#8208;Dependent Nonradiative Energy Transfer and Leaflet&#8208;Resolved Dye Sensing in Lipid Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes' distance&#8208;dependent energy transfer properties are examined using single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy and DNA origami nanopositioners. The findings reveal MXenes as short&#8208;distance spectroscopic nanorulers, achieving 50% energy transfer efficiency at 2.7&#160;nm with a cubic power law dependency. Single&#8208;molecule leaflet&#8208;resolved dye sensing of lipid bilayers are demonstrated with MXene energy transfer due to MXenes&#8217; sensitivity at the interface.








Abstract
Despite their growing popularity, many fundamental properties and applications of MXene materials remain underexplored. Here, the nonradiative energy transfer properties of 2D titanium carbide MXene are investigated&#160;and their application in single&#8208;molecule biosensing is explored for the first time. DNA origami positioners are used for single dye placement immobilized by a specific chemistry based on glycine&#8208;MXene interactions, allowing precise control of their orientation on the surface. Each DNA origami structure carries a single dye molecule at predetermined heights. Single&#8208;molecule fluorescence confocal microscopy reveals that energy transfer of an organic emitter (ATTO 542) on transparent thin films made of spincast Ti3C2Tx flakes follows a cubic distance dependence, where 50% of energy transfer efficiency is reached at 2.7&#160;nm (d0). MXenes are applied as short&#8208;distance spectroscopic nanorulers, determining z distances of dye&#8208;labeled supported lipid bilayers fused on MXene's hydrophilic surface. Hydration layer (2.1&#160;nm) and lipid bilayer thickness (4.5&#160;nm) values that agree with the literature are obtained. These results highlight titanium carbide MXenes as promising substrates for single&#8208;molecule biosensing of ultrathin assemblies, owing to their sensitivity near the interface, a distance regime that is typically inaccessible to other energy transfer tools.

         <title>Realizing Ultrahigh Conversion Efficiency of &#8776;9.0% in YbCd2Sb2/Mg3Sb2 Zintl Module for Thermoelectric Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high ZT of &#8776;1.43 is obtained for YbCd1.425Zn0.475Mg0.1Sb2 enabled by orbital alignment. Moreover, thermal expansion matches Fe90Sb10 barrier material with low contact resistivity and high stability is delicately designed. Leveraging the transient liquid phase bonding technique, for the first time, a YbCd2Sb2/Mg3(Sb, Bi)2 module with an ultrahigh conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.0% and good stability is successfully assembled.








Abstract
Recently, YbCd2Sb2&#8208;based Zintl compounds have been widely investigated owing to their extraordinary thermoelectric (TE) performance. However, its p orbitals of anions that determined the valence band structure are split due to crystal field splitting that provides a good platform for band manipulation by doping/alloying and, more importantly, the YbCd2Sb2&#8208;based device has yet to be reported. In this work, single&#8208;phase YbCd1.5Zn0.5Sb2 is successfully obtained through precise chemical composition control. Then, YbMg2Sb2&#8208;alloying increases the cationic vacancy defect formation energy and further optimizes carrier concentration. Moreover, the band structure of YbCd1.5Zn0.5Sb2 is subtly manipulated, and the underlying mechanism is experimentally explored. Combined with the reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a high peak ZT value of &#8764;1.43 at 700&#160;K is obtained for YbCd1.425Zn0.475Mg0.1Sb2. Subsequently, choosing Fe90Sb10 as the diffusion barrier layer and adopting the transient liquid phase bonding technique, for the first time, it is demonstrated that YbCd2Sb2/Mg3(Sb, Bi)2 TE module with an ultrahigh conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.0% at a heat difference of 430&#160;K. More importantly, this module displays good thermal stability. This work paves the way for YbCd2Sb2 materials and devices in mid&#8208;temperature heat recovery.

Leveraging the transient liquid phase bonding technique, for the first time, a YbCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb, Bi)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; module with an ultrahigh conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.0% and good stability is successfully assembled.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, YbCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based Zintl compounds have been widely investigated owing to their extraordinary thermoelectric (TE) performance. However, its &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of anions that determined the valence band structure are split due to crystal field splitting that provides a good platform for band manipulation by doping/alloying and, more importantly, the YbCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based device has yet to be reported. In this work, single-phase YbCd&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is successfully obtained through precise chemical composition control. Then, YbMg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-alloying increases the cationic vacancy defect formation energy and further optimizes carrier concentration. Moreover, the band structure of YbCd&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is subtly manipulated, and the underlying mechanism is experimentally explored. Combined with the reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a high peak &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; value of &#8764;1.43 at 700&#160;K is obtained for YbCd&lt;sub&gt;1.425&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.475&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Subsequently, choosing Fe&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; as the diffusion barrier layer and adopting the transient liquid phase bonding technique, for the first time, it is demonstrated that YbCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb, Bi)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; TE module with an ultrahigh conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.0% at a heat difference of 430&#160;K. More importantly, this module displays good thermal stability. This work paves the way for YbCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; materials and devices in mid-temperature heat recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Additive Selection to Boost Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theoretical model driven by physical and chemical knowledge is proposed, summarizing descriptors and training sets through computational simulation combined with extensive literature. By integrating machine learning prediction and artificial intelligence clustering, electrolyte additives are screened and designed for Zn&#8208;ion batteries to achieve higher stability. Experimental verification confirms the practical applicability of this approach.








Abstract
In tackling the stability challenge of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) for large&#8208;scale energy storage, the adoption of electrolyte additive emerges as a practical solution. Unlike current trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods for selecting electrolyte additives, a data&#8208;driven strategy is proposed using theoretically computed surface free energy as a stability descriptor, benchmarked against experimental results. Numerous additives are calculated from existing literature, forming a database for machine learning (ML) training. Importantly, this ML model relies solely on experimental values, effectively addressing the challenge of large solvent molecule models that are difficult to handle with quantum chemistry computation. The interpretable linear regression algorithm identifies the number of heavy atoms in the additive molecule and the liquid surface tension as key factors. Artificial intelligence (AI) clustering categorizes additive molecules, identifying regions with the most significant impact on enhancing battery stability. Experimental verification successfully confirms the exceptional performance of 1,2,3&#8208;butanetriol and acetone in the optimal region. This integrated methodology, combining theoretical models, data&#8208;driven ML, and experimental validation, provides insights into the rational design of battery electrolyte additives.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarized PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 In&#8208;Plane Heterostructures with Tandem Catalytic Mechanism for Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanosheet assemblies composed of spin&#8208;polarized PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are precisely synthesized via a liquid&#8208;phase short&#8208;range atomic diffusion strategy. A multi&#8208;site tandem mechanism is revealed on the deliberate&#8208;engineered heterostructures &#9472;O2 molecules are initially activated and cleaved on Fe sites to form O* and OH*, which are then transferred to Pd sites for the following proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps.








Abstract
Alloying has significantly upgraded the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of Pd&#8208;based catalysts through regulating the thermodynamics of oxygenated intermediates. However, the unsatisfactory activation ability of Pd&#8208;based alloys toward O2 molecules limits further improvement of ORR kinetics. Herein, the precise synthesis of nanosheet assemblies of spin&#8208;polarized PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 in&#8208;plane heterostructures for drastically activating O2 molecules and boosting ORR kinetics is reported. It is demonstrated that the deliberate&#8208;engineered in&#8208;plane heterostructures not only tailor the d&#8208;band center of Pd sites with weakened adsorption of oxygenated intermediates but also endow electrophilic Fe sites with strong ability to activate O2 molecules, which make PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 in&#8208;plane heterostructures exhibit the highest ORR specific activity among the state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pd&#8208;based catalysts so far. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical investigations reveal a tandem catalytic mechanism on PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4&#9472;Fe sites that initially activate molecular O2 and generate oxygenated intermediates being transferred to Pd sites to finish the subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cell Modules by Mediated Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapor&#8208;to&#8208;solid deposition of high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films is developed via a new process based on a 2D intermediated phase. Efficiencies of 21.1% and 20.1% are achieved for perovskite modules with active areas of 12.5 and 48.0 cm2, respectively.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can enable renewable electricity generation at low levelized costs, subject to the invention of an economically feasible technology for their large&#8208;scale fabrication, like vapor deposition. This approach is effective for the fabrication of small area (&lt;1 cm2) PSCs, but its scale&#8208;up to produce high&#8208;efficiency larger area modules has been limited by a severe imbalance between the vapor&#8208;solid reaction kinetics and the mass&#8208;transport of the volatile ammonium salt precursor. In this study, an amidine&#8208;based low&#8208;dimensional perovskite is introduced as an intermediate of the solid&#8208;vapor reaction to help resolve this limitation. This improves reaction pathway produces unique vertically monolithic grains with no detectable horizontal boundaries, which is used to produce 1.0 cm2 PSCs with an efficiency of 22.1%, as well as 12.5 and 48 cm2 modules delivering 21.1% and 20.1% efficiency, respectively. The modules retain &#8776;85% of their initial performance after 900 h of continuous operation (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 protocol) and &#8776;100% after 2800 h of storage in an ambient environment (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1 protocol).

         <title>Lattice Match&#8208;Enabled Covalent Heterointerfaces with Built&#8208;in Electric Field for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;matched In2S3/CdS heterojunction with coherent heterointerface and built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) is crafted for efficient H2O2 photosynthesis. It features a covalent In&#9472;S&#9472;Cd bridge, an exceptionally low lattice mismatch of 0.27%, and a BIEF from In2S3 to CdS. It entails rapid charge separation and transfer, achieving an outstanding H2O2 production rate of 2.09 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without the need for scavengers and oxygen bubbling.








Abstract
Crafting semiconducting heterojunctions represents an effective route to enhance photocatalysis by improving interfacial charge separation and transport. However, lattice mismatch (&#948;) between different semiconductors can significantly hinder charge dynamics. Here, meticulous lattice tailoring is reported to create a covalent heterointerface with a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF), imparting markedly improved hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis. Specifically, an In2S3/CdS heterojunction with a coherent heterointerface, characterized by covalent In&#9472;S&#9472;Cd bridge and exceptionally low lattice mismatch of 0.27%, and a BIEF from In2S3 to CdS, is rationally designed. This heterojunction entails rapid charge separation and transfer, achieving an outstanding H2O2 production rate of 2.09 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without the need for scavengers and oxygen bubbling, and a high apparent quantum efficiency of 17.73% at 400 nm. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that this Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates the adsorption of *O2 and the generation of *OOH intermediates during the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction, associated with a low Gibbs free energy. This study underscores the significance of fine&#8208;tuning interfacial lattices and integrating BIEF to accelerate photocatalysis. The simple yet robust strategy can be conveniently leveraged to enhance device performance in optoelectronics, electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and sensing.

&lt;p&gt;A lattice-matched In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS heterojunction with coherent heterointerface and built-in electric field (BIEF) is crafted for efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis. It features a covalent In&#9472;S&#9472;Cd bridge, an exceptionally low lattice mismatch of 0.27%, and a BIEF from In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to CdS. It entails rapid charge separation and transfer, achieving an outstanding H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 2.09 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; without the need for scavengers and oxygen bubbling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crafting semiconducting heterojunctions represents an effective route to enhance photocatalysis by improving interfacial charge separation and transport. However, lattice mismatch (&lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;) between different semiconductors can significantly hinder charge dynamics. Here, meticulous lattice tailoring is reported to create a covalent heterointerface with a built-in electric field (BIEF), imparting markedly improved hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) photosynthesis. Specifically, an In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS heterojunction with a coherent heterointerface, characterized by covalent In&#9472;S&#9472;Cd bridge and exceptionally low lattice mismatch of 0.27%, and a BIEF from In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to CdS, is rationally designed. This heterojunction entails rapid charge separation and transfer, achieving an outstanding H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 2.09 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; without the need for scavengers and oxygen bubbling, and a high apparent quantum efficiency of 17.73% at 400 nm. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that this Z-scheme heterojunction facilitates the adsorption of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the generation of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OOH intermediates during the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction, associated with a low Gibbs free energy. This study underscores the significance of fine-tuning interfacial lattices and integrating BIEF to accelerate photocatalysis. The simple yet robust strategy can be conveniently leveraged to enhance device performance in optoelectronics, electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and sensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Bioprinting of Liquid High&#8208;Cell&#8208;Proportion Bioinks in Liquid Granular Bath</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are challenges for extrusion 3D bioprinting in simultaneously satisfying the requirements of high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion, and low&#8208;viscosity bioinks, which allows the establishment of improved cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication and enhanced biological. Here, liquid high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion GelMA are found to be printed in liquid granular through ink&#8208;bath electrostatic interaction, that is, liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid 3D bioprinting (LL3DBP).








Abstract
Embedded 3D bioprinting techniques have emerged as a powerful method to fabricate 3D engineered constructs&#160;using low strength bioinks; however, there are challenges in simultaneously satisfying the requirements of high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion, and low&#8208;viscosity bioinks. In particular, the printing capacity of embedded 3D bioprinting is limited as two main challenges: spreading and diffusion, especially for liquid, high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity bioinks that can facilitate high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion. Here, a liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid 3D bioprinting (LL3DBP) strategy is developed, which used a liquid granular bath to prevent the spreading of liquid bioinks during 3D printing, and electrostatic interaction between the liquid bioinks and liquid granular baths is found to effectively prevent the diffusion of liquid bioinks. As an example, the printing of positively charged 5% w/v gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) in a liquid granular bath prepared with negatively charged &#954;&#8208;carrageenan is proved to be achievable. By LL3DBP, printing capacity is greatly advanced and bioinks with over 90% v/v cell can be printed, and printed structures with high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion exhibit excellent bioactivity.

         <title>In Situ Molecular Reconfiguration of Pyrene Redox&#8208;Active Molecules for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural evolution of organic electrolysis is revealed at the molecular level in a flow battery and decreases the electrosynthesis yield of isomers and dimers with low electrochemical activity by more than one order of magnitude through pyrene precursor structure regulation. The molecular reconfigured pyrene&#8208;based catholytes achieved a high electrolyte utilization, electron concentration, and recordable cell performance without obvious capacity decay.








Abstract
Aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs) hold great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, however, scalable, green, and economical synthetic methods for stable organic redox&#8208;active molecules (ORAMs) are still required for their practical applications. Herein, pyrene&#8208;based ORAMs are obtained via an in situ organic electrolysis strategy in a flow cell. It is revealed that the water attacking pyrenes restructured molecules to produce a variety of isomers and dimers during the electrolysis, which can be modulated by regulating the local electron cloud density and steric hindrance of pyrene precursors. As a result, the molecularly reconfigured pyrene&#8208;based catholytes, even without any further purification, achieved a high electrolyte utilization of &#8776;96% and volumetric capacity above 50&#160;Ah&#160;L&#8722;1. Inspiringly, remarkable cell stability with almost no capacity decay for &#8776;70 days is achieved, benefiting from the robust aromatic structure of the pyrene cores. The insights into the in situ electrosynthesis of pyrene&#8208;based ORAMs provided in the work will provide guidance for designing ultra&#8208;stable ORAMs for AOFB applications.

         <title>Molecular Reconfiguration of Disordered Tellurium Oxide Transistors with Biomimetic Spectral Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable transistors and neuromorphic devices are realized through surface processes on disordered tellurium oxides. The enhanced surface interactions effectively regulate carrier concentration in the channel, leading to logic functions and biomimetic wavelength selectivity. This molecular reconfiguration strategy increases the integration level of circuits and significantly promotes the development of next&#8208;generation multifunctional electronic devices.








Abstract
Reconfigurable devices with field&#8208;effect transistor features and neuromorphic behaviors are promising for enhancing data processing capability and reducing power consumption in next&#8208;generation semiconductor platforms. However, commonly used 2D materials for reconfigurable devices require additional modulation terminals and suffer from complex and stringent operating rules to obtain specific functionalities. Here, a p&#8208;type disordered tellurium oxide is introduced that realizes dual&#8208;mode reconfigurability as a logic transistor and a neuromorphic device. Due to the disordered film surface, the enhanced adsorption of oxygen molecules and laser&#8208;induced desorption concurrently regulate the carrier concentration in the channel. The device exhibits high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type characteristics with a field&#8208;effect hole mobility of 10.02 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an Ion/Ioff ratio exceeding 106 in the transistor mode. As a neuromorphic device, the vision system exhibits biomimetic bee vision, explicitly responding to the blue&#8208;to&#8208;ultraviolet light. Finally, in&#8208;sensor denoising and invisible image recognition in static and dynamic scenarios are achieved.

         <title>Balancing Potassiophilicity and Catalytic Activity of Artificial Interface Layer for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium/Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon layer with a locally ordered structure has been developed as an artificial interface to achieve a balance between K affinity and catalytic activity, which can significantly enhance the cycle life of potassium metal batteries, achieving an impressive life of 2000 h at 0.5 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Potassium metal batteries (PMBs), with high energy density and low cost, are considered a promising option for grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, challenges such as the uneven nucleation of K and instability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer result in dendrite growth and poor cyclic performance, limiting practical application. To address them, constructing an artificial interface layer with rich defects can enhance the potassium affinity and promote the uniform nucleation of potassium, yet this can also catalyze electrolyte to decompose, leading to unstable SEI formation and poor cycle stability. Herein, a carbon layer with a locally ordered structure (SC&#8208;1600) is constructed as the artificial interface to achieve a balance between K affinity and catalytic activity. This optimized design allows for the uniform nucleation of potassium metal and the formation of a dense SEI layer. SC&#8208;1600@K symmetric cell can operate for 2000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and the developed full cell shows a high capacity retention of 78% after 1500 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1. Besides, SC&#8208;1600@Na effectively extend the life of sodium metal batteries. This work provides a new insight for the construction of efficient K metal artificial interface layer.

SC-1600@K symmetric cell can operate for 2000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a capacity of 0.5 mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the developed full cell shows a high capacity retention of 78% after 1500 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Besides, SC-1600@Na effectively extend the life of sodium metal batteries. This work provides a new insight for the construction of efficient K metal artificial interface layer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Narrowband Blue Phosphorescent Materials and Their Applications in 3D Printed Self&#8208;monitoring Microfluidic Chips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to achieve intrinsic narrowband blue phosphorescent materials is demonstrated. When doping guest molecules into hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA)&#8208;acrylic acid (AA) polymer matrix, narrowband phosphorescence with the full width at half maximum of 36 nm is achieved. 3D printed structures based on 2O&#8208;Cphpz@HEA&#8208;AA are also fabricated, expanding potential applications for self&#8208;monitoring the trajectories of droplet by optical methods.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials, especially with narrowband emission properties, exhibit great potential for applications in display and sensing, but have been seldom reported. Herein, a rare example of the intrinsic narrowband blue RTP material is fabricated and reported. A series of indolo[3,2,1&#8208;kl]phenothiazine derivatives, named Cphpz, 1O&#8208;Cphpz, and 2O&#8208;Cphpz, are designed and synthesized. Due to their relatively rigid structures, these three compounds showed deep blue narrowband emissions ranging from 396 to 434&#160;nm with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 31, 26, and 31&#160;nm, respectively. To the delight, compound 2O&#8208;Cphpz displayed intrinsic narrowband blue RTP at 448 nm with FWHM of 36 nm and a long&#8208;lived lifetime of 1.08 s in hydroxyethyl acrylate and acrylic acid matrix. Photophysical studies, single crystal analyses, and TD&#8208;DFT calculations are performed to elucidate further the relationships between molecular structures and the narrowband blue RTP properties. Meanwhile, because the narrowband blue RTP is highly sensitive to humidity, a visualizing droplet path optical microfluidic chip is efficiently fabricated through the digital light processing 3D printing.This work provides a rare example and a reliable strategy to realize narrowband blue RTP and further expand their applications in self&#8208;monitoring 3D printed structures.

         <title>Embedding Reverse Electron Transfer Between Stably Bare Cu Nanoparticles and Cation&#8208;Vacancy CuWO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An embedded cation&#8208;vacancy metal&#8208;oxide interface is developed to induce the reverse strong metal&#8208;support interactions in Cu NPs, which inhibits its surface oxidation in ambient air, high&#8208;temperature agglomeration, and CO poisoning adsorption. In contrast to the Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood mechanism observed in the deposited Cu NPs, the exsolved electron&#8208;enriched Cu NPs with anion oxygen protective layers follow the Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism during CO oxidation.








Abstract
Cu nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted widespread attention in electronics, energy, and catalysis. However, conventionally synthesized Cu NPs face some challenges such as surface passivation and agglomeration in applications, which impairs their functionalities in the physicochemical properties. Here, the issues above by engineering an embedded interface of stably bare Cu NPs on the cation&#8208;vacancy CuWO4 support is addressed, which induces the strong metal&#8208;support interactions and reverse electron transfer. Various atomic&#8208;scale analyses directly demonstrate the unique electronic structure of the embedded Cu NPs with negative charge and anion oxygen protective layer, which mitigates the typical degradation pathways such as oxidation in ambient air, high&#8208;temperature agglomeration, and CO poisoning adsorption. Kinetics and in situ spectroscopic studies unveil that the embedded electron&#8208;enriched Cu NPs follow the typical Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism in CO oxidation, contrasting the Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood mechanism on the traditional Cu NPs. This mechanistic shift is driven by the Coulombic repulsion in anion oxygen layer, enabling its direct reaction with gaseous CO to form the easily desorbed monodentate carbonate.

         <title>Functional Carbon Springs Enabled Dynamic Tunable Microwave Absorption and Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional carbon spring (FCS) aerogels possess dynamic tunable microwave absorption and excellent thermal insulation due to their unique lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure. This design resolves the current conflict in co&#8208;optimizing these functions, providing the best &#8220;electromagnetic&#8208;thermal&#8221; dual protection known.









Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave pollution and thermal damage pose serious hazards to delicate instruments. Functional aerogels offer a promising solution by mitigating EM interference and isolating heat. However, most of these materials struggle to balance thermal protection with microwave absorption (MA) efficiency due to a previously unidentified conflict between the optimizing strategies of the two properties. Herein, this study reports a solution involving the design of a carbon&#8208;based aerogel called functional carbon spring (FCS). Its unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure enables tunable MA performance and excellent thermal insulation capability. Adjusting compression strain from 0% to 50%, the adjustable effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) spans up to 13.4&#160;GHz, covering 84% of the measured frequency spectrum. Notably, at 75% strain, the EAB drops to 0&#160;GHz, demonstrating a novel &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; switchability for MA performance. Its ultralow vertical thermal conductivity (12.7&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and unique anisotropic heat transfer mechanism endow FCS with superior thermal protection effectiveness. Numerical simulations demonstrate that FCS outperforms common honeycomb structures and isotropic porous aerogels in thermal management. Furthermore, an &#8220;electromagnetic&#8208;thermal&#8221; dual&#8208;protection material database is established, which intuitively demonstrates the superiority of the solution. This work contributes to the advancement of multifunctional MA materials with significant potential for practical applications.

         <title>Dynamic Lock&#8208;And&#8208;Release Mechanism Enables Reduced &#916;G at Low Temperatures for High&#8208;Performance Polyanionic Cathode in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;adaptive coordination field regulation (SACFR) strategy, underpinned by a dynamic lock&#8208;and&#8208;release (DLR) mechanism, is proposed for the first time to dynamically regulate the coordination field of reactant ions. This dynamic regulation improves reaction kinetics and reduces &#916;G at low temperatures, enabling the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)2F cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature synthesis of polyanionic cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries is highly desirable but often plagued by prolonged reaction times and suboptimal crystallinity. To address these challenges, a novel self&#8208;adaptive coordination field regulation (SACFR) strategy based on a dynamic lock&#8208;and&#8208;release (DLR) mechanism is introduced. Specifically, urea is used as a DLR carrier during synthesis, which dynamically &#8220;locks&#8221; and &#8220;releases&#8221; vanadium ions for controlled release, simultaneously &#8220;locking&#8221; H+ ions to enhance phosphate group release, thereby creating a self&#8208;adaptive coordination field that can intelligently respond to real&#8208;time demands of the reaction system. This dynamic coordination behavior contributes to both an improvement in reaction kinetics and a significant reduction in Gibbs free energy change (&#916;G). As a result, the kinetic efficiency and thermodynamic spontaneity of the reaction are greatly enhanced, enabling the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) at 90 &#176;C within just 3 hours. The as&#8208;prepared NVOPF cathode exhibits exceptional rate performance and ultra&#8208;stable cycling stability across a broad temperature range. Furthermore, the successful kilogram&#8208;scale synthesis underscores the practical potential of the innovative strategy. This work pioneers the regulation of coordination field chemistry for polyanionic cathode synthesis, providing transformative insights into material design.

         <title>Ionized Phenanthroline Derivatives Suppressing Interface Chemical Interactions with Active Layer for High&#8208;efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Exceptional Device Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel alcohol&#8208;soluble phenanthroline derivative, tbp&#8208;PhenBr, is innovatively designed and synthesized as cathode interlayer material, which can effectively suppress interface chemical interactions with the non&#8208;fullerene active layer for high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells with exceptional device stability.








Abstract
The contact interface between the charge transport interlayer and the active layer is crucial for the non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells (NF OSCs) to achieve high efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. In this study, two novel phenanthroline (Phen) derivatives, tbp&#8208;Phen and tbp&#8208;PhenBr, are developed as efficient cathode interfacial materials (CIMs). The larger steric hindrance substituents and the ionization of nitrogen atoms on the Phen framework jointly enable the tbp&#8208;PhenBr CIM with a stable film morphology and immensely suppress the detrimental interface chemical interactions with the NF active layer. Consequently, tbp&#8208;PhenBr&#8208;based OSC achieves a higher efficiency (PCE&#160;=&#160;16.34%) than bathocuproine (BCP)&#8208;based control device (PCE&#160;=&#160;13.70%) using PM6:Y6 as the active layer. More importantly, the tbp&#8208;PhenBr&#8208;based device maintains 80% of its initial efficiency (T80) for 3264 h in dark conditions and 220 h after being heated at 85&#160;&#176;C, significantly outperforming the BCP&#8208;based device. The tbp&#8208;PhenBr CIM also shows broad applicability across various binary and ternary active layer systems, affording a notable PCE of 19.49%. Additionally, the tbp&#8208;PhenBr CIM can be processed via a thermal evaporation technique and the prepared devices exhibit high reproducibility. This work provides innovative insights into the molecular design of the CIMs for stable and efficient NF OSCs.

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Adjustable, Deformable, and Packable Wireless Charging Fiber Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated wireless charging fiber supercapacitor developed by only one fiber features with adjustable size (2&#8211;20&#160;cm diameter circle), arbitrary shape and controllable wireless charging energy (0.003&#8211;313&#160;mW power), exhibiting extraordinary energy density at 1004 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Wireless charging energy storage devices eliminate bulky wires of wearable electronics. However, rigid shape and specific charging energy restrict their applications in space&#8208;limited portable electronics. Herein, an all&#8208;carbon fiber supercapacitor is presented that features shape&#8208;adjustable, packable, and energy&#8208;controllable wireless charging functions. With the unique on&#8208;dimensional circuit structure, the maximum energy transfer efficiency from the electrical energy received by the wireless charging unit to the output energy of the fiber supercapacitor can reach up to &#8776;60.8%, and meanwhile this integrated fiber device exhibits an outstanding area capacity of 803 mF cm&#8722;2 and energy density of 1004 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2, superior to most of the fiber supercapacitors. Moreover, this unique device can endure significant deformation in shape of circles ranging from 2 to 20&#160;cm diameter, and can be packed into narrow spaces, such as smart bracelet and disk&#8208;shaped pet global positioning system (GPS). By altering the device shape, the wireless charging current, voltage, and power can be adjusted in the range of 0.5&#8211;20&#160;mA, 1.4&#8211;15.5&#160;V, and 0.003&#8211;313&#160;mW, accommodating the energy requirements for nearly all existing micro&#8208;electronics. This work offers unprecedented opportunities for packable, space&#8208;confined and energy harvesting controllable wearable electronics.

         <title>Enhancing the Filler Utilization of Composite Gel Electrolytes via In Situ Solution&#8208;Processable Method for Sustainable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable method is developed to fabricate composite gel electrolytes with high filler utilization. Uniform distributed UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 fillers enhance its mechanical toughness, ionic conductivity, and cation transference number, and stabilize the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This strategy enables the sodium&#8208;ion batteries to achieve excellent cycling and wide&#8208;temperature performance.








Abstract
The composite gel electrolyte (CGE), which combines the advantages of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes and solid polymer electrolytes, is regarded as the ultimate candidate for constructing batteries with high safety and superior electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface contact. However, the ubiquitous agglomeration of nanofillers results in low filler utilization, which seriously reduces structural uniformity and ion transport efficiency, thus restricting the development of consistent and durable batteries. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable method to in situ construct CGE with high filler utilization is introduced. The homogeneous metal&#8211;organic framework fillers contribute to uniform ionic and electronic filed distribution, realizing a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Consequently, the CGE with high filler utilization achieves an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 10&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80.2%. This work provides guidance for constructing high&#8208;performance CGEs in electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Amorphous to Crystalline Transition in Nanoimprinted Sol&#8211;Gel Titanium Oxide Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wafer&#8208;scale manufacturing platform is introduced for crystalline TiO2 metasurfaces. Anatase or rutile metalenses are fabricated via thermal nanoimprint lithography and sintering. The high refractive index enhances conversion efficiency and numerical aperture. These metalenses demonstrate diffraction&#8208;limited focusing and imaging capabilities, showcasing the potential of crystalline TiO2 in advanced flat optics for improved performance in various applications.








Abstract
Crystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) (anatase and rutile) possesses a higher refractive index than amorphous TiO2 and near&#8208;zero absorption in the visible region, making them an ideal material for visible metasurfaces. However, fabrication limitations hinder their implementation into flat optics. In this work, a wafer&#8208;scale manufacturing platform is proposed for crystalline TiO2 metasurfaces. Sol&#8211;gel TiO2 is developed as a printable material in which its material phase can be precisely controlled to produce amorphous, anatase, or rutile, depending on the crystallization temperature. Therefore, anatase or rutile metalenses can be fabricated on a wafer scale using thermal nanoimprint lithography and sintering process. The high refractive index of the crystalline TiO2 contributes to the enhanced conversion efficiency of the fabricated metalenses. The fabricated metalenses exhibit diffraction&#8208;limited focusing and imaging capabilities, comparable to the theoretically ideal lenses.

Precise control over gene delivery in 3D can refine tissue models providing insights into the complex, multicellular processes underlying development, degeneration, and disease progression. This work presents an optoporation strategy based on light&#8208;responsive porous silicon nanoparticles for the spatially&#8208;resolved transfection of organoids.








Abstract
Engineering the spatial organisation of organotypic cultures is pivotal for refining tissue models that are useful for gaining deeper insights into complex, non&#8208;cell autonomous processes. These advanced models are key to improving the understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. Controlling gene regulation through spatially&#8208;resolved delivery of nucleic acids provides an attractive approach to produce such tissue models. An emerging strategy for spatially&#8208;resolved transfection uses photosensitizing nanoparticles coupled with laser pulses to optoporate cells in culture and locally mediate gene delivery. However, localized optoporation in 3D systems remains challenging. Here we propose a solution to this longstanding hurdle, demonstrating that porous silicon nanoparticles are a safe and bioresorbable photosensitising nanomaterial capable of spatially&#8208;resolved transfection of mRNA in MCF&#8208;7 organoids by near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon optoporation. Functionalization with an azobenzene&#8211;lysine photo&#8208;switchable moiety enhances the transfection efficiency of the nanoparticles up to 84% in a 2D cell system. Moreover, the nanoparticles enable spatially selective mRNA transfection to MCF&#8208;7 spheroids, demonstrating targeted &#160;gene delivery in complex 3D cellular environments. The approach for spatially&#8208;resolved 3D optoporation offers a way forward for the design of tailored spheroids and organoids by spatially selective nucleic acids delivery.

         <title>Optimization of Charge Extraction and Interconnecting Layers for Highly Efficient Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells with High Fill Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developshighly efficient perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSC) via the simultaneous optimization of quaternary organic BHJ blend, and reduction of optical and electrical losses of interconnecting layers via self&#8208;assembly monolayer. The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.56% (certified: 24.65%), with a record fill factor (FF) of 83.62% of all types of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) till now.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential for achieving high photovoltaic (PV) performance. However, the reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and fill factors (FFs) are still subpar due to the challenges associated with charge extraction in the organic bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) and significant energy losses in the interconnecting layers (ICLs). Here, a quaternary organic BHJ blend is developed to enhance the charge extraction in the organic subcell, contributing to an increased FF of &#8805;78% under 1 sun illumination and even more under lower illumination intensities. Meanwhile, energy losses in the ICLs are reduced via the incorporation of a self&#8208;assembly monolayer (SAM), (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz), in organic BHJ to form a MoOx/SAM interface and the thorough control of the MoOx thickness to suppress parasitic absorption. The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable PCE of 25.56% (certified: 24.65%), with a record FF of 83.62%, which is among the highest PCEs of POTSCs and the highest FF of all types of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) till now. This work proves the optimization of charge extraction and ICLs are effective strategies to promote the performance of POTSCs to surpass other solution&#8208;processed perovskite&#8208;based TSCs in the near future.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of MXenes in Minutes via Low&#8208;Temperature Molten Salt Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes, including Ti3C2Tx, V4C3Tx, Nb4C3Tx, Mo2TiC2Tx, and Mo2CTx, can be rapidly synthesized via the low&#8208;temperature (130&#8211;195&#160;&#176;C) NH4HF2 molten salt etching process from their corresponding MAX phases in just 5&#8211;40&#160;min. This low&#8208;temperature molten salt etching method is easy to scale up and can yield more than 100&#160;g MXene in a single reaction.








Abstract
Developing green and efficient preparation strategies is a persistent pursuit in the field of 2D transition metal nitrides and/or carbides (MXenes). Traditional etching methods, such as HF&#8208;based or high&#8208;temperature Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;molten&#8208;salt etching route, require harsher etching conditions and exhibit lower preparation efficiency with limited scalability, severely constraining their commercial production and practical application. Here, an ultrafast low&#8208;temperature molten salt (LTMS) etching method is presented for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of diverse MXenes within minutes by employing NH4HF2 as the etchant. The increased thermal motion and improved diffusion of molten NH4HF2 molecules significantly expedite the etching process of MAX phases, thus achieving the preparation of Ti3C2Tx MXene in just 5&#160;minutes. The universality of the LTMS method renders it a valuable approach for the rapid synthesis of various MXenes, including V4C3Tx, Nb4C3Tx, Mo2TiC2Tx, and Mo2CTx. The LTMS method is easy to scale up and can yield more than 100&#160;g Ti3C2Tx in a single reaction. The obtained LTMS&#8208;MXene exhibits excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors, evidently proving the effectiveness of the LTMS method. This work provides an ultrafast, universal, and scalable LTMS etching method for the large&#8208;scale commercial production of MXenes.

         <title>Iodide Management and Oriented Crystallization Modulation for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Air Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up, all&#8208;in&#8208;one modification strategy is proposed by introducing a multisite antioxidant ergothioneine (EGT) at the buried interface to manage iodide ions and manipulate crystallization dynamics. The EGT&#8208;optimization firmly anchors I&#8722; and inhibits their oxidation to I2. The optimized all&#8208;air processed device achieves a remarkable PCE of 25.13%, which is among the highest values reported for devices fabricated in air.








Abstract
Halide&#8208;related defects at the buried interface not only cause nonradiative recombination, but also seriously impair the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a bottom&#8208;up, all&#8208;in&#8208;one modification strategy is proposed by introducing a multisite antioxidant ergothioneine (EGT) at the buried interface to manage iodide ions and manipulate crystallization dynamics. The findings demonstrate that EGT not only passivates uncoordinated Sn4+/Pb2+ defects, but also firmly anchors iodide ions and inhibits their oxidation to I2. Additionally, the modification by EGT enhances the oriented crystallization of perovskite, improves the carrier dynamics, and releases residual stresses. Consequently, the optimized all&#8208;air processed device (Rb0.02(FA0.95Cs0.05)0.98PbI2.91Br0.03Cl0.06) achieves a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.13%, which is among the highest values reported for devices fabricated in air, along with ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.191&#160;V and fill factor (FF) of 84.9%. The optimized device without encapsulation exhibits strong humidity, thermal, and operational stability under ISOS protocol. Specifically, the initial efficiency of the device is retained at 90.12% after 1512 h of thermal ageing at 65&#160;&#176;C and 90.14% after 930 h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under simulated AM1.5 illumination.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Actuated Ferroptosis Nanomotor for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;driven ROS self&#8208;supplying Z@P&#8208;F nanomotor with efficient lysosome escape and enhanced tumor penetration is successfully developed for synergistic tumor CDT/PTT. By releasing Fe2+ and H2O2 under NIR irradiation and acidic TME, Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors continuously generate large amounts of lipid ROS in the tumor and deplete intracellular GSH, thus facilitating Fe2+&#8208;mediated ferroptosis and eventually achieving effective tumor eradication.








Abstract
Ferroptosis nano&#8208;inducers have drawn considerable attention in the treatment of malignant tumors. However, low intratumoral hydrogen peroxide level and complex biological barriers hinder the ability of nanomedicines to generate sufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve tumor penetration. Here a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;driven ROS self&#8208;supplying nanomotor is successfully designed for synergistic tumor chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Janus nanomotor is created by the asymmetrical modification of polydopamine (PDA) with zinc peroxide (ZnO2) and subsequent ferrous ion (Fe2+) chelation via the polyphenol groups from the PDA, here refer as ZnO2@PDA&#8208;Fe (Z@P&#8208;F). ZnO2 is capable of slowly releasing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into an acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) providing sufficient ingredients for the Fenton reaction necessary for ferroptosis. Upon NIR laser irradiation, the loaded Fe2+ is released and a thermal gradient is simultaneously formed owing to the asymmetric PDA coating, thus endowing the nanomotor with self&#8208;thermophoresis based enhanced diffusion for subsequent lysosomal escape and tumor penetration. Therefore, the release of ferrous ions (Fe2+), self&#8208;supplied H2O2, and self&#8208;thermophoresis of nanomotors with NIR actuation further improve the synergistic CDT/PTT efficacy, showing great potential for active tumor therapy.

         <title>Construction of COF/COF Organic S&#8208;Scheme Heterostructure for Enhanced Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of organic COF/COF heterojunction with an S&#8208;scheme charge transfer pathway is designed for enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting without sacrificial agents, and the record high visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 and O2 evolution rates achieved for COF&#8208;316/Pt@TpBpy&#8208;COF.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as a new type of photocatalysts have shown unique advantages in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution, while the reported overall water&#8208;splitting systems are still very rare among various COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Herein, two COFs are integrated to construct a type of organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunction for improved overall water splitting. In this system, TpBpy&#8208;COF and COF&#8208;316 serve as H2&#8208; and O2&#8208;evolving components, respectively, which are combined through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between conjugated aromatic rings. By introducing ultra&#8208;small Pt nanoparticles (NPs) into the pores of the TpBpy&#8208;COF nanosheets (NS), the resultant COF&#8208;316/Pt@TpBpy&#8208;COF NS heterostructure achieves extremely high H2 and O2 evolution rates of 220.4 and 110.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, respectively, under visible light irradiation (&#955; &#8805; 420&#160;nm). The results of transient absorption spectra (TAS) and photoelectronic measurements indicate that the organic heterojunction interface notably facilitates the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. Further, theoretical calculations and in situ experiments confirm the spontaneous formation of the COF/COF heterojunction interface and the active sites for overall water splitting.

         <title>Boosting the Quantum Efficiency of Ionic Carbon Nitrides in Photocatalytic H2O2 Evolution via Controllable n &#8594; &#960;* Electronic Transition Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable activation of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition is presented to boost the photocatalytic H2O2 evolution in ionic carbon nitrides through the simultaneous introduction of structural distortions and defect sites. The best catalyst (2%Ox&#8208;KPHI) shows an apparent quantum yield of 41% at 410&#160;nm without the need for any cocatalysts, outperforming most previously reported carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial chemical used in numerous industrial applications, yet its manufacturing relies on the energy&#8208;demanding anthraquinone process. Solar&#8208;driven synthesis of H2O2 is gaining traction as a promising research area, providing a sustainable method for its production. Herein, a controllable activation of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition is presented to boost the photocatalytic H2O2 evolution in ionic carbon nitrides. This enhancement is achieved through the simultaneous introduction of structural distortions and defect sites (&#9472;C &#8801; N groups and N vacancies) into the KPHI framework. The optimal catalyst (2%Ox&#8208;KPHI) reached an apparent quantum yield of 41% at 410&#160;nm without the need for any cocatalysts, outperforming most previously reported carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts. Extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that a corrugated configuration and the presence of defects significantly broaden the light absorption profile, improve carrier separation and migration, promote O2 adsorption, and lower the energy barriers for H2O2 desorption. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicates that the enhanced photocatalytic performance of 2%Ox&#8208;KPHI is largely attributed to the preferential migration of electrons at defect sites over extended timescales, following the diffusion of geminate carriers across the PHI sheets.

CAT&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Macrophages
A roller, equipped with needle tires and loaded with CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, traversed this road. CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms appear like graceful angels, clearing away DPP4+ fibroblasts and regulating the fibrotic phenotype of vascular endothelial cells. The &#8220;scarred road&#8221; undergoes a transformation into smooth and flat road following compaction by a roller. More details can be found in article number 2406153 by Wen Zeng and co&#8208;workers.

Self&#8208;Thermophoretic Nanomotor
Self&#8208;thermophoresis confers Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors motility to achieve enhanced deep tumor penetration and therapy. By releasing massive Fe2+ and H2O2, Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors continuously generate ROS in the tumor, thus eventually achieving effective tumor ferroptosis. More details can be found in article number 2412227 by Yingfeng Tu, Fei Peng, Hao Tian, and co&#8208;workers.

3D Bioprinting of Liquid High&#8208;Cell&#8208;Proportion Bioinks
In extrusion&#8208;based bioprinting, bioinks have long been subject to trade&#8208;offs between physicochemical properties and biological outcomes. Due to insufficient viscosity, liquid bioinks have been considered unprintable. In article number 2412127, Lei Shao, Yong He, Xueping Wang and co&#8208;workers developed a liquid granular bath that enables embedded 3D bioprinting of liquid, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion bioinks to address this challenge.

         <title>Recent Progress on 3D Printing of Lightweight Metal Thin&#8208;Walled Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Additive manufacturing (AM) has become an integral part of industry to manufacture complex parts with a shorter turnaround time. Metal thin&#8208;walled structures are ubiquitous in many of these parts. This review aims to discuss the structure design of additively manufactured metal thin walls and the impact that thin walls have on the geometrical accuracy, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the part.








Abstract
Metal thin&#8208;walled structures are ubiquitous in various industrial applications and fabricating them through additive manufacturing (AM) enables intricate thin&#8208;wall geometries with no assembly required. However, additively manufactured metal thin walls suffer from increased heat accumulation and reduced structural stability, making it difficult to print geometrically accurate thin walls with minimal distortion and defects. Thin&#8208;walled structures also experience different thermal histories and solidification conditions compared to bulk structures, leading to drastic differences in the microstructure and mechanical properties. In this review article, the AM processing of metal thin&#8208;walled structures will be introduced. An in&#8208;depth discussion on the design strategies of additively manufactured metal thin walls will be presented regarding the restrictions imposed by the AM technology, the integration of thin walls in lightweight structures, and novel design ideation through topology optimization. The effects that the thin wall design has on the geometrical accuracy, microstructure, and mechanical properties will then be elucidated. The utilization of AM for fabricating metal thin walls across various industries will also be summarized. Finally, this review article will close on some perspectives and future work on the AM of metal thin&#8208;walled structures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal thin-walled structures are ubiquitous in various industrial applications and fabricating them through additive manufacturing (AM) enables intricate thin-wall geometries with no assembly required. However, additively manufactured metal thin walls suffer from increased heat accumulation and reduced structural stability, making it difficult to print geometrically accurate thin walls with minimal distortion and defects. Thin-walled structures also experience different thermal histories and solidification conditions compared to bulk structures, leading to drastic differences in the microstructure and mechanical properties. In this review article, the AM processing of metal thin-walled structures will be introduced. An in-depth discussion on the design strategies of additively manufactured metal thin walls will be presented regarding the restrictions imposed by the AM technology, the integration of thin walls in lightweight structures, and novel design ideation through topology optimization.

         <title>Boosting Light&#8722;Matter Interactions in Plasmonic Nanogaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic nanogap systems enhance optical processes via antenna or cavity plasmon modes, which are influenced by gap morphology. Emitters such as self&#8208;assembled monolayer molecules, quantum dots, and 2D materials couple within the nanogaps. The resulting enhanced optical processes include Raman scattering, infrared absorption, nonlinear optics, photoluminescence, strong coupling, electroluminescence, and photochemistry.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanogaps in strongly coupled metal nanostructures can confine light to nanoscale regions, leading to huge electric field enhancement. This unique capability makes plasmonic nanogaps powerful platforms for boosting light&#8211;matter interactions, thereby enabling the rapid development of novel phenomena and applications. This review traces the progress of nanogap systems characterized by well&#8208;defined morphologies, controllable optical responses, and a focus on achieving extreme performance. The properties of plasmonic gap modes in far&#8208;field resonance and near&#8208;field enhancement are explored and a detailed comparative analysis of nanogap fabrication techniques down to sub&#8208;nanometer scales is provided, including bottom&#8208;up, top&#8208;down, and their combined approaches. Additionally, recent advancements and applications across various frontier research areas are highlighted, including surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy, plasmon&#8208;exciton strong coupling, nonlinear optics, optoelectronic devices, and other applications beyond photonics. Finally, the challenges and promising emerging directions in the field are discussed, such as light&#8208;driven atomic effects, molecular optomechanics, and alternative new materials.

         <title>Multifunctional Strategies of Advanced Electrocatalysts for Efficient Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an in&#8208;depth exploration of engineering modification strategies for catalytic materials and their promising applications in C&#9472;N coupling for urea electrosynthesis. Additionally, it highlights the significance of integrating diverse modification strategies to improve the efficiency of C&#9472;N coupling in urea synthesis. Finally, the review evaluates the potential challenges and opportunities that catalytic materials for C&#9472;N coupling may encounter in the path toward future commercialization.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrogenous species (such as N2, NO, NO2&#8722;, and NO3&#8722;) for urea synthesis under ambient conditions has been extensively studied due to their potential to realize carbon/nitrogen neutrality and mitigate environmental pollution, as well as provide a means to store renewable electricity generated from intermittent sources such as wind and solar power. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics and the scarcity of active sites on electrocatalysts have significantly hindered the advancement of their practical applications. Multifunctional engineering of electrocatalysts has been rationally designed and investigated to adjust their electronic structures, increase the density of active sites, and optimize the binding energies to enhance electrocatalytic performance. Here, surface engineering, defect engineering, doping engineering, and heterostructure engineering strategies for efficient nitrogen electro&#8208;reduction are comprehensively summarized. The role of each element in engineered electrocatalysts is elucidated at the atomic level, revealing the intrinsic active site, and understanding the relationship between atomic structure and catalytic performance. This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of electrocatalytic reactions of waste nitrogenous species into urea. Moreover, this review outlines the challenges and opportunities for urea synthesis and aims to facilitate further research into the development of advanced electrocatalysts for a sustainable future.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Based Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key green energy oxidant with growing interest. This review examines non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR), aiming to optimize H2O2 production through active site regulation, heterometallic effects, oxygen vacancy engineering, and local electronic environment. It suggests a future research direction for more advanced catalyst design.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a high&#8208;value chemical widely used in electronics, textiles, paper bleaching, medical disinfection, and wastewater treatment. Traditional production methods, such as the anthraquinone oxidation process and direct synthesis, require high energy consumption, and involve risks from toxic substances and explosions. Researchers are now exploring photochemical, electrochemical, and photoelectrochemical synthesis methods to reduce energy use and pollution. This review focuses on the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) for the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, and discusses how catalyst active sites influence O2 adsorption. Strategies to enhance H2O2 selectivity by regulating these sites are presented. Catalysts require strong O2 adsorption to initiate reactions and weak *OOH adsorption to promote H2O2 formation. The review also covers advances in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), multi&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts, and highlights non&#8208;noble metal oxides, especially perovskite oxides, for their versatile structures and potential in 2e&#8722; ORR. The potential of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects to enhance catalyst performance is also discussed. In conclusion, emphasis is placed on optimizing catalyst structures through theoretical and experimental methods to achieve efficient and selective H2O2 production, aiming for sustainable and commercial applications.

         <title>Breathable and Stretchable Epidermal Electronics for Health Management: Recent Advances and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the latest advancements in stretchable and breathable epidermal electronics for personalized healthcare. It examines the design principles, fabrication techniques, and practical applications of porous substrates, highlighting their advantages in terms of breathability, biocompatibility, and mechanical robustness. Key challenges and future directions for developing high&#8208;performance on&#8208;skin electronics are also discussed.








Abstract
Advanced epidermal electronic devices, capable of real&#8208;time monitoring of physical, physiological, and biochemical signals and administering appropriate therapeutics, are revolutionizing personalized healthcare technology. However, conventional portable electronic devices are predominantly constructed from impermeable and rigid materials, which thus leads to the mechanical and biochemical disparities between the devices and human tissues, resulting in skin irritation, tissue damage, compromised signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR), and limited operational lifespans. To address these limitations, a new generation of wearable on&#8208;skin electronics built on stretchable and porous substrates has emerged. These substrates offer significant advantages including breathability, conformability, biocompatibility, and mechanical robustness, thus providing solutions for the aforementioned challenges.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced epidermal electronic devices, capable of real-time monitoring of physical, physiological, and biochemical signals and administering appropriate therapeutics, are revolutionizing personalized healthcare technology. However, conventional portable electronic devices are predominantly constructed from impermeable and rigid materials, which thus leads to the mechanical and biochemical disparities between the devices and human tissues, resulting in skin irritation, tissue damage, compromised signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and limited operational lifespans. To address these limitations, a new generation of wearable on-skin electronics built on stretchable and porous substrates has emerged. These substrates offer significant advantages including breathability, conformability, biocompatibility, and mechanical robustness, thus providing solutions for the aforementioned challenges. However, given their diverse nature and varying application scenarios, the careful selection and engineering of suitable substrates is paramount when developing high-performance on-skin electronics tailored to specific applications. This comprehensive review begins with an overview of various stretchable porous substrates, specifically focusing on their fundamental design principles, fabrication processes, and practical applications. Subsequently, a concise comparison of various methods is offered to fabricate epidermal electronics by applying these porous substrates. Following these, the latest advancements and applications of these electronics are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges are summarized and potential future directions in this dynamic field are explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Inorganic Nanomaterials Characterized by Advanced TEM: A Qualitative and Quantitative Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Focusing on chiral inorganic nanomaterials (CINMs), this review elucidates how advanced TEM techniques facilitate precise qualitative analysis of CINMs, including chiral atomic&#8208;level features, 0D, 1D, and 2D nanocrystals, and assemblies. It also highlights quantitative methods for determining chirality, such as 3D electron tomography, and discusses the evolution of chiral structures as monitored by the ex situ and in situ TEM technologies.








Abstract
Chiral inorganic nanomaterials (CINMs) have garnered significant interest due to their exceptional optical, electronic, and catalytic properties, offering promising advancements in energy conversion, data storage, catalysis, and biomedicine. While traditional optical spectrophotometers reveal the chiroptical performance of CINMs on an ensemble level, the direct structural visualization for the qualitative and quantitative discernment of their chiral features has become increasingly distinct with the advancements of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The need for reasonable and high&#8208;standard discrimination requirements of CINMs has driven the progress of chirality&#8208;based TEM technologies. Therefore, this review in the good season takes the initiative to summarize the current advancements in TEM technologies for CINMs characterization, emphasizing a qualitative analysis of chiral atomic&#8208;level features, 0D, 1D, and 2D nanocrystals, and assembled nanomaterials. Then, the quantitative methods for determining chirality is also highlighted, such as 3D electron tomography, and further address the evolution of chiral structures monitored by the Ex&#8208;situ and In&#8208;situ TEM technologies. By providing a roadmap for the current challenges and proposing future advancements in TEM technologies for the qualitative, quantitative, and real&#8208;time analysis of CINMs, it can drive innovations in the field of chiral nanomaterials as well as the development of TEM technologies.

         <title>Sensing Interfaces Engineering for Organic Thin Film Transistors&#8208;Based Biosensors: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs)&#8208;based biosensors are fascinating due to their properties of low cost, label&#8208;free, and inherent signal amplification. The review provides a comprehensive and timely review of optimization in sensing interface engineering, and how efficient immobilization of biological sensing probes on sensing interfaces can contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors.








Abstract
Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) enable rapid and label&#8208;free high&#8208;sensitivity detection of target analytes due to their low cost, large&#8208;area processing, biocompatibility, and inherent signal amplification. At the same time, the freedom of synthesis, tailorability, and functionalization of organic semiconductor materials and their ability to be combined with flexible substrates make them one of the ideal platforms for biosensing. However, OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors still face significant challenges, such as unexpected surface adsorption, disordered conformation, inhomogeneous graft density, and flexibility of probe molecules that biological sensing probes would face during immobilization. In this review, efficient immobilization strategies based on OTFTs biological sensing probes developed in the last 5 years are highlighted. First, the biosensors are classified according to their sensing interface. Second, a comprehensive discussion of the types of biological sensing probes is presented. Third, three commonly used methods for immobilizing biological sensing probes and their challenges are briefly described. Finally, the applications of OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors for liquid phase detection are summarized. This review provides a comprehensive and timely review of optimization in sensing interface engineering so that efficient immobilization of biological sensing probes with sensing interfaces will contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors.
