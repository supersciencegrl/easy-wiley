         <title>Multiterminal Quantized Conductance in InSb Nanocrosses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for growth of high quality InSb nanocrosses by molecular beam epitaxy are developed, and electrical measurements at low temperature demonstrate ballistic transport in the individual nanowire terminals and through the junction.








Abstract
By studying the time&#8208;dependent axial and radial growth of InSb nanowires (NWs), the conditions for the synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline InSb nanocrosses (NCs) by molecular beam epitaxy are mapped. Low&#8208;temperature electrical measurements of InSb NC devices with local gate control on individual terminals exhibit quantized conductance and are used to probe the spatial distribution of the conducting channels. Tuning to a situation where the NC junction is connected by few&#8208;channel quantum point contacts in the connecting NW terminals, it is shown that transport through the junction is ballistic except close to pinch&#8208;off. Combined with a new concept for shadow&#8208;epitaxy of patterned superconductors on NCs, the structures reported here show promise for the realization of non&#8208;trivial topological states in multi&#8208;terminal Josephson junctions.

         <title>Gallium Plasmonic Nanoantennas Unveiling Multiple Kinetics of Hydrogen Sensing, Storage, and Spillover</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium nanoparticles represent a novel interesting plasmon photocatalysis system for hydrogen dissociation, sensing, and storage applications. Ga NPs have never been considered previously for photocatalysis. With respect to this, a novel vision is offered, which can represent breakthroughs in the plasmon&#8208;activated photocatalysis as well as in hydrogen science and technology.








Abstract
Hydrogen is the key element to accomplish a carbon&#8208;free based economy. Here, the first evidence of plasmonic gallium (Ga) nanoantennas is provided as nanoreactors supported on sapphire (&#945;&#8208;Al2O3) acting as direct plasmon&#8208;enhanced photocatalyst for hydrogen sensing, storage, and spillover. The role of plasmon&#8208;catalyzed electron transfer between hydrogen and plasmonic Ga nanoparticle in the activation of those processes is highlighted, as opposed to conventional refractive index&#8208;change&#8208;based sensing. This study reveals that, while temperature selectively operates those various processes, longitudinal (LO&#8208;LSPR) and transverse (TO&#8208;LSPR) localized surface plasmon resonances of supported Ga nanoparticles open selectivity of localized reaction pathways at specific sites corresponding to the electromagnetic hot&#8208;spots. Specifically, the TO&#8208;LSPR couples light into the surface dissociative adsorption of hydrogen and formation of hydrides, whereas the LO&#8208;LSPR activates heterogeneous reactions at the interface with the support, that is, hydrogen spillover into &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and reverse&#8208;oxygen spillover from &#945;&#8208;Al2O3. This Ga&#8208;based plasmon&#8208;catalytic platform expands the application of supported plasmon&#8208;catalysis to hydrogen technologies, including reversible fast hydrogen sensing in a timescale of a few seconds with a limit of detection as low as 5 ppm&#160;and in a broad temperature range from room&#8208;temperature up to 600 &#176;C while remaining stable and reusable over an extended period of time.

         <title>A Harmless&#8211;Harmful Switchable and Uninterrupted Laccase&#8208;Instructed Killer for Activatable Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A harmless&#8211;harmful switchable and uninterrupted laccase (LAC)&#8208;instructed killer (HULK) is designed as a chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent, which is the first CDT agent accelerated by LAC&#8208;instructed superoxide radical (O2&#8722;&#8226;) generation and possesses harmless&#8211;harmful switchable effect because of the photodegradation of O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger Fe&#8208;chlorin e6, showing great potential as a safe and effective CDT agent.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) employs Fenton catalysts to kill cancer cells by converting intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into hydroxyl radicals (OH&#8226;). Although many studies on H2O2 supplementation have been conducted to improve the therapeutic effect of CDT, few studies have focused on the application of superoxide radical (O2&#8722;&#8226;) in CDT, which may result in better efficacy. A major concern about O2&#8722;&#8226;&#8208;mediated CDT is its tendency to induce serious oxidative damage to normal tissues, which may be addressed by using a degradable O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger. Here, a harmless&#8208;harmful switchable and uninterrupted laccase (LAC)&#8208;instructed killer (HULK) is constructed, which is the first CDT agent accelerated by LAC&#8208;instructed O2&#8722;&#8226; generation and possesses a harmless&#8208;harmful switchable effect because of the photodegradation of the O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger iron&#8208;chlorin e6 (FeCe6). LAC&#8208;instructed substrate oxidation effectively catalyzes O2&#8722;&#8226; production with the help of intracellular reduction, thereby promoting the conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+, accelerating the generation of OH&#8226;, and inducing tumor cell apoptosis and necrosis. The introduced O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger FeCe6 is quickly photodegraded during irradiation, while LAC&#8208;instructed O2&#8722;&#8226; generation proceeds as before, resulting in activatable CDT. This work not only provides the first strategy for LAC&#8208;instructed O2&#8722;&#8226; generation but also presents new insight into activatable CDT.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Hybrid Dielectric for Capacitive and Triboelectric Tactile Sensors with High Sensitivity and Ultrawide Linearity Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;inspired hybrid dielectric with gradient compressibility and dielectric property is presented based on the combined low&#8208;permittivity (low&#8208;k) micro&#8208;cilia array and high&#8208;permittivity (high&#8208;k) rough surface and micro&#8208;dome array. The derived linear elastic modulus and effective dielectric constant enable the ultra&#8208;wide linear sensing range (0&#8211;1000&#160;kPa) and enhanced sensitivity for capacitive/triboelectric tactile sensors.








Abstract
The trade&#8208;off between sensitivity and linearity is critical for preserving the high pressure&#8208;resolution over a broad range and simplifying the signal processing/conversion of flexible tactile sensors. Conventional dielectrics suffer from the difficulty of quantitatively controlling the interacted mechanical and dielectric properties, thus causing the restricted sensitivity and linearity of capacitive sensors. Herein, inspired by human skin, a novel hybrid dielectric composed of a low&#8208;permittivity (low&#8208;k) micro&#8208;cilia array, a high&#8208;permittivity (high&#8208;k) rough surface, and micro&#8208;dome array is developed. The pressure&#8208;induced series&#8208;parallel conversion between the low&#8208;k and high&#8208;k components of the hybrid dielectric enables the linear effective dielectric constant and controllable initial/resultant capacitance. The gradient compressibility of the hybrid dielectric enables the linear behavior of elastic modulus with pressures, which derives the capacitance variation determined by the effective dielectric constant. Therefore, an ultrawide linearity range up to 1000&#160;kPa and a high sensitivity of 0.314 kPa&#8211;1 are simultaneously achieved by the optimized hybrid dielectric. The design is also applicable for triboelectric tactile sensors, which realizes the similar linear behavior of output voltage and enhanced sensitivity. With the high pressure&#8208;resolution across a broad range, potential applications such as healthcare monitoring in diverse scenarios and control command conversion via a single sensor are demonstrated.

A new design of the monolithic ternary logic transistor is presented to boost the breakthrough of the semiconductor technology beyond the Moore's law. A vertically stacked double n&#8208;type semiconductor heterostructure enables an equiprobable and distinctive manifestation of multiple logic states in the conventional MOSFET architecture, through the chemical&#8208;turning of electrical transitions between onsets of field&#8208;effect charge transport and tunneling behaviors.








Abstract
A monolithic ternary logic transistor based on a vertically stacked double n&#8208;type semiconductor heterostructure is presented. Incorporation of the organic heterostructure into the conventional metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistor (MOSFET) architecture induces the generation of stable multiple logic states in the device; these states can be further optimized to be equiprobable and distinctive, which are the most desirable and requisite properties for multivalued logic devices. A systematic investigation reveals that the electrical properties of the device are governed by not only the conventional field&#8208;effect charge transport but also the field&#8208;effect charge tunneling at the heterointerfaces, and thus, an intermediate state can be finely tuned by independently controlling the transition between the onsets of these two mechanisms. The achieved device performance agrees with the results of a numerical simulation based on a pseudo&#8208;metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal model; the obtained findings therefore provide rational criteria for material selection in a simple energetic perspective. The operation of various ternary logic circuits based on the optimized multistate heterojunction transistors, including the NMIN and NMAX gates, is also demonstrated.

         <title>Healable and Recyclable Elastomers with Record&#8208;High Mechanical Robustness, Unprecedented Crack Tolerance, and Superhigh Elastic Restorability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Healable and recyclable elastomers with superhigh strength (tensile strength &#8776;75.6&#160;MPa, true stress at break &#8776;1.21&#160;GPa) and ultrahigh toughness (&#8776;390.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) are reported. The elastomer has unprecedented crack tolerance with fracture energy of 215.2&#160;kJ m&#8722;2 that even exceeds that of metals and alloys. The elastomer exhibits superhigh elastic restorability allowing dimensional recovery from elongation over 12 times.








Abstract
Spider silk is one of the most robust natural materials, which has extremely high strength in combination with great toughness and good elasticity. Inspired by spider silk but beyond it, a healable and recyclable supramolecular elastomer, possessing superhigh true stress at break (1.21&#160;GPa) and ultrahigh toughness (390.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), which are, respectively, comparable to and &#8776;2.4 times higher than those of typical spider silk, is developed. The elastomer has the highest tensile strength (ultimate engineering stress, 75.6&#160;MPa) ever recorded for polymeric elastomers, rendering it the strongest and toughest healable elastomer thus far. The hyper&#8208;robust elastomer exhibits superb crack tolerance with unprecedentedly high fracture energy (215.2&#160;kJ m&#8722;2) that even exceeds that of metals and alloys, and superhigh elastic restorability allowing dimensional recovery from elongation over 12 times. These extraordinary mechanical performances mainly originate from the meticulously engineered hydrogen&#8208;bonding segments, consisting of multiple acylsemicarbazide and urethane moieties linked with flexible alicyclic hexatomic spacers. Such hydrogen&#8208;bonding segments, incorporated between extensible polymer chains, aggregate to form geometrically confined hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays resembling those in spider silk. The hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays act as firm but reversible crosslinks and sacrificial bonds for enormous energy dissipation, conferring exceptional mechanical robustness, healability, and recyclability on the elastomer.

         <title>Assembly of Close&#8208;Packed Ferroelectric Polymer Nanowires via Interface&#8208;Epitaxy with ReS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable approach is developed to achieve ferroelectric polymer P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) thin films composed of close&#8208;packed crystalline nanowires with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar axis via interface&#8208;epitaxy with 1T&#8242;&#8208;ReS2, which leads to over six orders of magnitude higher ferroelectric field effect modulation in ReS2 transistors and coercive voltages as low as 0.1&#160;V, making them viable for large&#8208;scale, low&#8208;power, high&#8208;performance device applications.








Abstract
The flexible, transparent, and low&#8208;weight nature of ferroelectric polymers makes them promising for wearable electronic and optical applications. To reach the full potential of the polarization&#8208;enabled device functionalities, large&#8208;scale fabrication of polymer thin films with well&#8208;controlled polar directions is called for, which remains a central challenge. The widely exploited Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett, spin&#8208;coating, and electrospinning methods only yield polymorphous or polycrystalline films, where the net polarization is compromised. Here, an easily scalable approach is reported to achieve poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) thin films composed of close&#8208;packed crystalline nanowires via interface&#8208;epitaxy with 1T&#8242;&#8208;ReS2. Upon controlled thermal treatment, uniform P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) films restructure into about 10 and 35 nm&#8208;wide (010)&#8208;oriented nanowires that are crystallographically aligned with the underlying ReS2, as revealed by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. Piezoresponse force microscopy studies confirm the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar axis of the nanowire films and reveal coercive voltages as low as 0.1 V. Reversing the polarization can induce a conductance switching ratio of &gt;108 in bilayer ReS2, over six orders of magnitude higher than that achieved by an untreated polymer gate. This study points to a cost&#8208;effective route to large&#8208;scale processing of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric polymer thin films for flexible energy&#8208;efficient nanoelectronics.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Gain Organic Electrochemical Transistor Chemosensors Based on Self&#8208;Curled Nanomembranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have attracted growing interest due to their physical, chemical, and mechanical versatility. Simultaneously, strain&#8208;engineered nanomembranes are well recognized to allow integration and property tailorability to numerous electronic and electrochemical miniaturized systems. By employing self&#8208;curled nanomembranes to advance the current liquid&#8208;gated transistor technology, unique characteristics arise in a pioneering ultrahigh&#8208;gain OECT platform.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are technologically relevant devices presenting high susceptibility to physical stimulus, chemical functionalization, and shape changes&#8212;jointly to versatility and low production costs. The OECT capability of liquid&#8208;gating addresses both electrochemical sensing and signal amplification within a single integrated device unit. However, given the organic semiconductor time&#8208;consuming doping process and their usual low field&#8208;effect mobility, OECTs are frequently considered low&#8208;end category devices. Toward high&#8208;performance OECTs, microtubular electrochemical devices based on strain&#8208;engineering are presented here by taking advantage of the exclusive shape features of self&#8208;curled nanomembranes. Such novel OECTs outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic liquid&#8208;gated transistors, reaching lower operating voltage, improved ion doping, and a signal amplification with a &gt;104&#160;intrinsic gain. The multipurpose OECT concept is validated with different electrolytes and distinct nanometer&#8208;thick molecular films, namely, phthalocyanine and thiophene derivatives. The OECTs are also applied as transducers to detect a biomarker related to neurological diseases, the neurotransmitter dopamine. The self&#8208;curled OECTs update the premises of electrochemical energy conversion in liquid&#8208;gated transistors, yielding a substantial performance improvement and new chemical sensing capabilities within picoliter sampling volumes.

         <title>Upregulating Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Nanoparticles with Blood&#8211;Tumor&#8208;Barrier Permeability for Precise Photothermal Eradication of Brain Tumors and Induction of Local Immune Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional biocompatible nanoplatform based on bradykinin (BK) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission nanoparticles (BK@AIE NPs) can specifically target brain tumors, penetrate through the blood&#8211;tumor barrier, perform photothermal therapy (PTT), and simultaneously activate the local immune system for very effective synergetic brain cancer therapy. Moreover, BK@AIE NPs&#8208;mediated PTT can eliminate cancer stem cells&#8217; recurrence associated with conventional therapy, for cancer treatment with highly improved efficacy.








Abstract
Compared to other tumors, glioblastoma (GBM) is extremely difficult to treat. Recently, photothermal therapy (PTT) has demonstrated advanced therapeutic efficacy; however, because of the relatively low tissue&#8208;penetration efficiency of laser light, its application in deep&#8208;seated tumors remains challenging. Herein, bradykinin (BK) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission nanoparticles (BK@AIE NPs) are synthesized; these offer selective penetration through the blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BTB) and strong absorbance in the near&#8208;infrared region (NIR). The BK ligand can prompt BTB adenosine receptor activation, which enhances transportation and accumulation inside tumors, as confirmed by T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance and fluorescence imaging. The BK@AIE NPs exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiency under 980&#160;nm NIR laser irradiation, facilitating the treatment of deep&#8208;seated tumors. Tumor progression can be effectively inhibited to extend the survival span of mice after spatiotemporal PTT. NIR irradiation can eradicate tumor tissues and release tumor&#8208;associated antigens. It is observed that the PTT treatment of GBM&#8208;bearing mice activates natural killer cells, CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and M1 macrophages in the GBM area, increasing the therapeutic efficacy.

&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional biocompatible nanoplatform based on bradykinin (BK) aggregation-induced-emission nanoparticles (BK@AIE NPs) can specifically target brain tumors, penetrate through the blood&#8211;tumor barrier, perform photothermal therapy (PTT), and simultaneously activate the local immune system for very effective synergetic brain cancer therapy. Moreover, BK@AIE NPs-mediated PTT can eliminate cancer stem cells&#8217; recurrence associated with conventional therapy, for cancer treatment with highly improved efficacy.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to other tumors, glioblastoma (GBM) is extremely difficult to treat. Recently, photothermal therapy (PTT) has demonstrated advanced therapeutic efficacy; however, because of the relatively low tissue-penetration efficiency of laser light, its application in deep-seated tumors remains challenging. Herein, bradykinin (BK) aggregation-induced-emission nanoparticles (BK@AIE NPs) are synthesized; these offer selective penetration through the blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BTB) and strong absorbance in the near-infrared region (NIR). The BK ligand can prompt BTB adenosine receptor activation, which enhances transportation and accumulation inside tumors, as confirmed by &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted magnetic resonance and fluorescence imaging. The BK@AIE NPs exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiency under 980&#160;nm NIR laser irradiation, facilitating the treatment of deep-seated tumors. Tumor progression can be effectively inhibited to extend the survival span of mice after spatiotemporal PTT. NIR irradiation can eradicate tumor tissues and release tumor-associated antigens. It is observed that the PTT treatment of GBM-bearing mice activates natural killer cells, CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, and M1 macrophages in the GBM area, increasing the therapeutic efficacy. This study demonstrates that NIR-assisted BK@AIE NPs represent a promising strategy for the improved systematic elimination of GBMs and the activation of local brain immune privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Bottom&#8208;Up Approach to Red&#8208;Emitting Molecular&#8208;Based Nanoparticles with Natural Stealth Properties and their Use for Single&#8208;Particle Tracking Deep in Brain Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent organic nanoparticles displaying intrinsic stealth properties toward biological membranes are prepared by nanoprecipitation of a hydrophobic, conjugated, red&#8208;emitting quadrupolar dye. The excellent brightness, stability, and size control down to &#8776;10&#160;nm of these nanoparticles allow for single&#8208;particle tracking deep in brain tissue. These findings point to a novel route for the bottom&#8208;up molecular design of the nano&#8211;bio interface.








Abstract
Fluorescent nanoparticles dedicated to bioimaging applications should possess specific properties that have to be maintained in the aqueous, reactive, and crowded biological environment. These include chemical and photostability, small size (on the scale of subcellular structures), biocompatibility, high brightness, and good solubility. The latter is a major challenge for inorganic nanoparticles, which require surface coating to be made water soluble. Molecular&#8208;based fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs) may prove a promising, spontaneously water&#8208;soluble alternative, whose bottom&#8208;up design allows for the fine&#8208;tuning of individual properties. Here, the critical challenge of controlling the interaction of nanoparticles with cellular membranes is addressed. This is a report on bright, size&#8208;tunable, red&#8208;emitting, naturally stealthy FONs that do not require the use of antifouling agents to impede interactions with cellular membranes. As a proof of concept, single FONs diffusing up to 150&#160;&#181;m deep in brain tissue are imaged and tracked.

Abstract
Epitaxial growth gives the highest&#8208;quality crystalline semiconductor thin films for optoelectronic devices. Here, a universal solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth of highly oriented &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskite film via a two&#8208;step method is reported, in which the crystal orientation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 film is precisely controlled through the synergetic effect of methylammonium chloride and the large&#8208;organic cation butylammonium bromide. In situ GIWAXS visualizes the BA&#8208;related intermediate phase formation at the bottom of film, which serves as a guiding template for the bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth in the subsequent annealing process. The template&#8208;guided epitaxially grown BAFAMA perovskite film exhibits increased crystallinity, preferred crystallographic orientation, and reduced defects. Moreover, the BAFAMA perovskite solar cells demonstrate decent stability, maintaining 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency after 2600&#160;h ambient storage, and 4&#8208;time operation condition lifetime enhancement.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Substitution Promoted Ultrawide Bandgap up to 4.5&#160;eV in a 2D Semiconductor: Gallium Thiophosphate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;substitution process is used to design 2D ultrawide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor GaPS4 by employing GeS2 as a similar structural model. Monolayer GaPS4 exhibits an ultrawide optical bandgap of 4.50&#160;eV. The polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on the GaPS4 material display high selectivity and linear dichroic ratio in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region.








Abstract
Exploring 2D ultrawide bandgap semiconductors (UWBSs) will be conductive to the development of next&#8208;generation nanodevices, such as deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetectors, single&#8208;photon emitters, and high&#8208;power flexible electronic devices. However, a gap still remains between the theoretical prediction of novel 2D UWBSs and the experimental realization of the corresponding materials. The cross&#8208;substitution process is an effective way to construct novel semiconductors with the favorable parent characteristics (e.g., structure) and the better physicochemical properties (e.g., bandgap). Herein, a simple case is offered for rational design and syntheses of 2D UWBS GaPS4 by employing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GeS2 as a similar structural model. Benefiting from the cosubstitution of Ge with lighter Ga and P, the GaPS4 crystals exhibit sharply enlarged optical bandgaps (few&#8208;layer: 3.94&#160;eV and monolayer: 4.50&#160;eV) and superior detection performances with high responsivity (4.89 A W&#8722;1), high detectivity (1.98&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones), and high quantum efficiency (2.39&#160;&#215;&#160;103%) in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region. Moreover, the GaPS4&#8208;based photodetector exhibits polarization&#8208;sensitive photoresponse with a linear dichroic ratio of 1.85 at 254&#160;nm, benefitting from its in&#8208;plane structural anisotropy. These results provide a pathway for the discovery and fabrication of 2D UWBS anisotropic materials, which become promising candidates for future solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet and polarization&#8208;sensitive sensors.

         <title>Engineering a Hydrogen&#8208;Sulfide&#8208;Based Nanomodulator to Normalize Hyperactive Photothermal Immunogenicity for Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most&#8208;potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, suffers from hyperactive immunity&#8208;related permanent tissue injury and high&#8208;profile tumor regeneration. In this scenario, a hydrogen sulfide donor to PTT via an amphiphilic conjugated polymer (CP) (2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol)) is integrated, for advanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided inflammatory modulation. The regulated inflammation preserves photothermal immunogenicity and promotes hyperthermia&#8208;induced wound healing concurrently.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most&#8208;potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, is highlighted with excessive inflammatory response, while ablating cancer with immunogenic death. This hyperactive immune response may override PTT&#8208;triggered immunogenicity, exacerbate skin empyrosis, and incur permanent tissue injury and high&#8208;profile tumor regeneration. Therefore, an anticancer balance between pathological and protective immune response is urgently needed for an advanced photothermal therapeutic tactic. Herein, a gas&#8208;modulated photothermal immunogenicity strategy is proposed by integrating an amphiphilic&#8208;conjugated polymer with a polysulfide&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor (2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP&#8208;PEG) (where CP = conjugated polymer and PEG = poly(ethylene glycol)). The CP is endowed with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence capacity and favorable photothermal effect, tracing the tumor for precise therapeutics. The polysulfide donor can release H2S triggered by intracellular glutathione, which elicits mitochondrial dysfunction and robust anti&#8208;inflammation effect. Ultimately, this gas&#8208;modulated PTT strategy inhibits tumor growth remarkably and limits the magnitude of PTT&#8208;induced proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor&#8208;alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;), interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6), and interleukin&#8208;1beta (IL&#8208;1&#946;) cytokines. Moreover, the regulated inflammation accelerates PTT&#8208;induced wound healing.

&lt;p&gt;Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most-potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, suffers from hyperactive immunity-related permanent tissue injury and high-profile tumor regeneration. In this scenario, a hydrogen sulfide donor to PTT via an amphiphilic conjugated polymer (CP) (2,2&#8242;-dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP-poly(ethylene glycol)) is integrated, for advanced NIR-II fluorescence-guided inflammatory modulation. The regulated inflammation preserves photothermal immunogenicity and promotes hyperthermia-induced wound healing concurrently.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most-potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, is highlighted with excessive inflammatory response, while ablating cancer with immunogenic death. This hyperactive immune response may override PTT-triggered immunogenicity, exacerbate skin empyrosis, and incur permanent tissue injury and high-profile tumor regeneration. Therefore, an anticancer balance between pathological and protective immune response is urgently needed for an advanced photothermal therapeutic tactic. Herein, a gas-modulated photothermal immunogenicity strategy is proposed by integrating an amphiphilic-conjugated polymer with a polysulfide-based hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) donor (2,2&#8242;-dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP-PEG) (where CP = conjugated polymer and PEG = poly(ethylene glycol)). The CP is endowed with NIR-II fluorescence capacity and favorable photothermal effect, tracing the tumor for precise therapeutics. The polysulfide donor can release H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S triggered by intracellular glutathione, which elicits mitochondrial dysfunction and robust anti-inflammation effect. Ultimately, this gas-modulated PTT strategy inhibits tumor growth remarkably and limits the magnitude of PTT-induced proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1&#946;) cytokines. Moreover, the regulated inflammation accelerates PTT-induced wound healing. A H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-modulated PTT with adaptive immune response is thus recommended as an advanced strategy to cancer therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Poor Stability of Li2CO3 in the Solid Electrolyte Interphase of a Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Revealed by Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy</title>

Sulfur&#8208;containing additives cause the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium&#8208;metal batteries to preferentially generate Li2SO4 and overlithiated lithium sulfate and lithium oxide, which encapsulates lithium carbonate in the middle, limiting SEI thickening and enhancing battery life by a factor of ten.








Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dictates the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Here, direct atomic imaging of the SEI's phase components and their spatial arrangement is achieved, using ultralow&#8208;dosage cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. The results show that, surprisingly, a lot of the deposited Li metal has amorphous atomic structure, likely due to carbon and oxygen impurities, and that crystalline lithium carbonate is not stable and readily decomposes when contacting the lithium metal. Lithium carbonate distributed in the outer SEI also continuously reacts with the electrolyte to produce gas, resulting in a dynamically evolving and porous SEI. Sulfur&#8208;containing additives cause the SEI to preferentially generate Li2SO4 and overlithiated lithium sulfate and lithium oxide, which encapsulate lithium carbonate in the middle, limiting SEI thickening and enhancing battery life by a factor of ten. The spatial mapping of the SEI gradient amorphous (polymeric &#8594; inorganic &#8594; metallic) and crystalline phase components provides guidance for designing electrolyte additives.

A top&#8208;level design strategy assisted by density functional theory is reported to guide and design advanced high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts and their enhanced catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is successfully predicted. A new low&#8208;temperature electrochemical reconstruction method is developed to fabricate the as&#8208;predicted high&#8208;entropy catalysts.

Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials are new&#8208;generation electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their excellent reactivity and highly tailorable electrochemical properties. Herein, a powerful top&#8208;level design strategy is reported to guide and design advanced high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts by establishing reaction models (e.g., reaction energy barrier, conductivity, adsorption geometries for intermediates, and rate&#8208;determining step) to predict performance with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Accordingly, novel high&#8208;entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalysts are fabricated by a new low&#8208;temperature electrochemical reconstruction method and their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties are thoroughly characterized. These as&#8208;prepared quaternary metallic (oxy)hydroxides present much better OER performance than ternary Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide, Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide, and other counterparts, and are demonstrated with a low overpotential of 199&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a 48.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 Tafel slope in 1 m KOH and excellent stability without decay over 72 h. The performance enhancement mechanism is also unraveled by synchrotron radiation. The work verifies the usefulness of high&#8208;entropy design and the great synergistic effect on OER performance by the incorporation of four elements, and also provides a new method for the construction of advanced high&#8208;entropy materials for energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Polymeric Microparticles Generated via Confinement&#8208;Free Fluid Instability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexplored facile and scalable polymeric microparticle fabrication strategy via confinement&#8208;free fluid instability induced by an ultralow&#8208;surface&#8208;energy layer is reported. This method can be applied to a variety of polymers with a wide range of sizes. This research introduces an intriguing phenomenon in fluid dynamics on superamphiphobic surfaces, which should lead to more exciting discoveries in the future.








Abstract
In&#8208;fiber fluid instability can be harnessed to realize scalable microparticles fabrication with tunable sizes and multifunctional characteristics making it competitive in comparison to conventional microparticles fabrication methods. However, since in&#8208;fiber fluid instability has to be induced via thermal annealing and the resulting microparticles can only be collected after dissolving the fiber cladding, obtaining contamination&#8208;free particles for high&#8208;temperature incompatible materials remains great challenge. Herein, confinement&#8208;free fluid instability is demonstrated to fabricate polymeric microparticles in a facile manner induced by the ultralow surface energy of the superamphiphobic surface. The polymer solution columns break up into uniform droplets then form spherical particles spontaneously in seconds at ambient temperature. This method can be applied to a variety of polymers spanning an exceptionally wide range of sizes: from 1&#160;mm down to 1&#160;&#181;m. With the aid of microfluidic spinning instrument, a large quantity of microparticles can be obtained, making this method promising for scaling up production. Notably, through simple modification of the feed solution configuration, composite/structured micromaterials can also be produced, including quantum&#8208;dots&#8208;labeled fluorescent particles, magnetic particles, core&#8211;shell particles, microcapsules, and necklace&#8208;like microfibers. This method, with general applicability and facile control, is envisioned to have great prospects in the field of polymer microprocessing.

         <title>Flexible Self&#8208;Powered Integrated Sensing System with 3D Periodic Ordered Black Phosphorus@MXene Thin&#8208;Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>

An MXene/BP&#8208;based self&#8208;powered smart sensor system can be created by integrating a flexible pressure sensor with direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitors and solar cells. The smart sensor system exhibits a detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. The MXene materials design and system integration developed in this work offers a general platform for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered electronics.








Abstract
Accurate and continuous detection of physiological signals without the need for an external power supply is a key technology for realizing wearable electronics as next&#8208;generation biomedical devices. Herein, it is shown that a MXene/black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based self&#8208;powered smart sensor system can be designed by integrating a flexible pressure sensor with direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitors and solar cells. Using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assembly process to form a periodic interleaving MXene/BP lamellar structure results in a high energy&#8208;storage capacity in a direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitor to drive the operation of sensors and compensate the intermittency of light illumination. Meanwhile, with MXene/BP as the sensitive layer in a flexible pressure sensor, the pressure sensitivity of the device can be improved to 77.61 kPa&#8211;1 at an optimized elastic modulus of 0.45&#160;MPa. Furthermore, the smart sensor system with fast response time (10.9&#160;ms) shows a real&#8208;time detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. It is believed that the proposed study based on the design and integration of MXene materials will provide a general platform for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered electronics.

Furthermore, the smart sensor system with fast response time (10.9&#160;ms) shows a real-time detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. It is believed that the proposed study based on the design and integration of MXene materials will provide a general platform for next-generation self-powered electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Force&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of 4D&#8208;Printed Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible and bidirectional self&#8208;assembly of microstructures is realized by two&#8208;photon&#8208;lithography&#8208;based 4D microprinting for reversible pattern/encapsulation, switchable wetting, and the dynamic actuation of microrobots/micromachines. In different evaporating solvents, the 4D&#8208;printed microstructures can exhibit three reversible geometries: (I) curved state, (II) distance&#8208;dependent coalesced clusters via traditional self&#8208;assembly, and (III) distance&#8208;independent arbitrary self&#8208;assemblies (4D self&#8208;assemblies) toward the curving directions.








Abstract
Capillary&#8208;force&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is emerging as a significant approach for the massive manufacture of advanced materials with novel wetting, adhesion, optical, mechanical, or electrical properties. However, academic value and practical applications of the self&#8208;assembly are greatly restricted because traditional micropillar self&#8208;assembly is always unidirectional. In this work, two&#8208;photon&#8208;lithography&#8208;based 4D microprinting is introduced to realize the reversible and bidirectional self&#8208;assembly of microstructures. With asymmetric crosslinking densities, the printed vertical microstructures can switch to a curved state with controlled thickness, curvature, and smooth morphology that are impossible to replicate by traditional 3D&#8208;printing technology. In different evaporating solvents, the 4D&#8208;printed microstructures can experience three states: (I) coalesce into clusters from original vertical states via traditional self&#8208;assembly, (II) remain curved, or (III) arbitrarily self&#8208;assemble (4D self&#8208;assembly) toward the curving directions. Compared to conventional approaches, this 4D self&#8208;assembly is distance&#8208;independent, which can generate varieties of assemblies with a yield as high as 100%. More importantly, the three states can be reversibly switched, allowing the development of many promising applications such as reversible micropatterns, switchable wetting, and dynamic actuation of microrobots, origami, and encapsulation.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Like Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Melamine&#8211;Cyanuric Acid Supramolecular Nanosheets as Pseudo&#8208;Porous Catalyst Support</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular network consisting of melamine and cyanuric acid is fabricated as ultrathin nanosheets with extraordinary stability at pH = 0, serving as a pseudo&#8208;porous catalyst support to simultaneously give remarkable enhancement in the catalytic stability and activity of metal phosphides for the hydrogen evolution reaction in strong acidic conditions.








Abstract
Behaving as structural protectors and electronic modulators, catalyst supports such as graphene derivatives are generally constructed by covalent bonds. Here, hydrogen&#8208;bonded ultrathin nanosheets are reported as a new type of catalyst support. Melamine (M) and cyanuric acid (CA) molecules self&#8208;assemble to form the graphite&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystal M&#8208;CA, which can be easily exfoliated by ultrasonic treatment to yield ultrathin nanosheets with thickness of &#8776;1.6 nm and high stability at pH = 0. The dynamic nanosheets form adaptive defects/pores in the synthetic process of CoP nanoparticles, giving embedded composite with high hydrogen evolution activity (overpotential of 66 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) and stability. Computational calculations, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy unveil the electron modulation effects of the nanosheets. This pseudo&#8208;porous catalyst support also can be applied to other metal phosphides.

         <title>From Chaos to Control: Programmable Crack Patterning with Molecular Order in Polymer Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cracks are normally classified as material failures to be prevented. A crack patterning strategy is described that allows freely programmable patterns of cracks guided by the alignment of liquid crystal polymer networks. This programmable cracking enables high&#8208;resolution patterning in a high&#8208;throughput manner without the use of expensive lithography procedures and may serve as an alternative fabrication strategy for various applications.








Abstract
Cracks are typically associated with the failure of materials. However, cracks can also be used to create periodic patterns on the surfaces of materials, as observed in the skin of crocodiles and elephants. In synthetic materials, surface patterns are critical to micro&#8208; and nanoscale fabrication processes. Here, a strategy is presented that enables freely programmable patterns of cracks on the surface of a polymer and then uses these cracks to pattern other materials. Cracks form during deposition of a thin film metal on a liquid crystal polymer network (LCN) and follow the spatially patterned molecular order of the polymer. These patterned sub&#8208;micrometer scale cracks have an order parameter of 0.98&#160;&#177; 0.02 and form readily over centimeter&#8208;scale areas on the flexible substrates. The patterning of the LCN enables cracks that turn corners, spiral azimuthally, or radiate from a point. Conductive inks can be filled into these oriented cracks, resulting in flexible, anisotropic, and transparent conductors. This materials&#8208;based processing approach to patterning cracks enables unprecedented control of the orientation, length, width, and depth of the cracks without costly lithography methods. This approach promises new architectures of electronics, sensors, fluidics, optics, and other devices with micro&#8208; and nanoscale features.

         <title>Resonant Spin Transmission Mediated by Magnons in a Magnetic Insulator Multilayer Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing an epitaxial magnetic insulator heterotructure, the magnon&#8208;mediated resonant spin transmission enhancement effect is achieved, where transmission of magnon spin current can be increased by more than 1000% at selected frequencies. This novel effect can provide useful mechanisms for building future magnonic devices similar to their photonic counterparts such as antireflection coatings and Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavities.








Abstract
While being electrically insulating, magnetic insulators can behave as good spin conductors by carrying spin current with excited spin waves. So far, magnetic insulators are utilized in multilayer heterostructures for optimizing spin transport or to form magnon spin valves for reaching controls over the spin flow. In these studies, it remains an intensively visited topic as to what the corresponding roles of coherent and incoherent magnons are in the spin transmission. Meanwhile, understanding the underlying mechanism associated with spin transmission in insulators can help to identify new mechanisms that can further improve the spin transport efficiency. Here, by studying spin transport in a magnetic&#8208;metal/magnetic&#8208;insulator/platinum multilayer, it is demonstrated that coherent magnons can transfer spins efficiently above the magnon bandgap of magnetic insulators. Particularly the standing spin&#8208;wave mode can greatly enhance the spin flow by inducing a resonant magnon transmission. Furthermore, within the magnon bandgap, a shutdown of spin transmission due to the blocking of coherent magnons is observed. The demonstrated magnon transmission enhancement and filtering effect provides an efficient method for modulating spin current in magnonic devices.

Zwitterion&#8208;functionalized polymers are synthsized with a record&#8208;high breakdown strength of 1300 MV&#160;m&#8722;1, energy density above 35 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, and charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &gt;90%, taking advantage of the covalent&#8208;bonding&#8208;restricted ion polarization and the charge trapping of the ion cluster phase.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are highly desirable in capacitor applications due to their low cost, high breakdown strength, and unique self&#8208;healing capability. However, existing polymer dielectrics suffer from either a low energy density or a high dielectric loss, thereby hindering the development of compact, efficient, and reliable power electronics. Here, a novel type of polymer dielectrics simultaneously exhibiting an extraordinarily high recoverable energy density of 35 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a low dielectric loss is reported. It is synthesized by grafting zwitterions onto the short side chains of a poly(4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;pentene) (PMP)&#8208;based copolymer, which increases its dielectric constant from &#8776;2.2 to &#8776;5.2 and significantly enhances its breakdown strength from &#8776;700 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 to &#8776;1300 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 while maintaining its low dielectric loss of &lt;0.002 and high charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &gt;90%. Based on a combination of the phase&#8208;field method description of mesoscale structures, Maxwell equations, and theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that the outstanding combination of high energy density and low dielectric loss of zwitterions&#8208;grafted copolymers is attributed to the covalent&#8208;bonding restricted ion polarization and the strong charge trapping by the zwitterions. This work represents a new strategy in polymer dielectrics for achieving simultaneous high energy density and low dielectric loss.

         <title>An Inorganic/Organic S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction H2&#8208;Production Photocatalyst and its Charge Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of a CdS/PT inorganic/organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunction not only leads to efficient charge separation and transfer, but also increased redox ability and enhanced stability for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Inspired by natural photosynthesis, constructing inorganic/organic heterojunctions is regarded as an effective strategy to design high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts. Herein, a step (S)&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is prepared by in situ growth of an inorganic semiconductor firmly on an organic semiconductor. A new pyrene&#8208;based conjugated polymer, pyrene&#8208;alt&#8208;triphenylamine (PT), is synthesized via the typical Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions, and then employed as a substrate to anchor CdS nanocrystals. The optimized CdS/PT composite, coupling 2 wt% PT with CdS, exhibits a robust H2 evolution rate of 9.28 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with continuous release of H2 bubbles, as well as a high apparent quantum efficiency of 24.3%, which is &#8776;8 times that of pure CdS. The S&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism between PT and CdS, is systematically demonstrated by photoirradiated Kelvin probe measurement and in situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. This work provides a protocol for preparing specific S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts on the basis of inorganic/organic coupling.

         <title>Observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov States in Superconducting Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The realization of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov (YSR) states in graphene, a non&#8208;superconducting 2D material, and without the participation of magnetic atoms, is shown. Graphene is made superconducting by the proximity effect with Pb islands. These scanning tunneling microscopy experiments reveal the very special nature of these YSR states and constitute an unequivocal demonstration of carbon magnetism at graphene grain boundaries.








Abstract
When magnetic atoms are inserted inside a superconductor, the superconducting order is locally depleted as a result of the antagonistic nature of magnetism and superconductivity. Thereby, distinctive spectral features, known as Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states, appear inside the superconducting gap. The search for Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in different materials is intense, as they can be used as building blocks to promote Majorana modes suitable for topological quantum computing. Here, the first observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in graphene, a non&#8208;superconducting 2D material, and without the participation of magnetic atoms, is reported. Superconductivity in graphene is induced by proximity effect brought by adsorbing nanometer&#8208;scale superconducting Pb islands. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy the superconducting proximity gap is measured in graphene, and Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states are visualized in graphene grain boundaries. The results reveal the very special nature of those Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states, which extends more than 20&#160;nm away from the grain boundaries. These observations provide the long&#8208;sought experimental confirmation that graphene grain boundaries host local magnetic moments and constitute the first observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in a chemically pure system.

         <title>Spontaneous Pillaring of Pentasil Zeolites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous formation of self&#8208;pillared pentasil zeolites in the absence of any template is demonstrated via heterogeneous nucleation of sequentially branched nanosheets from amorphous precursors. These hierarchical zeolites have a large external surface area and high percentages of external acid sites, which markedly improves their catalytic performance. These findings highlight a facile method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations in nanoporous zeolites.








Abstract
Conventional methods to prepare hierarchical zeolites depend upon the use of organic structure&#8208;directing agents and often require multiple synthesis steps with limited product yield and Br&#248;nsted acid concentration. Here, it is shown that the use of MEL&#8208; or MFI&#8208;type zeolites as crystalline seeds induces the spontaneous formation of self&#8208;pillared pentasil zeolites, thus avoiding the use of any organic or branching template for the crystallization of these hierarchical structures. The mechanism of formation is evaluated by time&#8208;resolved electron microscopy to provide evidence for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of sequentially branched nanosheets from amorphous precursors. The resulting hierarchical zeolites have large external surface area and high percentages of external acid sites, which markedly improves their catalytic performance in the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and methanol to hydrocarbons reactions. These findings highlight a facile, commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations and improve the performance of zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Immunoblotting based on a Photoclick Hydrogel Enables High&#8208;Throughput Screening and Accurate Profiling of Exogenous Gene Expression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;cell transfection analysis chip (scTAC) is developed for expression screening, precise positioning of transfected cells, and immunoblotting analysis of multi&#8208;target proteins. scTAC allows for true single&#8208;cell up&#8208;sampling and enables the acquisition of continuous single&#8208;cell protein expression even in low co&#8208;expression scenarios. scTAC provides a powerful tool for the analysis of biological pathways after transfection of rare cells.








Abstract
Fast and accurate profiling of exogenous gene expression in host cells is crucial for studying gene function in cellular and molecular biology, but still faces the challenge of incomplete co&#8208;expression of reporter genes and target genes. Here, a single&#8208;cell transfection analysis chip (scTAC) is presented, which is based on the in situ microchip immunoblotting method, for rapid and accurate analysis of exogenous gene expression in thousands of individual host cells. scTAC not only can assign information of exogenous gene activity to specific transfected cells, but enables the acquisition of continuous protein expression even in low co&#8208;expression scenarios. It is demonstrated that scTAC can reveal the relationship of expression level between reporter genes and target genes, which is helpful for evaluating transient transfection strategy efficiency. The advantages of this method for the study of fusion protein expression and downstream protein expression in signaling pathway in rare cells are shown. Empirically, an EGFP&#8208;TSPAN8 fusion plasmid is transfected into MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells and the expressions of two cancer stemness biomarkers (ALDHA1 and SOX2) are analyzed. The scTAC method clearly reveals an interesting phenomenon that transfected adherent MCF&#8208;7 cells exhibit some stem cell characteristics, but they do not have stem cell appearance.

Empirically, an EGFP-TSPAN8 fusion plasmid is transfected into MCF-7 breast cancer cells and the expressions of two cancer stemness biomarkers (ALDHA1 and SOX2) are analyzed. The scTAC method clearly reveals an interesting phenomenon that transfected adherent MCF-7 cells exhibit some stem cell characteristics, but they do not have stem cell appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multivalent Nanosheet Antibody Mimics for Selective Microbial Recognition and Inactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent nanosheet artificial antibodies with high selectivity and strong binding affinity to pathogenic bacteria are created by spontaneous assembly of various tripeptide recognition phases on transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets. The luminescent antibody mimics can detect pathogenic bacteria at a single&#8208;cell level from human serum and urine and effectively inactivate them on wounds of infected mice for healing.








Abstract
Antibodies are widely used as recognition elements in sensing and therapy, but they suffer from poor stability, long discovery time, and high cost. Herein, a facile approach to create antibody mimics with flexible recognition phases and luminescent rigid scaffolds for the selective recognition, detection, and inactivation of pathogenic bacteria is reported. Tripeptides with a nitriloacetate&#8208;Cu group are spontaneously assembled on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets via coordination bonding, providing a diversity of TMD&#8208;tripeptide assembly (TPA) antibody mimics. TMD&#8208;TPA antibody mimics can selectively recognize various pathogenic bacteria with nanomolar affinities. The bacterial binding sites for TMD&#8208;TPA are identified by experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, revealing that the dynamic and multivalent interactions of artificial antibodies play a crucial role for their recognition selectivity and affinity. The artificial antibodies allow the rapid and selective detection of pathogenic bacteria at single copy in human serum and urine, and their effective inactivation for therapy of infected mice. This work demonstrates the potential of TMD&#8208;TPA antibody mimics as an alternative to natural antibodies for sensing and therapy.

         <title>Improving Image&#8208;Guided Surgical and Immunological Tumor Treatment Efficacy by Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapies Based on a Multifunctional NIR AIEgen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated surgery and phototheranostics employing nanoparticles based on a near&#8208;infrared aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) for image&#8208;guided synergistic tumor therapy are explored to overcome respective limitations and realize maximized therapeutic outcomes and minimized recurrences. Moreover, the combined treatment of AIEgen&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;mediated phototheranostics and programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody significantly induces tumor elimination by enhancing the effect of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Multimodal therapy is attracting increasing attention to improve tumor treatment efficacy, but generally requires various complicated ingredients combined within one theranostic system to achieve multiple functions. Herein, a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform based on a single aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen), DDTB, is designed to integrate near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence, photothermal, photodynamic, and immunological effects. Intravenously injected AIEgen&#8208;based nanoparticles can efficiently accumulate in tumors with NIR fluorescence to provide preoperative diagnosis. Most of the tumors are excised under intraoperative fluorescence navigation, whereafter, some microscopic residual tumors are completely ablated by photodynamic and photothermal therapies for maximally killing the tumor cells and tissues. Up to 90% of the survival rate can be achieved by this synergistic image&#8208;guided surgery and photodynamic and photothermal therapies. Importantly, the nanoparticles&#8208;mediated photothermal/photodynamic therapy plus programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody significantly induce tumor elimination by enhancing the effect of immunotherapy. This theranostic strategy on the basis of a single AIEgen significantly improves the survival of cancer mice with maximized therapeutic outcomes, and holds great promise for clinical cancer treatment.

         <title>A New Conjugated Polymer that Enables the Integration of Photovoltaic and Light&#8208;Emitting Functions in One Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer, PBQx&#8208;TCl, exhibits 18% efficiency for outdoor application and 28.5% efficiency for indoor application. Simultaneously, the PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8208;based device also shows light&#8208;emitting function with broad emission ranges from 630 to 1000 nm and moderate external quantum efficiency approaching 0.2%.








Abstract
Exploring the intriguing bifunctional nature of organic semiconductors and investigating the feasibility of fabricating bifunctional devices are of great significance in realizing various applications with one device. Here, the design of a new wide&#8208;bandgap polymer named PBQx&#8208;TCl (optical bandgap of 2.05&#160;eV) is reported, and its applications in photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting devices are studied. By fabricating devices with nonfullerene acceptors BTA3 and BTP&#8208;eC9, it is shown that the devices exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.0% under air mass 1.5G illumination conditions and an outstanding PCE of 28.5% for a 1 cm2 device and 26.0% for a 10 cm2 device under illumination from a 1000 lux light&#8208;emitting diode. In addition, the PBQx&#8208;TCl:BTA3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a moderate organic light&#8208;emitting diode performance with an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency approaching 0.2% and a broad emission range of 630&#8211;1000&#160;nm. These results suggest that the polymer PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8208;based devices exhibit outstanding photovoltaic performance and potential light&#8208;emitting functions.

         <title>Crack Programming: From Chaos to Control: Programmable Crack Patterning with Molecular Order in Polymer Substrates (Adv. Mater. 22/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cracking is typically an uncontrolled material failure process. In article number 2008434, Hyun Kim, Taylor H. Ware, and co&#8208;workers describe a process that enables unprecedented control of crack formation. By depositing thin&#8208;film chromium on photoaligned liquid&#8208;crystal polymer networks, patterns of cracks on the surface of a polymer can be freely programmed in a high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;throughput manner. This crack programming process provides new opportunities for unconventional microfabrication. The image depicts light transmitted through a polymer film coated with chromium with azimuthally patterned cracks.

Ware, and co-workers describe a process that enables unprecedented control of crack formation. By depositing thin-film chromium on photoaligned liquid-crystal polymer networks, patterns of cracks on the surface of a polymer can be freely programmed in a high-resolution and high-throughput manner. This crack programming process provides new opportunities for unconventional microfabrication. The image depicts light transmitted through a polymer film coated with chromium with azimuthally patterned cracks.

In article number 2008761, Congxin Xia, Zhongming Wei, and co&#8208;workers describe substitution with lighter elements significantly increasing the bandgap of GaPS4, and simultaneously inheriting its in&#8208;plain anisotropy. GaPS4 thus becomes a promising candidate material for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet and polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. The balance demonstrates the main idea of the cross&#8208;substitution, with edge&#8208;sharing [GeS4]&#8211;[GeS4] atomic packing in the left pan and the tetrahedra centered by lighter elements (Ga and P) forming the [GaS4]&#8211;[PS4] motif in the right pan.

         <title>Superconductivity in Graphene: Observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov States in Superconducting Graphene (Adv. Mater. 22/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene is made superconducting with Pb islands by Iv&#225;n Brihuega and co&#8208;workers, as detailed in article number 2008113. At the same time, magnetic moments are introduced using naturally existing graphene grain boundaries. They show that both superconductivity and magnetism can coexist in graphene, generating exotic Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states. Those states provide a starting point to ultimately create graphene topological qubits, putting forward graphene as a potential platform for topological quantum computing.

         <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Containing Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Properties, and Therapeutic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, properties, and biomedical applications of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanomaterials are comprehensively reviewed. The problems in the current polyphenol&#8208;based nanosystems and the future research directions in this field are also discussed.








Abstract
Polyphenols, the phenolic hydroxyl group&#8208;containing organic molecules, are widely found in natural plants and have shown beneficial effects on human health. Recently, polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles have attracted extensive research attention due to their antioxidation property, anticancer activity, and universal adherent affinity, and thus have shown great promise in the preparation, stabilization, and modification of multifunctional nanoassemblies for bioimaging, therapeutic delivery, and other biomedical applications. Additionally, the metal&#8722;polyphenol networks, formed by the coordination interactions between polyphenols and metal ions, have been used to prepare an important class of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles for surface modification, bioimaging, drug delivery, and disease treatments. By focusing on the interactions between polyphenols and different materials (e.g., metal ions, inorganic materials, polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids), a comprehensive review on the synthesis and properties of the polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles is provided. Moreover, the remarkable versatility of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles in different biomedical applications, including biodetection, multimodal bioimaging, protein and gene delivery, bone repair, antibiosis, and cancer theranostics is also demonstrated. Finally, the challenges faced by future research regarding the polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles are discussed.

         <title>Atomically Thin Quantum Spin Hall Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators&#8212;a class of 2D topological insulators&#8212;promises to radically transform classical and quantum electronic device concepts. Advances in materials science and engineering are surveyed, alongside a theoretical description, and the future perspectives for electronic applications are discussed, including the quest to realizing Majorana&#8208;based topological quantum computing&#8212;the next frontier in QSH materials research.








Abstract
Atomically thin topological materials are attracting growing attention for their potential to radically transform classical and quantum electronic device concepts. Among them is the quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator&#8212;a 2D state of matter that arises from interplay of topological band inversion and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, with large tunable bulk bandgaps up to 800 meV and gapless, 1D edge states. Reviewing recent advances in materials science and engineering alongside theoretical description, the QSH materials library is surveyed with focus on the prospects for QSH&#8208;based device applications. In particular, theoretical predictions of nontrivial superconducting pairing in the QSH state toward Majorana&#8208;based topological quantum computing are discussed, which are the next frontier in QSH materials research.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enhance Biomimetic Cascade Catalysis for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research progress on the design and construction of biomimetic cascade reaction systems that incorporate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF), for signal amplification in biosensing, is summarized. Notably, the mechanisms for the improvement of catalytic activity and selectivity of the MOF&#8208;involving cascade systems are discussed in detail. In addition, the challenges and opportunities in the way of the further design and applications of cascade systems with MOFs are briefly put forward.








Abstract
Multiple enzymes&#8208;induced biological cascade catalysis guides efficient and selective substrate transformations in vivo. The biomimetic cascade systems, as ingenious strategies for signal transduction and amplification, have a wide range of applications in biosensing. However, the fragile nature of enzymes greatly limits their wide applications. In this regard, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous structures, unique nano/microenvironments, and good biocompatibility have been skillfully used as carriers to immobilize enzymes for shielding them against hash surroundings and improving the catalytic efficiency. For another, nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like properties and brilliant stabilities (nanozymes), have been widely applied to ameliorate the low stability of the enzymes. Inheriting the abovementioned merits of MOFs, the performances of MOFs&#8208;immboilized nanozymes could be significantly enhanced. Furthermore, in addition to carriers, some MOFs can also serve as nanozymes, expanding their applications in cascade systems. Herein, recent advances in the fabrication of efficient MOFs&#8208;involving enzymes/nanozymes cascade systems and biosensing applications are highlighted. Integrating diversified signal output modes, including colorimetry, electrochemistry, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering, sensitive detection of various targets (including biological molecules, environmental pollutants, enzyme activities, and so on) are realized. Finally, challenges and opportunities about further constructions and applications of MOFs&#8208;involving cascade reaction systems are briefly put forward.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Bio&#8208;Chemo&#8208;Mechanical&#8208;Systems: Micromotors, Microfluidics, and Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotors, microfluidics, and nanozymes originated as independent disciplines&#8212;today, their convergence can help solve each discipline's challenges and lead to essential advantages in bioapplications. Nanozymes significantly expand the scope of chemical reactions and fuels of catalytic micromotors with integrated dynamic responses. Microfluidics is used to mass&#8208;produce micromotors with optimal size, compositions, and core&#8211;shell properties for biomedical imaging and theranostics.








Abstract
Wireless nano&#8208;/micromotors powered by chemical reactions and/or external fields generate motive forces, perform tasks, and significantly extend short&#8208;range dynamic responses of passive biomedical microcarriers. However, before micromotors can be translated into clinical use, several major problems, including the biocompatibility of materials, the toxicity of chemical fuels, and deep tissue imaging methods, must be solved. Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics (e.g., catalase, oxidase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase), that is, nanozymes, can significantly expand the scope of micromotors&#8217; chemical fuels. A convergence of nanozymes, micromotors, and microfluidics can lead to a paradigm shift in the fabrication of multifunctional micromotors in reasonable quantities, encapsulation of desired subsystems, and engineering of FDA&#8208;approved core&#8211;shell structures with tuneable biological, physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Microfluidic methods are used to prepare stable bubbles/microbubbles and capsules integrating ultrasound, optoacoustic, fluorescent, and magnetic resonance imaging modalities. The aim here is to discuss an interdisciplinary approach of three independent emerging topics: micromotors, nanozymes, and microfluidics to creatively: 1) embrace new ideas, 2) think across boundaries, and 3) solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline toward the development of micro&#8208;bio&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical&#8208;systems for diverse bioapplications.

         <title>Interphases, Interfaces, and Surfaces of Active Materials in Rechargeable Batteries and Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfaces provide reactive zones and interphases stabilize electronic device operation. Understanding and designing interfaces and interphases represents an effective and efficient way for developing high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries and perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing demand for clean sustainable energy has driven tremendous worldwide investment in the design and exploration of new active materials for energy conversion and energy&#8208;storage devices. Tailoring the surfaces of and interfaces between different materials is one of the surest and best studied paths to enable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries and high&#8208;efficiency solar cells. Metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising photovoltaic materials due to their unprecedented development, with their record power conversion efficiency (PCE) rocketing beyond 25% in less than 10 years. Such progress is achieved largely through the control of crystallinity and surface/interface defects. Rechargeable batteries (RBs) reversibly convert electrical and chemical potential energy through redox reactions at the interfaces between the electrodes and electrolyte. The (electro)chemical and optoelectronic compatibility between active components are essential design considerations to optimize power conversion and energy storage performance. A focused discussion and critical analysis on the formation and functions of the interfaces and interphases of the active materials in these devices is provided, and prospective strategies used to overcome current challenges are described. These strategies revolve around manipulating the chemical compositions, defects, stability, and passivation of the various interfaces of RBs and PSCs.

         <title>Theory and Ab Initio Calculation of Optically Excited States&#8212;Recent Advances in 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>

2D materials exhibit unique physical phenomena and features that are absent in conventional bulk semiconductors. The theoretical and ab initio methods that yield the optically excited states in 2D materials are reviewed. Several analytical and numerical approaches are introduced and their results are compared with experiments.








Abstract
Recent studies of the optical properties of 2D materials have reported unique phenomena and features that are absent in conventional bulk semiconductors. Many of these interesting properties, such as enhanced light&#8208;matter coupling, gate&#8208;tunable photoluminescence, and unusual excitonic optical selection rules arise from the nature of the two&#8208; and multi&#8208;particle excited states such as strongly bound Wannier excitons and charged excitons. The theory, modeling, and ab initio calculations of these optically excited states in 2D materials are reviewed. Several analytical and ab initio approaches are introduced. These methods are compared with each other, revealing their relative strength and limitations. Recent works that apply these methods to a variety of 2D materials and material&#8208;defect systems are then highlighted. Understanding of the optically excited states in these systems is relevant not only for fundamental scientific research of electronic excitations and correlations, but also plays an important role in the future development of quantum information science and nano&#8208;photonics.

         <title>Visco&#8208;Poroelastic Electrochemiluminescence Skin with Piezo&#8208;Ionic Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material platform capable of transducing mechanical stimuli into visual readout is presented. The material platform contains liquid state electrochemiluminescence (ECL) active materials within rubbery polymer matrix, which undergoes visco&#8208;poroelastic response to mechanical stress. Incorporating this visco&#8208;poroelastic material into a simple electronic device, which is termed &#8220;ECL skin&#8221;, locally applied stress is spatially resolved and visualized.








Abstract
Following early research efforts devoted to achieving excellent sensitivity of electronic skins, recent design schemes for these devices have focused on strategies for transduction of spatially resolved sensing data into straightforward user&#8208;adaptive visual signals. Here, a material platform capable of transducing mechanical stimuli into visual readout is presented. The material layer comprises a mixture of an ionic transition metal complex luminophore and an ionic liquid (capable of producing electrochemiluminescence (ECL)) within a thermoplastic polyurethane matrix. The proposed material platform shows visco&#8208;poroelastic response to mechanical stress, which induces a change in the distribution of the ionic luminophore in the film, which is referred to as the piezo&#8208;ionic effect. This piezo&#8208;ionic effect is exploited to develop a simple device containing the composite layer sandwiched between two electrodes, which is termed &#8220;ECL skin&#8221;. Emission from the ECL skin is examined, which increases with the applied normal/tensile stress. Additionally, locally applied stress to the ECL skin is spatially resolved and visualized without the use of spatially distributed arrays of pressure sensors. The simple fabrication and unique operation of the demonstrated ECL skin are expected to provide new insights into the design of materials for human&#8211;machine interactive electronic skins.

         <title>Alternative Lone&#8208;Pair ns2&#8208;Cation&#8208;Based Semiconductors beyond Lead Halide Perovskites for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of recent progress on emerging Pb&#8208;free semiconductors containing lone&#8208;pair ns2 cations is provided, with the purpose of providing valid insights for discovering auspicious optoelectronic materials other than lead halide perovskites. The issues hindering performance enhancement and the design strategies of novel ns2&#8208;cation&#8208;based optoelectronic semiconductors are discussed.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as advantageous high&#8208;performance optoelectronic semiconductors, and have undergone rapid development for diverse applications such as solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes , and photodetectors. While material instability and lead toxicity are still major concerns hindering their commercialization, they offer promising prospects and design principles for developing promising optoelectronic materials. The distinguished optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites stem from the Pb2+ cation with a lone&#8208;pair 6s2 electronic configuration embedded in a mixed covalent&#8211;ionic bonding lattice. Herein, we&#160;summarize alternative Pb&#8208;free semiconductors containing lone&#8208;pair ns2 cations, intending to offer insights for developing potential optoelectronic materials other than lead halide perovskites. We&#160;start with the physical underpinning of how the ns2 cations within the material lattice allow for superior optoelectronic properties. We&#160;then review the emerging Pb&#8208;free semiconductors containing ns2 cations in terms of structural dimensionality, which is crucial for optoelectronic performance. For each category of materials, the research progresses on crystal structures, electronic/optical properties, device applications, and recent efforts for performance enhancements are overviewed. Finally, the issues hindering the further developments of studied materials are surveyed along with possible strategies to overcome them, which also provides an outlook on the future research in this field.

The micro&#8208;open&#8208;porous material demonstrates simultaneously high mechanical robustness, high capacitance, energy and power density when applied as capacitive electrodes. The presented strategy promotes the development of stretchable energy storage devices and opens up new possibilities for the application of tough hydrogels.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitors are seeing emerging applications in flexible and stretchable electronics. Supercapacitors with high capacitance, high power density, simple form factor, and good mechanical robustness are highly desired, which demands electrode materials with high surface area, high mass loading, good conductivity, larger thickness, low tortuosity, and high toughness. However, it has been challenging to simultaneously realize them in a single material. By compositing a superficial layer of tough hydrogel on conductive and low tortuous foams, a thick capacitor electrode with large capacitance (5.25 F cm&#8208;2), high power density (41.28&#160;mW cm&#8208;2), and good mechanical robustness (&#949;&#160;= 140%, &#915;&#160;= 1000 J m&#8208;2) is achieved. The tough hydrogel serves as both a load&#8208;bearing layer to maintain structural integrity during deformation and a permeable binder to allow interaction between the conductive electrode and electrolyte. It is shown that the tough hydrogel reinforcement is beneficial for both electrical and mechanical stability. With a simple design and facile fabrication, this strategy is generalizable for various conductive materials.

         <title>Co3Se4 Quantum Dots as an Ultrastable Host Material for Potassium&#8208;Ion Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co3Se4 quantum dots encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon (CSC) are reported as an anode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries, in which a morphology change process occurs. The unique core&#8211;shell&#8208;like structure anode demonstrates greatly enhanced electrochemical performance, especially long&#8208;term cyclic performance at various current densities. Density functional theory calculations, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, and ex situ transmission electron microscopy further reveal the working mechanism of CSC anode during potassiation/depotassiation.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) are receiving increased attention due to their cost&#8208;effective and similar energy&#8208;storage mechanism to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the lack of appropriate electrode materials is still hampered for their development, which is mainly caused by the large size of the potassium ions (1.38&#160;&#197;) including low structural stability and poor electrochemical redox reaction kinetics. Herein, Co3Se4 quantum dots (QD) encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon (CSC) are reported as an anode material for KIBs, in which a morphology change process occurs. Benefiting from the unique uniform nanostructure reducing the ion&#8208;diffusion length, the improved electronic conductivity, and the enhanced protective effect of N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) alleviating volume fluctuation, the CSC demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance. The core&#8211;shell&#8208;like CSC composite demonstrates remarkable discharge capacity (410&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 550 cycles, 360&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 3200 cycles) and excellent cyclic performance over 10&#160;000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Density functional theory calculations show a larger reaction energy of Co3Se4 QD than bulk Co3Se4, a lower barrier of K atom migration in Co3Se4 QD than bulk Co3Se4, and also favor the intercalation reaction rather than replacement reaction. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ transmission electron microscopy are further used to evaluate potassiation/depotassiation phenomena.

         <title>An Efficient Narrowband Near&#8208;Infrared at 1040&#160;nm Organic Photodetector Realized by Intermolecular Charge Transfer Mediated Coupling Based on a Squaraine Dye</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband near&#8208;infrared organic photodiodes are reported based on a dipolar squaraine dye. J&#8208;type coupling in the solid state allows SQ&#8208;H thin films to combine favorable NIR absorption at 1040&#160;nm and charge carrier mobility. The bulk&#8208;heterojunction with PC61BM yields an organic photodiode with external quantum efficiency of 12.3% at 1050&#160;nm with a full&#8208;width half&#8208;maximum of 85&#160;nm under short&#8208;circuit condition.








Abstract
A highly sensitive short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, &#955;&#160;&gt; 1000 nm) organic photodiode (OPD) is described based on a well&#8208;organized nanocrystalline bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) active layer composed of a dicyanovinyl&#8208;functionalized squaraine dye (SQ&#8208;H) donor material in combination with PC61BM. Through thermal annealing, dipolar SQ&#8208;H chromophores self&#8208;assemble in a nanoscale structure with intermolecular charge transfer mediated coupling, resulting in a redshifted and narrow absorption band at 1040 nm as well as enhanced charge carrier mobility. The optimized OPD exhibits an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12.3% and a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of only 85 nm (815 cm&#8722;1) at 1050 nm under 0 V, which is the first efficient SWIR OPD based on J&#8208;type aggregates. Photoplethysmography application for heart&#8208;rate monitoring is successfully demonstrated on flexible substrates without applying reverse bias, indicating the potential of OPDs based on short&#8208;range coupled dye aggregates for low&#8208;power operating wearable applications.

         <title>Uniform Magnesium Electrodeposition via Synergistic Coupling of Current Homogenization, Geometric Confinement, and Chemisorption Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a synergistic coupling of homogenizing current distribution, geometric confinement, and chemisorptive interaction, a 3D vertically aligned nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber array structure on carbon cloth can regulate the uniform Mg electrodeposition and realize a reversible magnesium&#8208;metal anode with high areal capacity, much better kinetics, and improved cycle life.








Abstract
Unevenly distributed magnesium (Mg) electrodeposits have emerged as a major obstacle for Mg&#8208;metal batteries. A comprehensive design matrix is reported for 3D magnesiophilic hosts, which regulate the uniform Mg electrodeposition through a synergistic coupling of homogenizing current distribution, geometric confinement, and chemisorptive interaction. Vertically aligned nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber arrays on carbon cloth (denoted as &#8220;VNCA@C&#8221;) are developed as a proof of concept. The evenly arranged short nanoarray architecture helps to homogenize the surface current density and the microchannels built in this 3D host allow the preferential nucleation of Mg due to their geometrical confinement effect. Besides, the nitrogen&#8208;/oxygen&#8208;doped carbon species exhibit strong chemisorptive interaction toward Mg atoms, providing preferential nucleation sites as demonstrated by first&#8208;principle calculation results. Electrochemical analysis reveals a peculiar yet highly reversible microchannel&#8208;filling growth&#160;behavior of Mg metals, which empowers the delicately designed VNCA@C host with the ability to deliver a reduced nucleation overpotential of 429&#160;mV at 10.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an elongated Mg plating/stripping cycle life (110 cycles) under high current density of 10.0 mA cm&#8722;2. The proposed design matrix can be extended to other metal anodes (such as lithium and zinc) for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Formulation of a Composite Nasal Spray Enabling Enhanced Surface Coverage and Prophylaxis of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There&#160;is a high risk of transmission of airborne pathogens through the nasal epithelium. This study reports a novel nasal spray, which is designed to maximize surface coverage and prevent infection through physical entrapment and inhibition of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2).








Abstract
Airborne pathogens pose high risks in terms of both contraction and transmission within the respiratory pathways, particularly the nasal region. However, there is little in the way of adequate intervention that can protect an individual or prevent further spread. This study reports on a nasal formulation with the capacity to combat such challenges, focusing on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). Formulation of a polysaccharide&#8208;based spray, known for its mucoadhesive properties, is undertaken and it is characterized for its mechanical, spray distribution, and antiviral properties. The ability to engineer key mechanical characteristics such as dynamic yield stresses and high coverage is shown, through systematic understanding of the composite mixture containing both gellan and &#955;&#8208;carrageenan. Furthermore, the spray systems demonstrate highly potent capacities to prevent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection in Vero cells, resulting in complete inhibition when either treating, the cells, or the virus, prior to challenging for infection. From this data, a mechanism for both prophylaxis and prevention is proposed; where entrapment within a polymeric coating sterically blocks virus uptake into the cells, inactivating the virus, and allowing clearance within the viscous medium. As such, a fully preventative spray is formulated, targeted at protecting the lining of the upper respiratory pathways against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

This study reports a novel nasal spray, which is designed to maximize surface coverage and prevent infection through physical entrapment and inhibition of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airborne pathogens pose high risks in terms of both contraction and transmission within the respiratory pathways, particularly the nasal region. However, there is little in the way of adequate intervention that can protect an individual or prevent further spread. This study reports on a nasal formulation with the capacity to combat such challenges, focusing on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Formulation of a polysaccharide-based spray, known for its mucoadhesive properties, is undertaken and it is characterized for its mechanical, spray distribution, and antiviral properties. The ability to engineer key mechanical characteristics such as dynamic yield stresses and high coverage is shown, through systematic understanding of the composite mixture containing both gellan and &#955;-carrageenan. Furthermore, the spray systems demonstrate highly potent capacities to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cells, resulting in complete inhibition when either treating, the cells, or the virus, prior to challenging for infection. From this data, a mechanism for both prophylaxis and prevention is proposed; where entrapment within a polymeric coating sterically blocks virus uptake into the cells, inactivating the virus, and allowing clearance within the viscous medium. As such, a fully preventative spray is formulated, targeted at protecting the lining of the upper respiratory pathways against SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>HCl&#8208;Based Hydrothermal Etching Strategy toward Fluoride&#8208;Free MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of etching various MAX materials in HCl solution influenced by temperature and pressure is simulated. Fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx MXenes are obtained with high quality and efficiency via a controllable HCl&#8208;hydrothermal etching method. Mo2CTx exhibits an excellent rate performance in supercapacitors owing to the unique surface terminations that significantly change the energy&#8208;storage mechanism compared with F&#8208;terminated MXenes.








Abstract
Due to their ultrathin layered structure and rich elemental variety, MXenes are emerging as a promising electrode candidate in energy generation and storage. MXenes are generally synthesized via hazardous fluoride&#8208;containing reagents from robust MAX materials, unfortunately resulting in plenty of inert fluoride functional groups on the surface that noticeably decline their performance. Density functional theory calculations are used to show the etching feasibility of hydrochloric acid (HCl) on various MAX phases. Based on this theoretical guidance, fluoride&#8208;free Mo2C MXenes with high efficiency about 98% are experimentally demonstrated. The Mo2C electrodes produced by this process exhibit high electrochemical performance in supercapacitors and sodium&#8208;ion batteries owing to the chosen surface functional groups created via the HCl etch process. This strategy enables the development of fluoride&#8208;free MXenes and opens a new window to explore their potential in energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets with Variable Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct, scalable, and surfactant&#8208;free synthesis of metal&#8211;organic framework suspensions encompassing exceptionally large NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with variable functionalities and excellent solution processability is presented. Relevant monoliths, aero&#8208; and xerogels, and large&#8208;area textured films with a great homogeneity, controllable thickness, and appreciable mechanical properties can be facilely fabricated. The sensors coated with NUS&#8208;8 possessing variable functionalities exhibit distinguishable sensing behaviors toward acetone.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) intrinsically lack fluidity and thus solution processability. Direct synthesis of MOFs exhibiting solution processability like polymers remains challenging but highly sought&#8208;after for multitudinous applications. Herein, a one&#8208;pot, surfactant&#8208;free, and scalable synthesis of highly stable MOF suspensions composed of exceptionally large (average area &gt;&#160;15&#160;000 &#181;m2) NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with variable functionalities and excellent solution processability is presented. This is achieved by adding capping molecules during the synthesis, and by judicious controls of precursor concentration and MOF nanosheet&#8211;solvent interactions. The resulting 2D NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with variable functionalities exhibit excellent solution processability. As such, relevant monoliths, aero&#8208; and xerogels, and large&#8208;area textured films with a great homogeneity, controllable thickness, and appreciable mechanical properties can be facilely fabricated. Additionally, from both the molecular&#8208; and chip&#8208;level it is demonstrated that capacitive sensors integrated with NUS&#8208;8 films functionalized with different terminal groups exhibit distinguishable sensing behaviors toward acetone due to their disparate host&#8211;guest interactions. It is envisioned that this simple approach will greatly facilitate the integration of MOFs in miniaturized electronic devices and benefit their mass production.

         <title>Double&#8208;Gate MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors with Full&#8208;Range Tunable Threshold Voltage for Multifunctional Logic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;gate MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistor is designed for potential applications in multifunctional reconfigurable logic circuits. Featuring the feasible tuning of threshold voltage and optimizing of subthreshold swing of the transistors, the system can both function well as full logic swing binary logic with high noise margin and be dynamically reconfigured between binary and ternary logic.








Abstract
Multifunctional reconfigurable devices, with higher information capacity, smaller size, and more functions, are urgently needed and draw most attention in frontiers in information technology. 2D semiconductors, ascribing to ultrathin body and easy electrostatic control, show great potential in developing reconfigurable functional units. This work proposes a novel double&#8208;gate field&#8208;effect transistor architecture with equal top and bottom gate (TG and BG) and realizes flexible optimization of the subthreshold swing (SS) and threshold voltage (VTH). While the TG and BG are used simultaneously, as a single gate to drive the transistor, ultralow average SS value of 65.5 mV dec&#8722;1 can be obtained in a large current range over 104, enabling the application in high gain inverter. While one gate is used to initialize the channel doping, full logic swing inverter circuit with high noise margin (over 90%) is demonstrated. Such device prototype is further extended for designing reconfigurable logic applications and can be dynamically switched and well maintained between binary and ternary logics. This study provides important concept and device prototype for future multifunctional logic applications.

         <title>40.1% Record Low&#8208;Light Solar&#8208;Cell Efficiency by Holistic Trap&#8208;Passivation using Micrometer&#8208;Thick Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The involvement of guanidinium in perovskite bulk film and CH3O&#8208;PEABr passivation on the perovskite surface synergistically suppresses the trap states. The charge carrier lifetimes of perovskite films increase by tenfold and fivefold to 981 ns and 8.02 &#181;s at the crystal surface and in its bulk, respectively. The decreased nonradiative recombination loss translates to a record efficiency of 40.1%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells exhibit not only high efficiency under full AM1.5 sunlight, but also have great potential for applications in low&#8208;light environments, such as indoors, cloudy conditions, early morning, late evening, etc. Unfortunately, their performance still suffers from severe trap&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination, particularly under low&#8208;light conditions. Here, a holistic passivation strategy is developed to reduce traps both on the surface and in the bulk of micrometer&#8208;thick perovskite film, leading to a record efficiency of 40.1% under 301.6 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 warm light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) light for low&#8208;light solar&#8208;cell applications. The involvement of guanidinium into the perovskite bulk film and 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)ethylamine hydrobromide (CH3O&#8208;PEABr) passivation on the perovskite surface synergistically suppresses the trap states. The charge carrier lifetimes of the perovskite film increase by tenfold and fivefold to 981&#160;ns and 8.02 &#181;s at the crystal surface and in its bulk, respectively. The decreased nonradiative recombination loss translates to a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.00&#160;V, a high short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) of 152.10 &#181;A cm&#8722;2, and a fill factor (FF) of 79.52%. Note that this performance also stands as the highest among all photovoltaics measured under indoor light illumination. This work of trap passivation for micrometer&#8208;thick perovskite film paves a way for high&#8208;performance, self&#8208;powered IoT devices.

         <title>Innervated, Self&#8208;Sensing Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators with Closed Loop Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sensing, innervated liquid crystal elastomers in both fiber and square spiral motifs (shown) are produced by core&#8211;shell 3D printing. Printed core&#8211;shell filaments consist of a liquid metal core surrounded by a liquid crystal elastomer shell. When Joule heated above their nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperature, these self&#8208;sensing architectures exhibit actuation and large work output, which can be regulated via closed loop control.

Abstract
The programmable assembly of innervated LCE actuators (iLCEs) with prescribed contractile actuation, self&#8208;sensing, and closed loop control via core&#8211;shell 3D printing is reported. This extrusion&#8208;based direct ink writing method enables coaxial filamentary features composed of pure LM core surrounded by an LCE shell, whose director is aligned along the print path. Specifically, the thermal response of the iLCE fiber&#8208;type actuators is programmed, measured, and modeled during Joule heating, including quantifying the concomitant changes in fiber length and resistance that arise during simultaneous heating and self&#8208;sensing. Due to their reversible, high&#8208;energy actuation and their resistive feedback, it is also demonstrated that iLCEs can be regulated with closed loop control even when perturbed with large bias loads. Finally, iLCE architectures capable of programmed, self&#8208;sensing 3D shape change with closed loop control are fabricated.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Integration of&#160;Highly Conductive PdTe2&#160;with Low&#8208;Dimensional Semiconductors for p&#8208;Type Transistors with Low Contact Barriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The patterned synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D PdTe2 is demonstrated. The as&#8208;grown PdTe2 exhibits high electrical and thermal conductivities, showing the potential as an ideal contact material in nanoelectronics. Based on the nondestructive synthesis of PdTe2 patterns directly on various low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors, high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with reduced contact barriers are chemically constructed.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors provide promising ultrathin channels for constructing more&#8208;than&#8208;Moore devices. However, the prominent contact barriers at the semiconductor&#8211;metal electrodes interfaces greatly limit the performance of the obtained devices. Here, a chemical approach is developed for the construction of p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with low contact barriers by achieving the simultaneous synthesis and integration of 2D PdTe2 with various low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors. The 2D PdTe2 synthesized through a quasi&#8208;liquid process exhibits high electrical conductivity (&#8776;4.3 &#215; 106 S m&#8722;1) and thermal conductivity (&#8776;130 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), superior to other transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and even higher than some metals. In addition, PdTe2 electrodes with desired geometry can be synthesized directly on 2D MoTe2 and other semiconductors to form high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type FETs without any further treatment. The chemically derived atomically ordered PdTe2&#8211;MoTe2 interface results in significantly reduced contact barrier (65 vs 240 meV) and thus increases the performance of the obtained devices. This work demonstrates the great potential of 2D PdTe2 as contact materials and also opens up a new avenue for the future device fabrication through the chemical construction and integration of 2D components.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Control of Propagating Spin Waves by Ferroelectric Domain&#8208;Wall Motion in a Multiferroic Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric&#8208;field control of propagating spin waves in a Fe/BaTiO3 multiferroic heterostructure is demonstrated experimentally. The underlying mechanism involves the concurrent motion of strain&#8208;coupled ferroelectric domain walls and magnetic anisotropy boundaries and allows reversible tuning of the spin&#8208;wave amplitude and phase. The results provide a new route toward energy&#8208;efficient reconfigurable magnonics.








Abstract
Magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic heterostructures offers a promising platform for electric&#8208;field control of magnonic devices based on low&#8208;power spin&#8208;wave transport. Here, electric&#8208;field manipulation of the amplitude and phase of propagating spin waves in a ferromagnetic Fe film on top of a ferroelectric BaTiO3 substrate is demonstrated experimentally. Electric&#8208;field effects in this composite material system are mediated by strain coupling between alternating ferroelectric stripe domains with in&#8208;plane and perpendicular polarization and fully correlated magnetic anisotropy domains with differing spin&#8208;wave transport properties. The propagation of spin waves across the strain&#8208;induced magnetic anisotropy domains of the Fe film is directly imaged and it is shown how reversible electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven motion of ferroelectric domain walls and pinned anisotropy boundaries turns the spin&#8208;wave signal on and off. Furthermore, linear electric&#8208;field tuning of the spin&#8208;wave phase by altering the width of strain&#8208;coupled stripe domains is demonstrated. The results provide a new route toward energy&#8208;efficient reconfigurable&#160;magnonics.

         <title>Bubble Forming Films for Spatial Selective Cell Killing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric films embedding iron oxide nanoparticles as photosensitizers are designed. Irradiation of the films with pulsed&#8208;laser light generates water vapor bubbles at their surface. Cells located close to the films can be killed due to mechanical forces which arise when the bubbles collapse. Local irradiation of bubble&#8208;films allows for spatial selective single cell killing at the surface of the eye.








Abstract
Photodynamic and photothermal cell killing at the surface of tissues finds applications in medicine. However, a lack of control over heat dissipation following a treatment with light might damage surrounding tissues. A new strategy to kill cells at the surface of tissues is reported. Polymeric films are designed in which iron oxide nanoparticles are embedded as photosensitizers. Irradiation of the films with pulsed laser light generates water vapor bubbles at the surface of the films. It is found that &#8220;bubble&#8208;films&#8221; can kill cells in close proximity to the films due to mechanical forces which arise when the bubbles collapse. Local irradiation of bubble&#8208;films allows for spatial selective single cell killing. As nanosurgery becomes attractive in ophthalmology to remove superficial tumors, bubble&#8208;films are applied on the cornea and found that irradiation of the bubble&#8208;films allows spatial and selective killing of corneal cells. As i) the photosensitizer is embedded in the films, which reduces its uptake by cells and spreading into tissues and ii) the bubble&#8208;films can be removed from the tissue after laser treatment, while iii) a low laser fluence is sufficient to generate vapor bubbles, it is foreseen that bubble&#8208;films might become promising for safe resection of superficial tumors.

         <dc:description>
Coupling light&#8208;harvesting ability and catalytic function, plasmonic Cu serves as a promising platform for photocatalysis. Recent advancements of Cu&#8208;based plasmonic photocatalysis are systematically summarized, including designing and synthetic strategies, photocatalytic performance, and mechanistic understanding over Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts. Besides, approaches for the enhancement of light&#8208;utilization efficiency and construction of active centers on Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts are highlighted and discussed.








Abstract
With the capability of inducing intense electromagnetic field, energetic charge carriers, and photothermal effect, plasmonic metals provide a unique opportunity for efficient light utilization and chemical transformation. Earth&#8208;abundant low&#8208;cost Cu possesses intense and tunable localized surface plasmon resonance from ultraviolet&#8208;visible to near infrared region. Moreover, Cu essentially exhibits remarkable catalytic performance toward various reactions owing to its intriguing physical and chemical properties. Coupling with light&#8208;harvesting ability and catalytic function, plasmonic Cu serves as a promising platform for efficient light&#8208;driven chemical reaction. Herein, recent advancements of Cu&#8208;based plasmonic photocatalysis are systematically summarized, including designing and synthetic strategies for Cu&#8208;based catalysts, plasmonic catalytic performance, and mechanistic understanding over Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts. What's more, approaches for the enhancement of light utilization efficiency and construction of active centers on Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts are highlighted and discussed in detail, such as morphology and size control, regulation of electronic structure, defect and strain engineering, etc. Remaining challenges and future perspectives for further development of Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysis are also proposed.

         <title>Emerging Materials and Technologies with Applications in Flexible Neural Implants: A Comprehensive Review of Current Issues with Neural Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible implants have attracted increasing interest mainly to overcome the mechanical mismatch between rigid materials and soft neural tissues, enabling precise measurements of neural signals from conformal contact. The current issues of flexible neural implants are summarized by presenting material candidates and designs to address challenges. Furthermore, the latest investigations associated with each issue are also introduced.








Abstract
Neuroscience is an essential field of investigation that reveals the identity of human beings, with a comprehensive understanding of advanced mental activities, through the study of neurobiological structures and functions. Fully understanding the neurotransmission system that allows for connectivity among neuronal circuits has paved the way for the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and depression. The field of flexible implants has attracted increasing interest mainly to overcome the mechanical mismatch between rigid electrode materials and soft neural tissues, enabling precise measurements of neural signals from conformal contact. Here, the current issues of flexible neural implants (chronic device failure, non&#8208;bioresorbable electronics, low&#8208;density electrode arrays, among others are summarized) by presenting material candidates and designs to address each challenge. Furthermore, the latest investigations associated with the aforementioned issues are also introduced, including suggestions for ideal neural implants. In terms of the future direction of these advances, designing flexible devices would provide new opportunities for the study of brain&#8211;machine interfaces or brain&#8211;computer interfaces as part of locomotion through brain signals, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Conjugated Organic Photothermal Films for Spatiotemporal Thermal Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal conjugated polymer films are reviewed along with their emerging applications from the perspective of their working principles. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic molecular and polymeric materials are summarized, and their photothermal conversion efficiencies are correlated to the chemical structures, light absorption, and electronic properties of the films.








Abstract
With the growth of photoenergy harvesting and thermal engineering, photothermal materials (PTMs) have attracted substantial interest due to their unique functions such as localized heat generation, spatiotemporal thermal controllability, invisibility, and light harvesting capabilities. In particular, &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic PTMs show advantages over inorganic or metallic PTMs in thin film applications due to their large light absorptivity, ease of synthesis and tunability of molecular structures for realizing high NIR absorption, flexibility, and solution processability. This review is intended to provide an overview of organic PTMs, including both molecular and polymeric PTMs. A description of the photothermal (PT) effect and conversion efficiency (&#951;PT) for organic films is provided. After that, the chemical structure and optical properties of organic PTMs are discussed. Finally, emerging applications of organic PT films from the perspective of spatiotemporal thermal engineering principles are illustrated.

         <title>Harnessing Innate Immunity Using Biomaterials for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterial&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy has recently drawn significant attention due to the enhanced therapeutic efficacy without adverse effects. A comprehensive overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomaterials reinforcing innate immunity in diverse manners is provided. The future perspective of harnessing biomaterials for enhanced cancer immunotherapy is also discussed.








Abstract
The discovery of immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the field of immuno&#8208;oncology and established the foundation for developing various new therapies that can surpass conventional cancer treatments. Most recent immunotherapeutic strategies have focused on adaptive immune responses by targeting T cell&#8208;activating pathways, genetic engineering of T cells with chimeric antigen receptors, or bispecific antibodies. Despite the unprecedented clinical success, these T cell&#8208;based treatments have only benefited a small proportion of patients. Thus, the need for the next generation of cancer immunotherapy is driven by identifying novel therapeutic molecules or new immunoengineered cells. To maximize the therapeutic potency via innate immunogenicity, the convergence of innate immunity&#8208;based therapy and biomaterials is required to yield an efficient index in clinical trials. This review highlights how biomaterials can efficiently reprogram and recruit innate immune cells in tumors and ultimately initiate activation of T cell immunity against advanced cancers. Moreover, the design and specific biomaterials that improve innate immune cells&#8217; targeting ability to selectively activate immunogenicity with minimal adverse effects are discussed.

         <title>Comprehensive Understandings into Complete Reconstruction of Precatalysts: Synthesis, Applications, and Characterizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive understandings into complete reconstruction of precatalysts are summarized, mainly including its fundamental understandings, advantages, and features of completely reconstructed catalysts, design principles/strategies, extensive electrocatalysis applications, and advanced characterizations. This review is expected to arouse attention on the complete reconstruction materials for multifunctional applications in energy storage and conversion.








Abstract
Reconstruction induced by external environment (such as applied voltage bias and test electrolytes) changes catalyst component and catalytic behaviors. Investigations of complete reconstruction in energy conversion recently receive intensive attention, which promote the targeted design of top&#8208;performance materials with maximum component utilization and good stability. However, the advantages of complete reconstruction, its design strategies, and extensive applications have not achieved the profound understandings and summaries it deserves. Here, this review systematically summarizes several important advances in complete reconstruction for the first time, which includes 1) fundamental understandings of complete reconstruction, the characteristics and advantages of completely reconstructed catalysts, and their design principles, 2) types of reconstruction&#8208;involved precatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction catalysis in wide pH solution, and origins of limited reconstruction degree as well as design strategies/principles toward complete reconstruction, 3) complete reconstruction for novel material synthesis and other electrocatalysis fields, and 4) advanced in situ/operando or multiangle/level characterization techniques to capture the dynamic reconstruction processes and real catalytic contributors. Finally, the existing major challenges and unexplored/unsolved issues on studying the reconstruction chemistry are summarized, and an outlook for the further development of complete reconstruction is briefly proposed. This review will arouse the attention on complete reconstruction materials and their applications in diverse fields.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electroreduction via the Synergistic Effect of Tuning Cationic Clusters and Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy is developed to improve the CO2RR intrinsic activity and selectivity via introducing Ti into the cluster and an external light field. The initial electron transfer to form *COO&#8722; can be facilitated thanks to the more exposed active sites and adjusted electron transfer pathway. This strategy provides a guidance to fabricate highly active and stable catalysts for CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Introducing an external light field can increase the intrinsic activity and energy efficiency for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Herein, a synergistic strategy that introduces photosensitive components and visible light into a stable system is reported to improve the performance for CO2 reduction. The catalytic kinetics studies indicate that the synergistic effect of implantation of cationic Ti and additional light driving is the primary responsibility for accelerating the first electron transfer to form a *COO&#8722; intermediate. This leads to a satisfactory CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion for Zr/Ti&#8208;NB&#8208;Co in terms of high selectivity (Faradaic efficiency of 93.6% at &#8722;0.7&#160;V), remarkable catalytic activity (production rate up to 546&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V), excellent long&#8208;term stability (without performance decay over 11 h), and large turnover frequency of 1028 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V under visible light. These results imply that the photodriven Ti&#8208;based porphyrin catalyst not only can deliver more electrons, but also can act as a photoswitch to adjust the electron transfer pathway.

Electrically rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ERZABs) have attracted substantial research interest as one of the best candidate power sources for electric vehicles, grid&#8208;scale energy storage, and portable electronics owing to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environmental benignity. However, the realization of ERZABs with long cycle life and high energy and power densities is still a considerable challenge. The electrolyte, which serves as the ionic conductor, is one of the core components of ERZABs, as it plays a significant role during the discharge&#8211;charge process and greatly influences the rechargeability, operating voltage, lifespan, power density, and safety of ERZABs. Herein, the fundamental electrochemistry of electrolyte materials for ERZABs and the associated challenges are presented. Furthermore, recent advances in electrolyte materials for ERZABs, including alkaline aqueous electrolytes, nonalkaline electrolytes, ionic liquids, and semisolid&#8208;state electrolytes are discussed. This work aims to provide insights into the future exploration of high&#8208;performance electrolytes and thus promote the development of ERZABs.

         <title>Active Control of Nanodielectric&#8208;Induced THz Quasi&#8208;BIC in Flexible Metasurfaces: A Platform for Modulation and Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy for introducing and engineering narrow and active resonances in metamaterials is demonstrated. A nanoscale thick semiconducting strip breaks the structure's symmetry, providing access to a quasi&#8208;bound state in the continuum (quasi&#8208;BIC) that can be modulated with light. Inverse design of such resonances and their potential for ultrafast terahertz switchable filters and sensors are demonstrated.








Abstract
A bound state in the continuum (BIC) is a nonradiating state of light embedded in the continuum of propagating modes providing drastic enhancement of the electromagnetic field and its localization at micro&#8211;nanoscale. However, access to such modes in the far&#8208;field requires symmetry breaking. Here, it is demonstrated that a nanometric dielectric or semiconductor layer, 1000&#160;times thinner than the resonant wavelength (&#955;/1000), induces a dynamically controllable quasi&#8208;bound state in the continuum (QBIC) with ultrahigh quality factor in a symmetric metallic metasurface at terahertz frequencies. Photoexcitation of nanostrips of germanium activates ultrafast switching of a QBIC resonance with 200% transmission intensity modulation and complete recovery within 7 ps on a low&#8208;loss flexible substrate. The nanostrips also form microchannels that provide an opportunity for BIC&#8208;based refractive index sensing. An optimization model is presented for (switchable) QBIC resonances of metamaterial arrays of planar symmetric resonators modified with any (active) dielectric for inverse metamaterial design that can serve as an enabling platform for active micro&#8211;nanophotonic devices.

         <title>2D III&#8208;Nitride Materials: Properties, Growth, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphene&#8208;like 2D III&#8208;nitride semiconductor materials have unique physical properties such as high stability, wide and tunable bandgap, and magnetism, etc. Those advantages prove them to be used in optoelectronic, electronic, and spin&#8208;based devices and so on. In this review, the properties, growth methods, and applications of graphene&#8208;like 2D III&#8208;nitride materials are introduced.








Abstract
2D III&#8208;nitride materials have been receiving considerable attention recently due to their excellent physicochemical properties, such as high stability, wide and tunable bandgap, and magnetism. Therefore, 2D III&#8208;nitride materials can be applied in various fields, such as electronic and photoelectric devices, spin&#8208;based devices, and gas detectors. Although the developments of 2D h&#8208;BN materials have been successful, the fabrication of other 2D III&#8208;nitride materials, such as 2D h&#8208;AlN, h&#8208;GaN, and h&#8208;InN, are still far from satisfactory, which limits the practical applications of these materials. In this review, recent advances in the properties, growth methods, and potential applications of 2D III&#8208;nitride materials are summarized. The properties of the 2D III&#8208;nitride materials are mainly obtained by first&#8208;principles calculations because of the difficulties in the growth and characterizations of these materials. The discussion on the growth of 2D III&#8208;nitride materials is focused on 2D h&#8208;BN and h&#8208;AlN, as the developments of 2D h&#8208;GaN and h&#8208;InN are yet to be realized. Therefore, applications have been realized mostly based on the 2D h&#8208;BN materials; however, many potential applications are cited for the entire range of 2D III&#8208;nitride materials. Finally, future research directions and prospects in this field are also discussed.

         <title>Electron Matters: Recent Advances in Passivation and Applications of Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Besides the 2D structure, the unique feature of black phosphorus (BP) is the lone&#8208;pair electrons on each P atom. The interaction between the lone&#8208;pair electrons of BP and the acceptor component can be utilized for passivation of BP and contributes toward BP&#8208;based applications, either indirectly or directly.








Abstract
2D materials have experienced rapid and explosive development in the past decades. Among them, black phosphorus (BP) is one of the most promising materials on account of its thickness&#8208;dependent bandgap, high charge&#8208;carrier mobility, in&#8208;plane anisotropic structure, and excellent biocompatibility, as well as the broad applications brought by the properties. In view of the electron configuration, the most unique feature of BP is the lone&#8208;pair electrons on each P atom. The lone&#8208;pair electrons inevitably cause high reactivity of BP, particularly toward water/oxygen, which greatly limits the practical application of BP under ambient conditions. The other side of the coin is that BP can serve as an electron donor to promote the construction of BP&#8208;based hybrid materials and/or to boost the performance of BP or BP&#8208;based hybrid materials in applications. Here, recent advances in passivation and application of BP by addressing the interaction between the lone&#8208;pair electrons of BP and the other materials are discussed, and prospects for future research on BP are also proposed.

         <dc:description>
Immunotherapy&#8208;involved combination cancer therapy: In this comprehensive review, the rapid development in the combination of immunotherapy with other therapeutic modalities for cancer therapy are systematically introduced, and the critical challenges and future directions are also discussed.








Abstract
Immunotherapy that can activate immunity or enhance the immunogenicity of tumors has emerged as one of the most effective methods for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, single&#8208;mode immunotherapy is still confronted with several critical challenges, such as the low immune response, the low tumor infiltration, and the complex immunosuppression tumor microenvironment. Recently, the combination of immunotherapy with other therapeutic modalities has emerged as a powerful strategy to augment the therapeutic outcome in fighting against cancer. In this review, recent research advances of the combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy, phototherapy, radiotherapy, sonodynamic therapy, metabolic therapy, and microwave thermotherapy are summarized. Critical challenges and future research direction of immunotherapy&#8208;based cancer therapeutic strategy are also discussed.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Silicene/Silicon Nanosheets: An Emerging Silicon&#8208;Composed Nanostructure in Biomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This progress report highlights the developments in the construction of 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets for versatile biomedical applications, including top&#8208;down fabrication, multifunctionalization, surface engineering and their available biomedical applications in tumor theranostics and antibacteria. The multivariate analysis on the facing challenges and future developments of these silicene/silicon nanosheets have been conducted and outlooked for further clinical translations.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;composed nanomedicines are one of the most representative inorganic nanosystems in theranostic biomedicine. The emerging of new family members of silicon&#8208;composed nanosystems substantially contributes to their further clinical translation. 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets have recently been developed as an emerging topology of silicon&#8208;composed nanoparticles, which features unique planar nanostructure with large surface area, abundant surface chemistry, specific physiochemical property, and desirable biological effects. This progress report highlights and discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;art developments of the elaborate construction of 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets for versatile biomedical applications, including top&#8211;down fabrication, multifunctionalization, surface engineering, and their available biomedical applications in tumor theranostics (e.g., bioimaging, photothermal ablation, chemotherapy, chemoreactive nanotherapy, radiotherapy, and synergistic nanotherapy) and antibacteria. Their large surface area originating from 2D nanostructure not only enables efficient loading and delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, but also guarantees the multifunctionalization. Especially, 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets harness desirable photothermal&#8208;conversion performance for photonic hyperthermia and photoacoustic imaging in the near infrared biowindow, accompanied with the desirable biodegradability and biocompatibility, which is typically not possessed in other silicon&#8208;composed counterparts. The multivariate analysis on the facing challenges and future developments of these 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets have also been conducted and outlooked for further underpinning their clinical translations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon-composed nanomedicines are one of the most representative inorganic nanosystems in theranostic biomedicine. The emerging of new family members of silicon-composed nanosystems substantially contributes to their further clinical translation. 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets have recently been developed as an emerging topology of silicon-composed nanoparticles, which features unique planar nanostructure with large surface area, abundant surface chemistry, specific physiochemical property, and desirable biological effects. This progress report highlights and discusses the state-of-art developments of the elaborate construction of 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets for versatile biomedical applications, including top&#8211;down fabrication, multifunctionalization, surface engineering, and their available biomedical applications in tumor theranostics (e.g., bioimaging, photothermal ablation, chemotherapy, chemoreactive nanotherapy, radiotherapy, and synergistic nanotherapy) and antibacteria. Their large surface area originating from 2D nanostructure not only enables efficient loading and delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, but also guarantees the multifunctionalization. Especially, 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets harness desirable photothermal-conversion performance for photonic hyperthermia and photoacoustic imaging in the near infrared biowindow, accompanied with the desirable biodegradability and biocompatibility, which is typically not possessed in other silicon-composed counterparts. The multivariate analysis on the facing challenges and future developments of these 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets have also been conducted and outlooked for further underpinning their clinical translations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Programmable Logic in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent key progress achieved in designing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based catalysts, the active sites, and associated regulation strategies is summarized. Besides, the effects of metal ions, organic ligands, modifiers, functional materials, and post&#8208;treatment modules on the compositions, structures, and morphologies are also highlighted. Modular design may inspire researchers who attempt to develop MOF&#8208;based catalysts with desired functional properties. 








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as one of the most widely investigated materials in catalysis mainly due to their excellent component tunability, high surface area, adjustable pore size, and uniform active sites. However, the overwhelming number of MOF materials and complex structures has brought difficulties for researchers to select and construct suitable MOF&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, a programmable design strategy is presented based on metal ions/clusters, organic ligands, modifiers, functional materials, and post&#8208;treatment modules, which can be used to design the components, structures, and morphologies of MOF catalysts for different reactions. By establishing the corresponding relationship between these modules and functions, researchers can accurately and efficiently construct heterometallic MOFs, chiral MOFs, conductive MOFs, hierarchically porous MOFs, defective MOFs, MOF composites, and MOF&#8208;derivative catalysts. Further, this programmable design approach can also be used to regulate the physical/chemical microenvironments of pristine MOFs, MOF composites, and MOF&#8208;derivative materials for heterogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis. Finally, the challenging issues and opportunities for the future research of MOF&#8208;based catalysts are discussed. Overall, the modular design concept of this review can be applied as a potent tool for exploring the structure&#8211;activity relationships and accelerating the on&#8208;demand design of multicomponent catalysts.

         <title>Repurposing Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) as a Conductivity&#8208;Reducing Additive for Polyethylene&#8208;Based High&#8208;Voltage Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugated polymer poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is used as a conductivity&#8208;reducing additive for low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE). An ultralow amount of only 0.0005 wt% of P3HT decreases the electrical conductivity of LDPE threefold, which may facilitate the design of better insulation materials for high&#8208;voltage direct&#8208;current power cables.








Abstract
Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is found to be a highly effective conductivity&#8208;reducing additive for low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE), which introduces a new application area to the field of conjugated polymers. Additives that reduce the direct&#8208;current (DC) electrical conductivity of an insulation material at high electric fields have gained a lot of research interest because they may facilitate the design of more efficient high&#8208;voltage direct&#8208;current power cables. An ultralow concentration of regio&#8208;regular P3HT of 0.0005 wt% is found to reduce the DC conductivity of LDPE threefold, which translates into the highest efficiency reported for any conductivity&#8208;reducing additive to date. The here&#8208;established approach, i.e., the use of a conjugated polymer as a mere additive, may boost demand in absolute terms beyond the quantities needed for thin&#8208;film electronics, which would turn organic semiconductors from a niche product into commodity chemicals.

         <title>Evolving Highly Active Oxidic Iron(III) Phase from Corrosion of Intermetallic Iron Silicide to Master Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation and Selective Oxygenation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of iron for oxidizing electrocatalytic reactions is limited due to the low conductivity of FeIIIOxHy phases. Using the second most abundant element of earth's crust, silicon, intermetallic FeSi is formed, which is demonstrated to drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at high efficiency under ambient and industrially relevant conditions (500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.50&#160;&#177;&#160;0.025&#160;VRHE&#160;and 65&#160;&#176;C), as well as selectively oxygenate 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).








Abstract
In a green energy economy, electrocatalysis is essential for chemical energy conversion and to produce value added chemicals from regenerative resources. To be widely applicable, an electrocatalyst should comprise the Earth's crust's most abundant elements. The most abundant 3d metal, iron, with its multiple accessible redox states has been manifold applied in chemocatalytic processes. However, due to the low conductivity of FeIIIOxHy phases, its applicability for targeted electrocatalytic oxidation reactions such as water oxidation is still limited. Herein, it is shown that iron incorporated in conductive intermetallic iron silicide (FeSi) can be employed to meet this challenge. In contrast to silicon&#8208;poor iron&#8211;silicon alloys, intermetallic FeSi possesses an ordered structure with a peculiar bonding situation including covalent and ionic contributions together with conducting electrons. Using in situ X&#8208;ray absorption and Raman spectroscopy, it could be demonstrated that, under the applied corrosive alkaline conditions, the FeSi partly forms a unique, oxidic iron(III) phase consisting of edge and corner sharing [FeO6] octahedra together with oxidized silicon species. This phase is capable of driving the oxyge evolution reaction (OER) at high efficiency under ambient and industrially relevant conditions (500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.50&#160;&#177;&#160;0.025&#160;VRHE and 65&#160;&#176;C) and to selectively oxygenate 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).

         <title>From Design to Clinic: Engineered Nanobiomaterials for Immune Normalization Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer immunotherapy is a rapidly emerging clinical reality. Various strategies, however, often fail to unleash the antitumor immune response because of the paucity of appropriate therapeutic targets in the complex tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). In this review article, the effective nanobiomaterial&#8208;based delivery and TIME normalization approaches that promote T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immune responses are discussed.








Abstract
The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is comprised of a complex milieu that contributes to stunting antitumor immune responses by restricting T cells to accumulate in the vicinity of the tumor. Nanomedicine&#8208;based strategies are being proposed as a salvage effort to reinvigorate antitumor immunity. Various strategies, however, often fail to unleash the antitumor immune response because of the paucity of appropriate therapeutic targets in the complex TIME, invigorating a fervor of investigation into mechanisms underlying the TIME to resist nanomedicines. In this review article, effective nano/biomaterial&#8208;based delivery and TIME normalization approaches that promote T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immune response will be discussed, with a focus on emerging preclinical and clinical strategies for immune normalization. Based on currently available evidence, it seems as if the ultimate success of cancer immunotherapy and nanomedicine hinges on the capacity to normalize the TIME. Here, how nanomedicines target immunosuppressive cells and signaling pathways to broaden the impact of cancer immunotherapy are explored. Acquisition of the urgently needed knowledge of nanomedicine&#8208;mediated immune normalization will guide researchers and scientists towards clinical applications of cancer immunotherapy.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic plasmonic array structures provide a powerful platform to control light&#8211;matter interactions and have found wide applications due to their fascinating, rich, and tunable optical properties through the morphology and parameter engineering. The recent progress of metallic plasmonic arrays is reviewed, including their optical properties, nanofabrication techniques, and applications for plasmonic sensing, surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies, nanolasing, and perfect light absorption. The challenges and perspectives are also discussed.








Abstract
The vast development of nanofabrication has spurred recent progress for the manipulation of light down to a region much smaller than the wavelength. Metallic plasmonic array structures are demonstrated to be the most powerful platform to realize controllable light&#8211;matter interactions and have found wide applications due to their rich and tunable optical performance through the morphology and parameter engineering. Here, various light&#8208;management mechanisms that may exist on metallic plasmonic array structures are described. Then, the typical techniques for fabrication of metallic plasmonic arrays are summarized. Next, some recent applications of plasmonic arrays are reviewed, including plasmonic sensing, surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies, plasmonic nanolasing, and perfect light absorption. Lastly, the existing challenges and perspectives for metallic plasmonic arrays are discussed. The aim is to provide guidance for future development of metallic plasmonic array structures.

         <title>Organic Solar Cells with 18% Efficiency Enabled by an Alloy Acceptor: A Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; strategy is applied to form an acceptor alloy for fine&#8208;tuning the donor/acceptor energy alignment and blend morphology. Enhanced hole transfer and suppressed charge recombination in the alloy acceptor consisting of AQx&#8208;3 and Y6 enable a power conversion efficiency of over 18%, which is the highest documented for ternary organic solar cells utilizing two nonfullerene acceptors.








Abstract
The trade&#8208;off between the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) has become the core of current organic photovoltaic research, and realizing the minimum energy offsets that can guarantee effective charge generation is strongly desired for high&#8208;performance systems. Herein, a high&#8208;performance ternary solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of over 18% using a large&#8208;bandgap polymer donor, PM6, and a small&#8208;bandgap alloy acceptor containing two structurally similar nonfullerene acceptors (Y6 and AQx&#8208;3) is reported. This system can take full advantage of solar irradiation and forms a favorable morphology. By varying the ratio of the two acceptors, delicate regulation of the energy levels of the alloy acceptor is achieved, thereby affecting the charge dynamics in the devices. The optimal ternary device exhibits more efficient hole transfer and exciton separation than the PM6:AQx&#8208;3&#8208;based system and reduced energy loss compared with the PM6:Y6&#8208;based system, contributing to better performance. Such a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; alloy strategy, which synergizes two highly compatible acceptors, provides a promising path for boosting the photovoltaic performance of devices.

         <title>A Roadmap to Cardiac Tissue&#8208;Engineered Construct Preservation: Insights from Cells, Tissues, and Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successful preservation methods for cardiac tissue&#8208;engineered constructs will allow transportation and storage for off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf availability, both critical for translating this technology to clinical use, opening new avenues for the treatment/prevention of heart failure. A theoretical foundation for cardiac tissue&#8208;engineered construct preservation is presented, with the aim to provide a roadmap to design safe and robust storage protocols.








Abstract
Worldwide, over 26 million patients suffer from heart failure (HF). One strategy aspiring to prevent or even to reverse HF is based on the transplantation of cardiac tissue&#8208;engineered (cTE) constructs. These patient&#8208;specific constructs aim to closely resemble the native myocardium and, upon implantation on the diseased tissue, support and restore cardiac function, thereby preventing the development of HF. However, cTE constructs off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf availability in the clinical arena critically depends on the development of efficient preservation methodologies. Short&#8208; and long&#8208;term preservation of cTE constructs would enable transportation and direct availability. Herein, currently available methods, from normothermic&#8208; to hypothermic&#8208; to cryopreservation, for the preservation of cardiomyocytes, whole&#8208;heart, and regenerative materials are reviewed. A theoretical foundation and recommendations for future research on developing cTE construct specific preservation methods are provided. Current research suggests that vitrification can be a promising procedure to ensure long&#8208;term cryopreservation of cTE constructs, despite the need of high doses of cytotoxic cryoprotective agents. Instead, short&#8208;term cTE construct preservation can be achieved at normothermic or hypothermic temperatures by administration of protective additives. With further tuning of these promising methods, it is anticipated that cTE construct therapy can be brought one step closer to the patient.

         <title>Interfacial Trap&#8208;Assisted Triplet Generation in Lead Halide Perovskite Sensitized Solid&#8208;State Upconversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of interfacial properties on charge&#8208;initiated triplet sensitization in perovskite&#8208;sensitized solid&#8208;state upconversion devices is investigated. Trap&#8208;assisted triplet sensitization is demonstrated via modification of interfacial trap densities of the devices through surface treatment while monitoring the upconversion performance. Devices with more interfacial traps show brighter upconversion, highlighting the importance of interfacial control in perovskite sensitized upconversion devices.








Abstract
Photon upconversion via triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) has promise for overcoming the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit for single&#8208;junction solar cells by allowing the utilization of sub&#8208;bandgap photons. Recently, bulk perovskites have been employed as sensitizers in solid&#8208;state upconversion devices to circumvent poor exciton diffusion in previous nanocrystal (NC)&#8208;sensitized devices. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the underlying photophysics of perovskite&#8208;sensitized triplet generation is still lacking due to the difficulty of precisely controlling interfacial properties of fully solution&#8208;processed devices. In this study, interfacial properties of upconversion devices are adjusted by a mild surface solvent treatment, specifically altering perovskite surface properties without perturbing the bulk perovskite. Thermal evaporation of the annihilator precludes further solvent contamination. Counterintuitively, devices with more interfacial traps show brighter upconversion. Approximately an order of magnitude difference in upconversion brightness is observed across different interfacial solvent treatments. Sequential charge transfer and interfacial trap&#8208;assisted triplet sensitization are demonstrated by comparing upconversion performance, transient photoluminescence dynamics, and magnetic field dependence of the devices. Incomplete triplet conversion from transferred charges and consequent triplet&#8208;charge annihilation (TCA) are also observed. The observations highlight the importance of interfacial control and provide guidance for further design and optimization of upconversion devices using perovskites or other semiconductors as sensitizers.

         <title>A Review of Phototransistors Using Metal Oxide Semiconductors: Research Progress and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based phototransistors conventionally have a limit of detection range and persistent photocurrent (PPC) phenomenon, which may hinder their potential applications in devices. To solve the aforementioned problems, the latest approaches for the absorption layer are reviewed according to surface treatment, structural engineering, and the absorption materials. Furthermore, perspectives on emerging applications and outlooks are introduced.








Abstract
Metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistors have been continuously researched and mass&#8208;produced in the display industry. However, their phototransistors are still in their infancy. In particular, utilizing metal oxide semiconductors as phototransistors is difficult because of the limited light absorption wavelength range and persistent photocurrent (PPC) phenomenon. Numerous studies have attempted to improve the detectable light wavelength range and the PPC phenomenon. Here, recent studies on metal oxide phototransistors are reviewed, which have improved the range of light wavelengths and the PPC phenomenon by introducing an absorption layer of oxide or non&#8208;oxide hybrid structure. The materials of the absorption layer applied to absorb long&#8208;wavelength light are classified into oxides, chalcogenides, organic materials, perovskites, and nanodots. Finally, next&#8208;generation convergence studies combined with other research fields are introduced and future research directions are detailed.

         <dc:description>
Traceable nano&#8208;biohybrid complexes are established by one&#8208;step synthesis to serve as CRISPR&#8208;chem drug vectors (CF&#8208;TBIO). The CRISPR/Cas9 tool and the chemical drug are employed to inhibit and eliminate abnormal protein aggregations related to neurodegenerative diseases. CF&#8208;TBIO facilitates accumulation of gene&#8208;chem drugs in brain lesions, reduces the burden of protein aggregations, and provides accurate imaging signals, having great potential for synergistic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.








Abstract
Abnormal protein aggregations are essential pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. Eliminating while inhibiting the regeneration of these protein aggregates is considered an effective treatment strategy. Herein, the CRISPR/Cas9 gene&#8208;editing tool is employed to inhibit the regeneration of disease&#8208;related proteins, while chemical drugs are applied to eliminate the proteins that are produced. To efficiently deliver CRISPR&#8208;chem drugs into brain lesions, traceable nano&#8208;biohybrid complexes (F&#8208;TBIO) are constructed by one&#8208;step synthesis and CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids (CF&#8208;TBIO) are loaded in a controllable manner. CF&#8208;TBIO can knock out the BACE1 gene and reduce the burden of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, and thereby significantly improve the cognitive abilities of 2xTg&#8208;AD mice. In particular, by prolonging the dosing interval, the pathological damage and behavioral abilities of 2xTg&#8208;AD mice are still significantly improved. During the therapeutic process, CF&#8208;TBIO with a high relaxation rate provides accurate imaging signals in the complex brain physiological environment. The finding shows that CF&#8208;TBIO has great potential to serve as a CRISPR&#8208;chem drug&#8208;delivery platform for neurodegenerative diseases therapy.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered MXene/GaN van der Waals Heterojunction Ultraviolet Photodiodes with Superhigh Efficiency and Stable Current Outputs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MXene/GaN self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodiode with superhigh peak external quantum efficiency (over 99%) is reported. It is found that two synergistic effects, the robust Schottky&#8208;junction&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field and the photoexcited hot carriers, contribute to the high&#8208;performance photodiode. The MXene/GaN van der Waals heterojunction can be easily fabricated into ultraviolet photodiode arrays with uniform and stable photocurrent outputs.








Abstract
A self&#8208;powered, high&#8208;performance Ti3C2Tx MXene/GaN van der Waals heterojunction (vdWH)&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) photodiode is reported. Such integration creates a Schottky junction depth that is larger than the UV absorption depth to sufficiently separate the photoinduced electron/hole pairs, boosting the peak internal quantum efficiency over the unity and the external quantum efficiency over 99% under weak UV light without bias. The proposed Ti3C2Tx/GaN vdWH UV photodiode demonstrates pronounced photoelectric performances working in self&#8208;powered mode, including a large responsivity (284 mA W&#8722;1), a high specific detectivity (7.06 &#215; 1013 Jones), and fast response speed (rise/decay time of 7.55 &#181;s/1.67 ms). Furthermore, the remarkable photovoltaic behavior leads to an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.33% under 355 nm UV light illumination. Additionally, this work presents an easy&#8208;processing spray&#8208;deposition route for the fabrication of large&#8208;area UV photodiode arrays that exhibit highly uniform cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell performance. The MXene/GaN photodiode arrays with high&#8208;efficiency and self&#8208;powered ability show high potential for many applications, such as energy&#8208;saving communication, imaging, and sensing networks.

         <title>Wirelessly Actuated Thermo&#8208; and Magneto&#8208;Responsive Soft Bimorph Materials with Programmable Shape&#8208;Morphing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimorph material with uncoupled integration of a magnetic&#8208;responsive elastomer with a liquid crystal elastomer is reported. This material can be actuated by both magnetic and heat stimuli. It enables heterogenous material properties and local addressability for independent control of separate parts within a single device. It introduces a new dimension in the design and control of wireless soft machines.








Abstract
Soft materials that respond to wireless external stimuli are referred to as &#8220;smart&#8221; materials due to their promising potential in real&#8208;world actuation and sensing applications in robotics, microfluidics, and bioengineering. Recent years have witnessed a burst of these stimuli&#8208;responsive materials and their preliminary applications. However, their further advancement demands more versatility, configurability, and adaptability to deliver their promised benefits. Here, a dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive soft bimorph material with three configurations that enable complex programmable 3D shape&#8208;morphing is presented. The material consists of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) and magnetic&#8208;responsive elastomers (MREs) via facile fabrication that orthogonally integrates their respective stimuli&#8208;responsiveness without detrimentally altering their properties. The material offers an unprecedented wide design space and abundant degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedoms (DoFs) due to the LCE's programmable director field, the MRE's programmable magnetization profile, and diverse geometric configurations. It responds to wireless stimuli of the controlled magnetic field and environmental temperature. Its dual&#8208;responsiveness allows the independent control of different DoFs for complex shape&#8208;morphing behaviors with anisotropic material properties. A diverse set of in situ reconfigurable shape&#8208;morphing and an environment&#8208;aware untethered miniature 12&#8208;legged robot capable of locomotion and self&#8208;gripping are demonstrated. Such material can provide solutions for the development of future soft robotic and other functional devices.

         <title>Advanced Data Encryption &#8203;using 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The few&#8208;atoms&#8208;wide and amorphous native defects in multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) synthesized by chemical vapor deposition can drive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane random telegraph noise current signals that are more stable than those traditionally observed in transition metal oxides. The reason is that these defects are confined and completely surrounded by 2D layered and crystalline h&#8208;BN. This allows fabrication of high&#8208;performance true random number generators for advanced data encryption.








Abstract
Advanced data encryption requires the use of true random number generators (TRNGs) to produce unpredictable sequences of bits. TRNG circuits with high degree of randomness and low power consumption may be fabricated by using the random telegraph noise (RTN) current signals produced by polarized metal/insulator/metal (MIM) devices as entropy source. However, the RTN signals produced by MIM devices made of traditional insulators, i.e., transition metal oxides like HfO2 and Al2O3, are not stable enough due to the formation and lateral expansion of defect clusters, resulting in undesired current fluctuations and the disappearance of the RTN effect. Here, the fabrication of highly stable TRNG circuits with low power consumption, high degree of randomness (even for a long string of 224&#160;&#8722; 1 bits), and high throughput of 1 Mbit s&#8722;1 by using MIM devices made of multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is shown. Their application is also demonstrated to produce one&#8208;time passwords, which is ideal for the internet&#8208;of&#8208;everything. The superior stability of the h&#8208;BN&#8208;based TRNG is related to the presence of few&#8208;atoms&#8208;wide defects embedded within the layered and crystalline structure of the h&#8208;BN stack, which produces a confinement effect that avoids their lateral expansion and results in stable operation.

         <title>Engineering of Microcage Carbon Nanotube Architectures with Decoupled Multimodal Porosity and Amplified Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft&#8208;templating of 1D carbon nanostructures provide next&#8208;generation nanocarbon aerogels with unique microcage internal architectures and independently tuneable micro&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and macroporosities. The intricate aerogel microstructures are chemically modified with metal nanoparticles (Cu, Pd, Ru) through a structure&#8208;preserving sublimation and shock&#8208;decomposition functionalization approach. The subsequent nanoparticle&#8208;decorated aerogels exhibit amplified catalytic performance, as well as solvent&#8208;induced shape&#8208;recovery behavior.








Abstract
New approaches for the engineering of the 3D microstructure, pore modality, and chemical functionality of hierarchically porous nanocarbon assemblies are key to develop the next generation of functional aerogel and membrane materials. Here, interfacially driven assembly of carbon nanotubes (CNT) is exploited to fabricate structurally directed aerogels with highly controlled internal architectures, composed of pseudo&#8208;monolayer, CNT microcages. CNT Pickering emulsions enable engineering at fundamentally different length scales, whereby the microporosity, mesoporosity, and macroporosity are decoupled and individually controlled through CNT type, CNT number density, and process energy, respectively. In addition, metal nanocatalysts (Cu, Pd, and Ru) are embedded within the architectures through an elegant sublimation and shock&#8208;decomposition approach; introducing the first approach that enables through&#8208;volume functionalization of intricate, pre&#8208;designed aerogels without microstructural degradation. Catalytic structure&#8211;function relationships are explored in a pharma&#8208;important amidation reaction; providing insights on how the engineered frameworks enhance catalyst activity. A sophisticated array of advanced tomographic, spectroscopic, and microscopic techniques reveal an intricate 3D assembly of CNT building&#8208;blocks and their influence on the functional properties of the enhanced nanocatalysts. These advances set a basis to modulate structure and chemistry of functional aerogel materials independently in a controlled fashion for a variety of applications, including energy conversion and storage, smart electronics, and (electro)catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;New approaches for the engineering of the 3D microstructure, pore modality, and chemical functionality of hierarchically porous nanocarbon assemblies are key to develop the next generation of functional aerogel and membrane materials. Here, interfacially driven assembly of carbon nanotubes (CNT) is exploited to fabricate structurally directed aerogels with highly controlled internal architectures, composed of pseudo-monolayer, CNT microcages. CNT Pickering emulsions enable engineering at fundamentally different length scales, whereby the microporosity, mesoporosity, and macroporosity are decoupled and individually controlled through CNT type, CNT number density, and process energy, respectively. In addition, metal nanocatalysts (Cu, Pd, and Ru) are embedded within the architectures through an elegant sublimation and shock-decomposition approach; introducing the first approach that enables through-volume functionalization of intricate, pre-designed aerogels without microstructural degradation. Catalytic structure&#8211;function relationships are explored in a pharma-important amidation reaction; providing insights on how the engineered frameworks enhance catalyst activity. A sophisticated array of advanced tomographic, spectroscopic, and microscopic techniques reveal an intricate 3D assembly of CNT building-blocks and their influence on the functional properties of the enhanced nanocatalysts. These advances set a basis to modulate structure and chemistry of functional aerogel materials independently in a controlled fashion for a variety of applications, including energy conversion and storage, smart electronics, and (electro)catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;piezoelectric platforms with the ability for mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion exhibit great potential in the biomedical field. This review introduces the latest development in bio&#8208;piezoelectric platforms, highlights their design and engineering strategies, and systematically outlines the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in biomedical applications. One closely combines the range of materials structures with their biomedical performance, aiming to provide insights for their design and construction in the future.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials, with their unique ability for mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion, have been widely applied in important fields such as sensing, energy harvesting, wastewater treatment, and catalysis. In recent years, advances in material synthesis and engineering have provided new opportunities for the development of bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials with excellent biocompatibility and piezoelectric performance. Bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials have attracted interdisciplinary research interest due to recent insights on the impact of piezoelectricity on biological systems and their versatile biomedical applications. This review therefore introduces the development of bio&#8208;piezoelectric platforms from a broad perspective and highlights their design and engineering strategies. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomedical applications in both biosensing and disease treatment will be systematically outlined. The relationships between the properties, structure, and biomedical performance of the bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials are examined to provide a deep understanding of the working mechanisms in a physiological environment. Finally, the development trends and challenges are discussed, with the aim to provide new insights for the design and construction of future bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials.

         <title>Emerging of Heterostructure Materials in Energy Storage: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing heterostructures is an effective way to enhance the electrochemical performance of active materials due to the unique heterointerface structure and some unrevealed synergistic effects. Herein, an overview of the recent advancements in heterostructure materials in terms of enhanced mechanism, synthesis techniques, and electrochemical performance are summarized. Future development trends for design heterostructure electrodes are analyzed.








Abstract
With the ever&#8208;increasing adaption of large&#8208;scale energy storage systems and electric devices, the energy storage capability of batteries and supercapacitors has faced increased demand and challenges. The electrodes of these devices have experienced radical change with the introduction of nano&#8208;scale materials. As new generation materials, heterostructure materials have attracted increasing attention due to their unique interfaces, robust architectures, and synergistic effects, and thus, the ability to enhance the energy/power outputs as well as the lifespan of batteries. In this review, the recent progress in heterostructure from energy storage fields is summarized. Specifically, the fundamental natures of heterostructures, including charge redistribution, built&#8208;in electric field, and associated energy storage mechanisms, are summarized and discussed in detail. Furthermore, various synthesis routes for heterostructures in energy storage fields are roundly reviewed, and their advantages and drawbacks are analyzed. The superiorities and current achievements of heterostructure materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (Li&#8208;S batteries), supercapacitors, and other energy storage devices are discussed. Finally, the authors conclude with the current challenges and perspectives of the heterostructure materials for the fields of energy storage.

         <title>Nanoengineered Peptide&#8208;Based Antimicrobial Conductive Supramolecular Biomaterial for Cardiac Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo RGD containing peptide is shown to form self&#8208;healing and biocompatible hydrogels. Nanoengineering the network of the peptide hydrogel by polyaniline integration results in semiconductive composite hydrogel showing excellent antibacterial properties and DNA binding ability. The composite hydrogel further supports the growth of cardiac cells into functional synchronized monolayers thus highlighting its potential as an excellent supramolecular biomaterial.








Abstract
Owing to their dynamic nature and ordered architecture, supramolecular materials strikingly resemble organic components of living systems. Although short&#8208;peptide self&#8208;assembled nanostructured hydrogels are regarded as intriguing supramolecular materials for biotechnology, their application is often limited due to their low stability and considerable challenge of combining other desirable properties. Herein, a di&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;based hydrogelator containing the cell&#8208;adhesive Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD) fragment that forms a mechanically stable, self&#8208;healing hydrogel is designed. Molecular dynamics simulation reveals the presence of RGD segments on the surface of the hydrogel fibers, highlighting their cell adherence capacity. Aiming to impart conductivity, the 3D network of the hydrogel is further nanoengineered by incorporating polyaniline (PAni). The composite hydrogels demonstrate semiconductivity, excellent antibacterial activity, and DNA binding capacity. Cardiac cells grown on the surface of the composite hydrogels form functional synchronized monolayers. Taken together, the combination of these attributes in a single hydrogel suggests it as an exceptional candidate for functional supramolecular biomaterial designed for electrogenic tissue engineering.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Electronic Ground&#8208;State Charge Transfer in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amount of charge transfer between components of a van der Waals heterostructure to reach the electronic ground state can exhibit a strong temperature dependence. For a donor&#8211;bridge&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type heterostructure, the intra component electron&#8211;phonon coupling and the intercomponent electronic coupling result in a temperature&#8208;dependent density of states available for charge transfer.








Abstract
Electronic charge rearrangement between components of a heterostructure is the fundamental principle to reach the electronic ground state. It is acknowledged that the density of state distribution of the components governs the amount of charge transfer, but a notable dependence on temperature is not yet considered, particularly for weakly interacting systems. Here, it is experimentally observed that the amount of ground&#8208;state charge transfer in a van der Waals heterostructure formed by monolayer MoS2 sandwiched between graphite and a molecular electron acceptor layer increases by a factor of 3 when going from 7 K to room temperature. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic structure calculations of the full heterostructure that accounts for nuclear thermal fluctuations reveal intracomponent electron&#8211;phonon coupling and intercomponent electronic coupling as the key factors determining the amount of charge transfer. This conclusion is rationalized by a model applicable to multicomponent van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Strain Effects on Rashba Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling of 2D Hole Gases in GeSn/Ge Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first 2D hole gas (2DHG) in GeSn/Ge heterostructures and the strongest Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) among group&#8208;IV materials are demonstrated. The SOC strength is controlled by modulating the 2DHG density via top gating, which enables effective spin manipulation for a spin logic device and fast quantum computing for spin qubits via SOC effects.








Abstract
A demonstration of 2D hole gases in GeSn/Ge heterostructures with a mobility as high as 20 000&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is given. Both the Shubnikov&#8211;de Haas oscillations and integer quantum Hall effect are observed, indicating high sample quality. The Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) is investigated via magneto&#8208;transport. Further, a transition from weak localization to weak anti&#8208;localization is observed, which shows the tunability of the SOC strength by gating. The magneto&#8208;transport data are fitted to the Hikami&#8211;Larkin&#8211;Nagaoka formula. The phase&#8208;coherence and spin&#8208;relaxation times, as well as spin&#8208;splitting energy and Rashba coefficient of the k&#8208;cubic term, are extracted. The analysis reveals that the effects of strain and confinement potential at a high fraction of Sn suppress the Rashba SOC caused by the GeSn/Ge&#160;heterostructures.

The phase-coherence and spin-relaxation times, as well as spin-splitting energy and Rashba coefficient of the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-cubic term, are extracted. The analysis reveals that the effects of strain and confinement potential at a high fraction of Sn suppress the Rashba SOC caused by the GeSn/Ge&#160;heterostructures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electronic Modulation of Non&#8208;van der Waals 2D Electrocatalysts for Efficient Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical review of the progress on non&#8208;ven der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D electrocatalysts is presented. Specifically, strategies for engineering electronic structure of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, etc., are comprehensively summarized, along with the perspective for the future development of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The exploration of efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion is important for green energy development. Owing to their high surface areas and unusual electronic structure, 2D electrocatalysts have attracted increasing interest. Among them, non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D materials with numerous chemical bonds in all three dimensions and novel chemical and electronic properties beyond those of vdW 2D materials have been studied increasingly over the past decades. Herein, the progress of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts is critically reviewed, with a special emphasis on electronic structure modulation. Strategies for heteroatom doping, vacancy engineering, pore creation, alloying, and heterostructure engineering are analyzed for tuning electronic structures and achieving intrinsically enhanced electrocatalytic performances. Lastly, a roadmap for the future development of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts is provided from material, mechanism, and performance viewpoints.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Deformable and Tissue&#8208;Adhesive Liquid Metal Antennas with High Wireless Powering Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabrication of unprecedentedly deformable liquid metal antennas by direct ink writing of silicone microchannels on a 7 &#181;m&#8208;thick elastomeric substrate is demonstrated. Suture&#8208;free conformal adhesion of the polydopamine&#8208;coated thin&#8208;film antenna to ex vivo animal tissues and reliable wireless operations under mechanical deformations is also demonstrated.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable antennas are important for wireless communication using wearable and implantable devices to address mechanical mismatch at the tissue&#8211;device interface. Emerging technologies of liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based stretchable electronics are promising approaches to improve the flexibility and stretchability of conventional metal&#8208;based antennas. However, existing methods to encapsulate liquid metals require monolithically thick (at least 100&#160;&#181;m) substrates, and the resulting devices are limited in deformability and tissue&#8208;adhesiveness. To overcome this limitation, fabrication of microchannels by direct ink writing on a 7 &#181;m&#8208;thick elastomeric substrate is demonstrated, to obtain liquid metal microfluidic antennas with unprecedented deformability. The fabricated wireless light&#8208;emitting device is powered by a standard near&#8208;field&#8208;communication system (13.56&#160;MHz, 1 W) and retained a consistent operation under deformations including stretching (&gt;200% uniaxial strain), twisting (180&#176; twist), and bending (3.0 mm radius of curvature) while maintaining a high quality factor (q&#160;&gt; 20). Suture&#8208;free conformal adhesion of the polydopamine&#8208;coated device to ex vivo animal tissues under mechanical deformations is also demonstrated. This technology offers a new capability for the design and fabrication of wireless biomedical devices requiring conformable tissue&#8208;device integration toward minimally invasive, imperceptible medical treatments.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Derived Nanostructures as Multifaceted Electrodes in Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in designing metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived nanostructures for multifaceted electrodes in metal&#8211;sulfur batteries (MSBs) are presented in this review. Particularly, the inherent charge transfer, polysulfides immobilization and conversion, and morphology&#8211;property correlations for MSBs applications are systematically discussed. The future tendencies regarding the construction of MOF&#8208;derived nanostructures are also summarized, which will provide experimental/theoretical guidance in developing fast&#8208;kinetic and robust MSBs.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;sulfur batteries (MSBs) are considered up&#8208;and&#8208;coming future&#8208;generation energy storage systems because of their prominent theoretical energy density. However, the practical applications of MSBs are still hampered by several critical challenges, i.e., the shuttle effects, sluggish redox kinetics, and low conductivity of sulfur species. Recently, benefiting from the high surface area, regulated networks, molecular/atomic&#8208;level reactive sites, the metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;derived nanostructures have emerged as efficient and durable multifaceted electrodes in MSBs. Herein, a timely review is presented on recent advancements in designing MOF&#8208;derived electrodes, including fabricating strategies, composition management, topography control, and electrochemical performance assessment. Particularly, the inherent charge transfer, intrinsic polysulfide immobilization, and catalytic conversion on designing and engineering of MOF nanostructures for efficient MSBs are systematically discussed. In the end, the essence of how MOFs&#8217; nanostructures influence their electrochemical properties in MSBs and conclude the future tendencies regarding the construction of MOF&#8208;derived electrodes in MSBs is exposed. It is believed that this progress review will provide significant experimental/theoretical guidance in designing and understanding the MOF&#8208;derived nanostructures as multifaceted electrodes, thus offering promising orientations for the future development of fast&#8208;kinetic and robust MSBs in broad energy fields.

         <title>Abrasion Resistant/Waterproof Stretchable Triboelectric Yarns Based on Fermat Spirals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous triboelectric yarn based on a Fermat&#8208;spiral structure has outstanding dynamic structure stability. The unique Fermat&#8208;spiral nanofibers endow an electronic yarn with excellent electrical output, abrasion resistance, and hydrophobicity, which then can collect water&#8208;droplet energy. Moreover, textiles knitted from the electronic yarn are of distinguished stretchability and breathability. This scalable yarn and textile is thus a feasible proposal for building future &#8220;energy garments&#8221;.








Abstract
Emerging energy harvesting yarns, via triboelectric effects, have wide application prospects in new&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, few studies have been carried out regarding simultaneously achieving high electrical performance, mechanical robustness, and comfortability in industrial&#8208;scalable yarn. Here, an electronic yarn twisted into Fermat spiral, which has outstanding dynamic structure stability, is reported. The Fermat&#8208;spiral&#8208;based energy yarns (FSBEY) can simultaneously realize ultrahigh abrasion resistance (over 5000 Martindale standard abrasion cycles), stable reversible strain (100%), and excellent electrical output. Considerably high output (105&#160;V, &#8776;1.2 &#181;A under 2&#160;Hz) can be attained upon contacting a single yarn (30&#160;cm) with latex material, which is superior to most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stretchable triboelectric yarns. The application of these FSBEY in wireless gesture recognition, smart screen information protection, and harvesting of energy from water dropletsis demonstrated. Moreover, textiles knitted from the FSBEY have distinguished waterproof nature and are breathable. This work shows a feasible proposal for building future &#8220;energy garments&#8221;.

         <title>Dendritic Network Implementable Organic Neurofiber Transistors with Enhanced Memory Cyclic Endurance for Spatiotemporal Iterative Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are proposed. The architecture of the fibrous organic electrochemical transistors consisting of a double&#8208;stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enables multiple implementation of synaptic junctions via simple physical contact of gate&#8208;electrode microfibers, as the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber.








Abstract
Dendritic network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are proposed. The architecture of the fibrous organic electrochemical transistors consisting of a double&#8208;stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enables the highly sensitive multiple implementation of synaptic junctions via simple physical contact of gate&#8208;electrode microfibers, similar to the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber. In particular, carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;functionalized polythiophene as a semiconductor channel material provides stable gate&#8208;field&#8208;dependent multilevel memory characteristics with long&#8208;term stability and cyclic endurance, unlike the conventional poly(alkylthiophene)&#8208;based neuromorphic electrochemical transistors, which exhibit short retention and unstable endurance. The dissociation of the carboxylic acid of the polythiophene enables reversible doping and dedoping of the polythiophene channel by effectively stabilizing the ions that penetrate the channel during potentiation and depression cycles, leading to the reliable cyclic endurance of the device. The synaptic weight of the neurofiber transistors with a dendritic network maintains the state levels stably and is independently updated with each synapse connected with the presynaptic neuron to a specific state level. Finally, the neurofiber transistor demonstrates successful speech recognition based on iterative spiking neural network learning in the time domain, showing a substantial recognition accuracy of 88.9%.

The architecture of the fibrous organic electrochemical transistors consisting of a double-stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enables multiple implementation of synaptic junctions via simple physical contact of gate-electrode microfibers, as the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dendritic network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are proposed. The architecture of the fibrous organic electrochemical transistors consisting of a double-stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enables the highly sensitive multiple implementation of synaptic junctions via simple physical contact of gate-electrode microfibers, similar to the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber. In particular, carboxylic-acid-functionalized polythiophene as a semiconductor channel material provides stable gate-field-dependent multilevel memory characteristics with long-term stability and cyclic endurance, unlike the conventional poly(alkylthiophene)-based neuromorphic electrochemical transistors, which exhibit short retention and unstable endurance. The dissociation of the carboxylic acid of the polythiophene enables reversible doping and dedoping of the polythiophene channel by effectively stabilizing the ions that penetrate the channel during potentiation and depression cycles, leading to the reliable cyclic endurance of the device. The synaptic weight of the neurofiber transistors with a dendritic network maintains the state levels stably and is independently updated with each synapse connected with the presynaptic neuron to a specific state level. Finally, the neurofiber transistor demonstrates successful speech recognition based on iterative spiking neural network learning in the time domain, showing a substantial recognition accuracy of 88.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Digital Electrochemistry for On&#8208;Chip Heterogeneous Material Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel digital electrochemistry approach is proposed, which site&#8208;selectively carries out electrochemical reactions to deposit electroactive materials. Multicolored electrochromic patterns and actuator arrays are fabricated. The approach can be extended to a broad range of materials and structures, opening up a new path for advanced heterogeneous microsystem integration.








Abstract
Many modern electronic applications rely on functional units arranged in an active&#8208;matrix integrated on a single chip. The active&#8208;matrix allows numerous identical device pixels to be addressed within a single system. However, next&#8208;generation electronics requires heterogeneous integration of dissimilar devices, where sensors, actuators, and display pixels sense and interact with the local environment. Heterogeneous material integration allows the reduction of size, increase of functionality, and enhancement of performance; however, it is challenging since front&#8208;end fabrication technologies in microelectronics put extremely high demands on materials, fabrication protocols, and processing environments. To overcome the obstacle in heterogeneous material integration, digital electrochemistry is explored here, which site&#8208;selectively carries out electrochemical processes to deposit and address electroactive materials within the pixel array. More specifically, an amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (a&#8208;IGZO) thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor (TFT) active&#8208;matrix is used to address pixels within the matrix and locally control electrochemical reactions for material growth and actuation. The digital electrochemistry procedure is studied in&#8208;depth by using polypyrrole (PPy) as a model material. Active&#8208;matrix&#8208;driven multicolored electrochromic patterns and actuator arrays are fabricated to demonstrate the capabilities of this approach for material integration. The approach can be extended to a broad range of materials and structures, opening up a new path for advanced heterogeneous microsystem integration.
