         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Ultrathin Perfect Absorber for High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ultrathin perfect absorber (UPA) enables efficient photothermal conversion (PC) in renewable chemical and energy systems. However, it is challenging so far to obtain efficient absorption with thickness significantly less than the wavelength, especially considering the common view that an ultrathin film can absorb at most 50% of incident light. Here we report a highly light&#8208;absorbing and mechanically stable UPA by learning from the honeycomb mirror design of the crab compound eyes. With the hollow apertures enclosed by the self&#8208;supporting ultrathin film of reduced graphene oxide and gold nanoparticles, the absorber achieves spoof&#8208;plasmon enhanced broadband absorption in solar spectrum and low radiative decay in infrared. Specifically, a strong absorption (87%) is realized by the apertures with cross&#8208;section thickness of 1/20 of the wavelength, which is 7.3 times stronger than a planar counterpart with the identical material. We also experimentally demonstrate its high PC efficiency up to 64%, with hot&#8208;electron temperature as high as 2,344&#8201;K. Utilizing its low thermal mass nature, we constructed a high&#8208;speed visible&#8208;to&#8208;infrared converter. The absorber could enable high&#8208;performance PC processes for future interfacial catalysis and photon&#8208;detection.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Microsensors Inspired by Noctiluca Scintillans for Small&#8208;Defect Positioning and Electrical&#8208;Stress Visualization in Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
small defects induce concentrated electrical stress in dielectric polymers, leading to premature failure of materials. Existing sensing methods fail to effectively visualize these defects owing to the invisible&#8208;energy state of the electric field. Thus, it is necessary to establish a nondestructive method for the real&#8208;time detection of small defects in dielectric polymers. In this study, a self&#8208;reporting microsensor (SRM) inspired by Noctiluca scintillans is designed to endow materials with the ability of self&#8208;detection for defects and electrical stress. The SRM leverages the energy of a nearby electric field to emit measurable fluorescence, enabling defect localization and diagnosis as well as electrical&#8208;stress visualization. A controllable dielectric microsphere is constructed to achieve an adjustable electroluminescence threshold for the SRM, thereby increasing its detection accuracy while decreasing the electroluminescence threshold. The potential degradation in the polymer performance owing to SRM implantation is addressed by assembling long molecular chains on the SRM surface to spontaneously generate an interpenetrating network. Results of finite element analyses and experiments demonstrate that the SRM can effectively realize nondestructive visualization and positioning of small defects and concentrated electrical stress in polymers, positioning it as a promising sensing method for monitoring the electric field and charge distribution in materials.

         <title>A Critical Review on Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: From Research Advances to Practical Perspectives</title>

Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT&#8208;Na/S) batteries are promising alternatives for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems with high energy density and high power density. However, some notorious issues are hampering the practical application of RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. Besides, the working mechanism of RT&#8208;Na/S batteries under practical conditions such as high sulfur loading, lean electrolyte, and low capacity ratio between the negative and positive electrode (N/P ratio), is of essential importance for practical applications, yet the significance of these parameters has long been disregarded. Herein, we comprehensively review recent advances on Na metal anode, S cathode, electrolyte, and separator engineering for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. The discrepancies between laboratory research and practical conditions are elaborately discussed, endeavors toward practical applications are highlighted, and suggestions for the practical values of the crucial parameters are rationally proposed. Furthermore, an empirical equation to estimate the actual energy density of RT&#8208;Na/S pouch cells under practical conditions is rationally proposed for the first time, making it possible to evaluate the gravimetric energy density of the cells under practical conditions. This review aims to reemphasize the vital importance of the crucial parameters for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries to bridge the gaps between laboratory research and practical applications.

         <title>Biocompatible 2D Materials via Liquid Phase Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs), such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP), have been proposed for different types of bioapplications, owing to their unique physicochemical, electrical, optical and mechanical properties. Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE), as a one of the most effective up&#8208;scalable and size&#8208;controllable methods, is becoming the standard process to produce high quantity of various 2DM types as it can benefit of the use of green and biocompatible conditions. The resulting exfoliated layered materials have garnered significant attention because of their biocompatibility and their potential use in biomedicine as new multimodal therapeutics, antimicrobials and biosensors. In this review, we focused our attention on the production of LPE&#8208;assisted 2DMs in aqueous solutions with or without the aid of surfactants, bioactive or non&#8208;natural molecules. We further concluded with our insights into the possibilities of applications of such materials in the biological and biomedical fields.

         <title>Long&#8208;range Atomic Order on Double&#8208;Stepped Al2O3(0001) Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The deterministic preparation of highly ordered single&#8208;crystalline surfaces is a key step for studying and utilizing the physical properties of various advanced materials. This paper presents the fast and straightforward preparation of vicinal Al2O3(0001) surfaces with micrometer&#8208;scale atomic order. Crisp electron&#8208;diffraction spots up to at least 20th order evidence atomic coherence on terraces with widths exceeding 1&#160;&#181;m. The unique combination of three properties of Al2O3(0001) underlie this remarkable coherence: its high&#8208;temperature stability; the differences in the ionic bonding systems of the surface as compared to the bulk; and the fact that the terraces are non&#8208;polar whereas the step edges have a polar character. The step edges are furthermore found to have alternating configurations, which drive a step&#8208;doubling transition. On double&#8208;stepped surfaces, the Al&#8208;rich (31&#215;31)R&#177;9$(\sqrt {31}\times \sqrt {31})\textrm {R}\pm 9$&#176; surface reconstruction attains a singular in&#8208;plane orientation. These results set a benchmark for high&#8208;quality surface preparation and thus expand the scope for both fundamental studies on and the technological utilization of exciting material&#160;systems.

         <title>Progress and Opportunities for Machine Learning in Materials and Processes of Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent years, there has been a widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) technologies to unravel intricate relationships among diverse parameters in various additive manufacturing (AM) techniques. These ML models excel at recognizing complex patterns from extensive, well&#8208;curated datasets, thereby unveiling latent knowledge crucial for informed decision&#8208;making during the AM process. The collaborative synergy between ML and AM holds the potential to revolutionize the design and production of AM&#8208;printed parts. By leveraging the copious data generated in AM processes, ML algorithms can significantly enhance design optimization. This is achieved by employing forward problem analysis in tandem with iterative optimization techniques or generative artificial intelligence tools. The approach involves reverse&#8208;engineering from desired outcomes to yield valuable insights, ultimately streamlining the AM design process. This review paper delves into the challenges and opportunities emerging at the intersection of these two dynamic fields. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the publication landscape for ML&#8208;related research in the field of AM, explores common ML applications in AM research (such as quality control, process optimization, design optimization, microstructure analysis, and material formulation) and concludes by presenting an outlook that underscores the utilization of advanced ML models, the development of emerging sensors, and ML applications in emerging AM&#8208;related fields. Notably, ML has garnered increased attention in AM due to its superior performance across various AM&#8208;related applications. We envision that the integration of ML into AM processes will significantly enhance 3D printing capabilities across diverse AM&#8208;related research areas.

These ML models excel at recognizing complex patterns from extensive, well-curated datasets, thereby unveiling latent knowledge crucial for informed decision-making during the AM process. The collaborative synergy between ML and AM holds the potential to revolutionize the design and production of AM-printed parts. By leveraging the copious data generated in AM processes, ML algorithms can significantly enhance design optimization. This is achieved by employing forward problem analysis in tandem with iterative optimization techniques or generative artificial intelligence tools. The approach involves reverse-engineering from desired outcomes to yield valuable insights, ultimately streamlining the AM design process. This review paper delves into the challenges and opportunities emerging at the intersection of these two dynamic fields. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the publication landscape for ML-related research in the field of AM, explores common ML applications in AM research (such as quality control, process optimization, design optimization, microstructure analysis, and material formulation) and concludes by presenting an outlook that underscores the utilization of advanced ML models, the development of emerging sensors, and ML applications in emerging AM-related fields. Notably, ML has garnered increased attention in AM due to its superior performance across various AM-related applications. We envision that the integration of ML into AM processes will significantly enhance 3D printing capabilities across diverse AM-related research areas.

         <title>Ultrastable N&#8208;Type Semiconducting Fiber Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Highly Sensitive Biosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A meticulously designed wet&#8208;spinning method successfully produces n&#8208;type semiconducting fibers with reduced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance and ordered molecular arrangement. Organic electrochemical transistors based on these fibers exhibit superior performance and unprecedented stability, advancing the development of highly sensitive biosensors and fiber&#8208;based complementary logic circuits, and paving the way for fiber&#8208;based bioelectronics.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have attracted increasing attention due to their merits of high transconductance, low operating voltage, and good biocompatibility, ideal for biosensors. However, further advances in their practical applications face challenges of low n&#8208;type performance and poor stability. Here, it is demonstrated that wet&#8208;spinning the commercially available n&#8208;type conjugated polymer poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) into highly aligned and crystalline fibers enhances both OECT performance and stability. Although BBL is only soluble in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point strong acids, it can be wet&#8208;spun into high&#8208;quality fibers with adjustable diameters. The BBL fiber OECTs exhibit a record&#8208;high area&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,A) of 2.40 &#181;S &#181;m&#8722;2 and over 10 times higher figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#181;C*) than its thin&#8208;film counterparts. More importantly, these fiber OECTs exhibit remarkable stability with no noticeable performance attenuation after 1500 cycles over 4&#160;h operation, outperforming all previously reported n&#8208;type OECTs. The superior performance and stability can be attributed to shorter &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance and ordered molecular arrangement in the fibers, endowing the BBL fiber OECT&#8208;based biosensors with outstanding sensitivity while keeping a miniaturized form factor. This work demonstrates that, beyond new material development, developing new fabrication technology is also crucial for addressing the performance and stability issues in n&#8208;type OECTs.

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Coordinated Tin Halide Perovskites for Wearable Health Monitoring and Weak Light Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Cyanoethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium iodide (CNI) is introduced to inhibit Sn2+ oxidation via strong coordination interaction. Self&#8208;powered photodetectors based on the CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite film with CNI exhibit low dark current, high detectivity, fast response speed, and good stability. Consequently, wearable health monitoring and weak light imaging with zero power consumption are successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Low&#8208;toxicity tin halide perovskites with excellent optoelectronic properties are promising candidates for photodetection. However, tin halide perovskite photodetectors have suffered from high dark current owing to uncontrollable Sn2+ oxidation. Here, 2&#8208;cyanoethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium iodide (CNI) is introduced in CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite films to inhibit Sn2+ oxidation by the strong coordination interaction between the cyano group (C&#8801;N) and Sn2+. Consequently, FASnI3&#8208;CNI films exhibit reduced nonradiative recombination and lower trap density. The self&#8208;powered photodetector based on FASnI3&#8208;CNI exhibits low dark current (1.04 &#215; 10&#8722;9 A cm&#8722;2), high detectivity (2.2 &#215; 1013 Jones at 785&#160;nm), fast response speed (2.62 &#181;s), and good stability. Mechanism studies show the increase in the activation energy required for thermal emission and generated&#160;carriers, leading to a lower dark current in the FASnI3&#8208;CNI photodetector. In addition, flexible photodetectors based on FASnI3&#8208;CNI, exhibiting high detectivity and fast response speed, are employed in wearable electronics to monitor the human heart rate under weak light and zero bias conditions. Finally, the FASnI3&#8208;CNI perovskite photodetectors are integrated with a 32&#160;&#215;&#160;32 thin&#8208;film transistor backplane, capable of ultraweak light (170 nW cm&#8722;2) real&#8208;time imaging with high contrast, and zero power consumption, demonstrating the great potential for image sensor applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Lipid Nanoparticles Based on Host&#8211;Guest Recognition: A New Generation Delivery System of mRNA Vaccines For Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular lipid nanoparticles (SMLNP) are developed to codeliver mRNA and an adjuvant (R848) through host&#8722;guest recognition, showing brilliant potentials in cancer immunotherapy. SMLNP@mRNAOVA/R848 significantly increases the translation efficiency, stimulates DC maturation, and promotes antigen presentation, thus eliciting potent antitumor immune responses. Excitingly, the antitumor performances of mRNA vaccine are further potentiated by synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade.








Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC) maturation is a crucial process for antigen presentation and the initiation of T cell&#8208;mediated immune responses. Toll&#8208;like receptors play pivotal roles in stimulating DC maturation and promoting antigen presentation. Here, a novel message RNA (mRNA) cancer vaccine is reported that boosts antitumor efficacy by codelivering an mRNA encoding tumor antigen and a TLR7/8 agonist (R848) to DC using supramolecular lipid nanoparticles (SMLNP) as a delivery platform, in which a new ionizable lipid (N2&#8208;3L) remarkably enhances the translation efficiency of mRNA and a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD)&#8208;modified ionizable lipid (Lip&#8208;CD) encapsulates R848. The incorporation of R848 adjuvant into the mRNA vaccine through noncovalent host&#8211;guest complexation significantly promotes DC maturation and antigen presentation after vaccination, thus resulting in superior antitumor efficacy in vivo. Moreover, the antitumor efficacy is further boosted synergized with immune checkpoint blockade by potentiating the anticancer capability of cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrated in tumor sites. This work indicates that SMLNP shows brilliant potential as next&#8208;generation delivery system in the development of mRNA vaccines with high efficacy.

         <title>Achieving Bright and Long&#8208;Lived Aqueous Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Carbon Nitrogen Dots Through In Situ Host&#8211;Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study successfully develops an efficient in situ host&#8211;guest approach for synthesizing water&#8208;boosted phosphorescent carbon nitrogen dots through a one&#8208;pot pyrolysis of cyanuric acid. This material exhibits bright and long&#8208;lived aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, even in fully aqueous environments, thereby demonstrating significant potential for high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio afterglow bioimaging both in vitro and in vivo, as well as advanced information encryption applications.








Abstract
The development of bright and long&#8208;lived aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials holds paramount importance in broadening the application scope of RTP material system. However, the conventional RTP materials usually exhibit low efficiency and short lifetime in aqueous solution. Herein, an in situ host&#8211;guest strategy is proposed to achieve cyanuric acid (CA)&#8208;derived phosphorescent carbon nitrogen dots (CNDs) composite (CNDs@CA) that demonstrates a significant enhancement of both quantum yield (QY) and lifetime mediated by water. Detailed investigations reveal that the robust hydrogen bonding networks between CNDs@CA and water effectively stabilize triplet excitons and suppress nonradiative decays, as well as facilitate efficient energy transfer from CA to CNDs, thereby prolonging the lifetime and enhancing the efficiency of RTP. The phosphorescent QY and lifetime of CNDs@CA can be increased to 26.89% (3.9&#8208;fold increase) and 951.25&#160;ms (5.5&#8208;fold increase), respectively, with the incorporation of 50 wt% water under ambient conditions. Even in fully aqueous environments (with up to 400 wt% water added), CNDs@CA exhibits persistent water&#8208;boosted RTP properties, demonstrating exceptional stability. The robust water&#8208;boosted RTP property of CNDs@CA in aqueous solutions presents significant potential for high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio afterglow bioimaging as well as advanced information encryption.

         <title>Defect Passivation Refinement in Perovskite Photovoltaics: Achieving Efficiency over 45% under Low&#8208;Light and Low&#8208;Temperature Dual Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A refined defect passivation in perovskite films is designed, which shows a multi&#8208;interaction mechanism between the perovskite and passivator. The shift of molecular bonding upon cooling down the film leads to a stronger passivation of iodine/formamidine vacancies. Such mechanism on device under low&#8208;light and low&#8208;temperature conditions is further leveraged and a record efficiency over 45% with durable ambient stability is obtained.








Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaics have emerged as the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation light&#8208;to&#8208;electricity technology. However, their practical application still suffers from energy loss induced by intrinsic defects within the perovskite lattice. Here, a refined defect passivation in perovskite films is designed, which shows a multi&#8208;interaction mechanism between the perovskite and passivator. Interestingly, a shift of molecular bonding is observed upon cooling down the film, leading to a stronger passivation of iodine/formamidine vacancies. Such mechanism on device under low&#8208;light and low&#8208;temperature conditions is further leveraged and a record efficiency over 45% with durable ambient stability (T90 &gt; 4000&#160;h) is obtained. The pioneer application of perovskite solar cells in above dual extreme conditions in this work reveals the key principles of designing functional groups for the passivators, and also demonstrates the capability of perovskites for diverse terrestrial energy conversion applications in demanding environments such as polar regions and outer space.

         <title>Phospholipid Membranes as Chemically and Functionally Tunable Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellular membranes feature a couple of unique properties to control various biological functions at this interface. Protein function can be modulated by specific lipids directly or by bulk membrane properties. Using this principle, a number of advanced membrane&#8208;based applications are conceivable where the membrane acts as a modulator of biological function.








Abstract
The sheet&#8208;like lipid bilayer is the fundamental structural component of all cell membranes. Its building blocks are phospholipids and cholesterol. Their amphiphilic structure spontaneously leads to the formation of a bilayer in aqueous environment. Lipids are not just structural elements. Individual lipid species, the lipid membrane structure, and lipid dynamics influence and regulate membrane protein function. An exciting field is emerging where the membrane&#8208;associated material properties of different bilayer systems are used in designing innovative solutions for widespread applications across various fields, such as the food industry, cosmetics, nano&#8208; and biomedicine, drug storage and delivery, biotechnology, nano&#8208; and biosensors, and computing. Here, the authors summarize what is known about how lipids determine the properties and functions of biological membranes and how this has been or can be translated into innovative applications. Based on recent progress in the understanding of membrane structure, dynamics, and physical properties, a perspective is provided on how membrane&#8208;controlled regulation of protein functions can extend current applications and even offer new applications.

         <title>Molecular Design for Vertical Phase Distribution Modulation in High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the effect of side&#8208;chain polarity on organic solar cells (OSCs) performance by synthesizing two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, ITIC&#8208;16F and ITIC&#8208;E. It shows that side&#8208;chain polarity influences component distribution within the photoactive layer, affecting excitation energy levels and charge transport. Incorporating ITIC&#8208;E significantly enhances power conversion efficiency to 19.4%, highlighting side&#8208;chain manipulation as a key strategy for OSC enhancement.








Abstract
Component distribution within the photoactive layer dictates the morphology and electronic structure and substantially influences the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, a molecular design strategy is introduced to manipulate component and energetics distribution by adjusting side&#8208;chain polarity. Two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), ITIC&#8208;16F and ITIC&#8208;E, are synthesized by introducing different polar functional substituents onto the side chains of ITIC. The alterations result in different distribution tendencies in the bulk heterojunction film: ITIC&#8208;16F with intensified hydrophobicity aligns predominantly with the top surface, while ITIC&#8208;E with strong hydrophilicity gravitates toward the bottom. This divergence directly impacts the vertical distribution of the excitation energy levels, thereby influencing the excitation kinetics over extended time periods and larger spatial ranges including enhanced diffusion&#8208;mediated exciton dissociation and stimulated charge carrier transport. Benefitting from the favorable energy distribution, the device incorporating ITIC&#8208;E into the PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl blend showcases an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.4%. This work highlights side&#8208;chain polarity manipulation as a promising strategy for designing efficient NFA molecules and underscores the pivotal role of spatial energetics distribution in OSC performance.

         <title>Gradiently Foaming Ultrasoft Hydrogel with Stop Holes for Highly Deformable, Crack&#8208;Resistant and Sensitive Conformal Human&#8208;Machine Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To solve the challenges of simultaneously achieving ultrasoftness, good mechanical robustness, and high sensitivity for wearable sensing applications, for the first time, this work proposes a universal phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced bubbling strategy to fabricate gradient foam&#8208;shaped hydrogels with stop holes as ultrasoft, high deformability, crack&#8208;resistance, and sensitive conformal HMIs for remote disease diagnosis and smart aquaculture.








Abstract
Hydrogels are considered as promising materials for human&#8208;machine interfaces (HMIs) owing to their merits of tailorable mechanical and electrical properties; nevertheless, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve ultrasoftness, good mechanical robustness and high sensitivity, which are the pre&#8208;requisite requirements for wearable sensing applications. Herein, for the first time, this work proposes a universal phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced bubbling strategy to fabricate ultrasoft gradient foam&#8208;shaped hydrogels (FSHs) with stop holes for high deformability, crack&#8208;resistance and sensitive conformal HMIs. As a typical system, the FSH based on polyacrylamide/sodium alginate system shows an ultralow Young's modulus (1.68&#160;kPa), increased sustainable strain (1411%), enhanced fracture toughness (915.6 J&#160;m&#8722;2), improved tensile sensitivity (21.77), and compressive sensitivity (65.23 kPa&#8722;1). The FSHs are used for precisely acquiring and identifying gesture commands of the operator to remotely control a surgical robot for endoscopy and an electric ship in a first&#8208;person perspective for cruising, feeding crabs and monitoring the environmental change in real&#8208;time.

         <title>Electropolymerized Bipolar Poly(2,3&#8208;diaminophenazine) Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Al&#8208;Ion Batteries with An Extended Temperature Range of &#8722;20 to 45&#160;&#176;C</title>

The high charge density and strong electrostatic interactions of Al3+ present a significant challenge in achieving high&#8208;performance aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a bipolar polymer with a long&#8208;range conjugated skeleton, high electronic/ionic conductivity, and a three&#8208;electron reaction mechanism is designed that enables high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance, even within a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;45 &#176;C).








Abstract
Achieving reversible insertion/extraction in most cathodes for aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AAIBs) is a significant challenge due to the high charge density of Al3+ and strong electrostatic interactions. Organic materials facilitate the hosting of multivalent carriers and rapid ions diffusion through the rearrangement of chemical bonds. Here, a bipolar conjugated poly(2,3&#8208;diaminophenazine) (PDAP) on carbon substrates prepared via a straightforward electropolymerization method is introduced as cathode for AAIBs. The integration of n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type active units endow PDAP with an increased number of sites for ions interaction. The long&#8208;range conjugated skeleton enhances electron delocalization and collaborates with carbon to ensure high conductivity. Moreover, the strong intermolecular interactions including &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding significantly enhance its stability. Consequently, the Al//PDAP battery exhibits a large capacity of 338 mAh g&#8722;1 with long lifespan and high&#8208;rate capability. It consistently demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performances even under extreme conditions with capacities of 155 and 348 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20 and 45&#160;&#176;C, respectively. In/ex situ spectroscopy comprehensively elucidates its cation/anion (Al3+/H3O+ and ClO4&#8722;) storage with 3&#8208;electron transfer in dual electroactive centers (C&#9552;N and &#8211;NH&#8211;). This study presents a promising strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance organic cathode for AAIBs over a wide temperature range.

Here, a bipolar conjugated poly(2,3-diaminophenazine) (PDAP) on carbon substrates prepared via a straightforward electropolymerization method is introduced as cathode for AAIBs. The integration of n-type and p-type active units endow PDAP with an increased number of sites for ions interaction. The long-range conjugated skeleton enhances electron delocalization and collaborates with carbon to ensure high conductivity. Moreover, the strong intermolecular interactions including &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding significantly enhance its stability. Consequently, the Al//PDAP battery exhibits a large capacity of 338 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with long lifespan and high-rate capability. It consistently demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performances even under extreme conditions with capacities of 155 and 348 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;20 and 45&#160;&#176;C, respectively. In/ex situ spectroscopy comprehensively elucidates its cation/anion (Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) storage with 3-electron transfer in dual electroactive centers (C&#9552;N and &#8211;NH&#8211;). This study presents a promising strategy for constructing high-performance organic cathode for AAIBs over a wide temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Touchless Thermosensation Enabled by Flexible Infrared Photothermoelectric Detector for Temperature Prewarning Function of Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize the touchless thermosensation function of e&#8208;skin, a flexible and wearable infrared detector is developed, based on the photothermoelectric coupling of tellurium&#8208;based thermoelectric multilayer film and infrared&#8208;absorbing polyimide substrate, which exhibits high sensitivity to the thermal radiation from hot and cold stimuli. Moreover, the integration of wearable infrared detector with a soft robotic gripper for temperature prewarning is demonstrated.








Abstract
Artificial skin, endowed with the capability to perceive thermal stimuli without physical contact, will bring innovative interactive experiences into smart robotics and augmented reality. The implementation of touchless thermosensation, responding to both hot and cold stimuli, relies on the construction of a flexible infrared detector operating in the long&#8208;wavelength infrared range to capture the spontaneous thermal radiation. This imposes rigorous requirements on the photodetection performance and mechanical flexibility of the detector. Herein, a flexible and wearable infrared detector is presented, on basis of the photothermoelectric coupling of the tellurium&#8208;based thermoelectric multilayer film and the infrared&#8208;absorbing polyimide substrate. By suppressing the optical reflection loss and aligning the destructive interference position with the absorption peak of polyimide, the fabricated thermopile detector exhibits high sensitivity to the thermal radiation over a broad source temperature range from &#8722;50 to 110&#160;&#176;C, even capable of resolving 0.05&#160;&#176;C temperature change. Spatially resolved radiation distribution sensing is also achieved by constructing an integrated thermopile array. Furthermore, an established temperature prewarning system is demonstrated for soft robotic gripper, enabling the identification of noxious thermal stimuli in a contactless manner. A feasible strategy is offered here to integrate the infrared detection technique into the sensory modality of electronic skin.

         <title>Sustained and Localized Drug Depot Release Using Radiation&#8208;Activated Scintillating Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clinical cancer treatment often involves X&#8208;ray radiation therapy, and spatially precise radiation treatment offers the possibility of improving the therapeutic window of systemic chemotherapies designed to be activated by irradiation. This work presents scintillating nanoparticles that generate light in response to irradiation, uncaging a reservoir of sustained chemotherapy release within tumor tissue while sparing off&#8208;target sites of toxicity.








Abstract
Clinical treatment of cancer commonly incorporates X&#8208;ray radiation therapy (XRT), and developing spatially precise radiation&#8208;activatable drug delivery strategies may improve XRT efficacy while limiting off&#8208;target toxicities associated with systemically administered drugs. Nevertheless, achieving this has been challenging thus far because strategies typically rely on radical species with short lifespans, and the inherent nature of hypoxic and acidic tumor microenvironments may encourage spatially heterogeneous effects. It is hypothesized that the challenge could be bypassed by using scintillating nanoparticles that emit light upon X&#8208;ray absorption, locally forming therapeutic drug depots in tumor tissues. Thus a nanoparticle platform (Scintillating nanoparticle Drug Depot; SciDD) that enables the local release of cytotoxic payloads only after activation by XRT is developed, thereby limiting off&#8208;target toxicity. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, SciDD is used to deliver a microtubule&#8208;destabilizing payload MMAE (monomethyl auristatin E). With as little as a 2&#160;Gy local irradiation to tumors, MMAE payloads are released effectively to kill tumor cells. XRT&#8208;mediated drug release is demonstrated in multiple mouse cancer models and showed efficacy over XRT alone (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.0001). This work shows that SciDD can act as a local drug depot with spatiotemporally controlled release of cancer therapeutics.

         <title>Dynamic Hyperspectral Holography Enabled by Inverse&#8208;Designed Metasurfaces with Oblique Helicoidal Cholesterics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metasurfaces are flat arrays of nanostructures that allow exquisite control of phase and amplitude of incident light. Although metasurfaces offer new active element for both fundamental science and applications, the challenge still remains to overcome their low information capacity and passive nature. Here, by integrating an inverse&#8208;designed&#8208;metasurface with oblique helicoidal cholesteric liquid crystal (ChOH), we demonstrate simultaneous spatial and spectral tunable metasurfaces with a high information capacity for dynamic hyperspectral holography. The inverse design facilitates a single&#8208;phase map encoding of ten independent holographic images at different wavelengths. ChOH provides precise spectral modulation with narrow bandwidth and wide tunable regime in response to programmed stimuli, thus enabling dynamic switching of the multicolor holography. Our results provide a simple and generalizable principles for the rational design of interactive metasurfaces that will find numerous applications, including security platform.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Responsive Manganese&#8208;Based Bacterial Materials Synergistically Activate the cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;responsive manganese (Mn)&#8208;based bacterial material (E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG) that exhibits an exceptional ability to synergistically activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway is successfully engineered. This work provides valuable insights for the development of bacteria&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Stimulating the cyclic guanosine monophophate(GMP)&#8208;adenosine monophosphate (AMP) synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a crucial strategy by which bacteria activate the tumor immune system. However, the limited stimulation capability poses significant challenges in advancing bacterial immunotherapy. Here, an adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;responsive manganese (Mn)&#8208;based bacterial material (E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG (polyethylene glycol)) is engineered successfully, which exhibits an exceptional ability to synergistically activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. In the tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by elevated ATP levels, this biohybrid material degrades, resulting in the release of divalent manganese ions (Mn2+) and subsequent bacteria exposure. This combination synergistically activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, as Mn2+ enhances the sensitivity of cGAS to the extracellular DNA (eDNA) secreted by the bacteria. The results of the in vivo experiments demonstrate that the biohybrid materials E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG and VNP20009@PDMC&#8208;PEG effectively inhibit the growth of subcutaneous melanoma in mice and in situ liver cancer in rabbits. Valuable insights for the development of bacteria&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy are provided here.

         <title>Anisotropic Morphing in Bistable Kirigami through Symmetry Breaking and Geometric Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry breaking of slit pattern in bistable kirigami metamaterials is leveraged to generate geometric frustration and anisotropic morphing in planar and flat&#8208;to&#8208;3D shape deployment. The role played by symmetry groups in the nonuniform scaling of bistable kirigami metamaterials is first mapped in the entire morphing space and then harnessed as design strategy for demonstrating arbitrary scaled bistable deployment.








Abstract
Shape morphing in bistable kirigami enables remarkable functionalities appealing to a diverse range of applications across the spectrum of length scale. At the core of their shape shifting lies the architecture of their repeating unit, where highly deformable slits and quasi&#8208;rigid rotating units often exhibit multiple symmetries that confer isotropic deployment obeying uniform scaling transformation. In this work, symmetry breaking in bistable kirigami is investigated to access geometric frustration and anisotropic morphing, enabling arbitrarily scaled deployment in planar and spatial bistable domains. With an analysis on their symmetry properties complemented by a systematic investigation integrating semi&#8208;analytical derivations, numerical simulations, and experiments on elastic kirigami sheets, this work unveils the fundamental relations between slit symmetry, geometric frustration, and anisotropic bistable deployment. Furthermore, asymmetric kirigami units are leveraged in planar and flat&#8208;to&#8208;3D demonstrations to showcase the pivotal role of shear deformation in achieving target shapes and functions so far unattainable with uniformly stretchable kirigami. The insights provided in this work unveil the role of slit symmetry breaking in controlling the anisotropic bistable deployment of soft kirigami metamaterials, enriching the range of achievable functionalities for applications spanning deployable space structures, wearable technologies, and soft machines.

&lt;p&gt;Shape morphing in bistable kirigami enables remarkable functionalities appealing to a diverse range of applications across the spectrum of length scale. At the core of their shape shifting lies the architecture of their repeating unit, where highly deformable slits and quasi-rigid rotating units often exhibit multiple symmetries that confer isotropic deployment obeying uniform scaling transformation. In this work, symmetry breaking in bistable kirigami is investigated to access geometric frustration and anisotropic morphing, enabling arbitrarily scaled deployment in planar and spatial bistable domains. With an analysis on their symmetry properties complemented by a systematic investigation integrating semi-analytical derivations, numerical simulations, and experiments on elastic kirigami sheets, this work unveils the fundamental relations between slit symmetry, geometric frustration, and anisotropic bistable deployment. Furthermore, asymmetric kirigami units are leveraged in planar and flat-to-3D demonstrations to showcase the pivotal role of shear deformation in achieving target shapes and functions so far unattainable with uniformly stretchable kirigami. The insights provided in this work unveil the role of slit symmetry breaking in controlling the anisotropic bistable deployment of soft kirigami metamaterials, enriching the range of achievable functionalities for applications spanning deployable space structures, wearable technologies, and soft machines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ice&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Atomic Cluster Cocatalyst with Regulable Coordination Number for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile ice&#8208;templating method is developed to synthesize photocatalyst cocatalysts with controllable coordination numbers, and morphologies ranging from single atoms to atomic clusters and nanoparticles. The approach is effective for various metals and photocatalysts. Ru atomic clusters with controlled coordination number loaded on Ga&#8208;doped La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1O7S5 enhance photocatalytic H2 evolution. This atomically controllable cocatalyst strategy is significant for boosting photocatalysis.








Abstract
Supported metal catalysts have been exploited in various applications. Among them, cocatalyst supported on photocatalyst is essential for activation of photocatalysis. However, cocatalyst decoration in a controllable fashion to promote intrinsic activity remains challenging. Herein, a versatile method is developed for cocatalyst synthesis using an ice&#8208;templating (ICT) strategy, resulting in size control from single&#8208;atom (SA), and atomic clusters (AC) to nanoparticles (NP). Importantly, the coordination numbers (CN) of decorated AC cocatalysts are highly controllable, and this ICT method applies to various metals and photocatalytic substrates. Taking narrow&#8208;band gap Ga&#8208;doped La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1O7S5 (LTCA) photocatalyst as an example, supported Ru AC/LTCA catalysts with regulable Ru CNs have been prepared, delivering significantly enhanced activities compared to Ru SA and Ru NPs supported on LTCA. Specifically, Ru(CN = 3.4) AC/LTCA with an average CN of Ru&#9472;Ru bond measured to be &#8776;3.4 exhibits excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (578&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1) under visible light irradiation. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the modeled Ru(CN = 3) atomic cluster cocatalyst possesses favorable electronic properties and available active sites for the H2 evolution reaction.

         <title>Enhancing Stability and Efficiency of Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with In&#8208;Situ Interfacial Cross&#8208;Linked Modifier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moisture&#8208;assisted crosslink of (3&#8208;mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane forms a 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) protective layer that not only effectively passivates perovskite surface defect, but also significantly enhances device moisture stability.








Abstract
Inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is potential as the top cells in tandem configurations, owing to the ideal bandgap, good thermal and light stability of inorganic perovskites. However, challenges such as mismatch of energy levels between charge transport layer and perovskite, significant non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by surface defects, and poor water stability have led to the urgent need for further improvement in the performance of inverted inorganic PSCs. Herein, the fabrication of efficient and stable CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx PSCs through surface treatment of (3&#8208;mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTS), is reported. The silane groups in MPTS can in situ crosslink in the presence of moisture to build a 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) network by Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si bonds, which forms a hydrophobic layer on perovskite surface to inhibit water invasion. Additionally, &#8208;SH can strongly interact with the undercoordinated Pb2+ at the perovskite surface, effectively minimizing interfacial charge recombination. Consequently, the efficiency of the inverted inorganic PSCs improves dramatically from 19.0% to 21.0% under 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 illumination with MPTS treatment. Remarkably, perovskite films with crosslinked MPTS exhibit superior stability when soaking in water. The optimized PSC maintains 91% of its initial efficiency after aging 1000 h in ambient atmosphere, and 86% in 800 h of operational stability testing.

         <title>Overcoming the Unfavorable Effects of &#8220;Boltzmann Tyranny:&#8221; Ultra&#8208;Low Subthreshold Swing in Organic Phototransistors via One&#8208;Transistor&#8208;One&#8208;Memristor Architecture</title>

         <dc:description>
An innovative one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor (1T1R) architecture is proposed to overcome the 60&#160;mV/dec limit in the subthreshold swing (SS) in conventional organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). By replacing the source electrode in an OFET with a memristor, the 1T1R device exploits the memristor's sharp resistance state transitions to achieve an ultra&#8208;low SS of 18&#160;mV/decade.








Abstract
Organic phototransistors (OPTs), as photosensitive organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), have gained significant attention due to their pivotal roles in imaging, optical communication, and night vision. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the Boltzmann distribution of charge carriers, which constrains the average subthreshold swing (SSave) to a minimum of 60&#160;mV/decade at room temperature. In this study, an innovative one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor (1T1R) architecture is proposed to overcome the Boltzmann limit in conventional OFETs. By replacing the source electrode in an OFET with a memristor, the 1T1R device exploits the memristor's sharp resistance state transitions to achieve an ultra&#8208;low SSave of 18&#160;mV/decade. Consequently, the 1T1R devices demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to photo illumination, with a high specific detectivity of 3.9 &#215; 109&#160;cm W&#8722;1Hz1/2, outperforming conventional OPTs (4.9 &#215; 104&#160;cm W&#8722;1Hz1/2) by more than four orders of magnitude. The 1T1R architecture presents a potentially universal solution for overcoming the detrimental effects of &#8220;Boltzmann tyranny,&#8221; setting the stage for the development of ultra&#8208;low SSave devices in various optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Understanding Advanced Transition Metal&#8208;based Two Electron Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts from the Perspective of Phase Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Non&#8208;noble transition metal (TM)&#8208;based compounds have recently become a focal point of extensive research interest as electrocatalysts for the two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) process. To efficiently drive this reaction, these TM&#8208;based electrocatalysts must bear unique physiochemical properties, which are strongly dependent on their phase structures. Consequently, adopting engineering strategies toward the phase structure has emerged as a cutting&#8208;edge scientific pursuit, crucial for achieving high activity, selectivity, and stability in the electrocatalytic process. This comprehensive review addresses the intricate field of phase engineering applied to non&#8208;noble TM&#8208;based compounds for 2e&#8722; ORR. First, the connotation of phase engineering and fundamental concepts related to oxygen reduction kinetics and thermodynamics are succinctly elucidated. Subsequently, the focus shifts to a detailed discussion of various phase engineering approaches, including elemental doping, defect creation, heterostructure construction, coordination tuning, crystalline design, and polymorphic transformation to boost or revive the 2e&#8722; ORR performance (selectivity, activity, and stability) of TM&#8208;based catalysts, accompanied by an insightful exploration of the phase&#8208;performance correlation. Finally, the review proposes fresh perspectives on the current challenges and opportunities in this burgeoning field, together with several critical research directions for the future development of non&#8208;noble TM&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

Abstract
Efficient electrocatalysts are pivotal for advancing green energy conversion technologies. Organic electrocatalysts, as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to noble&#8208;metal benchmarks, have garnered attention. However, the understanding of the relationships between their properties and electrocatalytic activities remains ambiguous. Plenty of research articles regarding low&#8208;cost organic electrocatalysts started to gain momentum in 2010 and have been flourishing recently though, a review article for both entry&#8208;level and experienced researchers in this field is still lacking. This review underscores the urgent need to elucidate the structure&#8208;activity relationship and design suitable electrode structures, leveraging the unique features of organic electrocatalysts like controllability and compatibility for real&#8208;world applications. Organic electrocatalysts are classified into four groups: small molecules, oligomers, polymers, and frameworks, with specific structural and physicochemical properties serving as activity indicators. To unlock the full potential of organic electrocatalysts, five strategies are discussed: integrated structures, surface property modulation, membrane technologies, electrolyte affinity regulation, and addition of anti&#8208;corrosion species, all aimed at enhancing charge efficiency, mass transfer, and long&#8208;term stability during electrocatalytic reactions. The review offers a comprehensive overview of the current state of organic electrocatalysts and their practical applications, bridging the understanding gap and paving the way for future developments of more efficient green energy conversion technologies.

         <title>From Nature&#8208;Sourced Polysaccharide Particles to Advanced Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosourced polysaccharide particles have promising applications in soft robotics, sensing, scavenging, water harvesting, drug delivery, bioengineering, food industry, and several other fields. This review highlights progresses in advanced materials derived from polysaccharide particles, along as the description of their extraction, fabrication, and modification.








Abstract
Polysaccharides constitute over 90% of the carbohydrate mass in nature, which makes them a promising feedstock for manufacturing sustainable materials. Polysaccharide particles (PSPs) are used as effective scavengers, carriers of chemical and biological cargos, and building blocks for the fabrication of macroscopic materials. The biocompatibility and degradability of PSPs are advantageous for their uses as biomaterials with more environmental friendliness. This review highlights the progresses in PSP applications as advanced functional materials, by describing PSP extraction, preparation, and surface functionalization with a variety of functional groups, polymers, nanoparticles, and biologically active species. This review also outlines the fabrication of PSP&#8208;derived macroscopic materials, as well as their applications in soft robotics, sensing, scavenging, water harvesting, drug delivery, and bioengineering. The paper is concluded with an outlook providing perspectives in the development and applications of PSP&#8208;derived materials.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Nanostructured Viologen&#8208;Siloxane Materials for Controllable Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable approach for tunable properties of viologen&#8208;siloxane block molecules is presented, where the counterion dictates morphology, domain spacing, and conductivity. A light&#8208;responsive counterion is used to reduce the viologen in situ, enhancing its conductivity. The radical cation is stable for several days and can be reversibly oxidized and reduced. Repeated pulsed&#8208;light irradiation results in a continuum of conductive states, exhibiting behavior resemblant to long&#8208;term potentiation.








Abstract
Spontaneous phase separation is a promising strategy for the development of novel electronic materials, as the resulting well&#8208;defined morphologies generally exhibit enhanced conductivity. Making these structures adaptive to external stimuli is challenging, yet crucial as multistate reconfigurable switching is essential for neuromorphic materials. Here, a modular and scalable approach is presented to obtain switchable phase&#8208;separated viologen&#8208;siloxane nanostructures with sub&#8208;5&#160;nm features. The domain spacing, morphology, and conductivity of these materials can be tuned by ion exchange, repeated pulsed photoirradiation and electric stimulation. Counterion exchange triggers a postsynthetic modification in domain spacing of up to 10%. Additionally, in some cases, 2D to 1D order&#8211;order transitions are observed with the latter exhibiting a sevenfold decrease in conductivity with respect to their 2D lamellar counterparts. Moreover, the combination of the viologen core with tetraphenylborate counterions enables reversible and in situ reduction upon light irradiation. This light&#8208;driven reduction provides access to a continuum of conducting states, reminiscent of long&#8208;term potentiation. The repeated voltage sweeps improve the nanostructures alignment, leading to increased conductivity in a learning effect. Overall, these results highlight the adaptivity of phase&#8208;separated nanostructures for the next generation of organic electronics, with exciting applications in smart sensors and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Spatial Photo&#8208;Patterning of Nematic Liquid Crystal Pretilt and its Application in Fabricating Flat Gradient&#8208;Index Lenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a method for 3D control of liquid crystal mesogens' orientation. A two&#8208;step photo&#8208;exposure process sets both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation, enabling smooth orientational patterns, and can generate stable gradient&#8208;index lenses without the need for an applied fields. The method shows promise for creating advanced photonics, re&#8208;configurable optical devices, and actuated materials.








Abstract
Liquid crystals offer a dynamic platform for developing advanced photonics and soft actuation systems due to their unique and facile tunability and reconfigurability. Achieving precise spatial patterning of the liquid crystal alignment is critical to developing electro&#8208;optical devices, programmable origami, directed colloidal assembly, and controlling active matter. Here, a simple method is demonstrated to achieve continuous 3D control of the directions of liquid crystal mesogens using a two&#8208;step photo&#8208;exposure process. In the first step, polarized light sets the orientation in the plane of confining substrates; the second step uses unpolarized light of a prescribed dose to set the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation. The method enables smoothly varying orientational patterns with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. As a demonstration, the setup is used to create gradient&#8208;index lenses with parabolic refractive index profiles that remain stable without external electric fields. The lenses' focal length and sensitivity to light polarization are characterized through experimental and numerical methods. The findings pave the way for developing next&#8208;generation photonic devices and actuated materials, with potential applications in molecular self&#8208;assembly, re&#8208;configurable optics, and responsive&#160;matter.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy Reveals Na Infiltration into Separator Pore Free&#8208;Volume as a Degradation Mechanism in Na Anode:Liquid Electrolyte Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;sectional cryo&#8208;electron microscopy of full intact Na anode electrochemical cells reveals deeper understanding of degradation mechanism during electrochemical plating and stripping with liquid electrolytes. Na is observed to infiltrate the separator by growing into the free volume space of its pores rather than mechanical puncturing by dendrites.








Abstract
Batteries utilizing a sodium (Na) metal anode with a liquid electrolyte are promising for affordable large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, a deep understanding of the intrinsic degradation mechanisms is limited by challenges in accessing the buried interfaces. Here, cryogenic electron microscopy&#160;of intact electrode:separator:electrode stacks is performed and degradation and failure of symmetric Na||Na coin cells occurs through the infiltration of Na metal through the&#160;pores of the separator rather than by mechanical puncturing by dendrites is revealed. It is shown the interior structure of the cell (electrode:separator:electrode) must be preserved and&#160;deconstructing the cell into different layers for characterization results in artifacts. In intact cell stacks, minimal liquid is found between the electrodes and separator, leading to intimate electrode:separator interfaces. After electrochemical cycling, Na infiltrates into the pore free&#8208;volume, growing through the separator to create electrical shorts and degradation. The Na infiltration occurs at interfacial regions devoid of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), revealing SEI plays an important role in preventing Na from growing into the separator by being a physical barrier that the plated Na cannot penetrate. These results shed new light on the fundamental failure mechanisms in Na batteries and demonstrate the importance of preserving the cell structure and buried interfaces.

         <title>Rational Design of Multinary Metal Chalcogenide Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 Nanocrystals for Efficient Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The realization of high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;lifetime potassium&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge due to the significant volume expansion and sluggish kinetics of anode materials for large&#8208;sized K&#8208;ion storage. In this study, a ternary Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene composite is designed with exceptional electronic/ionic conductivity, limited volume changes, enabling high K&#8208;storage capacity, ultrafast and highly durable potassium storage.








Abstract
Multinary metal chalcogenides hold considerable promise for high&#8208;energy potassium storage due to their numerous redox reactions. However, challenges arise from issues such as volume expansion and sluggish kinetics. Here, a design featuring a layered ternary Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 anchored on graphene layers as a composite anode, where Bi atoms act as a lattice softening agent on Sb, is presented. Benefiting from the lattice arrangement in Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 and structure, Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene exhibits a mitigated expansion of 28% during the potassiation/depotassiation process and demonstrates facile K+ ion transfer kinetics, enabling long&#8208;term durability of 500 cycles at various high rates. Operando synchrotron diffraction patterns and spectroscopies including in situ Raman, ex situ adsorption, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron reveal multiple conversion and alloying/dealloying reactions for potassium storage at the atomic level. In addition, both theoretical calculations and electrochemical examinations elucidate the K+ migration pathways and indicate a reduction in energy barriers within Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene, thereby suggesting enhanced diffusion kinetics for K+.

&lt;p&gt;The realization of high-rate and long-lifetime potassium-ion batteries remains a challenge due to the significant volume expansion and sluggish kinetics of anode materials for large-sized K-ion storage. In this study, a ternary Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/graphene composite is designed with exceptional electronic/ionic conductivity, limited volume changes, enabling high K-storage capacity, ultrafast and highly durable potassium storage.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multinary metal chalcogenides hold considerable promise for high-energy potassium storage due to their numerous redox reactions. However, challenges arise from issues such as volume expansion and sluggish kinetics. Here, a design featuring a layered ternary Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; anchored on graphene layers as a composite anode, where Bi atoms act as a lattice softening agent on Sb, is presented. Benefiting from the lattice arrangement in Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and structure, Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/graphene exhibits a mitigated expansion of 28% during the potassiation/depotassiation process and demonstrates facile K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion transfer kinetics, enabling long-term durability of 500 cycles at various high rates. Operando synchrotron diffraction patterns and spectroscopies including in situ Raman, ex situ adsorption, and X-ray photoelectron reveal multiple conversion and alloying/dealloying reactions for potassium storage at the atomic level. In addition, both theoretical calculations and electrochemical examinations elucidate the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration pathways and indicate a reduction in energy barriers within Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/graphene, thereby suggesting enhanced diffusion kinetics for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. These findings provide insight in the design of durable high-energy multinary tellurides for potassium storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Progress in Implantable Drug Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review details the recent progress of implantable drug delivery systems (IDDSs) with spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled drug release capabilities. The stimulus&#8208;responsive mechanisms, including endogenous (e.g., pH, reactive oxygen species, etc.) and exogenous stimuli (e.g., light, electricity, magnetism, etc.) are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of various IDDSs, bottleneck problems, and possible solutions are discussed.








Abstract
In recent years, tremendous effort is devoted to developing platforms, such as implantable drug delivery systems (IDDSs), with temporally and spatially controlled drug release capabilities and improved adherence. IDDSs have multiple advantages: i) the timing and location of drug delivery can be controlled by patients using specific stimuli (light, sound, electricity, magnetism, etc.). Some intelligent &#8220;closed&#8208;loop&#8221; IDDS can even realize self&#8208;management without human participation. ii) IDDSs enable continuous and stable delivery of drugs over a long period (months to years) and iii) to administer drugs directly to the lesion, thereby helping reduce dosage and side effects. iv) IDDSs enable personalized drug delivery according to patient needs. The high demand for such systems has prompted scientists to make efforts to develop intelligent IDDS. In this review, several common stimulus&#8208;responsive mechanisms including endogenous (e.g., pH, reactive oxygen species, proteins, etc.) and exogenous stimuli (e.g., light, sound, electricity, magnetism, etc.), are given in detail. Besides, several types of IDDS reported in recent years are reviewed, including various stimulus&#8208;responsive systems based on the above mechanisms, radio frequency&#8208;controlled IDDS, &#8220;closed&#8208;loop&#8221; IDDS, self&#8208;powered IDDS, etc. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of various IDDS, bottleneck problems, and possible solutions are analyzed to provide directions for subsequent research.

         <title>Synergizing Pyroelectric Catalysis and Enzyme Catalysis: Establishing a Reciprocal and Synergistic Model to Enhance Anti&#8208;Tumor Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnSnO3@MXene composites can effectively improve the enzymatic activity of MXene by fully utilizing the pyroelectric effect of ZnSnO3. Meanwhile, MXene provides an inducement for the pyroelectric effect of ZnSnO3 ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles (USNPs). Combined with highly cell membrane permeability enhanced by polarized charge, a satisfactory therapeutic efficacy is realized.








Abstract
Nanozyme activity is greatly weakened by the microenvironment and multidrug resistance of tumor cells. Hence, a bi&#8208;catalytic nanoplatform, which promotes the anti&#8208;tumor activity through &#8220;charging empowerment&#8221; and &#8220;mutual complementation&#8221; processes involved in enzymatic and pyroelectric catalysis, by loading ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles (USNPs) of pyroelectric ZnSnO3 onto MXene nanozyme (V2CTx nanosheets), is developed. Here, the V2CTx nanosheets exhibit enhanced peroxidase activity by reacting V3+ with H2O2 to generate toxic &#183;OH, accelerated by the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light mediated heat effect. The resulting V4+ is then converted to V3+ by oxidizing endogenous glutathione (GSH), realizing an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed cycle. However, the cycle will lose its persistence once GSH is insufficient; nevertheless, the pyroelectric charges generated by ZnSnO3 USNPs continuously support the V4+/V3+ conversion and ensure nanoenzyme durability. Moreover, the hyperthermia arising from the V2CTx nanosheets by NIR irradiation results in an ideal local temperature gradient for the ZnSnO3 USNPs, giving rise to an excellent pyroelectric catalytic effect by promoting band bending. Furthermore, polarized charges increase the tumor cell membrane permeability and facilitate nanodrug accumulation, thereby resolving the multidrug resistance issue. Thus, the combination of pyroelectric and enzyme catalysis together with the photothermal effect solves the dilemma of nanozymes and improves the antitumor efficiency.

         <title>Top&#8208;down Induced Crystallization Orientation toward Highly Efficient p&#8208;i&#8208;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Crystallization orientation plays a crucial role in determining the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), whereas effective strategies for realizing oriented perovskite crystallization is still lacking. Herein, we report a facile and efficient top&#8208;down strategy to manipulate the crystallization orientation via treating perovskite wet film with propylamine chloride (PACl) before annealing. The PA+ ions tend to be adsorbed on the (001) facet of the perovskite surface, resulting in the reduced cleavage energy to induce (001) orientation&#8208;dominated growth of perovskite film and then reduce the temperature of phase transition, meanwhile, the penetrating Cl ions further regulate the crystallization process. As&#8208;prepared (001)&#8208;dominant perovskite films exhibit the ameliorative film homogeneity in terms of vertical and horizontal scale, leading to alleviated lattice mismatch and lowered defect density. The resultant PVSC devices deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.07% with enhanced stability, and the unencapsulated PVSC device maintains 95% of its initial PCE after 1000 hours of operation at the maximum power point under simulated AM 1.5G illumination.

         <title>Intermediate Phase Suppression with Long Chain Diammonium Alkane for High Performance Wide&#8208;Bandgap and Tandem Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite can construct tandem cells with narrow bandgap solar cells by adjusting the band gap to overcome the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limitation of single junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, WBG perovskites still suffer from severe non&#8208;radiative carrier recombination and large open&#8208;circuit voltage loss. Here, we use an in&#8208;situ photoluminescence (PL) measurement to monitor the intermediate phase evolution and crystallization process via blade coating. We report a strategy to fabricate efficient and stable WBG perovskite solar cells through doping a long carbon chain molecule Octane&#8208;1,8&#8208;diamine dihydroiodide (ODADI). We found that ODADI doping not only suppress intermediate phases but also promote the crystallization of perovskite and passivate defects in blade coated 1.67&#160;eV WBG FA0.7Cs0.25MA0.05Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3 perovskite films. As a result, the champion single junction inverted PSCs deliver the efficiencies of 22.06%and 19.63% for the active area of 0.07 cm2 and 1.02 cm2, respectively, which are the highest PCEs in WBG PSCs by blade coating. The unencapsulated device demonstrates excellent stability in air, which maintains its initial efficiency at the maximum power points under constant AM 1.5G illumination in open air for nearly 500&#160;hrs. The resulting semi&#8208;transparent WBG device delivers a high PCE of 20.06%, and the 4&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem device delivers a PCE of 28.35%.

         <title>Stretch&#8208;induced Conductivity Enhancement in Highly Conductive and Tough Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The resistance of gels and elastomers increases significantly with tensile strain, which reduces conductive stability and restricts their use in stable and reliable electronics. Here, highly conductive tough hydrogels composed of silver nanowires (AgNWs), liquid metal (LM), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) were fabricated. The stretch&#8208;induced orientations of AgNWs, deformable LM, and PVA nanocrystalline create conductive pathways, enhancing the mechanical properties of the hydrogels, including increased ultimate fracture stress (13&#8208;33&#160;MPa), strain (3000&#8208;5300%), and toughness (390.9&#8208;765.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). Notably, the electrical conductivity of the hydrogels is significantly improved from 4.05&#215;10&#8722;3 to 24 S m&#8722;1 when stretched to 4200% strain, representing a 6000&#8208;fold enhancement. The incorporation of PVA nanocrystalline, deformable LM, and AgNWs effectively mitigates stress concentration at the crack tip, thereby conferring crack propagation insensitivity and fatigue resistance to the hydrogels. Moreover, the hydrogels designed with a reversible crosslinking network, allowing for water&#8208;induced recycling.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Induced Formation of Pt&#8208;based Intermetallics on MXene with Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The Pt&#8208;based alloys could moderate the binding energies of oxygenated species on the catalytic surface, endowing the superior catalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Nevertheless, it is still challenging to explore general methods to synthesize structurally ordered intermetallics with uniform distributions. Herein, the strong metal&#8208;support interaction is employed to facilitate the interdiffusion of Pt/M atoms by establishing a tunnel of oxygen vacancy on ultrathin Ti3C2Tx (MXene) sheets, synthesizing the ordered PtFe, PtCo, PtZn, PdFe, PdZn intermetallics loaded onto Ti3C2Tx. Furthermore, the in&#8208;situ generation of Ti&#8208;O from Ti3C2Tx could be bonded with Pt and forming Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Ti, resulting in charge redistribution through Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Ti structure. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the valuable charge redistribution could be observed at the interface and extended even to at the distance of two nanometers from the interface, which could modulate the Pt&#8208;Pt distance, optimize Pt&#8208;O binding energy and enhance intrinsic activity towards ORR. The strong coupling interaction between PtFe and Ti3C2Tx containing the titanium oxide layer endows the high stability of the composites. This work not only presents a general synthesis strategy for intermetallics but also provides a new insight that metal&#8208;support interaction is essential for the structural evolution of intermetallics on materials with oxygen vacancy defects.

         <title>Unveiling Confinement Engineering for Achieving High&#8208;Performance Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The confinement effect, restricting materials within nano/sub&#8208;nano spaces, has emerged as an innovative approach for fundamental research in diverse application fields, including chemical engineering, membrane separation, and catalysis. This confinement principle recently presents fresh perspectives on addressing critical challenges in rechargeable batteries. Within spatial confinement, novel microstructures and physiochemical properties have been raised to promote the battery performance. Nevertheless, few clear definitions and specific reviews are available to offer a comprehensive understanding and guide for utilizing the confinement effect in batteries. This review aims to fill this gap by primarily summarizing the categorization of confinement effects across various scales and dimensions within battery systems. Subsequently, the strategic design of confinement environments is proposed to address existing challenges in rechargeable batteries. These solutions involve the manipulation of the physicochemical properties of electrolytes, the regulation of electrochemical activity and stability of electrodes, and insights into ion transfer mechanisms. Furthermore, specific perspectives are provided to deepen the foundational understanding of the confinement effect for achieving high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. Overall, this review emphasizes the transformative potential of confinement effects in tailoring the microstructure and physiochemical properties of electrode materials, highlighting their crucial role in designing novel energy storage devices.

         <title>Large&#8208;scale, Vertically Aligned 2D Sub&#8208;nanochannel Arrays by a Smectic Liquid Crystal Network for High&#8208;Performance Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The osmotic energy, an abundant renewable energy source, can be directly converted to electricity by nanofluidic devices with ion&#8208;selective membranes. 2D nanochannels constructed by nanosheets possess abundant lateral interfacial ion&#8208;exchange sites and exhibit great superiority in nanofluidic devices. However, the most accessible orientation of the 2D nanochannels is parallel to the membrane surface, undoubtedly resulting in the conductivity loss. Herein, we first demonstrate vertically aligned 2D sub&#8208;nanochannel arrays self&#8208;assembled by a smectic liquid crystal (LC) network that exhibit high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. The 2D sub&#8208;nanochannel arrays are fabricated by in&#8208;situ photo&#8208;polymerization of monomers in the LC phase. The as&#8208;prepared membrane exhibits excellent water&#8208;resistance and mechanical strength. The 2D sub&#8208;nanochannels with excellent cation selectivity and conductivity show high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. The power density reaches up to about 22.5&#160;W/m2 with NaCl solution under a 50&#8208;fold concentration gradient, which is among with ultrahigh power density. This membrane design concept provides promising applications in osmotic energy conversion.

         <title>Designing Ultratough Single&#8208;Network Hydrogels with Centimeter&#8208;Scale Fractocohesive Lengths via Inelastic Crack Blunting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fractocohesive length, defined as the ratio of fracture toughness to work of fracture, measures the sensitivity of materials to fracture in the presence of flaws. The larger the fractocohesive length, the more flaw&#8208;tolerant and crack&#8208;resistant the hydrogel. For synthetic soft materials, the fractocohesive length is short, often on the scale of 1&#8197;mm. Here, we design highly flaw&#8208;insensitive (HFI) single&#8208;network hydrogels containing an entangled inhomogeneous polymer network of widely distributed chain lengths. The HFI hydrogels demonstrate a centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive length of 2.21&#160;cm, which is the highest ever recorded for synthetic hydrogels, and an unprecedented fracture toughness of &#8764;13300 J/m2. The uncommon flaw insensitivity results from the inelastic crack blunting inherent to the highly inhomogeneous network. When the HFI hydrogel is stretched, a large number of short chains break while coiled long chains can disentangle, unwind and straighten, producing large inelastic deformation that substantially blunts the crack tip in a plastic manner, thereby deconcentrating crack&#8208;tip stresses and blocking crack extension. The flaw&#8208;insensitive design strategy is applicable to various hydrogels such as PAAm and PDMA hydrogels and enables the development of HFI soft composites.

Reversible optical control of the ferroelectric polarization is accomplished in epitaxial PbZrxTi1&#8722;xO3 (PZT) thin films using UV light. For single&#8208;domain films, a transient modulation of the polarization magnitude occurs, mediated by the separation of photoexcited charge carriers in the Schottky interface. In PZT films at the morphotropic phase boundary, room&#8208;temperature remanent optical poling is realized that can be reversed via thermal annealing.








Abstract
Light is an effective tool to probe the polarization and domain distribution in ferroelectric materials passively, that is, non&#8208;invasively, for example, via optical second harmonic generation (SHG). With the emergence of oxide electronics, there is now a strong demand to expand the role of light toward active control of the polarization. In this work, optical control of the ferroelectric polarization is demonstrated&#160;in prototypical epitaxial PbZrxTi1&#8722;xO3 (PZT)&#8208;based heterostructures. This is accomplished in three steps, using above&#8208;bandgap UV light, while tracking the response of the polarization with optical SHG. First, it is found that UV&#8208;light exposure induces a transient enhancement or suppression of the ferroelectric polarization in films with an upward&#8208; or downward&#8208;oriented polarization, respectively. This behavior is attributed to a modified charge screening driven by the separation of photoexcited charge carriers at the Schottky interface of the ferroelectric thin film. Second, by taking advantage of this optical handle on electrostatics, remanent optical poling from a pristine multi&#8208;domain into a single&#8208;domain configuration is accomplished. Third, via thermal annealing or engineered electrostatic boundary conditions, a complete reversibility of the optical poling is further achieved. Hence, this work paves the way for the all&#8208;optical control of the spontaneous polarization in ferroelectric thin&#160;films.

         <title>Developing Hypoxia&#8208;Sensitive System via Designing Tumor&#8208;targeted Fullerene&#8208;Based Photosensitizer for Multimodal Therapy of Deep Tumor</title>

Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been approved for clinic. However, powerless efficiency for deep hypoxic tumor therapy remains an enormous challenge for PDT. Herein, a hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nanotherapeutic system (FTCD&#8208;SRGD) based on fullerene (C70) and anoxic activating chemical prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ) is rationally designed for multimodal therapy of deep hypoxic tumors. To enhance the accumulation and achieve specific drug release in tumor, the FTCD&#8208;SRGD is modified with cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;d&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys) (cRGDfK) peptide and disulfide bonds. With the exacerbated hypoxic microenvironment created by C70 consuming O2 for generating ROS, TPZ is activated to produce toxic radical species to ablate deep tumors, which achieves a synergistic treatment of C70&#8208;mediated PDT and hypoxia&#8208;enhanced chemotherapy. Additionally, given this hypoxia&#8208;sensitive system&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) activating anticancer cytotoxic T lymphocyte to result in more susceptible tumor to immunotherapy, FTCD&#8208;SRGD plus immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) fully inhibit deep hypoxic tumors by promoting infiltration of effector T cells in tumors. Collectively, it is the first time to develop a multimodal therapy system with fullerene&#8208;based hypoxia&#8208;sensitive PS for deep tumors. The powerful multimodal nanotherapeutic system for combining hypoxia&#8208;enhanced PDT and immunotherapy to massacre deep hypoxic tumors could provide a paradigm to combat the present bottleneck of tumor therapy.

         <title>Van der Waals Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A general guiding principle for colloidal crystallization is to tame the attractive enthalpy such that it slightly overwhelms the repulsive interaction. As&#8208;synthesized colloids are generally designed to retain a strong repulsive potential for high stability of suspensions, encoding appropriate attractive potentials into colloids has been key to their crystallization. Despite the myriad of interparticle attractions for colloidal crystallization, the van der Waals (vdW) force remains unexplored. Here, we show that implementation of gold cores into silica colloids and the resulting vdW force can reconfigure the pair potential well depth to optimal range between &#8208;1 and &#8208;4 kBT at tens of nanometer&#8208;scale colloidal distances. As such, colloidal crystals with a distinct liquid gap can be formed, which is evidenced by photonic bandgap&#8208;based diffractive colorization.

         <title>Junctionless Negative&#8208;Differential&#8208;Resistance Device using 2D Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Layered Materials for Ternary Parallel Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance (NDR) devices offer a promising pathway for developing future computing technologies characterized by exceptionally low energy consumption, especially multi&#8208;valued logic computing. Nevertheless, conventional approaches aimed at attaining the NDR phenomenon involve intricate junction configurations and/or external doping processes in the channel region, impeding the progress of NDR devices to the circuit and system levels. Here, we present an NDR device that incorporates a channel without junctions. We achieved the NDR phenomenon by introducing a metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor capacitor to a portion of the channel area. This approach establishes partial potential barrier and well that effectively restrict the movement of hole and electron carriers within specific voltage ranges. Consequently, this facilitates the implementation of both a ternary inverter and a ternary static&#8208;random&#8208;access&#8208;memory, which are essential components in the development of multi&#8208;valued logic computing technology.

Abstract
Conjugation of aptamers to homogeneous catalysts (&#8220;nucleoapzymes&#8221;), heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts (&#8220;aptananozymes&#8221;), and photocatalysts (&#8220;photoaptazymes&#8221;) yields superior catalytic/photocatalytic hybrid nanostructures emulating functions of native enzymes and photosystems. The concentration of the substrate in proximity to the catalytic sites (&#8220;molarity effect&#8221;) or spatial concentration of electron&#8208;acceptor units in spatial proximity to the photosensitizers, by aptamer&#8211;ligand complexes, leads to enhanced catalytic/photocatalytic efficacies of the hybrid nanostructures. This is exemplified by sets of &#8220;nucleoapzymes&#8221; composed of aptamers conjugated to the hemin/G&#8208;quadruplex DNAzymes or metal&#8211;ligand complexes as catalysts, catalyzing the oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome, oxygen&#8208;insertion into the Ar&#9472;H moiety of tyrosinamide and the subsequent oxidation of the catechol product into aminochrome, or the hydrolysis of esters or ATP. Also, aptananozymes consisting of aptamers conjugated to Cu2+&#8208; or Ce4+&#8208;ion&#8208;modified C&#8208;dots or polyadenine&#8208;stabilized Au nanoparticles acting as catalysts oxidizing&#160;dopamine or operating bioreactor biocatalytic cascades, are demonstrated. In addition, aptamers conjugated to the Ru(II)&#8211;tris&#8208;bipyridine photosensitizer or the Zn(II) protoporphyrin IX photosensitizer provide supramolecular photoaptazyme assemblies emulating native photosynthetic reaction centers. Effective photoinduced electron transfer followed by the catalyzed synthesis of NADPH or the evolution of H2 is demonstrated by the photosystems. Structure&#8211;function relationships dictate the catalytic and photocatalytic efficacies of the systems.

         <title>Nanozymes: Definition, Activity, and Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a historical perspective, the definition, catalytic activity, and mechanism of nanozymes are compared with enzymes. Immobilized catalysts and catalytic nanomaterials are two types of nanozymes, and the field has benefited from the name of nanozyme to endeavor replacement of enzymes with catalytic nanomaterials for analytical, environmental, and biomedical applications.








Abstract
&#8220;Nanozyme&#8221; is used to describe various catalysts from immobilized inorganic metal complexes, immobilized enzymes to inorganic nanoparticles. Here, the history of nanozymes is dvescribed in detail, and they can be largely separated into two types. Type 1 nanozymes refer to immobilized catalysts or enzymes on nanomaterials, which&#160;were&#160;dominant in the first decade since 2004. Type 2 nanozymes, which rely on the surface catalytic properties of inorganic nanomaterials, are the dominating type in the past decade. The definition of nanozymes is evolving, and a definition based on the same substrates and products as enzymes are able to cover most currently claimed nanozymes, although they may have different mechanisms compared to their enzyme counterparts. A broader definition can inspire application&#8208;based research to replace enzymes with nanomaterials for analytical, environmental, and biomedical applications. Comparison with enzymes also requires a clear definition of a nanozyme unit. Four ways of defining a nanozyme unit are described, with iron oxide and horseradish peroxidase activity comparison as examples in each definition. Growing work is devoted to understanding the&#160;catalytic mechanism of nanozymes, which provides a basis for further rational engineering of active sites. Finally, future perspective of the nanozyme field is discussed.

         <title>Approaches to Improving the Selectivity of Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes must be selective if they are to replace enzymes in sensing or catalysis. Mimicking enzymatic active sites and nanoconfined substrate channels provides an avenue to improving the selectivity of nanozymes. However, a purely biomimetic approach to nanozyme design limits the design of enzyme mimics. Therefore, designers endeavor to utilize all synthetic methods to make more selective nanozymes.








Abstract
Nanozymes mimic enzymes and that includes their selectivity. To achieve selectivity, significant inspiration for nanoparticle design can come from the geometric and molecular features that make enzymes selective catalysts. The two central features enzymes use are control over the arrangement of atoms in the active site and the placing of the active site down a nanoconfined substrate channel. The implementation of enzyme&#8208;inspired features has already been shown to both improve activity and selectivity of nanoparticles for a variety of catalytic and sensing applications. The tuning and control of active sites on metal nanoparticle surfaces ranges from simply changing the composition of the surface metal to sophisticated approaches such as the immobilization of single atoms on a metal substrate. Molecular frameworks provide a powerful platform for the implementation of isolated and discrete active sites while unique diffusional environments further improve selectivity. The implementation of nanoconfined substrate channels around these highly controlled active sites offers further ability to control selectivity through altering the solution environment and transport of reactants and products. Implementing these strategies together offers a unique opportunity to improve nanozyme selectivity in both sensing and catalysis.

The latest advances and current challenges of enzyme&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles and their use in biosensing are highlighted, with a special focus on point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) devices and their translational path for use in biomedical devices. These materials exhibit innate advantages compared to biological enzymes and nanoparticle probes currently utilized and hold great promise for implementation in biotechnology and clinical diagnosis.








Abstract
Nanozymes represent a class of nanosized materials that exhibit innate catalytic properties similar to biological enzymes. The unique features of&#160;these materials have positioned them as promising candidates for applications in clinical sensing devices, specifically those&#160;employed at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care. They notably have found use as a means to amplify signals in nanosensor&#8208;based platforms and thereby improve sensor detection limits. Recent developments in the understanding of the fundamental chemistries underpinning these materials have enabled the development of highly effective nanozymes capable of sensing clinically relevant biomarkers at detection limits that compete with &#8220;gold&#8208;standard&#8221; techniques. However, there remain considerable hurdles that need to be overcome before these nanozyme&#8208;based sensors can be utilized in a platform ready for clinical use. An overview of the current understandings of nanozymes for disease diagnostics and biosensing applications and the unmet challenges that must be considered prior to their translation in clinical diagnostic tests is provided.

         <title>Chiral MoSe2 Nanoparticles for Ultrasensitive Monitoring of Reactive Oxygen Species In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral molybdenum diselenide nanoparticles modified by the fluorescent molecule (cyanine 3) are synthesized. They are used as nanoprobes for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection through changes in chiral and fluorescent signals due to Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reaction induced by ROS on the surface of nanoparticles. These signals can indicate the ROS levels in living cells and in vivo.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and acute hepatitis, and quantification of ROS is critical for the early diagnosis of these diseases. In this work, a novel probe is developed,&#160;based on chiral molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) nanoparticles (NPs) modified by the fluorescent molecule, cyanine 3 (Cy3). Chiral MoSe2 NPs show intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals at 390 and 550&#160;nm, whereas the fluorescence of Cy3 at 560&#160;nm is quenched by MoSe2 NPs. In the presence of ROS, the probe reacts with the ROS and then oxidates rapidly, resulting in decreased CD signals and the recovery of the fluorescence. Using this strategy, the limit of detection values of CD and fluorescent signals in living cells are 0.0093&#160;nmol/106 cells and 0.024&#160;nmol/106 cells, respectively. The high selectivity and sensitivity to ROS in complex biological environments is attributed to the Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reactions on the surface of the NPs. Furthermore, chiral MoSe2 NPs are able to monitor the levels of ROS in vivo by the fluorescence. Collectively, this strategy offers a new approach for ROS detection and has the potential to inspire others to explore chiral nanomaterials as biosensors to investigate biological events.

         <title>Oxidation of Hydrogen Sulfide to Polysulfide and Thiosulfate by a Carbon Nanozyme: Therapeutic Implications with an Emphasis on Down Syndrome</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidized carbon nanozymes catalytically oxidize hydrogen sulfide to polysulfides and thiosulfate in an oxygen&#8208;dependent manner. In this report the reaction kinetics of polysulfide and thiosulfate formation both in a cell&#8208;free setting and intracellularly and present the possible role of these nanozymes as a supportive therapy in Down Syndrome, a condition where hydrogen sulfide production is detrimentally elevated.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a noxious, potentially poisonous, but necessary gas produced from sulfur metabolism in humans. In Down Syndrome (DS), the production of H2S is elevated and associated with degraded mitochondrial function. Therefore, removing H2S from the body as a stable oxide could be an approach to reducing the deleterious effects of H2S in DS. In this report we describe the catalytic oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to polysulfides (HS2+n&#8722;) and thiosulfate (S2O32&#8722;) by poly(ethylene glycol) hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG&#8208;HCCs) and poly(ethylene glycol) oxidized activated charcoal (PEG&#8208;OACs), examples of oxidized carbon nanozymes (OCNs). We show that OCNs oxidize H2S to polysulfides and S2O32&#8722; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. The reaction is dependent on O2 and the presence of quinone groups on the OCNs. In DS donor lymphocytes we found that OCNs increased polysulfide production, proliferation, and afforded protection against additional toxic levels of H2S compared to untreated DS lymphocytes. Finally, in Dp16 and Ts65DN murine models of DS, we found that OCNs restored osteoclast differentiation. This new action suggests potential facile translation into the clinic for conditions involving excess H2S exemplified by DS.

Finally, in Dp16 and Ts65DN murine models of DS, we found that OCNs restored osteoclast differentiation. This new action suggests potential facile translation into the clinic for conditions involving excess H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S exemplified by DS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Interaction of Amines with Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
All you wanted to know about the amine gold nanoparticle interaction and never dared to ask: mode and strength of binding, kinetics of the exchange of the amines, redox processes occurring at the surface and hints for preparation of robust semisynthetic nanozymes.








Abstract
Understanding the interactions between amines and the surface of gold nanoparticles is important because of their role in the stabilization of the nanosystems, in the formation of the protein corona, and in the preparation of semisynthetic nanozymes. By using fluorescence spectroscopy, electrochemistry, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and molecular simulation,&#160;a detailed picture of these interactions is obtained. Herein, it is shown that amines interact with surface Au(0) atoms of the nanoparticles with their lone electron pair with a strength linearly correlating with their basicity corrected for steric hindrance. The kinetics of binding depends on the position of the gold atoms (flat surfaces or edges) while the mode of binding involves a single Au(0) with nitrogen sitting on top of it. A small fraction of surface Au(I) atoms, still present, is reduced by the amines yielding a much stronger Au(0)&#8211;RN.+ (RN., after the loss of a proton) interaction. In this case, the mode of binding involves two Au(0) atoms with a bridging nitrogen placed between them. Stable Au nanoparticles, as those required for robust semisynthetic nanozymes preparation, are better obtained when the protein is involved (at least in part) in the reduction of the gold ions.

         <title>Fibrous Zr&#8208;MOF Nanozyme Aerogels with Macro&#8208;Nanoporous Structure for Enhanced Catalytic Hydrolysis of Organophosphate Toxins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid synthesis method is developed to introduce Zr&#8208;MOF nanozyme coating into cellulose nanofibers, resulting in the formation of processable macro&#8208;micro porous aerogel composites with high metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) loadings. The hierarchically structured MOF nanozymes monolithic aerogel enables excellent accessibility to catalytic active sites for fast and efficient hydrolytic detoxification of organophosphorus&#8208;based nerve agent simulants and pesticides from contaminated water.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with Lewis acid catalytic sites, such as zirconium&#8208;based MOFs (Zr&#8208;MOFs), comprise a growing class of phosphatase&#8208;like nanozymes that can degrade toxic organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents. Rationally engineering and shaping MOFs from as&#8208;synthesized powders into hierarchically porous monoliths is essential for their use in emerging applications, such as filters for air and water purification and personal protection gear. However, several challenges still limit the production of practical MOF composites, including the need for sophisticated reaction conditions, low MOF catalyst loadings in the resulting composites, and poor accessibility to MOF&#8208;based active sites. To overcome these limitations, a rapid synthesis method is developed to introduce Zr&#8208;MOF nanozyme coating into cellulose nanofibers, resulting in the formation of processable monolithic aerogel composites with high MOF loadings. These composites contain Zr&#8208;MOF nanozymes embedded in the structure, and hierarchical macro&#8208;micro porosity enables excellent accessibility to catalytic active sites. This multifaceted rational design strategy, including the selection of a MOF with many catalytic sites, fine&#8208;tuning the coating morphology, and the fabrication of a hierarchically structured monolithic aerogel, renders synergistic effects toward the efficient continuous hydrolytic detoxification of organophosphorus&#8208;based nerve agent simulants and pesticides from contaminated water.

         <title>A Defect&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme&#160;for Targeted NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of defect engineering, a tumor cell membrane coated redox nanozyme is developed for combinational second near&#8208;infrared photothermal immunotherapy of cancer. This controlled therapeutic paradigm potentiates systemic primary tumor ablation, inhibits cancer metastasis to distant tumor, and procures long&#8208;term immunological memory.








Abstract
Multienzyme&#8208;mimicking redox nanozymes, curated by defect engineering, in synergy with immunotherapy offer promising prospects for safe and efficient cancer therapy. However, the spatiotemporally precise immune response often gets challenged by off&#8208;target adverse effects and insufficient therapeutic response. Herein, a tumor cell membrane coated redox nanozyme (CMO&#8208;R@4T1) is reported for combinational second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 consists of a Cu&#8208;doped MoOx (CMO) nanozyme as the core, which is cloaked with tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived fused membranes with immunostimulants immobilized in the membrane shell. In addition to the enhanced tumor accumulation, the nanozyme can cause oxidative damage to tumor cells by the production of reactive oxygen species and attenuation of the antioxidant mechanism. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 also mediates a photothermal effect under NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation to trigger tumor eradication and immunogenic cell death, where the liberated agonist elicits the immune activation. Such a controlled therapeutic paradigm potentiates systemic primary tumor ablation, inhibits cancer metastasis to distant tumor, and procures long&#8208;term immunological memory. Thereby, this study takes advantage of defect engineering to illustrate a generic strategy to prepare cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;camouflaged nanozymes for targeted photo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer.

         <title>A Manganese&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Cold&#8208;Adapted Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme of manganese&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (nMnBTC) is designed and developed by mimicking the structural features of the natural counterparts. It exhibits extremely stable oxidase&#8208;like activity at both psychrophilic and mesophilic condition (0&#8211;45&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, a low&#8208;temperature antivirus strategy is innovatively established based on nMnBTC to inactive influenza virus H1N1 with high efficiency at &#8722;20 &#176;C.








Abstract
The development of cold&#8208;adapted enzymes with high efficiency and good stability is an advanced strategy to overcome the limitations of catalytic medicine in low and cryogenic temperatures. In this work, inspired by natural enzymes, a novel cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme based on a manganese&#8208;based nanosized metal&#8211;organic framework (nMnBTC) is designed and synthesized. The nMnBTC as an oxidase mimetic not only exhibits excellent activity at 0&#160;&#176;C, but also presents almost no observable activity loss as the temperature is increased to 45&#160;&#176;C. This breaks the traditional recognition that enzymes show maximum activity only under specific psychrophilic or thermophilic condition. The superior performance of nMnBTC as a cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme can be attributed to its high&#8208;catalytic efficiency at low temperature, good substrate affinity, and flexible conformation. Based on the robust performance of nMnBTC, a low&#8208;temperature antiviral strategy is developed to inactivate influenza virus H1N1 even at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. These results not only provide an important guide for the rational design of highly efficient artificial cold&#8208;adapted enzymes, but also pave a novel way for biomedical application in cryogenic fields.

         <title>Effect of Phosphorus Modulation in Iron Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Peroxidase Mimicking</title>

1D&#160;phosphorus&#8208;doped single&#8208;atom Fe nanowires are designed to mimic peroxidase&#8208;like activity. The mechanism of phosphorus modulation via long&#8208;range interaction for increasing catalytic activity is fully analyzed. The designed single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits good sensitivity in an enzyme&#8208;cascade sensor platform for colorimetric acetylcholine sensing. This work provides a strategy for creating enzyme&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts and replacing natural enzymes in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit excellent peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activity, owing to their well&#8208;defined isolated iron active sites on the carbon substrate, which effectively mimic the structure of natural peroxidase's active center. To further meet the requirements of diverse biosensing applications, SAC POD&#8208;like activity still needs to be continuously enhanced. Herein, a phosphorus (P) heteroatom is introduced to boost the POD&#8208;like activity of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs. A 1D&#160;carbon nanowire (FeNCP/NW) catalyst with enriched Fe&#8211;N4 active sites is designed and synthesized, and P atoms are doped in the carbon matrix to affect the Fe center through long&#8208;range interaction. The experimental results show that the P&#8208;doping process can boost the POD&#8208;like activity more than the non&#8208;P&#8208;doped one, with excellent selectivity and stability. The mechanism analysis results show that the introduction of P into SAC can greatly enhance POD&#8208;like activity initially, but its effect becomes insignificant with increasing amount of P. As a proof of concept, FeNCP/NW is employed in an enzyme cascade platform for highly sensitive colorimetric detection of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

         <title>A Thrombin&#8208;Activated Peptide&#8208;Templated Nanozyme for Remedying Ischemic Stroke via Thrombolytic and Neuroprotective Actions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;templated manganese dioxide nanozyme integrating thrombolytic and reactive oxygen species scavenging abilities is developed for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Through the self&#8208;assembled polypeptides that contain multiple functional motifs, the nanozyme binds fibrin in the thrombus, crosses the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and finally accumulates in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; by the action of thrombin.








Abstract
Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the most common causes of disability and death. Thrombolysis and neuroprotection are two current major therapeutic strategies to overcome ischemic and reperfusion damage. In this work, a novel peptide&#8208;templated manganese dioxide nanozyme (PNzyme/MnO2) is designed that integrates the thrombolytic activity of functional peptides with the reactive oxygen species scavenging ability of nanozymes. Through self&#8208;assembled polypeptides that contain multiple functional motifs, the novel peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme is able to bind fibrin in the thrombus, cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and finally accumulate in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; by the action of thrombin. In mice and rat IS models, the PNzyme/MnO2 prolongs the blood&#8208;circulation time and exhibits strong thrombolytic action, and reduces the ischemic damages in brain tissues. Moreover, this peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme also effectively inhibits the activation of astrocytes and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. These data indicate that the rationally designed PNzyme/MnO2 nanozyme exerts both thrombolytic and neuroprotective actions. Giving its long half&#8208;life in the blood and ability to target brain thrombi, the biocompatible nanozyme may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to improve the efficacy and prevent secondary thrombosis during the treatment of IS.

         <title>Bioinspired Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembled Nanozyme for Efficient Antibacterial Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired by the antibacterial nanostructures on the wing&#160;surfaces&#160;of&#160;some insects, this work reports a biomimetic NiCo2O4 nanozyme with 3&#8208;level hierarchical architecture that can self&#8208;adaptively tune their hierarchical nanostructures to capture bacteria of various morphotypes. The intrinsic peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the nanozyme promotes the generation of highly toxic reactive oxygen species that disrupt bacterial membranes and induce bacterial apoptosis.








Abstract
Along with the rapid development and ever&#8208;deepening understanding of nanoscience and nanotechnology, nanomaterials hold promise to mimic the highly evolved biological exquisite nanostructures and sophisticated functions. Here, inspired by the ubiquitous antibacterial nanostructures on the wing&#160;surfaces&#160;of&#160;some insects, a NiCo2O4 nanozyme with self&#8208;adaptive hierarchical nanostructure is developed that can capture bacteria of various morphotypes via the physico&#8208;mechanical interaction between the nanostructure and bacteria. Moreover, the developed biomimetic nanostructure further exhibits superior peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity, which can catalytically generate highly toxic reactive oxygen species that disrupt bacterial membranes and induce bacterial apoptosis. Therefore, the mechano&#8208;catalytic coupling property of this NiCo2O4 nanozyme allows for an extensive and efficient antibacterial application, with no concerns of antimicrobial resistance. This work suggests a promising strategy for the rational design of advanced antibacterial materials by mimicking biological antibiosis.

         <title>Oxidized Activated Charcoal Nanozymes: Synthesis, and Optimization for In Vitro and In Vivo Bioactivity for Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes synthesized via the oxidation of coconut&#8208;derived activated charcoal afford markable protection against oxidative injury in an in vivo rat model of mild traumatic brain injury. By tuning the oxidation process, smaller, more homogeneous nanomaterials containing free&#8208;radical&#8208;quenching quinone active sites are targeted for enhanced bioactivity. Such findings highlight the features that drive the oxidative power of these nanozymes.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic nanozymes have recently been employed as promising antioxidant nanotherapeutics due to their distinct properties. The structural features responsible for the efficacy of these nanomaterials as antioxidants are, however, poorly understood. Here, the process&#8211;structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance properties of coconut&#8208;derived oxidized activated charcoal (cOAC) nano&#8208;SOD mimetics are studied by analyzing how modifications to the nanomaterial's synthesis impact the size, as well as the elemental and electrochemical properties of the particles. These properties are then correlated to the in vitro antioxidant bioactivity of poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;functionalized cOACs (PEG&#8208;cOAC). Chemical oxidative treatment methods that afford smaller, more homogeneous cOAC nanoparticles with higher levels of quinone functionalization show enhanced protection against oxidative damage in bEnd.3 murine endothelioma cells. In an in vivo rat model of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and oxidative vascular injury, PEG&#8208;cOACs restore cerebral perfusion rapidly to the same extent as the former nanotube&#8208;derived PEG&#8208;hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG&#8208;HCCs) with a single intravenous injection. These findings provide a deeper understanding of how carbon nanozyme syntheses can be tailored for improved antioxidant bioactivity, and set the stage for translation of medical applications.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Based Robotics Approach for Targeting Fungal Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microrobotic platform is developed using iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based nanozymes to achieve precise spatial targeting and localized catalysis for rapid fungal killing. These nanozyme&#8208;microrobots demonstrate programmable motions, controllable catalysis, and selective binding to fungi. Using tissue infection models, localized delivery of nanozymes and targeted fungal eradication is shown, providing a unique antifungal modality for pathogen killing at the infection site.








Abstract
Fungal pathogens have been designated by the World Health Organization as microbial threats of the highest priority for global health. It remains a major challenge to improve antifungal efficacy at the site of infection while avoiding off&#8208;target effects, fungal spreading, and drug tolerance. Here, a nanozyme&#8208;based microrobotic platform is developed that directs localized catalysis to the infection site with microscale precision to achieve targeted and rapid fungal killing. Using electromagnetic field frequency modulation and fine&#8208;scale spatiotemporal control, structured iron oxide nanozyme assemblies are formed that display tunable dynamic shape transformation and catalysis activation. The catalytic activity varies depending on the motion, velocity, and shape providing controllable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Unexpectedly, nanozyme assemblies bind avidly to fungal (Candida albicans) surfaces to enable concentrated accumulation and targeted ROS&#8208;mediated killing in situ. By exploiting these tunable properties and selective binding to fungi, localized antifungal activity is achieved using in vivo&#8208;like cell spheroid and animal tissue infection models. Structured nanozyme assemblies are directed to Candida&#8208;infected sites using programmable algorithms to perform precisely guided spatial targeting and on&#8208;site catalysis resulting in fungal eradication within 10 min. This nanozyme&#8208;based microrobotics approach provides a uniquely effective and targeted therapeutic modality for pathogen elimination at the infection site.

&lt;p&gt;A microrobotic platform is developed using iron oxide nanoparticle-based nanozymes to achieve precise spatial targeting and localized catalysis for rapid fungal killing. These nanozyme-microrobots demonstrate programmable motions, controllable catalysis, and selective binding to fungi. Using tissue infection models, localized delivery of nanozymes and targeted fungal eradication is shown, providing a unique antifungal modality for pathogen killing at the infection site.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungal pathogens have been designated by the World Health Organization as microbial threats of the highest priority for global health. It remains a major challenge to improve antifungal efficacy at the site of infection while avoiding off-target effects, fungal spreading, and drug tolerance. Here, a nanozyme-based microrobotic platform is developed that directs localized catalysis to the infection site with microscale precision to achieve targeted and rapid fungal killing. Using electromagnetic field frequency modulation and fine-scale spatiotemporal control, structured iron oxide nanozyme assemblies are formed that display tunable dynamic shape transformation and catalysis activation. The catalytic activity varies depending on the motion, velocity, and shape providing controllable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Unexpectedly, nanozyme assemblies bind avidly to fungal (&lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;) surfaces to enable concentrated accumulation and targeted ROS-mediated killing in situ. By exploiting these tunable properties and selective binding to fungi, localized antifungal activity is achieved using in vivo-like cell spheroid and animal tissue infection models. Structured nanozyme assemblies are directed to &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt;-infected sites using programmable algorithms to perform precisely guided spatial targeting and on-site catalysis resulting in fungal eradication within 10 min. This nanozyme-based microrobotics approach provides a uniquely effective and targeted therapeutic modality for pathogen elimination at the infection site.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Ligand Engineering Ruthenium Nanozyme Superior to Horseradish Peroxidase for Enhanced Immunoassay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modification can engineer charge transfer between Ru and ligands and facilitate intermediate radicals to react with colorimetric substrate, which significantly improves the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Ru nanozymes superior to horseradish peroxidase. Following such a mechanism, polystyrene&#8208;sulfonate&#8208;modified Ru nanozymes can be used as an enzyme alternative in enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay to improve detection sensitivity up to 140&#8208;fold, validated with human alpha&#8208;fetoprotein.








Abstract
Nanozymes have great potential to be used as an alternative to natural enzymes in a variety of fields. However, low catalytic activity compared with natural enzymes limits their practical use. It is still challenging to design nanozymes comparable to their natural counterparts in terms of the specific activity. In this study, a surface engineering strategy is employed to improve the specific activity of Ru nanozymes using charge&#8208;transferrable ligands such as polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). PSS&#8208;modified Ru nanozyme exhibits a peroxidase&#8208;like specific activity of up to 2820&#160;U&#160;mg&#8722;1, which is twice that of horseradish peroxidase (1305&#160;U&#160;mg&#8722;1). Mechanism studies suggest that PSS readily accepts negative charge from Ru, thus reducing the affinity between Ru and &#183;OH. Importantly, the modified Ru&#8208;peroxidase&#160;nanozyme is successfully used to develop an immunoassay for human alpha&#8208;fetoprotein and achieves a 140&#8208;fold increase in detection sensitivity compared with traditional horseradish&#8208;peroxidase&#8208;based enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay. Therefore, this work provides a feasible route to design nanozymes with high specific activity that meets the practical use as an alternative to natural enzymes.

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Based Therapeutic Antioxidants for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With their exceptional nature to quench reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, ceria nanoparticles have been investigated as therapeutic nanozymes to treat diseases in which the oxidative stress aggravates the pathological condition. This review introduces the mechanism behind the therapeutic effects of ceria nanoparticles and the exemplary studies that take advantage of it. Remaining challenges and future perspectives are also provided.








Abstract
The growing interest in nanomedicine over the last 20 years has carved out a research field called &#8220;nanocatalytic therapy,&#8221; where catalytic reactions mediated by nanomaterials are employed to intervene in disease&#8208;critical biomolecular processes. Among many kinds of catalytic/enzyme&#8208;mimetic nanomaterials investigated thus far, ceria nanoparticles stand out from others owing to their unique scavenging properties against biologically noxious free radicals, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), by exerting enzyme mimicry and nonenzymatic activities. Much&#160;effort has been made to utilize ceria nanoparticles as self&#8208;regenerating antioxidative and anti&#8208;inflammatory agents for various kinds of diseases, given the detrimental effects of ROS and RNS therein that need alleviation. In this context, this review is intended to provide an overview as to what makes ceria nanoparticles merit attention in disease therapy. The introductory part describes the characteristics of ceria nanoparticles as an oxygen&#8208;deficient metal oxide. The pathophysiological roles of ROS and RNS are then presented, as well as their scavenging mechanisms by ceria nanoparticles. Representative examples of recent ceria&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;based therapeutics are summarized by categorization into organ and disease types, followed by the discussion on the remaining challenges and future research directions.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning (ML) shows promising potential for discovering new materials. However, the design of new nanozymes remains challenging. Here, recent advancements in ML&#8208;assisted discovery and design of materials and engineered enzymes is summarized, along with a discussion as to how these successful cases can be implicated in addressing the current problems facing the nanozyme field. The prospective design of nanozymes based on ML technology is also proposed.








Abstract
Nanozymes are nanomaterials that exhibit enzyme&#8208;like biomimicry. In combination with intrinsic characteristics of nanomaterials, nanozymes have broad applicability in materials science, chemical engineering, bioengineering, biochemistry, and disease theranostics. Recently, the heterogeneity of published results has highlighted the complexity and diversity of nanozymes in terms of consistency of catalytic capacity. Machine learning (ML) shows promising potential for discovering new materials, yet it remains challenging for the design of new nanozymes based on ML approaches. Alternatively, ML is employed to promote optimization of intelligent design and application of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes. Incorporation of the successful ML algorithms used in the intelligent design of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes can concomitantly facilitate the guided development of next&#8208;generation nanozymes with desirable properties. Here, recent progress in ML, its utilization in the design of catalytic materials and enzymes, and how emergent ML applications serve as promising strategies to circumvent challenges associated with time&#8208;expensive and laborious testing in nanozyme research and development are summarized. The potential applications of successful examples of ML&#8208;aided catalytic materials and engineered enzymes in nanozyme design are also highlighted, with special focus on the unified aims in enhancing design and recapitulation of substrate selectivity and catalytic activity.

         <title>Biosystem&#8208;Inspired Engineering of Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances in the engineering of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes, by leveraging the refined catalytic structure of natural enzymes, simulating the behavior changes of natural enzymes in the catalytic process, mimicking the specific biological processes or living organisms, as well as their biomedical applications, are reviewed.








Abstract
Nanozymes with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities have shown great potential to become surrogates of natural enzymes in many fields by virtue of their advantages of high catalytic stability, ease of functionalization, and low cost. However, due to the lack of predictable descriptors, most of the nanozymes reported in the past have been obtained mainly through trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategies, and the catalytic efficacy, substrate specificity, as well as practical application effect under physiological conditions, are far inferior to that of natural enzymes. To optimize the catalytic efficacies and functions of nanozymes in biomedical settings, recent studies have introduced biosystem&#8208;inspired strategies into nanozyme design. In this review, recent advances in the engineering of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes by leveraging the refined catalytic structure of natural enzymes, simulating the behavior changes of natural enzymes in the catalytic process, and mimicking the specific biological processes or living organisms, are introduced. Furthermore, the currently involved biomedical applications of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes are summarized. More importantly, the current opportunities and challenges of the design and application of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes are discussed. It is hoped that the studies of nanozymes based on bioinspired strategies will be beneficial for constructing the new generation of nanozymes and broadening their biomedical applications.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms and Kinetics of Nanozymes: Insights from Theory and Computation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A historic overview of how theory and computation promote the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms and kinetics of the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities of nanomaterials is provided. It is expected to spark future ideas for screening or designing more stable and efficient enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials with fascinating application potential prior to experiments.








Abstract
&#8220;Nanozymes&#8221; usually refers to inorganic nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. The research into nanozymes is one of the hot topics on the horizon of interdisciplinary science involving materials, chemistry, and biology. Although great progress has been made in the design, synthesis, characterization, and application of nanozymes, the study of the underlying microscopic mechanisms and kinetics is still not straightforward. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations compute the potential energy surfaces along the reaction coordinates for chemical reactions, which can give atomistic&#8208;level insights into the micro&#8208;mechanisms and kinetics for nanozymes. Therefore, DFT calculations have been playing an increasingly important role in exploring the mechanisms and kinetics for nanozymes in the past years. The calculations either predict the microscopic details for the catalytic processes to complement the experiments or further develop theoretical models to depict the physicochemical rules. In this review, the corresponding research progress is summarized. Particularly, the review focuses on the computational studies that closely interplay with the experiments. The relevant experimental results without DFT calculations will be also briefly discussed to offer a historic overview of how the computations promote the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms and kinetics of nanozymes.

Multienzymic nanozymes are nanomaterials with more than one enzyme&#8208;like activity. Multienzymic nanozymes have unique advantages, including synergistic effects, cascaded reactions, and responsive selectivity. The catalytic mechanism of multienzymic nanozymes is more complicated and elusive than single&#8208;enzymic nanozymes. In this review, the classification, regulating factors, rational design, and application of multienzymic nanozymes are systematically discussed.








Abstract
Nanomaterials with more than one enzyme&#8208;like activity are termed multienzymic nanozymes, and they&#160;have received increasing attention in recent years and hold huge potential to be applied in diverse fields, especially for biosensing and therapeutics. Compared to single enzyme&#8208;like nanozymes, multienzymic nanozymes offer various unique advantages, including synergistic effects, cascaded reactions, and environmentally responsive selectivity. Nevertheless, along with these merits, the catalytic mechanism and rational design of multienzymic nanozymes are more complicated and elusive as compared to single&#8208;enzymic nanozymes. In this review, the multienzymic nanozymes classification scheme based on the numbers/types of activities, the internal and external factors regulating the multienzymatic activities, the rational design based on chemical, biomimetic, and computer&#8208;aided strategies, and recent progress in applications attributed to the advantages of multicatalytic activities are systematically discussed. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives regarding the development and application of multienzymatic nanozymes are suggested. This review aims to deepen the understanding and inspire the research in multienzymic nanozymes to a greater extent.

         <title>Surface Chemistry of Biologically Active Reducible Oxide Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducible metal oxide nanoparticles are increasingly being studied for biomedical and therapeutic applications. These materials are able to accomplish a broad range of catalytic surface reactions, as well as being amenable to designed enzyme&#8208;mimetic activities as nanozymes. Here, physicochemical properties and material compositions informing optimal nanozyme activities by reducible metal oxide nanomaterials are considered.








Abstract
Reducible metal oxide nanozymes (rNZs) are a subject of intense recent interest due to their catalytic nature, ease of synthesis, and complex surface character. Such materials contain surface sites which facilitate enzyme&#8208;mimetic reactions via substrate coordination and redox cycling. Further, these surface reactive sites are shown to be highly sensitive to stresses within the nanomaterial lattice, the physicochemical environment, and to processing conditions occurring as part of their syntheses. When administered in vivo, a complex protein corona binds to the surface, redefining its biological identity and subsequent interactions within the biological system. Catalytic activities of rNZs each deliver a differing impact on protein corona formation, its composition, and in turn, their recognition, and internalization by host cells. Improving the understanding of the precise principles that dominate rNZ surface&#8208;biomolecule adsorption raises the question of whether designer rNZs can be engineered to prevent corona formation, or indeed to produce &#8220;custom&#8221; protein coronas applied either in vitro, and preadministration, or formed immediately upon their exposure to body fluids. Here, fundamental surface chemistry processes and their implications in rNZ material performance are considered. In particular, material structures which inform component adsorption from the application environment, including substrates for enzyme&#8208;mimetic reactions are discussed.

         <title>Current Advances on the Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme and Its Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis approaches including bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down strategies; catalysis modulation including central metal atom, coordination number, heteroatom doping, and the metal&#8208;support interaction for activity and selectivity modulation of single&#8208;atom nanozymes; and bioapplications in the biosensing, antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor fields are reviewed.








Abstract
Nanozymes, a class of nanomaterials mimicking the function of enzymes, have aroused much attention as the candidate in diverse fields with the arbitrarily tunable features owing to the diversity of crystalline nanostructures, composition, and surface configurations. However, the uncertainty of their active sites and the lower intrinsic deficiencies of nanomaterial&#8208;initiated catalysis compared with the natural enzymes promote the pursuing of alternatives by imitating the biological active centers. Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) maximize the atom utilization with the well&#8208;defined structure, providing an important bridge to investigate mechanism and the relationship between structure and catalytic activity. They have risen as the new burgeoning alternative to the natural enzyme from in vitro bioanalytical tool to in vivo therapy owing to the flexible atomic engineering structure. Here, focus is mainly on the three parts. First, a detailed overview of single&#8208;atom catalyst synthesis strategies including bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches is given. Then, according to the structural feature of single&#8208;atom nanocatalysts, the influence factors such as central metal atom, coordination number, heteroatom doping, and the metal&#8211;support interaction are discussed and the representative biological applications (including antibacterial/antiviral performance, cancer therapy, and biosensing) are highlighted. In the end, the future perspective and challenge facing are demonstrated.

         <title>Modular Fabrication of Bioorthogonal Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal nanozymes facilitate in situ drug synthesis at disease sites through prodrug activation. This review investigates the role of nanomaterials in stabilizing and regulating transition metal catalysts (TMCs), emphasizing the modular design of nanomaterials and catalysts. It explores their synergistic engineering for efficient in situ uncaging of diagnostic and therapeutic agents.








Abstract
The incorporation of transition metal catalysts (TMCs) into nanoscaffolds generates nanocatalysts that replicate key aspects of enzymatic behavior. The TMCs can access bioorthogonal chemistry unavailable to living systems. These bioorthogonal nanozymes can be employed as in situ &#8220;factories&#8221; for generating bioactive molecules where needed. The generation of effective bioorthogonal nanozymes requires co&#8208;engineering of the TMC and the nanometric scaffold. This review presents an overview of recent advances in the field of bioorthogonal nanozymes, focusing on modular design aspects of both nanomaterial and catalyst and how they synergistically work together for in situ uncaging of imaging and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Based Regulation of Cellular Metabolism and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of nanozymes in the metabolic regulation of diverse cells, including mammalian cells, microbial cells, and plant cells is reviewed, and the applications of nanozyme&#8208;based metabolic regulation in disease treatment, antimicrobial therapy, and sustainable agriculture are highlighted. Finally, the prospects and challenges of the future research are discussed.








Abstract
Metabolism is the sum of the enzyme&#8208;dependent chemical reactions, which produces energy in catabolic process and synthesizes biomass in anabolic process, exhibiting high similarity in mammalian cell, microbial cell, and plant cell. Consequently, the loss or gain of metabolic enzyme activity greatly affects cellular metabolism. Nanozymes, as emerging enzyme mimics with diverse functions and adjustable catalytic activities, have shown attractive potential for metabolic regulation. Although the basic metabolic tasks are highly similar for the cells from different species, the concrete metabolic pathway varies with the intracellular structure of different species. Here, the basic metabolism in living organisms is described and the similarities and differences in the metabolic pathways among mammalian, microbial, and plant cells and the regulation mechanism are discussed. The recent progress on regulation of cellular metabolism mainly including nutrient uptake and utilization, energy production, and the accompanied redox reactions by different kinds of oxidoreductases and their applications in the field of disease therapy, antimicrobial therapy, and sustainable agriculture is systematically reviewed. Furthermore, the prospects and challenges of nanozymes in regulating cell metabolism are also discussed, which broaden their application scenarios.

Abstract
Considering practical viability, Li&#8208;metal battery electrolytes should be formulated by tuning solvent composition similar to electrolyte systems for Li&#8208;ion batteries to enable the facile salt&#8208;dissociation, ion&#8208;conduction, and introduction of sacrificial additives for building stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. Although 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane with a high&#8208;donor number enables the implementation of ionic compounds as effective interface modifiers, its ubiquitous usage is limited by its low&#8208;oxidation durability and high&#8208;volatility. Regulation of the solvation structure and construction of well&#8208;structured interfacial layers ensure the potential strength of electrolytes in both Li&#8208;metal and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811). This study reports the build&#8208;up of multilayer solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase by utilizing different electron&#8208;accepting tendencies of lithium difluoro(bisoxalato) phosphate (LiDFBP), lithium nitrate, and synthetic 1&#8208;((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)piperidine. Furthermore, a well&#8208;structured cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface from LiDFBP effectively addresses the issues with NCM811. The developed electrolyte based on a framework of highly&#8208; and weakly&#8208;solvating solvents with interface modifiers enables the operation of Li|NCM811 cells with a high areal capacity cathode (4.3 mAh cm&#8722;2) at 4.4&#160;V versus Li/Li+.

&lt;p&gt;Considering practical viability, Li-metal battery electrolytes should be formulated by tuning solvent composition similar to electrolyte systems for Li-ion batteries to enable the facile salt-dissociation, ion-conduction, and introduction of sacrificial additives for building stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. Although 1,2-dimethoxyethane with a high-donor number enables the implementation of ionic compounds as effective interface modifiers, its ubiquitous usage is limited by its low-oxidation durability and high-volatility. Regulation of the solvation structure and construction of well-structured interfacial layers ensure the potential strength of electrolytes in both Li-metal and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM811).

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Melt electrowriting (MEW) is an emerging additive manufacturing (AM) technology that enables the precise deposition of continuous polymeric microfibers, allowing for the creation of high&#8208;resolution constructs. In recent years, MEW has undergone a revolution, with the introduction of active properties or additional functionalities through novel polymer processing strategies, the incorporation of functional fillers, post&#8208;processing, or the combination with other techniques. While extensively explored in biomedical applications, MEW's potential in other fields remains untapped. Thus, this review explores MEW's characteristics from a materials science perspective, emphasizing the diverse range of materials and composites processed by this technique and their current and potential applications. Additionally, the prospects offered by post&#8208;printing processing techniques are explored, together with the synergy achieved by combining melt electrowriting with other manufacturing methods. By highlighting the untapped potentials of MEW, this review aims to inspire research groups across various fields to leverage this technology for innovative endeavors.

         <title>Minimally Invasive Delivery of Percutaneous Ablation Agent via Magnetic Colloidal Hydrogel Injection for Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Percutaneous thermotherapy, a minimally invasive operational procedure, is employed in the ablation of deep tumor lesions by means of target&#8208;delivering heat. Conventional thermal ablation methods, such as radiofrequency or microwave ablation, to a certain extent, are subjected to extended ablation time as well as biosafety risks of unwanted overheating. Given its effectiveness and safety, percutaneous thermotherapy gains a fresh perspective thanks to magnetic hyperthermia. In this respect, an injectable and magnetic hydrogel constructs&#8208;based thermal ablation agent is likely to be a candidate for the aforementioned clinical translation. Adopting a simple and environment&#8208;friendly strategy, a magnetic colloidal hydrogel injection is introduced by a binary system comprising superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles and gelatin nanoparticles. The colloidal hydrogel constructs, unlike conventional bulk hydrogel, could be easily extruded through a percutaneous needle and then self&#8208;heal in a reversible manner owing to the unique electrostatic crosslinking. The introduction of magnetic building blocks was exhibited with a rapid magneto&#8208;thermal response to an alternating magnetic field. Such hydrogel injection is capable of generating heat without limitation of deep penetration. The materials achieved outstanding therapeutic results in both small and large animal models. These findings constitute a new class of locoregional interventional thermal therapies with minimal collateral damages.

         <title>Weak Electrostatic force on K+ in Gel Polymer Electrolyte Realizes High ion Transference Number for Quasi Solid&#8208;state Potassium ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quasi solid&#8208;state potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SSPIBs) are of great potential for commercial use due to the abundant reserves and cost effectiveness of resources as well as high safety. Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with high ionic conductivity and fast interfacial charge transport are necessary in SSPIBs. Here, we reveal the weak electrostatic force between K+ and electronegative functional groups in the ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) polymer chains, which can promote fast migration of free K+. To further enhance the interfacial reaction kinetics, a multilayered gel polymer electrolyte by in&#8208;situ growth of poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) on ETPTA (PVDF&#8208;HFP|ETPTA|PVDF&#8208;HFP) is constructed to improve the interface contact and provide sufficient K+ concentration in PVDF&#8208;HFP. A high ion transference number (0.92) and a superior ionic conductivity (5.15&#215;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) are achieved. Consequently, the SSPIBs with both intercalation&#8208;type (PB) and conversion&#8208;type (PTCDA) cathodes show the best battery performance among all reported SSPIBs of the same cathode. These findings demonstrate that potassium&#8208;ion batteries have the potential to surpass Li/Na ion batteries in solid&#8208;state systems.

         <title>Ingestible Artificial Urinary Biomarker Probes for Urine Test of Gastrointestinal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although colorectal cancer diagnosed at early stage shows high curability, methods simultaneously possessing point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing ability and high sensitivity are limited. Here, we present an orally deliverable biomarker&#8208;activatable probe (termed as HATS) for early detection of orthotopic tumor via remote urinalysis. To enable its oral delivery to colon, HATS is designed to have remarkable resistance to acidity and digestive enzymes in the stomach and small intestine, and negligible intestinal absorption. Upon reaction with a cancer biomarker in colon segment, HATS releases a small fragment of tetrazine that can transverse the intestinal barrier, enter blood circulation, and ultimately undergo renal clearance to urine. Subsequently, the urinary tetrazine fragment is detected by bioorthogonal reaction with trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8208;caged resorufin (TCO&#8208;Reso) to afford a rapid and specific fluorescence enhancement of TCO&#8208;Reso. Such signal readout is correlated with the urinary tetrazine concentration and thus measures the level of cancer biomarker in colon. HATS&#8208;based optical urinalysis detects orthotopic colon tumor two weeks earlier than clinical serological test and can be developed to point&#8208;of&#8208;care paper test. Thereby, HATS&#8208;based urinalysis provides a non&#8208;invasive and sensitive approach for cancer screening at low&#8208;resource settings.

A facile roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll strategy is developed for fabricating ultraflexible thermoelectric films with superior temperature&#8208; and strain&#8208;sensing performance, and a prototypical robotic hand for intelligent action feedback and temperature alarm is demonstrated. This work not only brings new inspiration for wearable inorganic thermoelectric devices, but also sets the stage for a wide implementation of multifunctional human&#8208;machine interaction systems.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;like thermoelectric (TE) films with temperature&#8208; and strain&#8208;sensing functions are highly desirable for human&#8208;machine interaction systems and wearable devices. However, current TE films still face challenges in achieving high flexibility and excellent sensing performance simultaneously. Herein, for the first time, a facile roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll strategy is proposed to fabricate an ultraflexible chalcogenide glass&#8208;polytetrafluoroethylene composite film with superior temperature&#8208; and strain&#8208;sensing performance. The unique reticular network of the composite film endows it with efficient Seebeck effect and flexibility, leading to a high Seebeck coefficient (731 &#181;V/K), rapid temperature response (&#8776;0.7 s), and excellent strain sensitivity (gauge factor = 836). Based on this high&#8208;performance composite film, an intelligent robotic hand for action feedback and temperature alarm is fabricated, demonstrating its great potential in human&#8208;machine interaction. Such TE film fabrication strategy not only brings new inspiration for wearable inorganic TE devices, but also sets the stage for a wide implementation of multifunctional human&#8208;machine interaction systems.

         <title>Phase Engineered CuxS&#8211;Ag2S with Photothermoelectric Activity for Enhanced Multienzyme Activity and Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous&#8208;crystalline hybrid material CuxS&#8211;Ag2S is explored for optimizing synergistic therapy. The characteristics of both amorphous and crystalline phases play a key role in thermoelectrodynamically enhancing enzyme catalytic activity. Thus, the catalytic active site is increased, site competition is avoided, and the temperature gradient is reasonably constructed.








Abstract
The insufficient exposure sites and active site competition of multienzyme are the two main factors to hinder its therapeutic effect. Here, a phase&#8208;junction nanomaterial (amorphous&#8208;crystalline CuxS&#8211;Ag2S) is designed and prepared through a simple room temperature ion&#8208;exchange process. A small amount of Ag+ is added into Cu7S4 nanocrystals, which transforms Cu7S4 into amorphous phased CuxS and produces crystalline Ag2S simultaneously. In this structure, the overhanging bonds on the amorphous CuxS surface provide abundant active sites for optimizing the therapeutic activity. Meanwhile, the amorphous state enhances the photothermal effect through non&#8208;radiative relaxation, and due to its low thermal resistance, phase&#8208;junction CuxS&#8211;Ag2S forms a significant temperature gradient to unlock the optimized thermo&#8208;electrodynamic therapy. Furthermore, benefiting from the high asymmetry of the amorphous state, the material forms a spin&#8208;polarized state that can effectively inhibit electron&#8211;hole recombination. In this way, the thermoelectric effect can facilitate the enzyme&#8208;catalyzed cycle by providing electrons and holes, enabling an enhanced coupling of thermoelectric therapy with multienzyme activity, which induces excellent anti&#8208;tumor performance. More importantly, the catalytic process simulated by density&#8208;functional theory proves that Ag+ alleviates the burden on the Cu sites through favorable adsorption of O2 and prevents active site competition.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Deep Eutectic Liquids Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Polarization Aluminum Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated deep eutectic liquid electrolyte (LC&#8208;DELE) is constructed by diluting [AlCl3]1.3[Urea]1 with 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn). dFBn leads to better fluidity and ionic transport, without affecting the ionic dynamics. Al&#8208;graphite and Al&#8208;S batteries employing LC&#8208;DELEs exhibit weakened polarization and enhanced cyclic stability. This work demonstrates that LC&#8208;DELEs is a feasible strategy enabling low&#8208;polarization aluminum metal batteries.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and nontoxic deep eutectic liquid electrolytes (DELEs), such as [AlCl3]1.3[Urea] (AU), are promising for rechargeable non&#8208;aqueous aluminum metal batteries (AMBs). However, their high viscosity and sluggish ion transport at room temperature lead to high cell polarization and low specific capacity, limiting their practical application. Herein, non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) is proposed as a co&#8208;solvent of DELEs using AU as model to construct a locally concentrated deep eutectic liquid electrolyte (LC&#8208;DELE). dFBn effectively improves the fluidity and ion transport without affecting the ionic dynamics in the electrolyte. Moreover, dFBn also modifies the solid electrolyte interphase growing on the aluminum metal anodes and reduces the interfacial resistance. As a result, the lifespan of Al/Al cells is improved from 210 to 2000&#160;h, and the cell polarization is reduced from 0.36 to 0.14&#160;V at 1.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The rate performance of Al&#8208;graphite cells is greatly improved with a polarization reduction of 0.15 and 0.74&#160;V at 0.1 and 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, respectively. The initial discharge capacity of Al&#8208;sulfur cells is improved from 94 to 1640&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. This work provides a feasible solution to the high polarization of AMBs employing DELEs and a new path to high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost AMBs.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Low Modulus of Ductile TiZrHfTa Biomedical High&#8208;Entropy Alloys through Deformation Induced Martensitic Transformation/Twinning/Amorphization</title>

Abstract
Biomedical alloys are paramount materials in biomedical applications, particularly in crafting biological artificial replacements. In traditional biomedical alloys, a significant challenge is simultaneously achieving an ultra&#8208;low Young's modulus, excellent biocompatibility, and acceptable ductility. A multi&#8208;component body&#8208;centered cubic biomedical high&#8208;entropy alloy (Bio&#8208;HEA), which is composed of non&#8208;toxic elements, is noteworthy for its outstanding biocompatibility and compositional tuning capabilities. Nevertheless, the aforementioned challenges still remain. Here, we propose a method to achieve a single phase with the lowest Young's modulus among the constituent phases by precisely tuning the stability of the body&#8208;centered cubic phase in the Bio&#8208;HEA. The subtle tuning of the body&#8208;centered cubic phase stability also enables the induction of stress&#8208;induced martensite transformation with extremely low trigger stress. The transformation&#8208;induced plasticity and work hardening capacity were achieved via the stress&#8208;induced martensite transformation. Additionally, the hierarchical stress&#8208;induced martensite twin structure and crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous phase transformation provide robust toughening mechanisms in the Bio&#8208;HEA. The cytotoxicity test confirmed that this Bio&#8208;HEA exhibited excellent biocompatibility without cytotoxicity. In conclusion, our study provides new insights on the development of biomedical alloys with a combination of ultra&#8208;low Young's modulus, excellent biocompatibility, and decent ductility.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretchable materials, such as gels and elastomers, are attractive materials in diverse applications. Their versatile fabrication platforms enable the creation of materials with various physiochemical properties and geometries. However, the mechanical performance of traditional stretchable materials is often hindered by the deficiencies in their energy dissipation system, leading to lower fracture resistance and impeding their broader range of applications. Therefore, the synthesis of fracture&#8208;resistant stretchable materials has attracted great interest. This review comprehensively summarizes key design considerations for constructing fracture&#8208;resistant stretchable materials, examines their synthesis strategies to achieve elevated fracture energy, and highlights recent advancements in their potential applications.

         <title>Exosome&#8208;Inhibiting Polymeric Sonosensitizer for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Combination cancer immunotherapy based on electromagnetic energy and immunotherapy has shown potent anti&#8208;cancer efficacy. However, as a factor that mediates tumor metastasis and immune suppression, the impact of tumor exosomes on therapy under electromagnetic energy stimulation remains unclear. Herein, our findings indicate that sonodynamic therapy (SDT) increases serum exosome levels by inducing apoptotic exosomes and loosening the tumor extracellular matrix, promoting lung metastasis. To address this problem, we synthesize an exosome&#8208;inhibiting polymeric sonosensitizer (EIPS) selectively inhibiting tumor exosome generation in response to the tumor biomarker. EIPS consists of a semiconducting polymer backbone capable of inducing SDT and a poly(ethylene glycol) layer conjugated with a tumor&#8208;specific enzyme&#8208;responsive exosome inhibitor prodrug. After being cleaved by tumor Cathepsin B, EIPS releases active exosome inhibitors, preventing tumor exosome&#8208;mediated immune suppression and lung metastasis. As a result, EIPS elicits robust antitumor effects through the synergistic effect of SDT and tumor exosome inhibition, completely preventing lung metastasis and establishing a long&#8208;term immune memory effect. This is the first example showing that combining SDT with tumor&#8208;specific exosome inhibition can elicit a potent immune response without the help of typical immune agonists.

         <title>Tailoring single&#8208;mode random lasing of tin halide perovskites integrated in a vertical cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of random lasing (RL) with predictable and controlled properties is an important step to make these cheap optical sources stable and reliable. However, the design of tailored RL characteristics (emission energy, threshold, number of modes) has been only obtained with complex photonic structures, while the simplest optical configurations able to tune the RL is still a challenge. This work demonstrates the tuning of the RL characteristics in spin&#8208;coated and inkjet&#8208;printed tin&#8208;based perovskites integrated into a vertical cavity with low quality factor. When the cavity mode is resonant with the photoluminescence (PL) peak energy, standard vertical lasing is observed. More important, single mode RL operation with the lowest threshold and a quality factor as high as 1000 (twenty times the quality factor of the resonator) is obtained if the cavity mode lies above the PL peak energy due to higher gain. These results can have important technological implications towards the development of low&#8208;cost RL sources without chaotic behavior.

         <title>Advancing Catalysts by Stacking Fault Defects for Enhanced Hydrogen Production: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the transformative role of stacking fault (SF) defect engineering in catalysts, strategically influencing surface reactivity and modulating electronic structure. This exploration sheds light on the promising applications and major challenges of SF&#8208;modified catalysts in hydrogen production and related electrochemical reactions, providing a critical and thorough overview to advance sustainable energy technologies.








Abstract
Green hydrogen, derived from water splitting powered by renewable energy such as solar and wind energy, provides a zero&#8208;emission solution crucial for revolutionizing hydrogen production and decarbonizing industries. Catalysts, particularly those utilizing defect engineering involving the strategical introduction of atomic&#8208;level imperfections, play a vital role in reducing energy requirements and enabling a more sustainable transition toward a hydrogen&#8208;based economy. Stacking fault (SF) defects play an important role in enhancing the electrocatalytic processes by reshaping surface reactivity, increasing active sites, improving reactants/product diffusion, and regulating electronic structure due to their dense generation ability and profound impact on catalyst properties. This review explores SF in metal&#8208;based materials, covering synthetic methods for the intentional introduction of SF and their applications in hydrogen production, including oxygen evolution reaction, photo&#8208; and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, and various other electrocatalytic processes such as oxygen reduction reaction, nitrate reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Finally, this review addresses the challenges associated with SF&#8208;based catalysts, emphasizing the importance of a detailed understanding of the properties of SF&#8208;based catalysts to optimize their electrocatalytic performance. It provides a comprehensive overview of their various applications in electrocatalytic processes, providing valuable insights for advancing sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Facile Access to High Solid Content Monodispersed Microspheres via Dual&#8208;Component Surfactants Regulation towards High&#8208;Performance Colloidal Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Monodispersed microspheres play a major role in optical science and engineering, providing ideal building blocks for structural color materials. However, method towards high solid content (HSC) monodispersed microspheres has remained a key hurdle. Herein, we demonstrated a facile access to harvest monodispersed microspheres based on the emulsion polymerization mechanism, where anionic and nonionic surfactants were employed to achieve the electrostatic and steric dual&#8208;stabilization balance in a synergistic manner. Monodispersed poly(styrene&#8208;butyl acrylate&#8208;methacrylic acid) (P(St&#8208;BA&#8208;MAA)) colloidal latex with 55&#160;wt.% HSC was achieved, which shows an enhanced self&#8208;assembly efficiency of 280% comparing with the low solid content (10&#160;wt.%) latex. In addition, Ag&#8208;coated colloidal photonic crystal (Ag@CPC) coating with near&#8208;zero refractive index is achieved, presenting the characteristics of metamaterials. And a 11&#8208;fold photoluminescence (PL) emission enhancement of CdSe@ZnS quantum dots (QDs) is realized by the Ag@CPC metamaterial coating. Taking advantage of high assembly efficiency, easily large&#8208;scale film&#8208;forming of the 55&#160;wt.% HSC microspheres latex, we could easily produce robust Ag@CPC metamaterial coatings for passive cooling. The coating demonstrates excellent thermal insulation performance with theoretical cooling power of 30.4&#160;W/m2, providing practical significance for scalable colloidal photonic crystal (CPC) architecture coatings in passive cooling.

         <title>Insight Into Multiple Intermolecular Coordination of Composite Solid Electrolytes Via Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy for High&#8208;Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Polymer/ceramic&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSE) are promising candidates for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SLBs), benefiting from the combined mechanical robustness of polymeric electrolytes and the high ionic conductivity of ceramic electrolytes. However, the interfacial instability and poorly understood interphases of CSE hinder their application in high&#8208;voltage SLBs. Herein, we discover a simple but effective CSE that stabilizes high&#8208;voltage SLBs by forming multiple intermolecular coordination interactions between polyester and ceramic electrolytes. The multiple coordination between the carbonyl groups in poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) and the fluorosulfonyl groups in anions with Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 nanoparticles is directly visualized by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation. Importantly, the multiple coordination in CSE not only prevents the continuous decomposition of polymer skeleton by shielding the vulnerable carbonyl sites but also establishes stable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases through preferential decomposition of anions. The stable CSE and its inorganic&#8208;rich interphases enable Li||Li symmetric cells with an exceptional lifespan of over 4800 hours without dendritic shorting at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the high&#8208;voltage SLB with LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode displays excellent cycling stability over 1100 cycles at a 1C charge/discharge rate. This work reveals the underlying mechanism behind the excellent stability of coordinating composite electrolytes and interfaces in high&#8208;voltage SLBs.

         <title>Viscoelasticity&#8208;Controlled Relaxation in Wrinkling Surface for Multistage Time&#8208;Resolved Optical Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As counterfeit techniques continue to evolve, ensuring the security of conventional &#8220;static&#8221; encryption methods becomes increasingly challenging. Here, the viscoelasticity&#8208;controlled relaxation is introduced for the first time in a bilayer wrinkling system by regulating the density of hydrogen bond networks in polymer to construct a &#8220;dynamic&#8221; encryption material. The wrinkling surface can manipulate light during the dynamic relaxation process, exhibiting three stages with frosted glass, structural color, and mirror reflection. By regulating the viscoelasticity of skin layer through UV irradiation, the wavelength and the relaxation rate of the wrinkles can be controlled. As a result, dynamic wrinkling anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns and time&#8208;resolved multistage information encryption are achieved. Crucially, the encryption material is developed as an anti&#8208;counterfeiting label for packing boxes in daily applications, allowing the encrypted information to be activated manually and identified by naked eyes, surpassing the existing time&#8208;resolved encryption materials in utilization potential.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As counterfeit techniques continue to evolve, ensuring the security of conventional &#8220;static&#8221; encryption methods becomes increasingly challenging. Here, the viscoelasticity-controlled relaxation is introduced for the first time in a bilayer wrinkling system by regulating the density of hydrogen bond networks in polymer to construct a &#8220;dynamic&#8221; encryption material. The wrinkling surface can manipulate light during the dynamic relaxation process, exhibiting three stages with frosted glass, structural color, and mirror reflection. By regulating the viscoelasticity of skin layer through UV irradiation, the wavelength and the relaxation rate of the wrinkles can be controlled. As a result, dynamic wrinkling anti-counterfeiting patterns and time-resolved multistage information encryption are achieved. Crucially, the encryption material is developed as an anti-counterfeiting label for packing boxes in daily applications, allowing the encrypted information to be activated manually and identified by naked eyes, surpassing the existing time-resolved encryption materials in utilization potential. Besides, the dynamic hydrogen bond networks are extended to various dynamic interaction networks, demonstrating the versatility of the dynamic encryption strategy. This work not only provides an additional dimension for dynamic information encryption in daily practical use, but also offers theoretical guidance for the development of advanced optical anti-counterfeiting and smart display materials in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tuning Surface Potential Polarization to Enhance N2 Affinity for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) to synthesize ammonia is a sustainable reaction that is expected to replace Haber Bosch process. Laminated Bi2WO6 has great potential as an NRR electrocatalyst, however, the effective activity requires that the inert substrate is fully activated. Here, we succeeded for the first time in activating the Bi2WO6 basal planes with NRR activity through Ti doping. The introduction of Ti successfully tunes the surface potential distribution and enhances the N2 adsorption. The subsequently strong hybrid coupling of d(Ti)&#8208;p(N) orbitals fills the electronic state of N2 antibonding molecular orbital, which greatly weakens the bonding strength of N&#8801;N bonds. Further, in situ SR&#8208;FTIR spectrum and theoretical calculations showed that surface potential polarization enhanced the adsorption of HNN* by Bi&#8208;Ti dual&#8208;metal sites, which is beneficial for the subsequent activation hydrogenation process. The Ti&#8208;Bi2WO6 nanosheets achieved 11.44% Faradaic efficiency (&#8208;0.2&#160;V), a NH3 yield rate of 23.14&#160;&#181;g mg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (15N calibration), and satisfactory stability in 0.1&#160;M HCl environment. The mutual assistance of theory and experiment can help understand and develop of excellent two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials for the NRR.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment Remodeling&#8208;Mediated Sequential Drug Delivery Potentiates Treatment Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonists, such as imidazoquinolines (IMDQs), are promising for the de novo priming of antitumor immunity. However, their systemic administration is severely limited due to the off&#8208;target toxicity. Here, we describe a sequential drug delivery strategy. The formulation is composed of two sequential modules: a tumor microenvironment remodeling nanocarrier (poly(L&#8208;glutamic acid)&#8208;graft&#8208;methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)/combretastatin A4, termed CA4&#8208;NPs) and an immunotherapy nanocarrier (apcitide peptide&#8208;decorated poly(L&#8208;glutamic acid)&#8208;graft&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3 conjugate, termed apcitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3). CA4&#8208;NPs, as a vascular disrupting agent, are utilized to remodel the tumor microenvironment for enhancing tumor coagulation and hypoxia. Subsequently, the apcitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3 could identify and target tumor coagulation through the binding of surface apcitide peptide to the GPIIb&#8208;IIIa on activated platelets. Afterward, IMDQ was activated selectively through the conversion of &#8220;&#8208;N3&#8221; to &#8220;&#8208;NH2&#8221; in the presence of hypoxia. The biodistribution results confirmed their high tumor uptake of activated IMDQ (22.66%ID/g). By augmenting the priming and immunologic memory of tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells, 4T1 and CT26 tumors with a size of &#8764;500 mm3 were eradicated without recurrence in mouse models.

Abstract
The presence of bacteria in tumor results in chemotherapeutic drug resistance and weakens the immune response in colorectal cancer. To overcome bacterium&#8208;induced chemotherapeutic drug resistance and potentiate anti&#8208;tumor immunity, herein we rationally design a novel molecule Biotin&#8208;Lys(SA&#8208;Cip&#8208;OH)&#8208;Lys(SA&#8208;CPT)&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;Nap (Biotin&#8208;Cip&#8208;CPT&#8208;Nap) containing four functional motifs (i.e., a biotin motif for targeting, Phe&#8208;Phe(&#8208;Nap) motif for self&#8208;assembly, ciprofloxacin derivative (Cip&#8208;OH) motif for antibacterial effect, and camptothecin (CPT) motif for chemotherapy). Using the designed molecule, a novel strategy of intracellular enzymatic nanofiber formation and synergistic antibacterium&#8208;enhanced chemotherapy and immunotherapy is achieved. Under endocytosis mediated by highly expressed biotin receptor in colorectal cancer cell membrane and the catalysis of highly expressed carboxylesterase in the cytoplasm, this novel molecule can be transformed into Biotin&#8208;Nap, which self&#8208;assembled into nanofibers. Meanwhile, antibiotic ciprofloxacin derivative (Cip&#8208;OH) and chemotherapeutic drug camptothecin (CPT) are released, overcoming bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy towards colorectal cancer. This work offers a feasible strategy for the design of novel multifunctional prodrugs to improve the efficiency of colorectal cancer treatment.

         <title>Femtosecond Electron Diffraction Reveals Local Disorder and Local Anharmonicity in Thermoelectric SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In addition to long&#8208;range periodicity, local disorder, with local structures deviating from the average lattice structure, dominates the physical properties of phonons, electrons and spin subsystems in crystalline functional materials. Experimentally characterizing the 3D atomic configuration of such a local disorder and correlating it with advanced functions remains challenging. Using a combination of femtosecond electron diffraction, structure factor calculations and TDDFT&#8208;MD simulations, we exclusively identified the static local disorder and its local anharmonicity in thermoelectric SnSe. The ultrafast structural dynamics reveal that the crystalline SnSe is composed of multiple locally correlated configurations dominated by the static off&#8208;symmetry displacements of Sn (&#8764;0.4 &#197;) and such a set of locally correlated structures is termed local disorder. Moreover, the anharmonicity of this local disorder induces an ultrafast atomic displacement within 100 fs, indicating the signature of probable THz Einstein oscillators. The identified local disorder and local anharmonicity suggest a glass&#8208;like thermal transport channel, which updates the fundamental insight into the long&#8208;debated ultralow thermal conductivity of SnSe. Our method of revealing the 3D local disorder and the locally correlated interactions by ultrafast structural dynamics will inspire broad interest in the construction of structure&#8208;property relationships in material science.

         <title>Fast Li Replenishment Channels&#8208;Assisted Recycling of Degraded Layered Cathodes with Enhanced Cycling Performance and Thermal Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The direct recycling of cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is important for environmental protection and resource conservation. The key regeneration processes are composition replenishment and atom rearrangement, both of which depend on the migration and diffusion of atoms. However, for the direct recycling of degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (D&#8208;NCM523) cathode, the irreversible phase transitions accumulated during the long&#8208;term cycles block the Li diffusion channels with a high diffusion energy barrier, resulting in the layered structure difficult to be fully repaired and the capacity decays rapidly. To address the challenge, we rebuild fast Li replenishment channels to regulate the surface phase and effectively assist the regeneration process with a reduced energy barrier. This method reduces the amount of Li supplement by &gt;75% and shortens the sintering time (only 2 hours) to fully regenerate D&#8208;NCM523, compared to general direct recycling methods. The regenerated NCM523 (LCMB&#8208;NCM523) exhibits a satisfactory repaired specific capacity of 160 mAh g&#8211;1 and excellent cycling stability, retaining 78% of its capacity after 300 cycles. In addition, LCMB&#8208;NCM523 is recycled with improved thermal decomposition peak temperature and enables 200 cycles even at 60 &#176;C, greatly improving safety. This work proposes a promising way for the large&#8208;scale direct regeneration of layered cathodes.

The regenerated NCM523 (LCMB-NCM523) exhibits a satisfactory repaired specific capacity of 160 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent cycling stability, retaining 78% of its capacity after 300 cycles. In addition, LCMB-NCM523 is recycled with improved thermal decomposition peak temperature and enables 200 cycles even at 60 &#176;C, greatly improving safety. This work proposes a promising way for the large-scale direct regeneration of layered cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Choreographing the adaptive shapes of patterned surfaces to exhibit designable mechanical interactions with their environment remains an intricate challenge. Here, a novel category of strain&#8208;engineered dynamic&#8208;shape materials, empowering diverse multi&#8208;dimensional shape modulations that are combined to form fine&#8208;grained adaptive microarchitectures is introduced. Using micro&#8208;origami tessellation technology, heterogeneous materials are provided with strategic creases featuring stimuli&#8208;responsive micro&#8208;hinges that morph precisely upon chemical and electrical cues. Freestanding multifaceted foldable packages, auxetic mesosurfaces, and morphable cages are three of the forms demonstrated herein of these complex 4&#8208;dimensional (4D) metamaterials. These systems are integrated in dual proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept bioelectronic demonstrations: a soft foldable supercapacitor enhancing its power density (&#8776;108&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a bio&#8208;adaptive device with a dynamic shape that may enable novel smart&#8208;implant technologies. This work demonstrates that intelligent material systems are now ready to support ultra&#8208;flexible 4D microelectronics, which can impart autonomy to devices culminating in the tangible realization of microelectronic morphogenesis.

         <title>Structuring and Shaping of Mechanically Robust and Functional Hydrogels toward Wearable and Implantable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The remarkable similarities to living tissues make hydrogels especially suitable for biointegrated applications that closely interact with human bodies. Recent progress in polymer science and advanced processing technologies that enable the mechanical engineering and shaping of hydrogels are reviewed. Moreover, perspectives on further development of mechanically reliable, adaptive biointegrated hydrogel devices for practical use are discussed.








Abstract
Hydrogels possess unique features such as softness, wetness, responsiveness, and biocompatibility, making them highly suitable for biointegrated applications that have close interactions with living organisms. However, conventional man&#8208;made hydrogels are usually soft and brittle, making them inferior to the mechanically robust biological hydrogels. To ensure reliable and durable operation of biointegrated wearable and implantable devices, mechanical matching and shape adaptivity of hydrogels to tissues and organs are essential. Recent advances in polymer science and processing technologies have enabled mechanical engineering and shaping of hydrogels for various biointegrated applications. In this review, polymer network structuring strategies at micro/nanoscales for toughening hydrogels are summarized, and representative mechanical functionalities that exist in biological materials but are not easily achieved in synthetic hydrogels are further discussed. Three categories of processing technologies, namely, 3D printing, spinning, and coating for fabrication of tough hydrogel constructs with complex shapes are reviewed, and the corresponding hydrogel toughening strategies are also highlighted. These developments enable adaptive fabrication of mechanically robust and functional hydrogel devices, and promote application of hydrogels in the fields of biomedical engineering, bioelectronics, and soft robotics.

         <dc:description>
This review highlights the recent progress in PEC catalysis to synthesize high&#8208;value chemicals from readily available feedstocks. The latest advancements in the PEC conversion of various feedstocks are highlighted and the existing challenges/prospects are presented. It offers an insightful perspective on PEC technology for upgrading several renewable precursors to value&#8208;added products and other pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysis provides the most promising avenue for producing value&#8208;added chemicals and consumables from renewable precursors. Over the last decades, PEC catalysis, including reduction of renewable feedstock, oxidation of organics, and activation and functionalization of C&#9472;C and C&#9472;H bonds, are extensively investigated, opening new opportunities for employing the technology in upgrading readily available resources. However, several challenges still remain unsolved, hindering the commercialization of the process. This review offers an overview of PEC catalysis targeted at the synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals from sustainable precursors. First, the fundamentals of evaluating PEC reactions in the context of value&#8208;added product synthesis at both anode and cathode are recalled. Then, the common photoelectrode fabrication methods that have been employed to produce thin&#8208;film photoelectrodes are highlighted. Next, the advancements are systematically reviewed and discussed in the PEC conversion of various feedstocks to produce highly valued chemicals. Finally, the challenges and prospects in the field are presented. This review aims at facilitating further development of PEC technology for upgrading several renewable precursors to value&#8208;added products and other pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Roadmap for Clinical Translation of Mobile Microrobotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinical use of medical microrobots gets closer to reality with the rapidly growing biomedical research on them. However, the clinical translation of microrobots has several challenges and obstacles, including scalability, biocompatibility, and imaging. In this review article, a realistic roadmap for medical microrobots is conceptualized with the collaborative efforts of microrobot researchers and&#160;clinicians.








Abstract
Medical microrobotics is an emerging field to revolutionize clinical applications in diagnostics and therapeutics of various diseases. On the other hand, the mobile microrobotics field has important obstacles to pass before clinical translation. This article focuses on these challenges and provides a roadmap of medical microrobots to enable their clinical use. From the concept of a &#8220;magic bullet&#8221; to the physicochemical interactions of microrobots in complex biological environments in medical applications, there are several translational steps to consider. Clinical translation of mobile microrobots is only possible with a close collaboration between clinical experts and microrobotics researchers to address the technical challenges in microfabrication, safety, and imaging. The clinical application potential can be materialized by designing microrobots that can solve the current main challenges, such as actuation limitations, material stability, and imaging constraints. The strengths and weaknesses of the current progress in the microrobotics field are discussed and a roadmap for their clinical applications in the near future is&#160;outlined.

         <title>Synergistic Interaction between Metal Single&#8208;Atoms and Defective WO3&#8722;x Nanosheets for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of a strong synergistic effect between metal single&#8208;atoms and oxygen vacancies of WO3&#8722;x nanosheets can effectively boost the sonodyanimc therapy performance under ultrasound irradiation, thus realizing highly efficient cancer treatment.








Abstract
Although metal single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;based nanomaterials are explored as sonosensitizers for sonodynamic therapy (SDT), they normally exhibit poor activities and need to combine with other therapeutic strategies. Herein, the deposition of metal SAs on oxygen vacancy (OV)&#8208;rich WO3&#8722;x nanosheets to generate a synergistic effect for efficient SDT is reported. Crystalline WO3 and OV&#8208;rich WO3&#8722;x nanosheets are first prepared by simple calcination of the WO3&#183;H2O nanosheets under an air and N2 atmosphere, respectively. Pt, Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni metal SAs are then deposited on WO3&#8722;x nanosheets to obtain metal SA&#8208;decorated WO3&#8722;x nanocomposites (M&#8208;WO3&#8722;x). Importantly, the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x sonosensitizer exhibits a much higher activity for ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced production of reactive oxygen species than that of the WO3&#8722;x and Cu SA&#8208;decorated WO3, which is also higher than other M&#8208;WO3&#8722;x nanosheets. Both the experimental and theoretical results suggest that the excellent SDT performance of the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x nanosheets should be attributed to the synergistic effect between Cu SAs and WO3&#8722;x OVs. Therefore, after polyethylene glycol modification, the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x can quickly kill cancer cells in vitro and effectively eradicate tumors in vivo under US irradiation. Transcriptome sequencing analysis and further molecular validation suggest that the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x&#8208;mediated SDT&#8208;activated apoptosis and TNF signaling pathways are potential drivers of tumor apoptosis induction.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Nanoribbons and Their Heterostructures via Assembly of Mass&#8208;Selected Inorganic Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottom&#8208;up fabrication of materials inaccessible by conventional thermal sublimation techniques is demonstrated. Mass&#8208;selected ionic building blocks generated by electrospray ionization are soft&#8208;landed at a substrate, generating nanostructures that are subsequently examined by electron microscopy. As the first example, MoS and WS ions are used to show fabrication of micrometer&#8208;long and nanometer&#8208;wide MoS2 and WS2 nanoribbons and their heterostructures on graphene.








Abstract
Control of nanomaterial dimensions with atomic precision through synthetic methods is essential to understanding and engineering of nanomaterials. For single&#8208;layer inorganic materials, size and shape controls have been achieved by self&#8208;assembly and surface&#8208;catalyzed reactions of building blocks deposited at a surface. However, the scope of nanostructures accessible by such approach is restricted by the limited choice of building blocks that can be thermally evaporated onto surfaces, such as atoms or thermostable molecules. Herein this limitation is bypassed by using mass&#8208;selected molecular ions obtained via electrospray ionization as building blocks to synthesize nanostructures that are inaccessible by conventional evaporation methods. As the first example, micron&#8208;scale production of MoS2 and WS2 nanoribbons and their heterostructures on graphene are shown by the self&#8208;assembly of asymmetrically shaped building blocks obtained from the electrospray. It is expected that judicious use of electrospray&#8208;generated building blocks would unlock access to previously inaccessible inorganic nanostructures.

         <title>In&#8208;Operando Spatiotemporal Imaging of Coupled Film&#8208;Substrate Elastodynamics During an Insulator&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Transition</title>

Abstract
The drive towards non&#8208;von Neumann device architectures has led to an intense focus on insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal (IMT) and the converse (MIT) transitions. Studies of electric field&#8208;driven IMT in the prototypical VO2 thin&#8208;film channel devices are largely focused on the electrical and elastic responses of the films, but the response of the corresponding TiO2 substrate is often overlooked since it is nominally expected to be electrically passive and elastically rigid. Here, in&#8208;operando spatiotemporal imaging of the coupled elastodynamics using x&#8208;ray diffraction microscopy of a VO2 film channel device on TiO2 substrate reveals two new surprises. First, the film channel bulges during the IMT, the opposite of the expected shrinking in the film undergoing IMT. Secondly, a microns thick proximal layer in the substrate also coherently bulges accompanying the IMT in the film, which is completely unexpected. Phase&#8208;field simulations of coupled IMT, oxygen vacancy electronic dynamics, and electronic carrier diffusion incorporating thermal and strain effects suggest that the observed elastodynamics can be explained by the known naturally occurring oxygen vacancies that rapidly ionize (and deionize) in concert with the IMT (MIT). Fast electrical&#8208;triggering of the IMT via ionizing defects and an active &#8220;IMT&#8208;like&#8221; substrate layer are critical aspects to consider in device applications.

         <title>Orbital Occupancy Modulation to Optimize Intermediate Absorption for Efficient Electrocatalysts in Water Electrolysis and Zinc&#8208;Ethanol&#8208;Air Battery</title>

Abstract
Spin engineering is a promising way to modulate the interaction between the transition metal d&#8208;orbital and the reaction intermediates and thus enhance the catalytic kinetics. Herein, we report an innovative strategy to modulate the spin state of Co by regulating its coordinating environment. We first prepared o&#8208;c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;Ni as pre&#8208;catalyst, then in situ EIS and in situ Raman spectroscopy were employed to prove phase transition, and CoOOH/Co3O4 was formed on the surface as active sites. In hybrid water electrolysis, the voltage has a negative shift, and in zinc&#8211;ethanol&#8211;air battery, the charging voltage was lowered and the cycling stability was greatly increased. Coordinated atom substitution and crystalline symmetry change were combined to regulate the absorption ability of reaction intermediates with balanced optimal adsorption. Coordinated atom substitution weakens the adsorption while the crystalline symmetry change strengthens the adsorption. Importantly, the tetrahedral sites were introduced by Ni doping which enables the co&#8208;existence of four&#8208;coordinated sites and six&#8208;coordination sites in o&#8208;c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;Ni. The dz2 + dx2&#8208;y2 orbital occupancy decreased after the atomic substitution, while increased after replacing the CoSe6&#8208;Oh field with CoSe6&#8208;Oh/CoSe4&#8208;Td caused by the Ni doping. This work explored a new direction for the preparation of efficient catalysts for water electrolysis and innovative zinc&#8211;ethanol&#8211;air battery.

         <title>General Design Concept of High&#8208;Performance Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Catalysts for H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a green oxidizing agent is widely used in various fields. Electrosynthesis of H2O2 has gradually become a hotspot due to its convenient and environmentally friendly features. Single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) with uniform active sites are the ideal catalyst for the in&#8208;depth study of the reaction mechanism and structure&#8208;performance relationship. In this review, we summarize the outstanding achievements of SASCs in the electrosynthesis of H2O2 through 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and 2e&#8722; water oxygen reaction (WOR) in recent years. Firstly, the elementary steps of the two pathways and the roles of key intermediates (*OOH and *OH) in the reactions are systematically discussed. Next, the influence of the size effect, electronic structure regulation, the support/interfacial effect, the optimization of coordination microenvironments, and the SASCs&#8208;derived catalysts applied in 2e&#8722; ORR are systematically analyzed. Besides, the developments of SASCs in 2e&#8722; WOR are also overviewed. Finally, the research progress of H2O2 electrosynthesis on SASCs is concluded, and an outlook on the rational design of SASCs is presented in conjunction with the design strategies and characterization techniques.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a green oxidizing agent is widely used in various fields. Electrosynthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has gradually become a hotspot due to its convenient and environmentally friendly features. Single-atom-site catalysts (SASCs) with uniform active sites are the ideal catalyst for the in-depth study of the reaction mechanism and structure-performance relationship. In this review, we summarize the outstanding achievements of SASCs in the electrosynthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; water oxygen reaction (WOR) in recent years.

         <title>The LiV3O8 Superlattice Cathode with Optimized Zinc Ion Insertion Chemistry for High Mass&#8208;Loading Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Resolving the sluggish transport kinetics of divalent Zn2+ in the cathode lattice and improving mass&#8208;loading performance are crucial for advancing the zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) application. Herein, PEO&#8208;LiV3O8 superlattice nanosheets (PEO&#8208;LVO) with expanded interlayer spacing (1.16&#160;nm) were fabricated to provide a high&#8208;rate, stable lifetime, and large mass&#8208;loading cathode. The steady in&#8208;plane expansion without shrinkage after the first cycle, but reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion in PEO&#8208;LVO were demonstrated by operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex&#8208;situ characterizations. Moreover, the large capacity of PEO&#8208;LVO was traced back to the optimized Zn2+ insertion chemistry with increased Zn2+ storage ratio, which is facilitated by the interlayer PEO in lowering the Zn2+ diffusion barrier and increased number of active sites from additional interfaces, as anticipated by density functional theory. Due to the optimized ion insertion resulting in stalled interfacial byproducts and rapid kinetics, PEO&#8208;LVO achieves excellent high mass&#8208;loading performance (areal capacity up to 6.18 mAh cm&#8722;2 for freestanding electrode with 24&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 mass&#8208;loading and 2.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 130&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for conventional electrode with 27&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 mass&#8208;loading). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber&#8208;shaped AZIBs with high mass&#8208;loading woven into a fabric can power an electronic watch, highlighting the application potential of PEO&#8208;LVO cathode.

         <title>Nanofluid&#8208;Guided Janus Membrane for High&#8208;Efficiency Electricity Generation from Water Evaporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanoconfined ionic liquids&#8208;guided evaporation power generator achieves high&#8208;efficiency performance with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.63&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current of 140&#160;&#181;A, and an ultra&#8208;high continuous operating time of 180 h, providing a new strategy for clean power generation technologies.








Abstract
Harvesting electricity from widespread water evaporation provides an alternative route to cleaner power generation technology. However, current evaporation power generation (EPG) mainly depends on the dissociation process of certain functional groups (e.g., SO3H) in water, which suffers from low power density and short&#8208;term output. Herein, the Janus membrane is prepared by combining nanofluid and water&#8208;grabbing material for EPG, where the nanoconfined ionic liquids (NCILs) serve as ion sources instead of the functional groups. Benefiting from the selective and fast transport of anions in NCILs, such EPG demonstrates excellent power performance with a voltage of 0.63&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current of 140&#160;&#181;A, and a maximum power density of 16.55 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 while operating for at least 180 h consistently. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and surface potential analysis reveal the molecular mechanism, that is, the diffusion of Cl&#8722; anions during evaporation is much faster than that of cations, generating the voltage and current across the membrane. Furthermore, the device performs well in varying environmental conditions, including different water temperatures and sources of evaporating water, showcasing its adaptability and integrability. Overall, the nanofluid&#8208;guided Janus membrane can efficiently transform low&#8208;grade thermal energy in evaporation into electricity, showing a competitive advantage over other sustainable applied approaches.

         <title>Spatial Structure Design of Thioether&#8208;Linked Naphthoquinone Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The naphthoquinone derivative isomers with nonplanar and partially conjugated structures have been designed to guarantee high structure stability and redox unit independence, realizing the construction of Zn&#8208;organic batteries with high achievable capacity, stable cycling performance, and ultrarapid rate capability.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials (OEMs) have gathered extensive attention for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their structural diversity and molecular designability. However, the reported research mainly focuses on the design of the planar configuration of OEMs and does not take into account the important influence of the spatial structure on the electrochemical properties, which seriously hamper the further performance liberation of OEMs. Herein, this work has designed a series of thioether&#8208;linked naphthoquinone&#8208;derived isomers with tunable spatial structures and applied them as the cathodes in AZIBs. The incomplete conjugated structure of the elaborately engineered isomers can guarantee the independence of the redox reaction of active groups, which contributes to the full utilization of active sites and high redox reversibility. In addition, the position isomerization of naphthoquinones on the benzene rings changes the zincophilic activity and redox kinetics of the isomers, signifying the importance of spatial structure on the electrochemical performance. As a result, the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylenedithio) bis(1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone) (p&#8208;PNQ) with the smallest steric hindrance and the most independent redox of active sites exhibits a high specific capacity (279 mAh g&#8722;1), an outstanding rate capability (167 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1), and a long&#8208;term cycling lifetime (over 2800&#160;h at 0.05 A g&#8722;1).

Herein, the first systematic and comprehensive review of the development of engineered bacteria in cancer, is provided; and the unique advantages of combining bacteria as anticancer agents with nanomedicines are discussed. This review focuses on the role of bacteria in cancer therapy, integration strategy of bacteria and nanotherapeutic drugs, synergistic mechanism of bacteria and nanomedicines, and bacteria&#8208;synergized multimodal cancer therapy.








Abstract
Engineered bacteria are widely used in cancer treatment because live facultative/obligate anaerobes can selectively proliferate at tumor sites and reach hypoxic regions, thereby causing nutritional competition, enhancing immune responses, and producing anticancer microbial agents in situ to suppress tumor growth. Despite the unique advantages of bacteria&#8208;based cancer biotherapy, the insufficient treatment efficiency limits its application in the complete ablation of malignant tumors. The combination of nanomedicine and engineered bacteria has attracted increasing attention owing to their striking synergistic effects in cancer treatment. Engineered bacteria that function as natural vehicles can effectively deliver nanomedicines to tumor sites. Moreover, bacteria provide an opportunity to enhance nanomedicines by modulating the TME and producing substrates to support nanomedicine&#8208;mediated anticancer reactions. Nanomedicine exhibits excellent optical, magnetic, acoustic, and catalytic properties, and plays an important role in promoting bacteria&#8208;mediated biotherapies. The synergistic anticancer effects of engineered bacteria and nanomedicines in cancer therapy are comprehensively summarized in this review. Attention is paid not only to the fabrication of nanobiohybrid composites, but also to the interpromotion mechanism between engineered bacteria and nanomedicine in cancer therapy. Additionally, recent advances in engineered bacteria&#8208;synergized multimodal cancer therapies are highlighted.

         <title>RhNi Bimetallenes with Lattice&#8208;Compressed Rh Skin towards Ultrastable Acidic Nitrate Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RhNi bimetallenes with a Rh&#8208;skin&#8208;type structure (RhNi@Rh BMLs) can inhibit NO2*/NH2* adsorption&#8208;induced Rh dissolution, contributing to the exceptional electrocatalytic durability for over 400 h towards acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction, which also reveals an excellent catalytic performance, including a high NH3 yield (13.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1) and a commendable NH3 Faradaic efficiency (98.4%).








Abstract
Harvesting recyclable ammonia (NH3) from acidic nitrate (NO3&#8722;)&#8208;containing wastewater requires the utilization of corrosion&#8208;resistant electrocatalytic materials with high activity and selectivity towards acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3ER). Herein, ultrathin RhNi bimetallenes with Rh&#8208;skin&#8208;type structure (RhNi@Rh BMLs) are fabricated towards acidic NO3ER. The Rh&#8208;skin atoms on the surface of RhNi@Rh BMLs experience the lattice compression&#8208;induced strain effect, resulting in shortened Rh&#8211;Rh bond and downshifted d&#8208;band center. Experimental and theoretical calculation results corroborate that Rh&#8208;skin atoms can inhibit NO2*/NH2* adsorption&#8208;induced Rh dissolution, contributing to the exceptional electrocatalytic durability of RhNi@Rh BMLs (over 400 h) towards acidic NO3ER. RhNi@Rh BMLs also reveal an excellent catalytic performance, boasting a 98.4% NH3 Faradaic efficiency and a 13.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 NH3 yield. Theoretical calculations reveal that compressive stress tunes the electronic structure of Rh skin atoms, which facilitates the reduction of NO* to NOH* in NO3ER. The practicality of RhNi@Rh BMLs has also been confirmed in an alkaline&#8208;acidic hybrid zinc&#8208;nitrate battery with a 1.39&#160;V open circuit voltage and a 10.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 power density. This work offers valuable insights into the nature of electrocatalyst deactivation behavior and guides the development of high&#8208;efficiency corrosion&#8208;resistant electrocatalysts for applications in energy and environment.

         <title>Switchable Anisotropic/Isotropic Photon Transport in a Double&#8208;Dipole Metal&#8211;Organic Framework via Radical&#8208;Controlled Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ switchable anisotropic/isotropic photon transport behavior is first achieved in a double&#8208;dipole metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), which exhibit tunable output on both polarization (isotropy/anisotropy state) and wavelength information (blue/red&#8208;color emission) triggered by the radical&#8208;controlled energy transfer. These results offer a novel strategy for developing MOF&#8208;based photonic devices with tunable anisotropic performance.








Abstract
Directional control of photon transport at micro/nanoscale holds great potential in developing multifunctional optoelectronic devices. Here, the switchable anisotropic/isotropic photon transport is reported in a double&#8208;dipole metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) based on radical&#8208;controlled energy transfer. Double&#8208;dipole MOF microcrystals with transition dipole moments perpendicular to each other have been achieved by the pillared&#8208;layer coordination strategy. The energy transfer between the double dipolar chromophores can be modulated by the photogenerated radicals, which permits the in situ switchable output on both polarization (isotropy/anisotropy state) and wavelength information (blue/red&#8208;color emission). On this basis, the original MOF microcrystal with isotropic polarization state displays the isotropic photon transport and similar reabsorption losses at various directions, while the radical&#8208;affected MOF microcrystal with anisotropic polarization state shows the anisotropic photon transport with distinct reabsorption losses at different directions, finally leading to the in situ switchable anisotropic/isotropic photon transport. These results offer a novel strategy for the development of MOF&#8208;based photonic devices with tunable anisotropic performance.

Abstract
High&#8208;entropy (HE) materials, celebrated for their extraordinary chemical and physical properties, have garnered increasing attention for their broad applications across diverse disciplines. The expansive compositional range of these materials allows for nuanced tuning of their properties and innovative structural designs. Recent advances have been centered on their versatile photothermal conversion capabilities, effective across the full solar spectrum (300&#8208;2500&#160;nm). The HE effect, coupled with hysteresis diffusion, imparts these materials with desirable thermal and chemical stability. These attributes position HE materials as a revolutionary alternative to traditional photothermal materials, signifying a transformative shift in photothermal technology. This review delivers a comprehensive summary of the current state of knowledge regarding HE photothermal materials, emphasizing the intricate relationship between their compositions, structures, light&#8208;absorbing mechanisms, and optical properties. Furthermore, the review outlines the notable advances in HE photothermal materials, emphasizing their contributions to areas such as solar water evaporation, personal thermal management, solar thermoelectric generation, catalysis, and biomedical applications. The review culminates in presenting a roadmap that outlines prospective directions for future research in this burgeoning field, and also outlines fruitful ways to develop advanced HE photothermal materials and to expand their promising applications.

         <title>570 Wh/kg&#8208;grade Lithium Metal Pouch Cell with 4.9V Highly Li+ Conductive Armor&#8208;like Cathode Electrolyte Interphase via Partially Fluorinated Electrolyte Engineering</title>

Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based layered oxides (LRMOs) are promisingly used in high&#8208;energy lithium metal pouch cells due to high specific capacity/working voltage. However, the interfacial stability of LRMOs remains challenging. To address this question, we proposed a novel armor&#8208;like cathode electrolyte interphase model for stabilizing LRMO cathode at 4.9&#160;V by exploring partially fluorinated electrolyte formulation. The fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and tris (trimethylsilyl) borate (TMSB) in formulated electrolyte largely contributed to the formation of 4.9&#160;V armor&#8208;like cathode electrolyte interphase with LiBxOy and LixPOyFz outer layer and LiF&#8208; and Li3PO4&#8208;rich inner part. Such CEI effectively inhibited lattice oxygen loss and facilitated the Li+ migration smoothly for guaranteeing LRMO cathode to deliver superior cycling and rate performance. As expected, Li||LRMO batteries with such electrolyte achieved a capacity retention of 85.7% with a high average Coulomb efficiency (CE) of 99.64% after 300 cycles at 4.8&#160;V/0.5 C, and even obtained a capacity retention of 87.4% after 100 cycles at higher cut&#8208;off voltge of 4.9&#160;V. Meanwhile, the 9 Ah&#8208;class Li||LRMO pouch cells with formulated electrolyte showed over 38 stable cycling life with a high energy density of 576&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 4.8&#160;V.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Photosensitizer Synergy Empowers Ambient Light Photoactivation of Indium Oxide for High&#8208;performance NO2 Sensing</title>

Abstract
Light&#8208;activated chemiresistors offer a powerful approach to achieving lower&#8208;temperature gas sensing with unprecedented sensitivities. However, an incomplete understanding of how photoexcited charge carriers enhance sensitivity obstructs the rational design of high&#8208;performance sensors, impeding the practical utilization under commonly accessible light sources instead of UV or higher&#8208;energy sources. Here, we present a rational approach to modulate the electronic properties of the parent metal oxide phase, exemplified by our model system of Bi&#8208;doped In2O3 nanofibers decorated with Au nanoparticles that exhibit superior NO2 sensing performance. Bi doping introduces mid&#8208;gap energy levels into In2O3, promoting photoactivation even under visible blue light. Additionally, green&#8208;absorbing plasmonic Au nanoparticles facilitate electron transfer across the heterojunction, extending the photoactive region towards green light. We reveal that the direct involvement of photogenerated charge carriers in gas adsorption and desorption processes is pivotal for enhancing gas sensing performance. Owing to the synergistic interplay between the Bi dopants and the Au nanoparticles, the Au&#8208;BixIn2&#8208;xO3 (x = 0.04) sensing layers attain impressive response values (Rg/Ra = 104 at 0.6&#160;ppm NO2) under green light illumination and demonstrate practical viability through evaluation under simulated mixed&#8208;light conditions, all of which significantly outperforms previously reported visible light activated NO2 sensors.

         <title>Liquid Metal Loaded Molecular Sieve: Specialized Lithium Dendrite Blocking Filler for Polymeric Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal and molecular sieve modified polyethylene oxide electrolyte is prepared to address the safety issue and poor Li+ conductivity of polymeric all&#8208;solid&#8211;state electrolyte for lithium&#8211;metal batteries. This functionalized polymer electrolyte could regulate the lithium deposition morphology at the interface, while the liquid metal distributed in the electrolyte could block the penetration of lithium dendrites. 








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8211;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are currently one of the best candidates for realizing the yearning high&#8208;energy&#8211;density batteries with high safety. However, even polyethylene oxide (PEO), the most popular polymeric solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) with the largest ionic conductivity in the category so far, has significant challenges due to the safety issues of lithium dendrites, and the insufficient ionic conductivity. Herein, molecular sieve (MS) is integrated into the PEO as an inert filler with the liquid metal (LM) as a functional module, forming an &#8220;LM&#8208;MS&#8208;PEO&#8221; composite as both SSE with enhanced ionic conductivity, and protection layer against lithium dendrites. As demonstrated by theoretical and experimental investigations, LM released from MS can be uniformly and efficiently distributed in PEO, which could avoid agglomeration, enable the effective blocking of lithium dendrites, and regulate the mass transport of Li ions, thus achieving even deposition of lithium during charge/discharge. Moreover, MS could reduce the crystallinity of PEO, improve lithium&#8208;ion conductivity, and reduce operating temperature. Benefiting from the introduction of the functional MS/LM, the LM&#8208;MS&#8208;PEO electrolyte exhibits fourfold higher lithium ionic conductivity than the pristine PEO at 40&#160;&#176;C, while the as&#8208;assembled all&#8208;solid&#8211;state LMBs have four to five times longer stable cycle life.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Induced Amorphization of Cobalt&#8208;Based Catalyst for Boosted CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;deficient Se&#8208;doped cobalt hydroxide with optimized band structure and catalytic energetics is&#160;theoretically proposed and successfully prepared in an amorphous state. The Se,O co&#8208;coordinated Co&#8208;based amorphous nanosheets are capable of photocatalyzing CO2 to CO with satisfactory activity and selectivity, superior to other Co&#8208;based catalysts.








Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to energy carriers is intriguing in the industry but kinetically hard to fulfil due to the lack of rationally designed catalysts. A promising way to improve the efficiency and selectivity of such reduction is to break the structural symmetry of catalysts by manipulating coordination. Here, inspired by analogous CoO6 and CoSe6 octahedral structural motifs of the Co(OH)2 and CoSe, a hetero&#8208;anionic coordination strategy is proposed to construct a symmetry&#8208;breaking photocatalyst prototype of oxygen&#8208;deficient Se&#8208;doped cobalt hydroxide upon first&#8208;principles calculations. Such involvement of large&#8208;size Se atoms in CoO6 octahedral frameworks experimentally lead to the switching of semiconductor type of cobalt hydroxide from p to n, generation of oxygen defects, and amorphization. The resultant oxygen&#8208;deficient Se,O&#8208;coordinated Co&#8208;based amorphous nanosheets exhibit impressive photocatalytic performance of CO2 to CO with a generation rate of 60.7&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the absence of photosensitizer and scavenger, superior to most of the Co&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work establishes a correlation between the symmetry&#8208;breaking of catalytic sites and CO2 photoreduction performances, opening up a new paradigm in the design of amorphous photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light Emitting Metal Halides: Materials, Mechanisms, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An updated overview of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting metal halides, an emerging class of optical materials, is reported. The report is not restricted to cases with perovskite structure only. The various possible mechanisms of light emission, the advances in synthesis (covering both bulk and confined morphologies), and the various applications are discussed and an outlook for the field is provided.








Abstract
Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) light emitting metal halides are emerging as a new generation of optical materials owing to their appealing features, which include low&#8208;cost synthesis, solution processability, and adjustable optical properties. NIR&#8208;emitting perovskite&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) have reached an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 20% and a device stability of over 10,000 h. Such results have sparked an interest in exploring new NIR metal halide emitters. In this review, several different types of NIR&#8208;emitting metal halides, including lead/tin bromide/iodide perovskites, lanthanide ions doped/based metal halides, double perovskites, low dimensional hybrid and Bi3+/Sb3+/Cr3+ doped metal halides, are summarized, and their recent advancement is assessed. The characteristics and mechanisms of narrow&#8208;band or broadband NIR luminescence in all these materials are discussed in detail. Also, the various applications of NIR&#8208;emitting metal halides are highlighted and an outlook for the field is provided.

         <title>Asymmetric Electron Redistribution in Niobic&#8208;Oxygen Vacancy Associates to Tune Non&#8208;Covalent Interaction in CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The role of vacancy associates in photocatalytic CO2 reduction is an open question. Herein, the Nb&#8208;O vacancy associates (VNb&#8208;O) are engineered into niobic acid (NA) atomic layers to tailor the CO2 photoreduction performance. The intrinsic charge compensation from O to Nb around Nb&#8208;O vacancy associates could manipulate the active electronic states, leading to the asymmetric electron redistribution. This local symmetry breaking sites will show a charge density gradient, forming a localized polarization field to polarize non&#8208;polar CO2 molecules and tune the non&#8208;covalent interaction of reaction intermediates. This unique configuration contributed to the 9.3 times increased activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Meantime, this VNb&#8208;O NA also show excellent photocatalytic activity for NO3&#8722;&#8208;NH4+ synthesis, with NH4+ formation rate up to 3442&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This work supplies fresh insights into the vacancy associates design for electron redistribution and non&#8208;covalent interaction tuning in photocatalysis.

         <title>Topological Spin Textures in an Insulating van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of a skyrmion lattice in van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr3 opens pathways for exploration of topological spin textures in 2D insulating crystals. These skyrmions manifest in unusual crystalline environment characterized by centrosymmetric crystal structure and are stabilized through dipolar rather than Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions. The construction of B&#8208;T phase diagram enables versatile phase&#8208;switching mechanisms for controlling magnetization textures.








Abstract
Generation and control of topological spin textures constitutes one of the most exciting challenges of modern spintronics given their potential applications in information storage technologies. Of particular interest are magnetic insulators, which due to low damping, absence of Joule heating and reduced dissipation can provide energy&#8208;efficient spin&#8208;textures platform. Here, it is demonstrated that the interplay between sample thickness, external magnetic fields, and optical excitations can generate a prolific paramount of spin textures, and their coexistence in insulating CrBr3 van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets. Using high&#8208;resolution magnetic force microscopy and large&#8208;scale micromagnetic simulation methods, the existence of a large region in T&#8208;B phase diagram is demonstrated where different stripe domains, skyrmion crystals, and magnetic domains exist and can be intrinsically selected or transformed to each&#8208;other via a phase&#8208;switch mechanism. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy unveils the mixed chirality of the magnetic textures that are of Bloch&#8208;type at given conditions but can be further manipulated into N&#233;el&#8208;type or hybrid&#8208;type via thickness&#8208;engineering. The topological phase transformation between the different magnetic objects can be further inspected by standard photoluminescence optical probes resolved by circular polarization indicative of an existence of exciton&#8208;skyrmion coupling mechanism. The findings identify vdW magnetic insulators as a promising framework of materials for the manipulation and generation of highly ordered skyrmion lattices relevant for device integration at the atomic level.

         <title>Controlled Refolding of Denatured IL&#8208;12 Using In Situ Antigen&#8208;Capturing Nanochaperone Remarkably Reduces the Systemic Toxicity and Enhances Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled nanochaperone (P&#8208;nChap) is designed as in situ antigen capturing nanovaccine to enhance cytokine&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. P&#8208;nChap effectively avoids on&#8208;target, off&#8208;tumor toxicity of IL&#8208;12 by delivering its denatured form, which can be only refolded into native states in response to tumor microenvironment. Moreover, P&#8208;nChap releases PTX to produce ICD, captures TAAs and transports to DCs to facilitate antigen cross&#8208;presentation.








Abstract
Cytokines are powerful in cancer immunotherapy, however, their therapeutic potential is limited by the severe systemic toxicity. Here a potent strategy to reduce the toxicity of systemic cytokine therapy by delivering its denatured form using a finely designed nanochaperone, is described. It is demonstrated that even if the denatured protein cargos are occasionally released under normal physiological conditions they are still misfolded, while can effectively refold into native states and release to function in tumor microenvironment. Consequently, the systemic toxicity of cytokines is nearly completely overcome. Moreover, an immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing chemotherapeutic is further loaded and delivered to tumor using this nanochaperone to trigger the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) that are subsequently captured in situ by nanochaperone and then reflows into lymph nodes (LNs) to promote antigen cross&#8208;presentation. This optimized personalized nanochaperone&#8208;vaccine demonstrates unprecedented suppressive effects against large, advanced tumors, and in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy results in a significant abscopal effect and inhibition of postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis. Hence, this approach provides a simple and universal delivery strategy to reduce the systemic toxicities of cytokines, as well as provides a robust personalized cancer vaccination platform, which may find wide applications in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Enhanced Chemoradiotherapy for MRSA&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis Using Immunomodulatory Polymer&#8208;Reinforced Nanotherapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanoradiosensitizer with improved light penetration depth for enhanced chemoradiotherapy effect to reverse immunosuppression in the biofilm&#8208;caused poorly innate immunity area and to eliminate MRSA&#8208;infected deep&#8208;tissue infections. The polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutics in the rat osteomyelitis model verify that chemoradiotherapy expresses an excellent modality for deep&#8208;tissue infection management and a promising immunomodulatory treatment to enhance the therapeutic effects of bacterial infections.








Abstract
The eradication of osteomyelitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a significant challenge due to its development of biofilm&#8208;induced antibiotic resistance and impaired innate immunity, which often leads to frequent surgical failure. Here, the design, synthesis, and performance of X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutics that modulate the immunological properties of infectious microenvironments to enhance chemoradiotherapy against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial deep&#8208;tissue infections are reported. Upon X&#8208;ray radiation, the proposed polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutic generates reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. To robustly eradicate MRSA biofilms at deep infection sites, these species can specifically bind to MRSA and penetrate biofilms for enhanced chemoradiotherapy treatment. X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated nanotherapeutics modulate the innate immunity of macrophages to prevent the recurrence of osteomyelitis. The remarkable anti&#8208;infection effects of these nanotherapeutics are validated using a rat osteomyelitis model. This study demonstrates the significant potential of a synergistic chemoradiotherapy and immunotherapy method for treating MRSA biofilm&#8208;infected osteomyelitis.

         <title>Suppressing Halide Segregation via Pyridine&#8208;Derivative Isomers Enables Efficient 1.68 eV Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of a series of pyridine&#8208;derivative isomers containing both amino and carboxyl on the quality and stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite are studied. The isomer with uniform functional group distribution delivers the best performance. A certified cell efficiency of 22.17% is obtained using the 1.68 eV perovskite, which is one of the highest values in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Light&#8208;induced phase segregation is one of the main issues restricting the efficiency and stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG PSCs). Small organic molecules with abundant functional groups can passivate various defects, and therefore suppress the ionic migration channels for phase segregation. Herein, a series of pyridine&#8208;derivative isomers containing amino and carboxyl are applied to modify the perovskite surface. The amino, carboxyl, and N&#8208;terminal of pyridine in all of these molecules can interact with undercoordinated Pb2+ through coordination bonds and suppress halide ions migration via hydrogen bonding. Among them, the 5&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;pyridine carboxyl acid (APA&#8208;3) treated devices win the champion performance, enabling an efficiency of 22.35% (certified 22.17%) using the 1.68 eV perovskite, which represents one of the highest values for WBG&#8208;PSCs. This is believed to be due to the more symmetric spatial distribution of the three functional groups of APA&#8208;3, which provides a better passivation effect independent of the molecular arrangement orientation. Therefore, the APA&#8208;3 passivated perovskite shows the slightest halide segregation, the lowest defect density, and the least nonradiative recombination. Moreover, the APA&#8208;3 passivated device retains 90% of the initial efficiency after 985 h of operation at the maximum power point, representing the robust durability of WBG&#8208;PSCs under working conditions.

         <title>Extreme Thermal Insulation and Tradeoff of Thermal Transport Mechanisms between Graphene and WS2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective thermal conductivity across WS2/graphene bilayer versus interlayer distance is measured experimentally up to distance of 2.69 nm and extended to larger scale through simulation. It is demonstrated that the trade&#8208;off between phonon&#8208; and air&#8208;conduction mechanisms leads to an existence of a minimum conductivity of 1.41 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 2.11 nm, or two thousandths of the smallest value reported previously.








Abstract
Controlling and understanding the heat flow at a nanometer scale are challenging, but important for fundamental science and applications. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials provide perhaps the ultimate solution for meeting these challenges. While there have been reports of low thermal conductivities (several mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) across the 2D heterostructures, phonon&#8208;dominant thermal transport remains strong due to the nearly&#8208;ideal contact between the layers. Here, this work experimentally explores the heat transport mechanisms by increasing the interlayer distance from perfect contact to a few nanometers and demonstrates that the phonon&#8208;dominated thermal conductivity across the WS2/graphene interface decreases further with the increasing interlayer distance until the air&#8208;dominated thermal conductivity increases again. This work finds that the resulting tradeoff of the two heat conduction mechanisms leads to the existence of a minimum thermal conductivity at 2.11&#160;nm of 1.41&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, which is two thousandths of the smallest value reported previously. This work provides an effective methodology for engineering thermal insulation structures and understanding heat transport at the ultimate small scales.

&lt;p&gt;Effective thermal conductivity across WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/graphene bilayer versus interlayer distance is measured experimentally up to distance of 2.69 nm and extended to larger scale through simulation. It is demonstrated that the trade-off between phonon- and air-conduction mechanisms leads to an existence of a minimum conductivity of 1.41 &#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;5&lt;/sup&gt; W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2.11 nm, or two thousandths of the smallest value reported previously.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling and understanding the heat flow at a nanometer scale are challenging, but important for fundamental science and applications. Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials provide perhaps the ultimate solution for meeting these challenges. While there have been reports of low thermal conductivities (several mW m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) across the 2D heterostructures, phonon-dominant thermal transport remains strong due to the nearly-ideal contact between the layers. Here, this work experimentally explores the heat transport mechanisms by increasing the interlayer distance from perfect contact to a few nanometers and demonstrates that the phonon-dominated thermal conductivity across the WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/graphene interface decreases further with the increasing interlayer distance until the air-dominated thermal conductivity increases again. This work finds that the resulting tradeoff of the two heat conduction mechanisms leads to the existence of a minimum thermal conductivity at 2.11&#160;nm of 1.41&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is two thousandths of the smallest value reported previously.

         <title>A Cu3BHT&#8208;Graphene van der Waals Heterostructure with Strong Interlayer Coupling for Highly Efficient Photoinduced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer Cu3BHT with large&#8208;scale uniformity and atomic flatness is synthesized using on&#8208;water surface chemistry, which enables the assembly of novel two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructure with strong interlayer coupling upon combining with graphene. Employing time&#8208;resolved THz spectroscopy, highly efficient photoinduced net electron transfer from Cu3BHT to graphene with record high efficiency of up to 34% is demonstrated.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (2D vdWhs) are of significant interest due to their intriguing physical properties critically defined by the constituent monolayers and their interlayer coupling. Synthetic access to 2D vdWhs based on chemically tunable monolayer organic 2D materials remains challenging. Herein, the fabrication of a novel organic&#8211;inorganic bilayer vdWh by combining &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2D coordination polymer (2DCP, i.e., Cu3BHT, BHT = benzenehexathiol) with graphene is reported. Monolayer Cu3BHT with detectable &#181;m2&#8208;scale uniformity and atomic flatness is synthesized using on&#8208;water surface chemistry. A combination of diffraction and imaging techniques enables the determination of the crystal structure of monolayer Cu3BHT with atomic precision. Leveraging the strong interlayer coupling, Cu3BHT&#8208;graphene vdWh exhibits highly efficient photoinduced interlayer charge separation with a net electron transfer efficiency of up to 34% from Cu3BHT to graphene, superior to those of reported bilayer 2D vdWhs and molecular&#8208;graphene vdWhs. This study unveils the potential for developing novel 2DCP&#8208;based vdWhs with intriguing physical properties.

         <title>Ionic Conduction&#8208;Based Polycrystalline Oxide Gamma Ray Detection &#8211; Radiation&#8208;Ionic Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New radiation detection devices based on ionic conduction modulation at grain boundaries in solid electrolytes. This paves the way to inexpensive, sensitive, low&#8208;power, and miniaturizable solid&#8208;state devices, uniquely suited for operating in harsh environments. Opportunities for portable and/or scalable radiation detectors are created benefiting geothermal drilling, small modular reactors, nuclear security, and waste management.








Abstract
Newly discovered opto&#8208;ionic effects in metal oxides provide unique opportunities for functional ceramic applications. The authors generalize the recently demonstrated grain boundary opto&#8208;ionic effect observed in solid electrolyte thin films under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to a radiation&#8208;ionic effect that can be applied to bulk materials and used for gamma&#8208;rays (&#947;&#8208;rays) detection. Near room temperature, lightly doped Gd&#8208;doped CeO2, a polycrystalline ion conducting ceramic, exhibits a resistance ratio change &#8776;103 and reversible response in ionic current when exposed to 60Co &#947;&#8208;ray (1.1 and 1.3 MeV). This is attributed to the steady state passivation of space charge barriers at grain boundaries, that act as virtual electrodes, capturing radiation&#8208;induced electrons, in turn lowering space charge barrier heights, and thereby exclusively modulating the ionic carrier flow within the ceramic electrolytes. Such behavior allows significant electrical response under low fields, that is, &lt; 2 V cm&#8722;1, paving the way to inexpensive, sensitive, low&#8208;power, and miniaturizable solid&#8208;state devices, uniquely suited for operating in harsh (high temperature, pressure, and corrosive) environments. This discovery presents opportunities for portable and/or scalable radiation detectors benefiting geothermal drilling, small modular reactors, nuclear security, and waste management.

         <title>The Electron Migration Polarization Boosting Electromagnetic Wave Absorption Based on Ce Atoms Modulated yolk@shell FexN@NGC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe4N@NGC/CeSA+Cs+NPs system is constructed to demonstrate the electron migration mechanism, where the Ce single&#8208;atoms (SA) with +3 valence state can feed the electrons to Ce4+ of clusters (Cs) and CeO2 nanoparticles through conductive network under EMW. Such electron migration loss combined with excellent magnetic loss provided by Fe4N core, results in the optimal EMW attenuation performance.








Abstract
The electron migration polarization is considered as a promising approach to optimize electromagnetic waves (EMW) dissipation. However, it is still difficult to realize well&#8208;controlled electron migration and elucidate the related EMW loss mechanisms for current researches. Herein, a novel FexN@NGC/Ce system to construct an effective electron migration model based on the electron leaps among the 4f/5d/6s orbitals of Ce ions is explored. In Fe4N@NGC/CeSA+Cs+NPs, Ce single&#8208;atoms (SA) mainly represent a +3 valence state, which can feed the electrons to Ce4+ of clusters (Cs) and CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) through a conductive network under EMW, leading to the electron migration polarization. Such electron migration loss combined with excellent magnetic loss provided by Fe4N core, results in the optimal EMW attenuation performance with a minimum reflection loss exceeds &#8722;85.1&#160;dB and a broadened absorption bandwidth up to 7.5&#160;GHz at 1.5&#160;mm. This study clarifies the in&#8208;depth relationship between electron migration polarization and EMW dissipation, providing profound insights into developing well&#8208;coordinated magnetic&#8211;dielectric nanocomposites for EMW absorption engineering.

         <title>Single&#8208;Shot Laser&#8208;Induced Switching of an Exchange Biased Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferromagnets are an exciting class of materials due to their inherently THz dynamics and complex interactions. Here, the highlight of the work is the demonstration that it is possible to switch the coupled antiferromagnet with a single femtosecond laser pulse. The results provide a means of direct and deterministic control of an antiferromagnet on the sub&#8208;picosecond timescale.








Abstract
Ultrafast manipulation of magnetic order has challenged the understanding of the fundamental and dynamic properties of magnetic materials. So far single&#8208;shot magnetic switching has been limited to ferrimagnetic alloys, multilayers, and designed ferromagnetic (FM) heterostructures. In FM/antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayers, exchange bias (He) arises from the interfacial exchange coupling between the two layers and reflects the microscopic orientation of the antiferromagnet. Here the possibility of single&#8208;shot switching of the antiferromagnet (change of the sign and amplitude of He) with a single femtosecond laser pulse in IrMn/CoGd bilayers is demonstrated. The manipulation is demonstrated in a wide range of fluences for different layer thicknesses and compositions. Atomistic simulations predict ultrafast switching and recovery of the AFM magnetization on a timescale of 2 ps. The results provide the fastest and the most energy&#8208;efficient method to set the exchange bias and pave the way to potential applications for ultrafast spintronic devices.

         <title>Strengthening the Metal&#8211;Acid Interactions by Using CeO2 as Regulators of Precisely Placing Pt Species in ZSM&#8208;5 for Furfural Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;confined auto&#8208;redox&#8221; strategy is reported to fix CeO2&#8208;anchored Pt species on the inner wall of a ZSM&#8208;5 cage. The formation of such unique encapsulation structure greatly improves the metal&#8211;acid interactions, thereby achieving a high yield of cyclopentanone&#160;from furfural selective hydrogenation.








Abstract
Understanding the synergism between the metal site and acid site is of great significance in boosting the efficiency of bi&#8208;functional catalysts in many heterogeneous reactions, particularly in biomass upgrading. Herein, a &#8220;confined auto&#8208;redox&#8221; strategy is reported to fix CeO2&#8208;anchored Pt atoms on the inner wall of a ZSM&#8208;5 cage, achieving the target of finely controlling the placements of the two active sites. Compared with the conventional surface&#8208;supported counterpart, the encapsulated Pt/CeO2@ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst possesses remarkably&#8208;improved activity and selectivity, which can convert &gt;99% furfural into cyclopentanone with 97.2% selectivity in 6 h at 160 &#176;C. Besides the excellent catalytic performance, the ordered metal&#8211;acid distribution also makes such kind of catalyst an ideal research subject for metal&#8211;acid interactions. The following mechanization investigation reveals that the enhancement is strongly related to the unique encapsulation structure, which promotes the migration of the reactants over different active sites, thereby contributing to the tandem reaction.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Interphase with Energy Dissipation and Fast Li&#8208;Ion Transport for High&#8208;Capacity Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [an]daisy chain (DC)&#8208;based mechanically interlocked network (DCMIN) is used as the artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) for stabilizing the lithium metal anode. The synergistic contractile and large&#8208;amplitude molecular motion of the [an]DC enable the DCMIN not only an effective energy dissipation function but also a fast Li&#8208;ion transport behavior, thus realizing a stable 2800&#160;h of Li&#8208;symmetrical cycling.








Abstract
Constructing an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) on Li metal anodes (LMAs) is a potential strategy for addressing the dendrite issues. However, the mechanical fatigue of the ASEI caused by stress accumulation under the repeated deformation from the Li plating/stripping is not taken seriously. Herein, this work introduces a mechanically interlocked [an]daisy chain network (DCMIN) into the ASEI to stabilize the Li metal/ASEI interface by combining the functions of energy dissipation and fast Li&#8208;ion transport. The DCMIN featured by large&#8208;range molecular motions is cross&#8208;linked via efficient thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry; thus, the DCMIN has flexibility and excellent mechanical properties. As an ASEI, the crown ether units in DCMIN not only interact with the dialkylammonium of a flexible chain, forming the energy dissipation behavior but also coordinate with Li ion to support the fast Li&#8208;ion transport in DCMIN. Therefore, a stable 2800&#160;h&#8208;symmetrical cycling (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and an excellent 5 C&#8208;rate (full cell with LiFePO4) performance are achieved by DCMIN&#8208;based ASEI. Furthermore, the 1&#8208;Ah pouch cell (LiNi0.88Co0.09Mn0.03O2 cathode) with DCMIN&#8208;coated LMA exhibits improved capacity retention (88%) relative to the Control. The molecular design of DCMIN provides new insights into the optimization of an ASEI for high&#8208;energy LMAs.

         <title>Selective Extraction of Critical Metals from Spent Li&#8208;ion Battery Cathode: Cation&#8208;Anion Coordination and Anti&#8208;Solvent Crystallization</title>

Abstract
Because of continuing global use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in particular in electric vehicles, there is a need for sustainable recycling of spent LIBs. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been reported as &#8220;green solvents&#8221; for low&#8208;cost and sustainable recycling. However, the lack of understanding of the coordination mechanisms between DESs and transition metals (Ni, Mn and Co) and Li makes selective separation of transition metals with similar physicochemical properties practically difficult. Here, we found that the transition metals and Li have a different stable coordination structure with the different anions in DES during leaching. Furthermore, based on the different solubility of these coordination structures in anti&#8208;solvent (acetone), a leaching and separation process system is designed, which enables high selective recovery of transition metals and Li from spent cathode LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111), with recovery of acetone. We also evidence recovery of spent LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode and establish a significant selective recovery for Co and Li, together with recovery and reuse of acetone and DES. We conclude that the tuning of cation&#8208;anion coordination structure and anti&#8208;solvent crystallization are practical for selective recovery of critical metal resources in the spent LIBs recycling.

         <title>Mixing Insulating Commodity Polymers with Semiconducting n&#8208;type Polymers Enables high&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Transistors</title>

Abstract
Diluting organic semiconductors with a host insulating polymer has been used to increase the electronic mobility in organic electronic devices, such as thin film transistors, while considerably reducing material costs. In contrast to organic electronics, bioelectronic devices such as the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) rely on both electronic and ionic mobility for efficient operation, making it challenging to integrate hydrophobic polymers as the predominant blend component. Here, we show that diluting the n&#8208;type conjugated polymer p(N&#8208;T) with high molecular weight polystyrene (10&#160;KDa) leads to OECTs with over three times better &#956;C* with respect to the pristine p(N&#8208;T) (from 4.3 to 13.4 F V&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) while drastically decreasing the amount of conjugated polymer (six times less). This improvement in &#956;C* is due to a dramatic increase in electronic mobility by two orders of magnitude, from 0.059 to 1.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for p(N&#8208;T):PS10 KDa 1:6. Moreover, devices made with this polymer blend show better stability, retaining 77% of the initial drain current after 60 minutes operation in contrast to 12% for pristine p(N&#8208;T). These results open a new generation of low&#8208;cost organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors where the bulk of the film is made by a commodity polymer.

         <title>Enhancing Light Outcoupling Efficiency via Anisotropic Low Refractive Index Electron Transporting Materials for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Thanks to the extensive efforts toward optimizing perovskite crystallization properties, high&#8208;quality perovskite films with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield have been successfully achieved. However, the light outcoupling efficiency of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is impeded by insufficient light extraction, which poses a challenge to the further advancement of PeLEDs. Here, an anisotropic multifunctional electron transporting material, 9,10&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl) anthracene (BPBiPA), with a low extraordinary refractive index (ne) and high electron mobility is developed for fabricating high&#8208;efficiency PeLEDs. The anisotropic molecular orientations of BPBiPA can result in a low ne of 1.59 along the z&#8208;axis direction. Optical simulations show that the low ne of BPBiPA can effectively mitigate the surface plasmon polariton loss and enhance the photon extraction efficiency in waveguide mode, thereby improving the light outcoupling efficiency of PeLEDs. Additionally, the high electron mobility of BPBiPA can facilitate balanced carrier injection in PeLEDs. As a result, high&#8208;efficiency green PeLEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 32.1% and a current efficiency of 111.7&#160;cd A&#8722;1 are obtained, which provides new inspirations for the design of electron transporting materials for high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) and high electron mobility is developed for fabricating high-efficiency PeLEDs. The anisotropic molecular orientations of BPBiPA can result in a low &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.59 along the z-axis direction. Optical simulations show that the low &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; of BPBiPA can effectively mitigate the surface plasmon polariton loss and enhance the photon extraction efficiency in waveguide mode, thereby improving the light outcoupling efficiency of PeLEDs. Additionally, the high electron mobility of BPBiPA can facilitate balanced carrier injection in PeLEDs. As a result, high-efficiency green PeLEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 32.1% and a current efficiency of 111.7&#160;cd A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are obtained, which provides new inspirations for the design of electron transporting materials for high-performance PeLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Moir&#233; Pattern Controlled Phonon Polarizer Based on Twisted Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Atomically twisted van der Waals materials featuring Moir&#233; patterns present new design possibilities and demonstrate unconventional behaviors in electrical, optical, spintronic, and superconducting properties. However, experimental exploration of thermal transport across Moir&#233; patterns has not been as extensive, despite its critical role in nanoelectronics, thermal management, and energy conversion. Here, we conduct the first experimental investigation into thermal transport across twisted graphene, demonstrating the concept of a phonon polarizer achieved by manipulating the rotational misalignment between adjacent stacked layers. Our approach includes thorough structural characterizations and atomistic modeling of various twisted graphene configurations, along with direct measurements of thermal and acoustic transport using ultrafast spectroscopies. For the first time, we have measured a significant modulation &#8211; up to 631% &#8211; in the thermal conductance of twisted graphene by reducing phonon transmissions as a function of Moir&#233; angles, while a high acoustic transmission maintains across all twist configurations. By comparing experiments with first&#8208;principles calculations using density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, mode&#8208;dependent phonon transmission between monolayer graphene are quantified based on the angle alignment of phonon band structures. We investigate mode&#8208;specific phonon transmission and attribute the pronounced polarizing effect to the distortion over the coupling phase space especially from flexural phonon modes. The modeling results agree with experimental data, verifying the dominant tuning mechanisms in adjusting phonon transmission from high&#8208;frequency thermal modes while negligible effects on low&#8208;frequency acoustic modes near Brillouin zone center. This study offers crucial insights into the fundamental thermal transport in Moir&#233; structures, opening avenues for the invention of advanced thermal devices and new design methodologies based on manipulations of vibrational band structures and phonon spectra.

         <title>A Perspective on Uniform Plating Behavior of Mg Metal Anode: Diffusion Limited Theory versus Nucleation Theory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective points out the &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Buffer Zone&#8221; between &#8220;Kinetic&#8208;Control Region&#8221; and &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Region&#8221;, where the current density exceeds limited value, but time has not yet reached the Sand's time. In this buffer zone, dense and uniform Mg deposit layer is available, even the optimal deposit occurs in the vicinity of the boundary between &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Buffer Zone&#8221; and &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Region&#8221;.








Abstract
Utilizing metal anode is the most attractive way to meet the urgent demand for rechargeable batteries with high energy density. Unfortunately, the formation of dendrites, which is caused by uneven plating behavior, always threaten the safety of the batteries. To explore the origin of different plating behavior and predict the plating morphology of anode under a variety of operating conditions, multifarious models have been developed. However, abuse of models has led to conflictive views. In this perspective, to clarify the controversial reports on magnesium (Mg) metal plating behavior, the previously proposed models are elaborated that govern the plating process. Through linking various models and clarifying their boundary conditions, a scheme is drawn to illustrate the strategy for achieving the most dense and uniform plating morphology, which also explains the seemingly contradictory of diffusion limited theory and nucleation theory on uniform plating. This perspective will undoubtedly enhance the understanding on the metal anode plating process and provide meaningful guidance for the development of metal anode batteries.

         <title>Mechanical Properties of Conducting Printed Nanosheet Network Thin Films Under Uniaxial Compression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Printed thin film nanosheet networks show remarkable promise for a range of electrical applications. Their conductivity relies heavily on their morphology, which may be altered via compression. This work provides the first exploration of the compressive properties of printed networks of graphene and MoS2 to explore properties of elastic modulus, plastic yield, viscoelasticity, tensile failure, and sheet bending versus slippage.








Abstract
Thin film networks of solution processed nanosheets show remarkable promise for use in a broad range of applications including strain sensors, energy storage, printed devices, textile electronics, and more. While it is known that their electronic properties rely heavily on their morphology, little is known of their mechanical nature, a glaring omission given the effect mechanical deformation has on the morphology of porous systems and the promise of mechanical post processing for tailored properties. Here, this work employs a recent advance in thin film mechanical testing called the Layer Compression Test to perform the first in situ analysis of printed nanosheet network compression. Due to the well&#8208;defined deformation geometry of this unique test, this work is able to explore the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elastic, plastic, and creep deformation in these systems, extracting properties of elastic modulus, plastic yield, viscoelasticity, tensile failure and sheet bending vs. slippage under both out of plane uniaxial compression and tension. This work characterizes these for a range of networks of differing porosities and sheet sizes, for low and high compression, as well as the effect of chemical cross linking. This work explores graphene and MoS2 networks, from which the results can be extended to printed nanosheet networks as a whole.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Surface Engineered Cyanine Nanodots for Active Transport of Therapeutic Antibodies into Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput fluorescent screening of a library of single&#8208;molecule Cy5 nanodots reveals that the nanoparticle&#8208;inducing cell transcytosis is highly related to the particles' surface structures and varies significantly with cell lines. The selected Cy5 nanodots with high transcytosis&#8208;inducing capability (G5&#8208;R) can carry &#945;PD&#8208;L1 to penetrate deep into&#160;solid tumor and generates potent antitumor activity through immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
The successful delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules into solid tumor&#160;holds great challenge due to their high resistance to penetrate through the complex tumor microenvironments. Here, active&#8208;transporting nanoparticles are harnessed to efficiently deliver biomacromolecular drugs into solid tumors through cell transcytosis. A series of molecularly precise cyanine 5&#8208;cored polylysine G5 dendrimers (Cy5 nanodots) with different peripheral amino acids (G5&#8208;AA) is prepared. The capability of these positively charged nanodots to induce cell endocytosis, exocytosis, and transcytosis is evaluated via fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screen. The optimized nanodots (G5&#8208;R) are conjugated with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 (a therapeutic monoclonal antibody binding to programmed&#8208;death ligand 1) (&#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R) to demonstrate the nanoparticle&#8208;mediated tumor active transport. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R can greatly enhance the tumor&#8208;penetration capability through adsorption&#8208;mediated transcytosis (AMT). The effectiveness of &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R is tested in treating mice bearing partially resected CT26 tumors, mimicking the local immunotherapy of residual tumors post&#8208;surgery in clinic. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R embedded in fibrin gel can efficiently mediate tumor cell transcytosis, and deliver &#945;PD&#8208;L1 throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing immune checkpoint blockade, reducing tumor recurrence, and significantly prolonging the survival time. The active&#8208;transporting nanodots are promising platforms for efficient tumor delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules.

         <title>Ultraconfined Plasmons in Atomically Thin Crystalline Silver Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin crystalline silver structures of &lt;3 nm in thickness are fabricated by lighographically prepatterning a silicon wafer and subsequently depositing a few atomic layers of metal under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The method has great flexibility regarding the size and morphology of the structures, which are demonstrated to sustain plasmon resonances with quality factors as high as ten.








Abstract
The ability to confine light down to atomic scales is critical for the development of applications in optoelectronics and optical sensing as well as for the exploration of nanoscale quantum phenomena. Plasmons in metallic nanostructures with just a few atomic layers in thickness can achieve this type of confinement, although fabrication imperfections down to the subnanometer scale hinder actual developments. Here, narrow plasmons are demonstrated in atomically thin crystalline silver nanostructures fabricated by prepatterning silicon substrates and epitaxially depositing silver films of just a few atomic layers in thickness. Specifically, a silicon wafer is lithographically patterned to introduce on&#8208;demand lateral shapes, chemically process the sample to obtain an atomically flat silicon surface, and epitaxially deposit silver to obtain ultrathin crystalline metal films with the designated morphologies. Structures fabricated by following this procedure allow for an unprecedented control over optical field confinement in the near&#8208;infrared spectral region, which is here illustrated by the observation of fundamental and higher&#8208;order plasmons featuring extreme spatial confinement and high&#8208;quality factors that reflect the crystallinity of the metal. The present study constitutes a&#160;substantial improvement in the degree of spatial confinement and quality factor that should facilitate the design and exploitation of atomic&#8208;scale nanoplasmonic devices for optoelectronics, sensing, and quantum&#8208;physics&#160;applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Perception of Object's Deformability with Multiple Deformation Attributes Utilizing Biomimetic Mechanoreceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tactile sensor, which integrates biomimetic slow&#8208;adapting mechanoreceptors in a soft medium, enables self&#8208;decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at the contact surface. In robotic manipulation, the sensor can achieve the self&#8208;adaptive perception of material softness and enhance tactile perception by establishing two relevant deformation attributes (material softness and compliance) for an object.








Abstract
The perception of object's deformability in unstructured interactions relies on both kinesthetic and cutaneous cues to adapt the uncertainties of an object. However, the existing tactile sensors cannot provide adequate cutaneous cues to self&#8208;adaptively estimate the material softness, especially in non&#8208;standard contact scenarios where the interacting object deviates from the assumption of an elastic half&#8208;infinite body. This paper proposes an innovative design of a tactile sensor that integrates the capabilities of two slow&#8208;adapting mechanoreceptors within a soft medium, allowing self&#8208;decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at specific locations within the contact interface. By leveraging these localized cutaneous cues, the sensor can accurately and self&#8208;adaptively measure the material softness of an object, accommodating variations in thicknesses and applied forces. Furthermore, when combined with a kinesthetic cue from the robot, the sensor can enhance tactile expression by the synergy of two relevant deformation attributes, including material softness and compliance.&#160;It is demonstrated that the biomimetic fusion of tactile information can fully comprehend the deformability of an object, hence facilitating robotic decision&#8208;making and dexterous manipulation.

         <title>In Situ Engineering of Inorganic&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphases via Anion Choice Enables Stable, Lithium Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahydrofuran&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). By employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB), it is demonstrated that electrolyte anions can improve the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI.








Abstract
The discovery of liquid battery electrolytes that facilitate the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) to mitigate dendrite formation is imperative to enable lithium anodes in next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;dense batteries. Compared to traditional electrolyte solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated great success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs. Herein, by employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB),&#160;it is&#160;demonstrated that electrolyte anions modulate the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI. Through novel analytical time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry&#160;methods, such as hierarchical clustering of depth profiles and compositional analysis using integrated yields,&#160;the chemical composition and morphology of the SEIs generated from each electrolyte system are examined. Notably, the LiDFOB electrolyte provides an exceptionally stable system to enable lithium anodes, delivering &gt;1500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 and a capacity of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 in symmetrical cells. Furthermore, Li//LFP cells using this electrolyte demonstrate high&#8208;rate, reversible lithium storage, supplying 139 mAh g(LFP)&#8722;1 at C/2 (&#8776;0.991 mAh cm&#8722;2, @ 0.61 mA cm&#8722;2) with 87.5% capacity retention over 300 cycles (average Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.86%).

         <title>Retarding Ion Migration for Stable Blade&#8208;Coated Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional molecule, p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA), increases ion migration barrier, induces (100) facet perovskite grain growth, and yields defect&#8208;reduced, homogeneous films. The blade&#8208;coated PABA&#8208;based inverted PSC achieves an impressive PCE of 23.32% and maintains 93.8% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours under 1&#8208;sun illumination at 75 &#176;C and 10% relative humidity.








Abstract
The fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through blade coating is seen as one of the most viable paths toward commercialization. However, relative to the less scalable spin coating method, the blade coating process often results in more defective perovskite films with lower grain uniformity. Ion migration, facilitated by those elevated defect levels, is one of the main triggers of phase segregation and device instability. Here, a bifunctional molecule, p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which enhances the barrier to ion migration, induces grain growth along the (100) facet, and promotes the formation of homogeneous perovskite films with fewer defects, is reported. As a result, PSCs with PABA achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 23.32% and 22.23% for devices with active areas of 0.1 cm2 and 1 cm2, respectively. Furthermore, these devices maintain 93.8% of their initial efficiencies after 1&#160;000 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination, 75 &#176;C, and 10% relative humidity conditions.

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Bone Repair through Multihierarchy Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Regulated Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multihierarchy reactive oxygen species regulated system, PEGS&#8208;PGA/SeSe/Rapa hydrogel (PSeR) for aged bone regeneration can effectively delay senescence and restore the regenerative function of senescent BMSCs by maintaining the levels of ROS intracellularly and extracellularly. Additionally, the PSeR hydrogel can be injected and rapidly crosslinked in the site of bone defects, presenting a novel therapeutic strategy for addressing age&#8208;related bone injuries.








Abstract
Aging exacerbates the dysfunction of tissue regeneration at multiple levels and gradually diminishes individual's capacity to withstand stress, damage, and disease. The excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered a hallmark feature of senescent stem cells, which causes oxidative stress, deteriorates the host microenvironment, and eventually becomes a critical obstacle for aged bone defect repair. Till now, the strategies cannot synchronously and thoroughly regulate intracellular and extracellular ROS in senescent cells. Herein, a multihierarchy ROS scavenging system for aged bone regeneration is developed by fabricating an injectable PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate) (PEGS&#8208;NH2)/poly(&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid) (&#947;&#8208;PGA) hydrogel containing rapamycin&#8208;loaded poly(diselenide&#8208;carbonate) nanomicelles (PSeR). This PSeR hydrogel exhibits highly sensitive ROS responsiveness to the local aged microenvironment and dynamically releases drug&#8208;loaded nanomicelles to scavenge the intracellular ROS accumulated in senescent bone mesenchymal stem cells. The PSeR hydrogel effectively tunes the antioxidant function and delays senescence of bone mesenchymal stem cells by safeguarding DNA replication in an oxidative environment, thereby promoting the self&#8208;renewal ability and enhancing the osteogenic capacity for aged bone repair in vitro and in vivo.

     alt="Rejuvenating Aged Bone Repair through Multihierarchy Reactive Oxygen Species-Regulated Hydrogel"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multihierarchy reactive oxygen species regulated system, PEGS-PGA/SeSe/Rapa hydrogel (PSeR) for aged bone regeneration can effectively delay senescence and restore the regenerative function of senescent BMSCs by maintaining the levels of ROS intracellularly and extracellularly. Additionally, the PSeR hydrogel can be injected and rapidly crosslinked in the site of bone defects, presenting a novel therapeutic strategy for addressing age-related bone injuries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging exacerbates the dysfunction of tissue regeneration at multiple levels and gradually diminishes individual's capacity to withstand stress, damage, and disease. The excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered a hallmark feature of senescent stem cells, which causes oxidative stress, deteriorates the host microenvironment, and eventually becomes a critical obstacle for aged bone defect repair. Till now, the strategies cannot synchronously and thoroughly regulate intracellular and extracellular ROS in senescent cells. Herein, a multihierarchy ROS scavenging system for aged bone regeneration is developed by fabricating an injectable PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate) (PEGS-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/poly(&#947;-glutamic acid) (&#947;-PGA) hydrogel containing rapamycin-loaded poly(diselenide-carbonate) nanomicelles (PSeR). This PSeR hydrogel exhibits highly sensitive ROS responsiveness to the local aged microenvironment and dynamically releases drug-loaded nanomicelles to scavenge the intracellular ROS accumulated in senescent bone mesenchymal stem cells. The PSeR hydrogel effectively tunes the antioxidant function and delays senescence of bone mesenchymal stem cells by safeguarding DNA replication in an oxidative environment, thereby promoting the self-renewal ability and enhancing the osteogenic capacity for aged bone repair in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this multihierarchy ROS-regulated hydrogel provides a new strategy for treating degenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Nanorobot&#8208;Based Marsupial Robotic System for Intracranial Cross&#8208;Scale Targeting Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A marsupial robotic system combining a continuum robot (mother robot) with nanorobots (child robots) is developed for cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery. The robotic system improves the targeting rate and therapeutic efficacy in brain tumor treatment with the hierarchical targeting strategy spanning targeting scale from centimeters to nanometers.








Abstract
Nanorobots capable of active movement are an exciting technology for targeted therapeutic intervention. However, the extensive motion range and hindrance of the blood&#8211;brain barrier impeded their clinical translation in glioblastoma therapy. Here, a marsupial robotic system constructed by integrating chemical/magnetic hybrid nanorobots (child robots) with a miniature magnetic continuum robot (mother robot) for intracranial cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery is reported. For primary targeting on macroscale, the continuum robot enters the cranial cavity through a minimally invasive channel (e.g., Ommaya device) in the skull and transports the nanorobots to pathogenic regions. Upon circumventing the blood&#8211;brain barrier, the released nanorobots perform secondary targeting on microscale to further enhance the spatial resolution of drug delivery. In vitro experiments against primary glioblastoma cells derived from different patients are conducted for personalized treatment guidance. The operation feasibility within organisms is shown in ex vivo swine brain experiments. The biosafety of the treatment system is suggested in in vivo experiments. Owing to the hierarchical targeting method, the targeting rate, targeting accuracy, and treatment efficacy have improved greatly. The marsupial robotic system offers a novel intracranial local therapeutic strategy and constitutes a key milestone in the development of glioblastoma treatment platforms.

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated Selectivity Control of CH3OH versus CO/CH4 in CO2 Photoreduction on Single&#8208;Atom Implanted Nanotube Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;TiO2/SrTiO3 nanotube arrays are constructed with both Fe single atom reduction centers and dominant oxidation facets (001) for efficiently driving CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation. The amount of water can be facilely adjusted to selectively control CH3OH production from &#8776;0% (above H2O) to 98.90% (in H2O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water.








Abstract
Controllable methanol production in artificial photosynthesis is highly desirable due to its high energy density and ease of storage. Herein, single atom Fe is implanted into TiO2/SrTiO3 (TSr) nanotube arrays by two&#8208;step anodization and Sr&#8208;induced crystallization. The resulting Fe&#8208;TSr with both single Fe reduction centers and dominant oxidation facets (001) contributes to efficient CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation for controlled production of CH3OH and CO/CH4. The methanol yield can reach to 154.20&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 98.90% selectivity by immersing all the catalyst in pure water, and the yield of CO/CH4 is 147.48&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with &gt;99.99% selectivity when the catalyst completely outside water. This CH3OH yield is 50 and 3 times higher than that of TiO2 and TSr and stands among all the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. The facile gas&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#160;phase switch can selectively control CH3OH production from &#8776;0% (above H2O) to 98.90% (in H2O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water, where abundant &#8226;OH and H2O around Fe sites play important role in selective CH3OH production. This work highlights a new insight for water&#8208;mediated CO2 photoreduction to controllably produce CH3OH.

A 3D porous Al current collector decorated with N&#8208;doped graphene affording electronic structure modulation, giving rise to an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI architecture to expedite ion transport and guide dendrite&#8208;free potassium deposition.








Abstract
Potassium metal battery is an appealing candidate for future energy storage. However, its application is plagued by the notorious dendrite proliferation at the anode side, which entails the formation of vulnerable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and non&#8208;uniform potassium deposition on the current collector. Here, this work reports a dual&#8208;modification design of aluminum current collector to render dendrite&#8208;free potassium anodes with favorable reversibility. This work achieves to modulate the electronic structure of the designed current collector and accordingly attain an SEI architecture with robust inorganic&#8208;rich constituents, which is evidenced by detailed cryo&#8208;EM inspection and X&#8208;ray depth profiling. The thus&#8208;produced SEI manages to expedite ionic conductivity and guide homogeneous potassium deposition. Compared to the potassium metal cells assembled using typical aluminum current collector, cells based on the designed current collector realize improved rate capability (maintaining 400&#160;h under 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and low&#8208;temperature durability (stable operation at &#8722;50 &#176;C). Moreover, scalable production of the current collector allows for the sustainable construction of high&#8208;safety potassium metal batteries, with the potential for reducing the manufacturing cost.

Killing tumor cells in deep tumor regions with ferroptosis agents is still challenging because of distinct size requirements for intratumoral accumulation and deep tumor penetration.

Abstract
The ferroptosis pathway is recognized as an essential strategy for tumor treatment. However, killing tumor cells in deep tumor regions with ferroptosis agents is still challenging because of distinct size requirements for intratumoral accumulation and deep tumor penetration. Herein, intelligent nanocapsules with size&#8208;switchable capability that responds to acid/hyperthermia stimulation to achieve deep tumor ferroptosis are developed. These nanocapsules are constructed using poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic) acid and Pluronic F127 as carrier materials, with Au&#8211;Fe2C Janus nanoparticles serving as photothermal and ferroptosis agents, and sorafenib (SRF) as the ferroptosis enhancer. The PFP@Au&#8211;Fe2C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules, designed with an appropriate size, exhibit superior intratumoral accumulation compared to free Au&#8211;Fe2C nanoparticles, as evidenced by photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging. These nanocapsules can degrade within the acidic tumor microenvironment when subjected to laser irradiation, releasing free Au&#8211;Fe2C nanoparticles. This enables them to penetrate deep into tumor regions and disrupt intracellular redox balance. Under the guidance of imaging, these PFP@Au&#8211;Fe2C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules effectively inhibit tumor growth when exposed to laser irradiation, capitalizing on the synergistic photothermal and ferroptosis effects. This study presents an intelligent formulation based on iron carbide for achieving deep tumor ferroptosis through size&#8208;switchable cascade delivery, thereby advancing the comprehension of ferroptosis in the context of tumor theranostics.

These nanocapsules are constructed using poly(lactic-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-glycolic) acid and Pluronic F127 as carrier materials, with Au&#8211;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C Janus nanoparticles serving as photothermal and ferroptosis agents, and sorafenib (SRF) as the ferroptosis enhancer. The PFP@Au&#8211;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules, designed with an appropriate size, exhibit superior intratumoral accumulation compared to free Au&#8211;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C nanoparticles, as evidenced by photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging. These nanocapsules can degrade within the acidic tumor microenvironment when subjected to laser irradiation, releasing free Au&#8211;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C nanoparticles. This enables them to penetrate deep into tumor regions and disrupt intracellular redox balance. Under the guidance of imaging, these PFP@Au&#8211;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules effectively inhibit tumor growth when exposed to laser irradiation, capitalizing on the synergistic photothermal and ferroptosis effects. This study presents an intelligent formulation based on iron carbide for achieving deep tumor ferroptosis through size-switchable cascade delivery, thereby advancing the comprehension of ferroptosis in the context of tumor theranostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalized MXene Films with Substantially Improved Low&#8208;Voltage Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple tetrabutylammonium (TBA)&#8208;functionalization of MXene improves the in&#8208;plane actuation strain over three times and enhances the mechanical property and stability in air. In situ and ex situ characterizations reveal that the co&#8208;insertion/de&#8208;insertion of TBA ions with Li ions into/from MXene interlayer galleries and inter&#8208;edge gaps&#160;causes a large in&#8208;plane sliding of MXene sheets under negative/positive polarizations.








Abstract
Ti3C2Tx MXene film is promising for low&#8208;voltage electrochemical actuators (ECAs) due to its excellent electrical conductivity, volumetric capacitance, and mechanical properties. However, its in&#8208;plane actuation is limited to little intralayer strain of MXene sheets under polarization. Here it is demonstrated that a simple tetrabutylammonium (TBA) functionalization of MXene improves the in&#8208;plane actuation strain by 337% and also enhances the mechanical property and stability in air and the electrolyte. Various in situ characterizations reveal that the improved actuation is ascribed to the co&#8208;insertion/desertion of TBA and Li ions into/from MXene interlayer galleries and inter&#8208;edge gaps that causes a large in&#8208;plane sliding of MXene sheets under negative/positive polarizations. The assembled bending actuator has a high strength and modulus and generates a peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain difference of 0.771% and a blocking force up to 51.5 times its own weight under 1&#160;V. The designed soft robotic tweezer can grasp an object under 1&#160;V and hold it firmly under 0&#160;V. The novel sheet sliding mechanism resembling the filament sliding theory in skeletal muscles may inspire the design of high&#8208;performance actuators with other nanomaterials.

         <title>Mid&#8208;IR Light&#8208;Activatable Full Spectrum LaB6 Plasmonic Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasmonic LaB6 photocatalyst can be excited by mid&#8208;IR (3900 nm) light and thermal radiation from hot/warm objects to generate reactive oxygen species and exert photodegradation of organic pollutants, as well as disinfection of multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria.








Abstract
Photocatalysts as long&#8208;lasting, benign reagents for disinfection of bacteria in hospitals and public areas/facilities/transportation vehicles are strongly needed. A common limitation for all existing semiconductor photocatalysts is the requirement of activation by external UV&#8211;vis&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light with wavelengths shorter than &#8776;1265 nm. None of the existing photocatalysts can function during nighttime in the absence of external light. Herein, an unprecedented LaB6 plasmonic photocatalyst is reported, which can absorb UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR light and mid&#8208;IR (3900 nm) light to split water and generate hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals for the decomposition of organic pollutants, as well as kill multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli bacteria. Mid&#8208;IR light (&#8776;2&#8211;50 &#181;m) is readily available from the natural environments via thermal radiation of warm/hot objects on the earth including human bodies, animals, furnances,&#160;hot/warm electrical devices, and buildings.

         <title>Deformation&#8208;Induced Photoprogrammable Pattern of Polyurethane Elastomers Based on Poisson Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward yet powerful strategy to fabricate micropatterns with high aspect ratio on polyurethane elastomers is developed by spatially regulating the photodimerization and the distribution of internal stress. This technology integrates the characteristics of top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up methods, providing a versatile basis for applications in stretchable strain sensors, anticounterfeiting devices, and functional systems.








Abstract
Elastomers with high aspect ratio surface patterns are a promising class of materials for designing soft machines in the future. Here, a facile method for fabricating surface patterns on polyurethane elastomer by subtly utilizing the Poisson effect and gradient photocrosslinking is demonstrated. By applying uniaxial tensile strains, the aspect ratio of the surface patterns can be optionally manipulated. At prestretched state, the pattern on the polyurethane elastomer can be readily constructed through compressive stress, resulting from the gradient photocrosslinking via selective photodimerization of an anthracene&#8208;functionalized polyurethane elastomer (referred to as ANPU). The macromolecular aggregation structures during stretching deformation significantly contribute to the fabrication of high aspect ratio surface patterns. The insightful finite element analysis well demonstrates that the magnitude and distribution of internal stress in the ANPU elastomer can be regulated by selectively gradient crosslinking, leading to polymer chains migrate from the exposed region to the unexposed region, thereby generating a diverse array of surface patterns. Additionally, the periodic surface patterns exhibit tunable structural color according to the different stretching states and are fully reversible over multiple cycles, opening up avenues for diverse applications such as smart displays, stretchable strain sensors, and anticounterfeiting devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Metal Foam Catalysts for Cathodic Electro&#8208;Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops leaded foam&#8208;type electrodes through the dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT) method and tests them in electro&#8208;organic reductions using an oxime to nitrile transformation for synthesis of fine chemicals. All developed catalysts outperformed both Pb and CuSn7Pb15 in terms of chemical yields and energy efficiency. The latter material is deemed the best replacement for Pb in reductive organo&#8208;electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Although electro&#8208;organic synthesis is currently receiving renewed interest because of its potential to enable sustainability in chemical processes to value&#8208;added products, challenges in process development persist: For reductive transformations performed in protic media, an inherent issue is the limited choice of metallic cathode materials that can effectively suppress the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) while maintaining a high activity toward the targeted electro&#8208;organic reaction. Current development trends are aimed at avoiding the previously used HER&#8208;suppressing elements (Cd, Hg, and Pb) because of their toxicity. Here, this work reports the rational design of highly porous foam&#8208;type binary and ternary electrocatalysts with reduced Pb content. Optimized cathodes are tested in electro&#8208;organic reductions using an oxime to nitrile transformation as a model reaction relevant for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Their electrocatalytic performance is compared with that of the model CuSn7Pb15 bronze alloy that has recently been endorsed as the best cathode replacement for bare Pb electrodes. All developed metal foam catalysts outperform both bare Pb and the CuSn7Pb15 benchmark in terms of chemical yield and energetic efficiency. Moreover, post&#8208;electrolysis analysis of the crude electrolyte mixture and the cathode's surfaces through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively, reveal the foam catalysts&#8217; elevated resistance to cathodic corrosion.

         <title>Rejoint of Carbon Nitride Fragments into Multi&#8208;Interfacial Order&#8208;Disorder Homojunction for Robust Photo&#8208;Driven Generation of H2O2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a directed healing process is employed to splice carbon nitride pieces into a carbon nitride homojunction with multiple order&#8208;disorder interfaces. The resultant catalyst exhibits boosted charge dynamics and more spatially and orderly separated redox centers, resulting in a remarkable yield, an excellent selectivity, and a prominent solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency in photosynthesis of H2O2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic technology based on carbon nitride (C3N4) offers a sustainable and clean approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, but the yield is severely limited by the sluggish hot carriers due to the weak internal electric field. In this study, a novel approach is devised by fragmenting bulk C3N4&#160;into smaller pieces (CN&#8208;NH4) and then subjecting it to a directed healing process to create multiple order&#8208;disorder interfaces (CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK).&#160;The resulting junctions in CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK significantly boost charge dynamics and facilitate more spatially and orderly separated redox centers. As a result, CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK demonstrates outstanding photosynthesis of H2O2 via both two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron and one&#8208;step double&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathways, achieving a remarkable yield of 16675&#160;&#181;mol h&#8211;1&#160;g&#8211;1, excellent selectivity (&gt;&#160;91%), and a prominent solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency exceeding 2.3%. These remarkable results surpass pristine C3N4 by 158 times and outperform previously reported C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work represents a significant advancement in catalyst design and modification technology, inspiring the development of more efficient metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for the synthesis of highly valued fuels.

         <title>A Soft, Adhesive Self&#8208;Healing Naked&#8208;Eye Strain/Stress Visualization Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel naked&#8208;eye strain/stress visualization (NSV) patch is developed based on a bio&#8208;inspired force&#8208;responsive hydrogel. Reversible generation of light scattering mechano&#8208;iridophore is regulated by local deformations, serving as the sensing mechanism. NSV patches feature fast response, high resolution, wide dynamic range, great adhesiveness, and self&#8208;healing material capability. Their optical output can be directly read by naked eyes or smartphone apps.








Abstract
Learning about the strain/stress distribution in a material is essential to achieve its mechanical stability and proper functionality. Conventional techniques such as universal testing machines only apply to static samples with standardized geometry in laboratory environment. Soft mechanical sensors based on stretchable conductors, carbon&#8208;filled composites, or conductive gels possess better adaptability, but still face challenges from complicated fabrication process, dependence on extra readout device, and limited strain/stress mapping ability. Inspired by the camouflage mechanism of cuttlefish and chameleons, here an innovative responsive hydrogel containing light&#8208;scattering &#8220;mechano&#8208;iridophores&#8221; is developed. Force induced reversible phase separation manipulates the dynamic generation of mechano&#8208;iridophores, serving as optical indicators of local deformation. Patch&#8208;shaped mechanical sensors made from the responsive hydrogel feature fast response time (&lt;0.4 s), high spatial resolution (&#8776;100&#160;&#181;m), and wide dynamic ranges (e.g., 10&#8211;150% strain). The intrinsic adhesiveness and self&#8208;healing material capability of sensing patches also ensure their excellent applicability and robustness. This combination of chemical and optical properties allows strain/stress distributions in target samples to be directly identified by naked eyes or smartphone apps, which is not yet achieved. The great advantages above are ideal for developing the next&#8208;generation mechanical sensors toward material studies, damage diagnosis, risk prediction, and smart devices.

         <title>Crystallization Control Based on the Regulation of Solvent&#8211;Perovskite Coordination for High&#8208;Performance Ambient Printable FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A weak coordination solvent strategy is developed to tailor solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination. This strategy promotes the direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3),&#160;leads to more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics, and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. The corresponding ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%.








Abstract
The critical requirement for ambient&#8208;printed formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) lies in the control of nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics and defect formation behavior, which are extensively influenced by interactions between the solvent and perovskite. Here, a strategy is developed that combines a cosolvent and an additive to efficiently tailor the coordination between the solvent and perovskite. Through in situ characterizations, the direct crystallization from the sol&#8211;gel phase to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is illustrated. When the solvent exhibits strong interactions with the perovskite, the sol&#8211;gel phases cannot effectively transform into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, resulting in a lower nucleation rate and confined crystal growth directions. Consequently, it becomes challenging to fabricate high&#8208;quality void&#8208;free perovskite films. Conversely, weaker solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination promotes direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This process exhibits more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. This strategy leads to improved structural and optoelectronic properties within the FAPbI3 films, characterized by more compact grain stacking, smoother surface morphology, released lattice strain, and fewer defects. The ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells fabricated using this strategy exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%, with significantly reduced efficiency deviation and negligible decreases in the stabilized output.

         <title>Industrial Kraft Lignin Based Binary Cathode Interface Layer Enables Enhanced Stability in High Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces industrial solvent fractionated LignoBoost kraft lignin (KL) in highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) by binary cathode interface layer (CIL) strategy, which can significantly improve the stability of both binary and ternary photoactive layer (PAL) OSC, owing to the passivation of diffusion and reaction between bathocuproine (BCP) and nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). The results combine sustainable wood&#8208;based material with classic interface materials in advance NFA&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
Herein, a binary cathode interface layer (CIL) strategy based on the industrial solvent fractionated LignoBoost kraft lignin (KL) is adopted for fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs). The uniformly distributed phenol moieties in KL enable it to easily form hydrogen bonds with commonly used CIL materials, i.e., bathocuproine (BCP) and PFN&#8208;Br, resulting in binary CILs with tunable work function (WF). This work shows that the binary CILs work well in OSCs with large KL ratio compatibility, exhibiting equivalent or even higher efficiency to the traditional CILs in state of art OSCs. In addition, the combination of KL and BCP significantly enhanced OSC stability, owing to KL blocking the reaction between BCP and nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). This work provides a simple and effective way to achieve high&#8208;efficient OSCs with better stability and sustainability by using wood&#8208;based materials.

A key cause of phase segregation in WBG perovskites is identified as residual PbI2 at the interface, creating electrical potential variations between domain surfaces and boundaries, inducing ion migration and subsequent phase segregation. Applying a surface reaction strategy to eliminate surface PbI2 residue enhances bandgap stability and mitigates photovoltage deficits in complete devices.








Abstract
Efficient wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are essential for fully maximizing the potential of tandem solar cells. However, these cells currently face challenges such as high photovoltage losses and the presence of phase segregation, which impede the attainment of their expected efficiency and stability. Herein, the root cause of halide segregation is investigated, uncovering a close association with the presence of locally aggregated lead iodide (PbI2), particularly at the perovskite/C60 interface. Kelvin&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy results indicate that the remaining PbI2 at the interface leads to potential electrical differences between the domain surface and boundaries, which drives the formation of halide segregation. By reacting the surface PbI2 residue with ethanediamine dihydroiodide (EDAI2) at proper temperature, it is possible to effectively mitigate the phase segregation. By applying this surface reaction strategy in WBG inverted cells, a notable improvement of &#8776;100&#160;mV is achieved in photovoltage over a wide range of WBG cells (1.67&#8211;1.78&#160;eV), resulting in a champion efficiency of 23.1% (certified 22.95%) for 1.67&#160;eV cells and 19.7% (certified 18.81%) for 1.75&#160;eV cells. Furthermore, efficiency of 26.1% is demonstrated in a monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem cell.

         <title>Diagnosing the Electrostatic Shielding Mechanism for Dendrite Suppression in Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal anode for aqueous zinc batteries is highly susceptible to dendrites and side reactions. Engineering the electrolyte with additives can combat these negative traits. Operando transmission electron microscopy is used to explore how the inclusion of LiCl additive encourages the formation of blocky Zn electroplated deposits, which it is proposed is due to an electrostatic shielding mechanism.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc electrolytes offer the potential for cheaper rechargeable batteries due to their safe compatibility with the high capacity metal anode; yet, they are stymied by irregular zinc deposition and consequent dendrite growth. Suppressing dendrite formation by tailoring the electrolyte is a proven approach from lithium batteries; yet, the underlying mechanistic understanding that guides such tailoring does not necessarily directly translate from one system to the other. Here, it is shown that the electrostatic shielding mechanism, a fundamental concept in electrolyte engineering for stable metal anodes, has different consequences for the plating morphology in aqueous zinc batteries. Operando electrochemical transmission electron microscopy is used to directly observe the zinc nucleation and growth under different electrolyte compositions and reveal that electrostatic shielding additive suppresses dendrites by inhibiting secondary zinc nucleation along the (100) edges of existing primary deposits and encouraging preferential deposition on the (002) faces, leading to a dense and block&#8208;like zinc morphology. The strong influence of the crystallography of Zn on the electrostatic shielding mechanism is further confirmed with Zn||Ti cells and density functional theory modeling. This work demonstrates the importance of considering the unique aspects of the aqueous zinc battery system when using concepts from other battery chemistries.

         <title>RuOx Quantum Dots Loaded on Graphdiyne for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strengthened d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based catalyst (RuOxQDs/GDY) and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is achieved through the strong Ru&#8208;to&#8208;alkyne &#960; backdonation, which significantly enhances the catalytic performance of RuOxQDs/GDY for LiPSs conversion. RuOxQDs/GDY also enable ultrastable lithium metal anodes. Thus, the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur full cells are realized.








Abstract
Here, a strategy to strengthen d&#8211;p orbital hybridization by fabricating &#960; backbonding in the catalyst for efficient lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion is reported. A special interface structure of RuOx quantum dots (QDs) anchored on graphdiyne (GDY) nanoboxes (RuOxQDs/GDY) is prepared to enable strong Ru&#8208;to&#8208;alkyne &#960; backdonation, which effectively regulates the d&#8208;electron structures of Ru centers to promote the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between the catalyst and LiPSs and significantly boosts the catalytic performance of RuOxQDs/GDY. The strong affinity with Li ions and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion of RuOxQDs/GDY also enable ultrastable Li metal anodes. Thus, S@RuOxQDs/GDY cathodes exhibit excellent cycling performance under harsh conditions, and Li@RuOxQDs/GDY anodes show an ultralong cycling life over 8800&#160;h without Li dendrite growth. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) full cells with S@RuOxQDs/GDY cathodes and Li@RuOxQDs/GDY anodes can deliver an impressive areal capacity of 17.8&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability under the practical conditions of low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio (N/P = 1.4), lean electrolyte (E/S = 3&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1), and high S mass loading (15.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2).

High&#8208;yield stress colloidal inks for 3D printing of structurally&#8208;colored objects are created through destabilization of ultra&#8208;stable silica suspensions with polar molecules. These inks form dense, uniform colloidal networks and swiftly transition from liquid to solid upon nozzle discharge, facilitating rapid, shrinkage&#8208;free printing. The resulting prints display structural colors and enhanced mechanical properties due to the dense network.








Abstract
Direct ink writing (DIW) stands out as a facile additive manufacturing method, minimizing material waste. Nonetheless, developing homogeneous Bingham inks with high yield stress and swift liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions for versatile 3D printing remains a challenge. In this study, high&#8208;performance Bingham inks are formulated by destabilizing silica particle suspensions in acrylate&#8208;based resin. A colloidal network forms in the shear&#8208;free state through interparticle attraction, achieved by disrupting the solvation layer of large resin molecules using polar molecules. The network is highly dense, with evenly distributed linkage strength as monodisperse particles undergo gelation at an ultra&#8208;high fraction. Crucially, the strength is calibrated to ensure a sufficiently large yield stress, while still allowing the network to reversibly melt under shear flow. The inks immediately undergo a liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition upon discharge, while maintaining fluidity without nozzle clogging. The dense colloidal networks develop structural colors due to the short&#8208;range order. This enables the rapid and sophisticated drawing of structurally&#8208;colored 3D structures, relying solely on rheological properties. Moreover, the printed composite structures exhibit high mechanical stability due to the presence of the colloidal network, which expands the range of potential applications.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation Reaction with a Benchmark Rate at Air&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Solid Joint Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase photocatalytic interface effectively enhances the interfacial oxygen concentration and results in largely enhanced performance in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in water. This is attributed to an enhanced oxygen diffusion rate and high O2 concentration in triphase interface.








Abstract
The rapid charge recombination, low selectivity for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and limited O2 diffusion rate hinder the practical applications of photocatalytic H2O2 generation. Herein, a triphase photocatalytic system in which the H2O2 generation occurs at the air&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid joint interfaces is developed, using polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The introduction of pyrrole units and cyano group into PCN can promote the activation of oxygen molecules and facilitate the spatial separation of HOMO and LUMO orbits, hence improving the charge carrier separation efficiency and enhancing the formation of H2O2. Importantly, the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triphase interface system allows for the rapid transport of oxygen from the air to the reaction interface, overcoming the low solubility and slow diffusion of oxygen in the water in conventional liquid reaction systems. The triphase system shows a benchmark H2O2 generation rate over PCN&#8208;based materials in pure water (2063.21&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), which is an approximate tenfold enhancement as compared to powder photocatalyst (215.44&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Simulation and electrochemical tests reveal that the rapid oxygen diffusion rate of triphase interface can promote charge separation and provide more O2 to generate H2O2. This work provides a promising strategy for constructing an efficient and sustainable H2O2 production system.

&lt;p&gt;The construction of gas-liquid-solid three-phase photocatalytic interface effectively enhances the interfacial oxygen concentration and results in largely enhanced performance in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production in water. This is attributed to an enhanced oxygen diffusion rate and high O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in triphase interface.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid charge recombination, low selectivity for two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and limited O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diffusion rate hinder the practical applications of photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation. Herein, a triphase photocatalytic system in which the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation occurs at the air-liquid-solid joint interfaces is developed, using polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The introduction of pyrrole units and cyano group into PCN can promote the activation of oxygen molecules and facilitate the spatial separation of HOMO and LUMO orbits, hence improving the charge carrier separation efficiency and enhancing the formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Importantly, the gas-liquid-solid triphase interface system allows for the rapid transport of oxygen from the air to the reaction interface, overcoming the low solubility and slow diffusion of oxygen in the water in conventional liquid reaction systems. The triphase system shows a benchmark H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation rate over PCN-based materials in pure water (2063.21&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which is an approximate tenfold enhancement as compared to powder photocatalyst (215.44&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Switchable Chemical&#8208;Bond Reorganization for the Stable Charge Trapping in Amorphous Silicon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors suggest a novel atomistic mechanism for stable charge storage in amorphous silicon nitride in charge trap flash memory. Through ab initio molecular dynamics and orbital interaction analysis, it is demonstrated that stable charge trapping involves chemical bond reorganization and large trap level shifts, resulting in charges being trapped in multicenter bonding states.








Abstract
Despite the widespread use of charge&#8208;trap flash (CTF) memory, the atomistic mechanism behind the exceptionally stable charge storage at the localized trap sites is still controversial. Herein, by combining first&#8208;principles calculations and orbital interaction analysis, a charge&#8208;dependent switchable chemical&#8208;bond reorganization is elucidated as the underpinning chemistry in the working mechanism of CTF. Especially, positively charged fourfold&#8208;coordinated nitrogen (dubbed N+ center), unappreciated until now, is the decisive component of the entire process; once an electron occupies this site, the N+ center disappears by breaking one N&#9472;Si bond, simultaneously forming a new Si&#9472;Si bond with a nearby Si atom which, in turn, creates fivefold coordinated Si. As a result, the electron is stored in a multi&#8208;center orbital belonging to multiple atoms including the newly formed Si&#9472;Si bond. It is also observed that hole trapping accompanies the creation of an N+ center by forming a new N&#9472;Si bond, which represents the reverse process. To further support and validate this model by means of core&#8208;level calculations, it is also shown that an N+ center's 1s core level is 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;eV deeper in energy than those of the threefold coordinated N atoms, in harmony with experimental X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy data.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment Modulating CaCO3&#8208;Based Colloidosomal Microreactors Can Generally Reinforce Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor microenvironment (TME) modulating CaCO3&#8208;based colloidosomal microreactors are constructed via encapulating catalase within CaCO3 nanoparticles assembled colloidsome. The obtained CCaP CSs can simultaneously neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia, and deplete immunosuppressive lactate, collectively leading to activated anticancer immunity. As a result, CCaP CSs treatment can remarkably reinforce the therapeutic potency of both anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 immunotherapy and EGFR&#8208;CAR&#8208;T cell immunotherapy in different tumor models.








Abstract
Tumor hypoxia and acidity, two general features of solid tumors, are known to have negative effect on cancer immunotherapy by directly causing dysfunction of effector immune cells and promoting suppressive immune cells inside tumors. Herein, a multifunctional colloidosomal microreactor is constructed by encapsulating catalase within calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle&#8208;assembled colloidosomes (abbreviated as CaP CSs) via the classic double emulsion method. The yielded CCaP CSs exhibit well&#8208;retained proton&#8208;scavenging and hydrogen peroxide decomposition performances and can thus neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia, and suppress lactate production upon intratumoral administration. Consequently, CCaP CSs treatment can activate potent antitumor immunity and thus significantly enhance the therapeutic potency of coloaded anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) antibodies in both murine subcutaneous CT26 and orthotopic 4T1 tumor xenografts. In addition, such CCaP CSs treatment also markedly reinforces the therapeutic potency of epidermal growth factor receptor expressing chimeric antigen receptor T (EGFR&#8208;CAR&#8208;T) cells toward a human triple&#8208;negative breast cancer xenograft by promoting their tumor infiltration and effector cytokine secretion. Therefore, this study highlights that chemical modulation of tumor acidity and hypoxia can collectively reverse tumor immunosuppression and thus significantly potentiate both immune checkpoint blockade and CAR&#8208;T cell immunotherapies toward solid tumors.

         <title>Reconstruction of Vesicle Assemblies with DNA Nanorulers for Resolving Heterogeneity of Vesicles in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a vitro system composed of synaptic vesicle&#8208;sized vesicles coupled to double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) nanorulers, which enables to selectively connect isolated vesicles to generate vesicle assemblies with controlled lateral distance (from 3 to 10 nm). Moreover, this work analyzes the state heterogeneity of vesicles (individual vesicle or vesicle clusters) in cells and vesicle release heterogeneity in different positions across the cell.








Abstract
Nanoscale vesicles such as synaptic vesicles play a pivotal role in efficient interneuronal communications in vivo. However, the coexistence of single vesicle and vesicle clusters in living cells increases the heterogeneity of vesicle populations, which largely complicates the quantitative analysis of the vesicles. The high spatiotemporal monitoring of vesicle assemblies is currently incompletely resolved. Here, this work uses synthetic vesicles and DNA nanorulers to reconstruct in vitro the vesicle assemblies that mimic vesicle clusters in living cells. DNA nanorulers program the lateral distance of vesicle assemblies from 3 to 10 nm. This work uses the carbon fiber nanoelectrode (CFNE) to amperometric monitor artificial vesicle assemblies with sub&#8208;10 nm interspaces, and obtain a larger proportion of complex events. This work resolves the heterogeneity of individual vesicle release kinetics in PC12 cells with the temporal resolution down to &#8776;0.1 ms. This work further analyzes the aggregation state of intracellular vesicles and the exocytosis of living cells with electrochemical vesicle cytometry. The results indicate that the exocytosis of vesicle clusters is critically dependent on the size of clusters. This technology has the potential as a tool to shed light on the heterogeneity analysis of vesicle populations.

         <title>Structure Engineered High Piezo&#8208;Photoelectronic Performance for Boosted Sono&#8208;Photodynamic Therapy</title>

The design of watermelon&#8208;like ZnSnO3@UCNPs (upconversion nanoparticles) heterostructure can effectively prevent the degradation of piezoelectric ZnSnO3 quantum dots in tumor environment, fully utilizing its piezoelectric catalytic effect as an antitumor carrier. Combined with the photodynamic therapy effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO3, a satisfactory therapeutic efficacy is realized.








Abstract
Sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy is hindered by the limited tissue penetration depth of the external light source and the quick recombination of electron&#8211;hole owing to the random movement of charge carriers. In this study, orthorhombic ZnSnO3 quantum dots (QDs) with piezo&#8208;photoelectronic effects are successfully encapsulated in hexagonal upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) using a one&#8208;pot thermal decomposition method to form an all&#8208;in&#8208;one watermelon&#8208;like structured sono&#8208;photosensitizer (ZnSnO3@UCNPs). The excited near&#8208;infrared light has high penetration depth, and the watermelon&#8208;like structure allows for full contact between the UCNPs and ZnSnO3 QDs, achieving ultrahigh F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer efficiency of up to 80.30%. Upon ultrasonic and near&#8208;infrared laser co&#8208;activation, the high temperature and pressure generated lead to the deformation of the UCNPs, thereby driving the deformation of all ZnSnO3 QDs inside the UCNPs, forming many small internal electric fields similar to isotropic electric domains. This piezoelectric effect not only increases the internal electric field intensity of the entire material but also prevents random movement and rapid recombination of charge carriers, thereby achieving satisfactory piezocatalytic performance. By combining the photodynamic effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO3, synergistic efficacy is realized. This study proposes a novel strategy for designing highly efficient sono&#8208;photosensitizers through structural design.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sono-photodynamic therapy is hindered by the limited tissue penetration depth of the external light source and the quick recombination of electron&#8211;hole owing to the random movement of charge carriers. In this study, orthorhombic ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots (QDs) with piezo-photoelectronic effects are successfully encapsulated in hexagonal upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) using a one-pot thermal decomposition method to form an all-in-one watermelon-like structured sono-photosensitizer (ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@UCNPs). The excited near-infrared light has high penetration depth, and the watermelon-like structure allows for full contact between the UCNPs and ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QDs, achieving ultrahigh F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer efficiency of up to 80.30%. Upon ultrasonic and near-infrared laser co-activation, the high temperature and pressure generated lead to the deformation of the UCNPs, thereby driving the deformation of all ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QDs inside the UCNPs, forming many small internal electric fields similar to isotropic electric domains. This piezoelectric effect not only increases the internal electric field intensity of the entire material but also prevents random movement and rapid recombination of charge carriers, thereby achieving satisfactory piezocatalytic performance. By combining the photodynamic effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, synergistic efficacy is realized. This study proposes a novel strategy for designing highly efficient sono-photosensitizers through structural design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Electron Synchronization Excitation for Photochemical Synthesis and Patterning Graphene&#8208;Based Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a novel approach for synthesizing and patterning electrodes using multi&#8208;point electron synchronization excitation. It not only significantly enhances the processing efficiency for micro&#8208;supercapacitors but also circumvents the influence of electrode morphology during the traditional laser direct writing. This strategy leads to enhanced electrochemical performance&#160;and better processing efficiency and quality of micro&#8208;supercapacitors.








Abstract
Micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) represent a pressing requirement for powering the forthcoming generation of micro&#8208;electronic devices. The simultaneous realization of high&#8208;efficiency synthesis of electrode materials and precision patterning for MSCs in a single step presents an ardent need, yet it poses a formidable challenge. Herein, a unique shaped laser&#8208;induced patterned electron synchronization excitation strategy has been put forward to photochemical synthesis RuO2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrode and simultaneously manufacture the micron&#8208;scale high&#8208;performance MSCs with ultra&#8208;high resolution. Significantly, the technique represents a noteworthy advancement over traditional laser direct writing (LDW) patterning and photoinduced synthetic electrode methods. It not only improves the processing efficiency for MSCs and the controllability of laser&#8208;induced electrode material but also enhances electric fields and potentials at the interface for better electrochemical performance. The resultant MSCs exhibit excellent area and volumetric capacitance (516&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1720&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3), and ultrahigh energy density (0.41&#160;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;3) and well&#8208;cycle stability (retaining 95% capacitance after 12000 cycles). This investigation establishes a novel avenue for electrode design and underscores substantial potential in the fabrication of diverse microelectronic devices.

         <title>Ultrastrong and High&#8208;Tough Thermoset Epoxy Resins from Hyperbranched Topological Structure and Subnanoscaled Free Volume</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the preparation of high&#8208;performance epoxy thermosets from hyperbranched epoxy, overcoming the two conflicts between strength and toughness and between high performance and highly efficient degradation. The in&#8208;situ simultaneous reinforcing and toughening mechanism is well investigated, being attributed to a synergistic effect of high crosslinking density, minimization of free volume, narrow free volume distribution, and hyperbranched structure.








Abstract
The strength and toughness of thermoset epoxy resins are generally mutually exclusive, as are the high performance and rapid recyclability. Experimentally determined mechanical strength values are usually much lower than their theoretical values. The preparation of thermoset epoxy resins with high modulus, high toughness, ultrastrong strength, and highly efficient recyclability is still a challenge. Here, novel hyperbranched epoxy resins (Bn, n = 6, 12, 24)&#160;with imide structures by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. Bn shows an excellent comprehensive function in simultaneously improving the strength, modulus, toughness, low&#8208;temperature resistance, and degradability of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol&#8208;A (DGEBA). All the mechanical properties first increase and then decrease with minimization of the free volume properties. The improvement is attributable to uniform molecular holes or free volume by a molecular mixture of linear and hyperbranched topological structures. The precise measurement and controllability of the molecular free volume properties of epoxy resins is first discovered, as well as the imide structure degradation of crosslinked epoxy resins. The two conflicts are successfully resolved between strength and toughness and between high performance during service and high efficiency during degradation. These findings provide a route for designing ultrastrong, tough, and recyclable thermoset epoxy resins.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature, Current&#8208;Induced Magnetization Self&#8208;Switching in A Van Der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In conventional switching heterostructures based on spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT), a spin source material with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling or broken inversion symmetry is typically required to generate SOT when a charge current is applied. In this study, we achieved current&#8208;induced self&#8208;switching of magnetization at room temperature using a layered polar magnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2, thereby greatly simplifying the structure for magnetization switching.








Abstract
2D layered materials with broken inversion symmetry are being extensively pursued as &#160;spin&#160;source layers to realize high&#8208;efficiency magnetic switching. Such low&#8208;symmetry layered systems are, however, scarce. In addition, most layered magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy show a low Curie temperature. Here, the experimental observation of spin&#8211;orbit torque magnetization self&#8208;switching at room temperature in a layered polar ferromagnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2 is reported. The spin&#8211;orbit torque is generated from the broken inversion symmetry along the c&#8208;axis of the crystal. These results provide a direct pathway toward applicable 2D spintronic devices.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Photothermal CO2 Methanation over Greenhouse&#8208;Like Plasmonic Superstructures of Ultrasmall Cobalt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic approach to enhance the efficiency of photothermal conversion while maintaining the excellent intrinsic catalytic reactivity for ultrasmall Co nanoparticles is demonstrated by integrating the &#8220;nano&#8208;greenhouse effect&#8221; with plasmonic coupling. This work reveals the great potential of nanoscale greenhouse effect in enhancing photothermal conversions through the combination with conventional promoting strategies.








Abstract
Improving the solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal energy conversion efficiency of photothermal nanomaterials at no expense of other physicochemical properties, e.g., the catalytic reactivity of metal nanoparticles, is highly desired for diverse applications but remains a big challenge. Herein, a synergistic strategy is developed for enhanced photothermal conversion by a greenhouse&#8208;like plasmonic superstructure of 4 nm cobalt nanoparticles while maintaining their intrinsic catalytic reactivity. The silica shell plays a key role in retaining the plasmonic superstructures for efficient use of the full solar spectrum, and reducing the heat loss of cobalt nanoparticles via the nano&#8208;greenhouse effect. The optimized plasmonic superstructure catalyst exhibits supra&#8208;photothermal CO2 methanation performance with a record&#8208;high rate of 2.3 mol gCo&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, close to 100% CH4 selectivity, and desirable catalytic stability. This work reveals the great potential of nanoscale greenhouse effect in enhancing photothermal conversions through the combination with conventional promoting strategies, shedding light on the design of efficient photothermal nanomaterials for demanding applications.

Inspired by the poison dart frog's skin with venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF&#8208;8 is prepared as a lubricant and injects into the silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SLIPS)&#8212;the slippery porous&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SPIPS) for neritic marine antifouling.








Abstract
Slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have received widespread attention in the antifouling field. However, the reduction in antifouling performance caused by lubricant loss limits their application in marine antifouling. Herein, inspired by the skin of a poison dart frog which contains venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF&#8208;8 is prepared as a lubricant and injected into a silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of SLIPS for marine antifouling applications: the slippery porous&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SPIPS). The SPIPS consists of a responsive antifoulant&#8208;releasing switch between &#8220;defensive&#8221; and &#8220;offensive&#8221; antifouling modes to intelligently enhance the antifouling effect after lubricant loss. The SPIPS can adjust antifouling performance to meet the antifouling requirements under different light conditions. The wastage of antifoulants is reduced, thereby effectively maintaining the durability and service life of SLIPS materials. The SPIPS exhibits efficient lubricant self&#8208;replenishment, self&#8208;cleaning, anti&#8208;protein, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;algal, and self&#8208;healing (97.48%) properties. Furthermore, it shows satisfactory 360&#8208;day antifouling performance in actual marine fields during boom seasons, demonstrating the longest antifouling lifespan in the field tests of reported SLIPS coatings. Hence, the SPIPS can effectively promote the development of SLIPS for neritic antifouling.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Based Optical Logic Operators Driven by Diffractive Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;compact optical quantum logic operator based on multifunctional metasurfaces is implemented under a spatial&#8208; and polarization&#8208;multiplexed strategy. Such a novel program for optical quantum computing is experimentally validated to achieve high fidelities (99.88%) for all four classical quantum logical gates at ultra&#8208;high operating speeds.








Abstract
In this paper, a novel optical logic operator based on the multifunctional metasurface driven by all&#8208;optical diffractive neural network is reported, which can perform four principal quantum logic operations (Pauli&#8208;X, Pauli&#8208;Y, Pauli&#8208;Z, and Hadamard gates). The two ground states |0&#10217;$|0 \rangle $ and |1&#10217;$|1 \rangle $&#8197;are characterized by two orthogonal linear polarization states. The proposed spatial&#8208; and polarization&#8208;multiplexed all&#8208;optical diffractive neural network only contains a hidden layer physically mapped as a metasurface with simple and compact unit cells, which dramatically reduces the volume and computing resources required for the system. The designed optical quantum operator is proven to achieve high fidelities for all four quantum logical gates, up to 99.96% numerically and 99.88% experimentally. The solution will facilitate the construction of large&#8208;scale optical quantum computing systems and scalable optical quantum devices.

         <title>Molecular Masking of Synthetic Immunomodulator Evokes Antitumor Immunity With Reduced Immune Tolerance and Systemic Toxicity by Temporal Activity Recovery and Sustained Stimulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinical application of toll&#8208;like receptor agonist (TLR7/8a)&#160;therapy is limited by systemic immune&#8208;associated toxicity and immune tolerance. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal activity recovery&#160;of TLR7/8a through prodrug&#8208;like TLR7/8a (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposomes (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) in a macroscale depot is designed.








Abstract
Activation of the innate immune system counteracts tumor&#8208;induced immunosuppression. Hence, small molecule&#8208;based toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonists (TLR7/8a), which can modulate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment along with the activation of innate immunity, are emerging as essential components of cancer immunotherapy. However, the clinical application of synthetic TLR7/8a therapies is limited by systemic immune&#8208;associated toxicity and immune tolerance induced by uncontrolled stimulatory activities and repeated treatments. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal recovery of the activity of TLR7/8a through prodrug&#8208;like TLR7/8a (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained and controlled release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposome (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) (NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8)) in a macroscale depot are designed. Immunization with cationic NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8) and anionic antigens triggers robust activation of innate immune cells as well as antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses, eliciting reprogramming of immunosuppressive cells into tumor&#8208;suppressive cells, with decreased systemic adverse effects and immune tolerance. Combination treatment with NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 plus anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) or nanoliposomes (Doxorubicin) has synergistic effects on antitumor immunity in various tumor models. The concept of pro&#8208;TLR7/8a suggested herein may facilitate the advancement of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based immunomodulators for clinical translation and safe and effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing film composed of titanium dioxide nanotube/silk fibroin is developed by an eco&#8208;friendly way. It is an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use platform for capturing and profiling heterogeneous circular tumor cells (CTCs) effectively and accurately from the unprocessed blood samples of patients, discriminating the CTCs with different surface biomarkers, showing the potential in molecular typing of breast cancer.








Abstract
Developing a robust strategy for profiling heterogeneous circular tumor cells specifically, distinguishing the phenotypes of which in blood sample of cancer patient precisely, and releasing them sequentially, is significant for cancer management by liquid biopsy. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired free&#8208;standing and flexible film composed of TiO2 nanotube and silk fibroin, fabricated with multiply dynamic bioactive surface (TSF/MDBS) by a simple and eco&#8208;friendly way including using polydopamine chemistry and dual dynamic covalent chemistry, is reported. The as&#8208;prepared TSF/MDBS binds specific peptides toward cells with epithelial biomarker and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) biomarker, and antifouling agents bovine serum albumin for obviating platelets and proteins adhering of blood, can capture heterogeneous CTCs with enhanced capability due to the cytocompatible soft film and exquisite surface design, and further release the captured cells as program, by specifically breaking down the covalent bonds in sequence via the action of adding biocompatible molecules fructose and glutathione. By applying the TSF/MDBS, it can be tailored into desired pieces for identifying CTCs with different phenotypes (HER2&#8208;high and HER2&#8208;low) from the unprocessed blood samples of breast cancer patients, and finally profiling these heterogeneous CTCs, to discriminate HER2 positive or negative of breast cancer patients in clinical applications.

         <title>Smart&#8208;Responsive HOF Heterostructures with Multiple Spatial&#8208;Resolved Emission Modes toward Photonic Security Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smart&#8208;responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) heterostructure is first realized based on the differentiated design on high&#8208;electronegative atoms of building blocks, which exhibit dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;controlled spatial&#8208;resolved emission modes, facilitating the construction of responsive photonic barcodes with multiple convert states. These results provide enlightenment on the function&#8208;oriented design of smart&#8208;responsive HOF heterosystem for advanced anticounterfeiting and information security applications.

Luminescent hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with the unique dynamics and versatile functional sites hold great potential application in information security, yet most of responsive HOFs focus on the single&#8208;component framework with restrained emission control, limiting further applications in advanced confidential information protection. Herein, the first smart&#8208;responsive HOF heterostructure with multiple spatial&#8208;resolved emission modes for covert photonic security platform is reported. The HOF heterostructures are prepared by integrating different HOFs into a single microwire based on a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth method. The distinct responsive behaviors of HOFs permit the heterostructure to simultaneously display the thermochromism via the framework transformation and the acidichromism via the protonation effect, thus generating multiple emission modes. The dual stimuli&#8208;controlled spatial&#8208;resolved emission modes constitute the fingerprint of a heterostructure, and enable the establishment of the smart&#8208;responsive photonic barcode with multiple convert states, which further demonstrate the dynamic coding capability and enhanced security in anticounterfeiting label applications. These results offer a promising route to design function&#8208;oriented smart responsive HOF microdevices toward advanced anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Adaptable Optothermal Nanotweezers for Trapping, Sorting, and Assembling across Diverse Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly&#8208;adaptable optothermal nanotweezer (HAONT) is a universal optothermal manipulation scheme with sub&#8208;10 nm precision, enabling trapping, sorting, assembling, and novel doughnut&#8208;shaped vortex trapping across diverse nanoparticles. Its versatility expands its functionality to a broad spectrum of nanoparticles, making it a useful tool for versatile nano&#8208;fabrication across various materials, charges, shapes, sizes, and beyond.








Abstract
Optical manipulation of various kinds of nanoparticles is vital in biomedical engineering. However, classical optical approaches demand higher laser power and are constrained by diffraction limits, necessitating tailored trapping schemes for specific nanoparticles. They lack a universal and biocompatible tool to manipulate nanoparticles of diverse sizes, charges, and materials. Through precise modulation of diffusiophoresis and thermo&#8208;osmotic flows in the boundary layer of an optothermal&#8208;responsive gold film, highly adaptable optothermal nanotweezers (HAONTs) capable of manipulating a single nanoparticle as small as sub&#8208;10&#160;nm are designed. Additionally, a novel optothermal doughnut&#8208;shaped vortex (DSV) trapping strategy is introduced, enabling a new mode of physical interaction between cells and nanoparticles. Furthermore, this versatile approach allows for the manipulation of nanoparticles in organic, inorganic, and biological forms. It also offers versatile function modes such as trapping, sorting, and assembling of nanoparticles. It is believed that this approach holds the potential to be a valuable tool in fields such as synthetic biology, optofluidics, nanophotonics, and colloidal science.

         <title>Artificial Photosynthetic System with Spatial Dual Reduction Site Enabling Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Step&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, recognized for their efficient charge transport and high redox capacity, are considered a viable approach to improve photocatalytic hydrogen production. In this study, a double S&#8208;scheme heterojunction featuring spatial dual reduction sites is developed. This design enhances solar hydrogen production and yields a high apparent quantum efficiency. This work contributes a significant approach to the development of more effective S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthetic systems.








Abstract
Although S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthesis shows promise for photocatalytic hydrogen production, traditional methods often overly concentrate on a single reduction site. This limitation results in inadequate redox capability and inefficient charge separation, which hampers the efficiency of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. To overcome this limitation, a double S&#8208;scheme system is proposed that leverages dual reduction sites, thereby preserving energetic photo&#8208;electrons and holes to enhance apparent quantum efficiency. The design features a double S&#8208;scheme junction consisting of CdS nanospheres decorated with anatase TiO2 nanoparticles coupled with graphitic C3N4. The as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a hydrogen evolution rate of 26.84&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 40.2% at 365 nm. This enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is ascribed to the efficient charge separation and transport induced by the double S&#8208;scheme. Both theoretical calculations and comprehensive spectroscopy tests (both in&#160;situ and ex&#160;situ) affirm the efficient charge transport across the catalyst interface. Moreover, substituting the reduction&#8208;type catalyst CdS with other similar sulfides like ZnIn2S4, ZnS, MoS2 and In2S3 further confirms the feasibility of the proposed double S&#8208;scheme configuration. The findings provide a pathway to designing more effective double S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthetic systems, opening up fresh perspectives in enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.

         <title>Highly Potent and Low&#8208;Volume Concentration Additives for Durable Aqueous Zinc Batteries: Machine Learning&#8208;Enabled Performance Rationalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;alkanediols with an optimal chain length are unveiled as highly potent low&#8208;volume concentration electrolyte additives to address the zinc anode rechargeability for the practical development of aqueous zinc batteries. A machine learning&#8208;based model that maps the performance relative to critical additive physicochemical descriptors is presented, which can lead the way for a rational approach to additive design and discoveries.








Abstract
The essential virtues of aqueous zinc battery chemistry stem from the energy&#8208;dense zinc metal anode and mild aqueous electrolytes. Yet, their incompatibility &#8211; as exposed by zinc's corrosion and associated dendrite problem &#8211; poses a challenge to achieving improved cycle life under practically relevant parameters. While electrolyte additives are a scalable strategy, additives that can function at low volume concentrations remain elusive. Here, through screening alkanol and alkanediol chemistries, 1,2&#8208;butanediol and pentanediol are unveiled as highly potent additives, which operate at a practical 1 volume% concentration owing to their ability to furnish dynamic solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase through pronounced interfacial filming. This unique mechanistic action renders effective corrosion and dendrite mitigation, resulting in up to five to twenty&#8208;fold zinc cyclability enhancement with a high Coulombic efficiency (up to 99.9%) and improved full&#8208;cell performance under demanding conditions, including at elevated temperatures. A machine learning&#8208;based analysis is presented to rationalize the additive performance relative to critical physicochemical descriptors, which can pave the way for a rational approach to efficient additive discoveries.

         <title>Epitaxial Ultrathin Pt Atomic Layers on CrN Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt atomic layers catalysts with electron&#8208;deficient Pt sites and epitaxial strain are successfully grown on low&#8208;cost CrN nanoparticles via a facile thermal ammonlysis method. The Pt atomic layers on CrN electrocatalyst deliver outstanding activity and durability for the formic acid oxidation reaction, guiding the development of low&#8208;cost Pt&#8208;based catalysts for various applications.








Abstract
The construction of platinum (Pt) atomic layers is an effective strategy to improve the utilization efficiency of Pt atoms in electrocatalysis, thus is important for reducing the capital costs of a wide range of energy storage and conversion devices. However, the substrates used to grow Pt atomic layers are largely limited to noble metals and their alloys, which is not conducive to reducing catalyst costs. Herein, low&#8208;cost chromium nitride (CrN) is utilized as a support for the loading of epitaxial ultrathin Pt atomic layers via a simple thermal ammonolysis method. Owing to the strong anchoring and electronic regulation of Pt atomic layers by CrN, the obtained Pt atomic layers&#160;catalyst (containing electron&#8208;deficient Pt sites) exhibits excellent activity and endurance for the formic acid oxidation reaction, with a mass activity of 5.17&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 that is 13.6 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. This novel strategy demonstrates that CrN can replace noble metals as a low&#8208;cost substrate for constructing Pt atomic layers catalysts.

         <title>Engineering Semicarbazide&#8208;Bearing Polypeptide Conjugates for Efficient Tumor Chemotherapy and Imaging of Tumor Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polypeptides containing semicarbazide moieties via direct polymerization of N&#8208;phenoxycarbonyl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acid (NPCA) based monomers. These polypeptides can be further decorated with ketone/aldehyde&#8208;containing agents with the formation of pH&#8208;cleavable semicarbazone linkages. The intracellular acidic pH&#8208;triggered release promotes drug escape from endolysosomes and enhances anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, which can be also employed for highly sensitive detection of tumor lesions.








Abstract
Polypeptide materials offer scalability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, rendering them an ideal platform for biomedical applications. However, the preparation of polypeptides with specific functional groups, such as semicarbazide moieties, remains challenging. This work reports, for the first time, the straightforward synthesis of well&#8208;defined methoxy&#8208;terminated poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;polypeptide hybrid block copolymers (HBCPs) containing semicarbazide moieties. This synthesis involves implementing the direct polymerization of environment&#8208;stable N&#8208;phenoxycarbonyl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acid (NPCA) precursors, thereby avoiding the handling of labile N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers. The resulting HBCPs containing semicarbazide moieties enable facile functionalization with aldehyde/ketone derivatives, forming pH&#8208;cleavable semicarbazone linkages for tailored drug release. Particularly, the intracellular pH&#8208;triggered hydrolysis of semicarbazone moieties restores the initial semicarbazide residues, facilitating endo&#8208;lysosomal escape and thus improving therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, the integration of the hypoxic probe (Ir(btpna)(bpy)2) into the pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicines allows sequential responses to acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironments, enabling precise detection of metastatic tumors. The innovative approach for designing bespoke functional polypeptides holds promise for advanced drug delivery and precision therapeutics.

         <title>Polyester Nanofiltration Membranes for Efficient Cations Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyester nanofiltration membrane for cation separation is prepared by interfacial polymerization of TET with TMC. The &#8220;hydroxyl&#8208;ammonium&#8221; entities in the TET confer the TET&#8208;TMC membrane with dense structures and positive surface charge, leading to MgCl2 retention (95.5%) significantly higher than other polyester nanofiltration membranes (&lt;50%).








Abstract
Polyester nanofiltration membranes highlight beneficial chlorine resistance, but their loose structures and negative charge result in poor cations retention precluding advanced use in cations separation. This work designs a new monomer (TET) containing &#8220;hydroxyl&#8208;ammonium&#8221; entities that confer dense structures and positive charge to polyester nanofiltration membranes. The TET monomer undergoes efficient interfacial polymerization with the trimesoyl chloride (TMC) monomer, and the resultant TET&#8208;TMC membranes feature one of the lowest molecular weight cut&#8208;offs (389&#160;Da) and the highest zeta potential (4&#160;mv, pH: 7) among all polyester nanofiltration membranes. The MgCl2 rejection of the TET&#8208;TMC membrane is 95.5%, significantly higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyester nanofiltration membranes (&lt;50%). The Li+/Mg2+ separation performance of TET&#8208;TMC membrane is on par with cutting&#8208;edge polyamide membranes, while additionally, the membrane is stable against NaClO though polyamide membranes readily degrade. Thus the TET&#8208;TMC is the first polyester nanofiltration membrane for efficient cations separation.

         <title>High Output Power and High Quantum Efficiency in Novel NIR Phosphor MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ with Profound FWHM Variation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared phosphor MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:0.05Cr3+ exhibits impressive external quantum efficiency and output power. MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ undergoes a transition from ultra&#8208;narrowband to ultra&#8208;broadband emission as the Cr3+ concentration increased, driven by energy transfer between the three emitting centers.








Abstract
There is strong demand for ultraefficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors with adjustable emission properties for next&#8208;generation intelligent NIR light sources. Designing phosphors with large full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) variations is challenging. In this study, novel near&#8208;ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diode&#160;(LED)&#8208;excited NIR phosphors, MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ (MAGBO:Cr3+), with three emission centers achieve ultra&#8208;narrowband (FWHM = 29&#160;nm) to ultra&#8208;broadband (FWHM = 260&#160;nm) emission with increasing Cr3+ concentration. Gaussian fitting and decay time analysis reveal the alteration in the FWHM, which is attributed to the energy transfer occurring between the three emission centers. The distinct thermal quenching behaviors of the three emission centers are revealed through the temperature&#8208;dependent decay times. The ultra&#8208;broadband NIR phosphor MAGBO:0.05Cr3+ exhibits high thermal stability (85%, 425 K) and exceptional external quantum efficiency of 68.5%. An NIR phosphor&#8208;converted LED (pc&#8208;LED) is fabricated using MAGBO:0.05Cr3+ phosphor, exhibiting a remarkable NIR output power of 136&#160;mW at 600&#160;mA in ultra&#8208;broadband NIR pc&#8208;LEDs. This study describes the preparation of highly efficient phosphors and provides a further understanding of the tunable FWHM, which is vital for high&#8208;performance NIR phosphors with versatile applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Wearable Organic Photodetectors by Molecular Design and Green Solvent Processing for Pulse Oximetry and Photoplethysmography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic photodetectors processed from a biomass&#8208;derived solvent, namely 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, which simultaneously exhibits a remarkably high detectivity and surpasses the performances of devices processed from conventional chlorinated solvents, are developed. Furthermore, such devices can also be used as smart wearable devices for medical applications, such as heart pulse rate monitoring and blood oxygen saturation assessment.








Abstract
White&#8208;light detection from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared region is central to many applications such as high&#8208;speed cameras, autonomous vehicles, and wearable electronics. While organic photodetectors (OPDs) are being developed for such applications, several challenges must be overcome to produce scalable high&#8208;detectivity OPDs. This includes issues associated with low responsivity, narrow absorption range, and environmentally friendly device fabrication. Here, an OPD system processed from 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MeTHF) sets a record in light detectivity, which is also comparable with commercially available silicon&#8208;based photodiodes is reported. The newly designed OPD is employed in wearable devices to monitor heart rate and blood oxygen saturation using a flexible OPD&#8208;based finger pulse oximeter. In achieving this, a framework for a detailed understanding of the structure&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationship in these OPDs is also developed. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) thin films processed from 2&#8208;MeTHF are characterized at different length scales with advanced techniques. The BHJ morphology exhibits optimal intermixing and phase separation of donor and acceptor moieties, which facilitates the charge generation and collection process. Benefitting from high charge carrier mobilities and a low shunt leakage current, the newly developed OPD exhibits a specific detectivity of above 1012&#160;Jones over 400&#8211;900&#160;nm, which is higher than those of reference devices processed from chlorobenzene and&#160;ortho&#8208;xylene.

         <title>A &#8220;One Arrow Three Eagle&#8221; Strategy to Improve CM&#8208;272 Primed Bladder Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>

MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 cannot only promote the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 for O2&#8208;compensated SDT but also reduce the high level of GSH to enhance the reactive oxygen species, inducing ferroptosis and apoptosis. Significantly, MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 actives ICD to enhance T&#8208;cell receptor activation to better respond to ICI (&#945;PD&#8208;1). Hence, this effective &#8220;one arrow three eagle&#8221; strategy improves CM&#8208;272 primed bladder cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy using an immune&#8208;checkpoint blockade has significantly improved its therapeutic effects. CM&#8208;272, which is a novel epigenetic inhibitor of G9a, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) for recovering the sensitivity to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies; however, the efficacy of CM&#8208;272 is greatly limited by promoting the transcription activity of HIF&#8208;1&#945; to form a hypoxic environment. Here, a Fe3+&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MIL&#8208;53) is used to load CM&#8208;272 (ultra&#8208;high loading rate of 56.4%) for realizing an MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 nanoplatform. After entering bladder cancer cells, Fe3+ not only promotes the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 for O2&#8208;compensated sonodynamic therapy but reduces the high level of glutathione in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for enhancing reactive oxygen species, including ferroptosis and apoptosis. MIL&#8208;53 carriers can be degraded in response to the TME, accelerating the release of CM&#8208;272, which helps achieve the maximum effectiveness in an O2&#8208;sufficient TME by attenuating drug resistance. Furthermore, MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 enhances dendritic cell maturation and synergistically combines it with an anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein 1 antibody during the study of immune&#8208;related pathways in the transcriptomes of bladder cancer cells using RNA&#8208;seq. This study presents the first instance of amalgamating nanomedicine with CM&#8208;272, inducing apoptosis, ferroptosis, and ICD to achieve the &#8220;one arrow three eagle&#8221; effect.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Nanophosphors Based on CuInSe2 Quantum Dots with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield for Micro&#8208;LEDs Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors based on CuInSe2 quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaking from 750 to 1150&#160;nm and a high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield of 92.8% are reported. Notably, NIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with an output power of 88.7mW@350&#160;mA and bright micro&#8208;LEDs arrays with diameters less than 5&#160;&#181;m are achieved based on these QDs.








Abstract
Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent nanomaterials are urgently required for portable mini or micro phosphors&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs). However, most existing NIR&#8208;emitting phosphors are generally restricted by their low photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) or large particle size. Herein, a kind of highly efficient NIR nanophosphors is developed based on copper indium selenide quantum dots (CISe QDs). The PL peak of these QDs can be exquisitely manipulated from 750 to 1150&#160;nm by altering the stoichiometry of Cu/In and doping with Zn2+. Their absolute PLQY can be significantly improved from 28.6% to 92.8% via coating a ZnSe shell. By combining the phosphors with a commercial blue chip, an NIR pc&#8208;LED is fabricated with remarkable photostability and a record&#8208;high radiant flux of 88.7 mW@350&#160;mA among the Pb/Cd&#8208;free QDs&#8208;based NIR pc&#8208;LEDs. Particularly, such QDs&#8208;based nanophosphors acted as excellent luminescence converter for NIR micro&#8208;LEDs with microarray diameters below 5&#160;&#181;m, which significantly exceeds the resolutions of current commercial inkjet display pixels. The findings may open new avenues for the exploration of highly efficient NIR micro&#8208;LEDs in a variety of applications.

         <title>Synchronous Diagnosis of Respiratory Viruses Variants via Receptonics Based on Modeling Receptor&#8210;Ligand Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A receptor&#8211;ligand binding reaction based receptonics platform is presented as a facile diagnostic device to discriminate numerous strains of respiratory viruses. Diagnosis of respiratory viruses and their variants indicate its potential as on&#8208;site screening platform for fatal diseases without the need for complex additional equipment. The newly developed receptonics shows the possibility for the application of clinical samples and samples from primate model.








Abstract
The transmission and pathogenesis of highly contagious fatal respiratory viruses are increasing, and the need for an on&#8208;site diagnostic platform has arisen as an issue worldwide. Furthermore, as the spread of respiratory viruses continues, different variants have become the dominant circulating strains. To prevent virus transmission, the development of highly sensitive and accurate on&#8208;site diagnostic assays is urgently needed. Herein, a facile diagnostic device is presented for multi&#8208;detection based on the results of detailed receptor&#8210;ligand dynamics simulations for the screening of various viral strains. The novel bioreceptor&#8208;treated electronics (receptonics) device consists of a multichannel graphene transistor and cell&#8208;entry receptors conjugated to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). An ultrasensitive multi&#8208;detection performance is achieved without the need for sample pretreatment, which will enable rapid diagnosis and prevent the spread of pathogens. This platform can be applied for the diagnosis of variants of concern in clinical respiratory virus samples and primate models. This multi&#8208;screening platform can be used to enhance surveillance and discriminate emerging virus variants before they become a severe threat to public health.

         <title>Engineered Bio&#8208;Heterojunction Confers Extra&#8208; and Intracellular Bacterial Ferroptosis and Hunger&#8208;Triggered Cell Protection for Diabetic Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise ferroptosis bio&#8208;heterojunction (F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ) consisting of Fe2O3, Ti3C2&#8208;MXene, and glucose oxidase is developed to induce extra&#8208;intracellular bacteria&#8208;targeted ferroptosis for infected diabetic cutaneous regeneration. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ induces extracellular bacterial ferroptosis via photothermal, photodynamic, and chemodynamic properties and assists macrophages against intracellular bacteria via ferroportin&#8208;mediated bacterial ferroptosis and hunger&#8208;triggered AMPK pathway&#8208;mediated cell protection, elevating the biocompatibility of ferroptosis&#8208;mediated therapeutic strategies.








Abstract
Nanomaterial&#8208;mediated ferroptosis has garnered considerable interest in the antibacterial field, as it invokes the disequilibrium of ion homeostasis and boosts lipid peroxidation in extra&#8208; and intracellular bacteria. However, current ferroptosis&#8208;associated antibacterial strategies indiscriminately pose damage to healthy cells, ultimately compromising their biocompatibility. To address this daunting issue, this work has designed a precise ferroptosis bio&#8208;heterojunction (F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ) consisting of Fe2O3, Ti3C2&#8208;MXene, and glucose oxidase (GOx) to induce extra&#8208;intracellular bacteria&#8208;targeted ferroptosis for infected diabetic cutaneous regeneration. Fe2O3/Ti3C2&#8208;MXene@GOx (FMG) catalytically generates a considerable amount of ROS which assaults the membrane of extracellular bacteria, facilitating the permeation of synchronously generated Fe2+/Fe3+ into bacteria under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, causing planktonic bacterial death via ferroptosis, Fe2+ overload, and lipid peroxidation. Additionally, FMG facilitates intracellular bacterial ferroptosis by transporting Fe2+ into intracellular bacteria via inward ferroportin (FPN). With GOx consuming glucose, FMG creates hunger protection which helps macrophages escape cell ferroptosis by activating the adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. In vivo results authenticate that FMG boosts diabetic infectious cutaneous regeneration without triggering ferroptosis in normal cells. As envisaged, the proposed tactic provides a promising approach to combat intractable infections by precisely terminating extra&#8208;intracellular infection via steerable ferroptosis, thereby markedly elevating the biocompatibility of therapeutic ferroptosis&#8208;mediated strategies.

Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MXene@GOx (FMG) catalytically generates a considerable amount of ROS which assaults the membrane of extracellular bacteria, facilitating the permeation of synchronously generated Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; into bacteria under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, causing planktonic bacterial death via ferroptosis, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload, and lipid peroxidation. Additionally, FMG facilitates intracellular bacterial ferroptosis by transporting Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into intracellular bacteria via inward ferroportin (FPN). With GOx consuming glucose, FMG creates hunger protection which helps macrophages escape cell ferroptosis by activating the adenosine 5&#8217;-monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. In vivo results authenticate that FMG boosts diabetic infectious cutaneous regeneration without triggering ferroptosis in normal cells. As envisaged, the proposed tactic provides a promising approach to combat intractable infections by precisely terminating extra-intracellular infection via steerable ferroptosis, thereby markedly elevating the biocompatibility of therapeutic ferroptosis-mediated strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Based Macrophage&#8208;Like Nanoparticles for Targeted Photothermal Therapy and Virus Transmission Blockage in Monkeypox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise therapeutic, prevention, and control strategy for monkeypox, based on an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) loaded macrophage&#8208;like biomimetic nanoparticle (TBD@M NPs), is developed. TBD@M NPs achieve NIR&#8208;II fluorescent tracking of the monkeypox lesions and photothermal eradication of monkeypox virus after intravenous injection followed by 808&#160;nm laser stimulation, thus accomplishing monkeypox treatment, wound healing promoting, and virus transmission blockage.








Abstract
The recent prevalence of monkeypox has led to the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Monkeypox lesions are typically ulcers or pustules (containing high titers of replication&#8208;competent virus) in the skin and mucous membranes, which allow monkeypox virus to transmit predominantly through intimate contact. Currently, effective clinical treatments for monkeypox are lacking, and strategies for blocking virus transmission are fraught with drawbacks. Herein, this work constructs a biomimetic nanotemplate (termed TBD@M NPs) with macrophage membranes as the coat and polymeric nanoparticles loading a versatile aggregation&#8208;induced emission featured photothermal molecule TPE&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ as the core. In a surrogate mouse model of monkeypox (vaccinia&#8208;virus&#8208;infected tail scarification model), intravenously injected TBD@M NPs show precise tracking and near&#8208;infrared region II fluorescence imaging of the lesions. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, the virus is eliminated by the photothermal effect and the infected wound heals rapidly. More importantly, the inoculation of treated lesion tissue suspensions does not trigger tail infection or inflammatory activation in healthy mice, indicating successful blockage of virus transmission. This study demonstrates for the first time monkeypox theranostics using nanomedicine, and may bring a new insight into the development of a viable strategy for monkeypox management in clinical trials.

         <title>Asymmetric &#928;&#8208;Bridge Engineering Enables High&#8208;Permittivity Benzo[1,2&#8208;B:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]Difuran&#8208;Conjugated Polymer for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric &#960;&#8208;bridge engineering is proposed to improve the permittivity of polymer donors without impairing their miscibility with acceptor materials. Asymmetric &#960;&#8208;bridge benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran (BDF)&#8208;based polymer PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz demonstrates larger permittivity, smaller exciton binding energy, and more favorable molecular packing than its counterparts, leading to proficient charge dynamics and a promising power conversion efficiency of 18.10% with a remarkable fill factor of 80.11% for derived devices.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibit complex charge dynamics, which are closely correlated with the dielectric constant (&#603;r) of photovoltaic materials. In this work, a series of novel conjugated copolymers based on benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran (BDF) and benzotriazole (BTz) is designed and synthesized, which differ by the nature of &#960;&#8208;bridge from one another. The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz with asymmetric furan and thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge demonstrates a larger &#603;r of 4.22 than PBDF&#8208;dT&#8208;BTz with symmetric thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.15) and PBDF&#8208;dF&#8208;BTz with symmetric furan &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.90). The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz also offers more favorable molecular packing and appropriate miscibility with non&#8208;fullerene acceptor Y6 than its counterparts. The corresponding PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6 OSCs display efficient exciton dissociation, fast charge transport and collection, and reduced charge recombination, eventually leading to a power conversion efficiency of 17.01%. When introducing a fullerene derivative (PCBO&#8208;12) as a third component, the PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6:PCBO&#8208;12 OSCs yield a remarkable FF of 80.11% with a high efficiency of 18.10%, the highest value among all reported BDF&#8208;polymer&#8208;based OSCs. This work provides an effective approach to developing high&#8208;permittivity photovoltaic materials, showcasing PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz as a promising polymer donor for constructing high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Black Barium Titanate for Multienzyme&#8208;Piezoelectric Synergetic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich black barium titanate nanoparticles for amplified piezocatalytic tumor therapy based on the narrowing of the bandgap and the suppression of carrier recombination processes through the introduction of the Pd component.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic tumor therapy is an emerging reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;generating therapeutic approach that relies on piezoelectric polarization under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Optimizing ROS production is a primary objective for enhancing treatment efficiency. In this study, oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich Pd&#8208;integrated black barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticles are rationally engineered to boost the ROS generation efficiency via the introduction of Pd. Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation at low temperatures narrows the bandgap of BTO and reduces the recombination rate of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Furthermore, Pd has dual&#8208;enzyme&#8208;mimicking characteristics, including peroxidase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;mimicking activities, which further heighten the therapeutic efficacy by enhancing ROS production and reversing the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Importantly, the dual enzymatic activity of Pd can be amplified by multiple redox processes sparked by the piezoelectric potential under US stimulation, resulting in bilaterally enhanced multienzyme&#8208;piezoelectric synergetic therapy. In vitro and in vivo results confirm high tumor inhibition in murine breast cancer cells. This work stresses the critical effects of defect engineering&#8208;optimized piezodynamic tumor therapy.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Magnesium Deposition Induced by Paper&#8208;Based Triple&#8208;Gradient Scaffolds toward Flexible Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible paper&#8208;based scaffold exhibiting gradient conductivity, magnesiophilicity, and pore size is fabricated using an industrially compatible papermaking process. This triple&#8208;gradient design controls the Mg ion flux for bottom&#8208;up deposition, facilitating superior cyclability. The high flexibility and minimal thickness of the scaffold align well with the emerging demand for flexible and wearable electronics, signaling a robust pathway for their advancement.








Abstract
The development of advanced magnesium metal batteries (MMBs) has been hindered by longstanding challenges, such as the inability to induce uniform magnesium (Mg) nucleation and the inefficient utilization of Mg foil. This study introduces a novel solution in the form of a flexible, lightweight, paper&#8208;based scaffold that incorporates gradient conductivity, magnesiophilicity, and pore size. This design is achieved through an industrially adaptable papermaking process in which the ratio of carboxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes to softwood cellulose fibers is meticulously adjusted. The triple&#8208;gradient structure of the scaffold enables the regulation of Mg ion flux, promoting bottom&#8208;up Mg deposition. Owing to its high flexibility, low thickness, and reduced density, the scaffold has potential applications in flexible and wearable electronics. Accordingly, the triple&#8208;gradient electrodes exhibit stable operation for over 1200&#160;h at 3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 in symmetrical cells, markedly outperforming the non&#8208;gradient and metallic Mg alternatives. Notably, this study marks the first successful fabrication of a flexible MMB pouch full cell, achieving an impressive volumetric energy density of 244&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1. The simplicity and scalability of the triple&#8208;gradient design, which uses readily available materials through an industrially compatible papermaking process, open new doors for the production of flexible, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries.

Owing to its high flexibility, low thickness, and reduced density, the scaffold has potential applications in flexible and wearable electronics. Accordingly, the triple-gradient electrodes exhibit stable operation for over 1200&#160;h at 3&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in symmetrical cells, markedly outperforming the non-gradient and metallic Mg alternatives. Notably, this study marks the first successful fabrication of a flexible MMB pouch full cell, achieving an impressive volumetric energy density of 244&#160;Wh&#160;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The simplicity and scalability of the triple-gradient design, which uses readily available materials through an industrially compatible papermaking process, open new doors for the production of flexible, high-energy-density metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin Clay Nanoparticles&#8208;Mediated Mutual Reinforcement of Ferroptosis and Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mutual reinforcement of ferroptosis and antitumor immunity is a promising strategy to overcome the drawbacks of current immunotherapy. Effective interferon &#947; (IFN&#947;)&#160;delivery sensitizes tumor cells to ferroptosis induced by an ultrathin Mn&#8208;based clay nanocarrier. Immunogenic cancer cell death and tumor microenvironment modulation evoke strong immune response. Meanwhile, cytotoxic T cells released IFN&#947; in turn promotes ferroptosis occurrence.








Abstract
Ferroptosis&#8208;triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD) is widely adopted to potentiate the body's antitumor immunity by catalyzing the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the efficacy of ferroptosis and immunotherapy is greatly restricted by intracellular abundant glutathione (GSH) and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a facile bottom&#8208;up method for solvent&#8208;free synthesis of ultrathin manganese (Mn)&#8208;based layered double hydroxide nanosheets with high loading efficiency for pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN&#947;) (IFN&#947;/uMn&#8208;LDHs) is proposed to mutually reinforce the ferroptosis and systemic immunity. The introduction of manganese ions significantly contributes to GSH depletion and hydroxyl radical generation, which can be further enhanced by IFN&#947; delivery&#8208;induced SLC7A11 downregulation. The ICD effect after cell ferroptosis cooperates with the intrinsic immunomodulatory property of IFN&#947;/uMn&#8208;LDHs to facilitate the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the priming of T cells. IFN&#947; secretion from activated CD8+ T cells in turn involves cascade immunogenic ferroptosis, thus constructing a closed&#8208;loop therapy. Remarkably, a potent abscopal effect is observed in the growth inhibition of both primary and distant tumors. Overall, the ultrathin Mn&#8208;based clay nanoplatform provides a simple approach for mutual regulation between ferroptosis and antitumor immune response, overcoming the obstacles of current cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Robust Ru&#8208;VO2 Bifunctional Catalysts for All&#8208;pH Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;VO2 catalysts containing Ru&#8208;doped VO2 and Ru nanoparticles are synthesized, and it shows excellent water splitting performance in all&#8208;pH range. The in&#8208;situ characterizations and Theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that synergy of Ru Nanoparticles and Ru&#8208;doped VO2 breaks the hydrogen bond network formed by *OH adsorbed on the Ru single&#8208;atom site, and thereby significantly boosts the acidic oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Designing robust bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction in all&#8208;pH conditions for overall water splitting (OWS) is an effective way to achieve sustainable development. Herein, a composite Ru&#8208;VO2 containing Ru&#8208;doped VO2 and Ru nanoparticles (NPs) is synthesized, and it shows a high OWS performance in full&#8208;pH range due to their synergist effect. In particular, the OER mass activities of Ru&#8208;VO2 at 1.53 V (vs RHE) in acidic, alkaline, and PBS solutions are &#8776;65, 36, and 235 times of commercial RuO2 in the same conditions. The &#8220;Ru&#8208;VO2 || Ru&#8208;VO2&#8221; two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer only needs a voltage of 1.515 V (at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) in acidic water splitting, which can operate stably for 125 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 without significant voltage decay. In situ Raman spectra and in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry prove that the OER of Ru&#8208;VO2 in acid follows the adsorption evolution mechanism. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the synergistic effect between Ru NP and Ru&#8208;doped VO2, which breaks the hydrogen bond network formed by *OH adsorbed on the Ru single&#8208;atom site, and thereby significantly enhances the OER activity. This work provides new insights into the design of novel bifunctional pH&#8208;universal catalysts for OWS.

Ultraconfined Plasmons
In article number 2302520, J. Enrique Ortega, F. Javier Garc&#237;a de Abajo, and co&#8208;workers present a new approach to fabricating ultrathin crystalline silver films consisting of a few atomic layers in thickness and featuring collective electron oscillations&#8212;plasmons&#8212;with an unprecedented combination of spatial confinement and long lifetimes. The image illustrates one of those structures, where bowtie pillars are carved from a silicon wafer, followed by a chemical and physical treatment that flattens the upper surface, and subsequent epitaxial deposition of a controlled number of silver (111) atomic layers. The resulting silver bowtie structures present confined plasmons at the gap region with a quality factor (spectral frequency&#8208;to&#8208;width ratio) approaching ten and a spatial footprint of a few tens of nanometers.

Intracranial Drug Delivery
In article number 2306876 by Niandong Jiao, Anhua Wu, Lianqing Liu, and co&#8208;workers, a marsupial robotic system combining a continuum robot (mother robot) with nanorobots (child robots) is developed for cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery. A magnetic catheter robot goes through a minimally invasive channel on the skull and enters deep into the brain along a curved path. The hollow catheter robot releases nanorobots when reaching the location of the brain tumor. Then the nanorobots further advance to the tumor and release the loaded drugs to kill the brain tumor.

Vesicle Assemblies with DNA Nanorulers
In article number 2308344, Min Li, Xiaolei Zuo, and co&#8208;workers used synthetic vesicles and DNA nanorulers to reconstruct in vitro the vesicle assemblies that mimic vesicle clusters in living cells. They demonstrate the amperometric monitoring of vesicle assemblies using nanoelectrode with high precision. The further application in vivo enables to analyze the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of vesicle clusters in cells and release events heterogeneity in different positions across the cell.

         <title>3D Printing of Self&#8208;Healing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article critically summarizes the recent literature on 3D printable materials and structures with self&#8208;healing characteristics, emphasizing the intimate relationship between chemical and physical properties and printability, toward the design and fabrication of advanced components. Moreover, it highlights actual applications, envisaging future directions of investigation.








Abstract
This review article presents a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in the field of 3D printable structures with self&#8208;healing properties. Three&#8208;dimensional printing (3DP) is a versatile technology that enables the rapid manufacturing of complex geometric structures with precision and functionality not previously attainable. However, the application of 3DP technology is still limited by the availability of materials with customizable properties specifically designed for additive manufacturing. The addition of self&#8208;healing properties within 3D printed objects is of high interest as it can improve the performance and lifespan of structural components, and even enable the mimicking of living tissues for biomedical applications, such as organs printing. The review will discuss and analyze the most relevant results reported in recent years in the development of self&#8208;healing polymeric materials that can be processed via 3D printing. After introducing the chemical and physical self&#8208;healing mechanism that can be exploited, the literature review here reported will focus in particular on printability and repairing performances. At last, actual perspective and possible development field will be critically discussed.

         <title>Technology and Integration Roadmap for Optoelectronic Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoelectronic memristors (OMs) can emulate neurological functions within a bionic computing architecture, enabling energy&#8208;efficient in&#8208;memory computing. Identifying suitable techniques for integrating materials into integrated circuit platforms is imperative to advance the field. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental performance, mechanism, structures, applications, and integration roadmap of OMs aiming to establish a connection between materials and OM systems.








Abstract
Optoelectronic memristors (OMs) have emerged as a promising optoelectronic Neuromorphic computing paradigm, opening up new opportunities for neurosynaptic devices and optoelectronic systems. These OMs possess a range of desirable features including minimal crosstalk, high bandwidth, low power consumption, zero latency, and the ability to replicate crucial neurological functions such as vision and optical memory. By incorporating large&#8208;scale parallel synaptic structures, OMs are anticipated to greatly enhance high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power in&#8208;memory computing, effectively overcoming the limitations of the von Neumann bottleneck. However, progress in this field necessitates a comprehensive understanding of suitable structures and techniques for integrating low&#8208;dimensional materials into optoelectronic integrated circuit platforms. This review aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the fundamental performance, mechanisms, design of structures, applications, and integration roadmap of optoelectronic synaptic memristors. By establishing connections between materials, multilayer optoelectronic memristor units, and monolithic optoelectronic integrated circuits, this review seeks to provide insights into emerging technologies and future prospects that are expected to drive innovation and widespread adoption in the near future.

         <title>Engineered Synthetic Matrices for Human Intestinal Organoid Culture and Therapeutic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from pluripotent stem cells or adult stem cell biopsies represent a powerful platform to study human development, drug testing, and disease modeling, and serve as a cell source for tissue regeneration. Synthetic hydrogels can be engineered to serve as analogs of the extracellular matrix to support HIO growth and delivery vehicles in therapeutic applications. 








Abstract
Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from pluripotent stem cells or adult stem cell biopsies represent a powerful platform to study human development, drug testing, and disease modeling in vitro, and serve as a cell source for tissue regeneration and therapeutic advances in vivo. Synthetic hydrogels can be engineered to serve as analogs of the extracellular matrix to support HIO growth and differentiation. These hydrogels allow for tuning the mechanical and biochemical properties of the matrix, offering an advantage over biologically derived hydrogels such as Matrigel. Human intestinal organoids have been used for repopulating transplantable intestinal grafts and for in vivo delivery to an injured intestinal site. The use of synthetic hydrogels for in vitro culture and for in vivo delivery is expected to significantly increase the relevance of human intestinal organoids for drug screening, disease modeling, and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Interfacial Assembly of 2D Graphene&#8208;Derived Ion Channels for Water&#8208;Based Green Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational materials selection/design and thorough mechanism research in water&#8208;based green energy conversion are essential scientific issues to be imminently discussed for future development of 2D graphene&#8208;derived ion channels (2D&#8208;GDICs) through interfacial assembly. Such review and prospects about 2D&#8208;GDIC from synthesis to applications including stability and functionalization would also provide a reference for other 2D materials to fabricate sophisticated ion channels.








Abstract
The utilization of sustained and green energy is believed to alleviate increasing menace of global environmental concerns and energy dilemma. Interfacial assembly of 2D graphene&#8208;derived ion channels (2D&#8208;GDICs) with tunable ion/fluid transport behavior enables efficient harvesting of renewable green energy from ubiquitous water, especially for osmotic energy harvesting. In this review, various interfacial assembly strategies for fabricating diverse 2D&#8208;GDICs are summarized and their ion transport properties are discussed. This review analyzes how particular structure and charge density/distribution of 2D&#8208;GDIC can be modulated to minimize internal resistance of ion/fluid transport and enhance energy conversion efficiency, and highlights stimuli&#8208;responsive functions and stability of 2D&#8208;GDIC and further examines the possibility of integrating 2D&#8208;GDIC with other energy conversion systems. Notably, the presented preparation and applications of 2D&#8208;GDIC also inspire and guide other 2D materials to fabricate sophisticated ion channels for targeted applications. Finally, potential challenges in this field is analyzed and a prospect to future developments toward high&#8208;performance or large&#8208;scale real&#8208;word applications is offered.

         <title>Engineering Kirigami Frameworks Toward Real&#8208;World Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the basic deformation mechanisms inherent to kirigami design, summarizes the most distinguished properties of kirigami induced by cutting and folding, and overviews how each property can be leveraged to tackle challenges across various domains. It envisions that this work will inspire further innovation in metamaterials and encourage the community to address the challenges posed by real&#8208;world&#160;applications.








Abstract
The surge in advanced manufacturing techniques has led to a paradigm shift in the realm of material design from developing completely new chemistry to tailoring geometry within existing materials. Kirigami, evolved from a traditional cultural and artistic craft of cutting and folding, has emerged as a powerful framework that endows simple 2D sheets with unique mechanical, thermal, optical, and acoustic properties, as well as shape&#8208;shifting capabilities. Given its flexibility, versatility, and ease of fabrication, there are significant efforts in developing kirigami algorithms to create various architectured materials for a wide range of applications. This review summarizes the fundamental mechanisms that govern the transformation of kirigami structures and elucidates how these mechanisms contribute to their distinctive properties, including high stretchability and adaptability, tunable surface topography, programmable shape morphing, and characteristics of bistability and multistability. It then highlights several promising applications enabled by the unique kirigami designs and concludes with an outlook on the future challenges and perspectives of kirigami&#8208;inspired metamaterials toward real&#8208;world&#160;applications.

         <title>Strain Engineering in Perovskites: Mutual Insight on Oxides and Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxide and halide perovskites play a key role in various energy conversion devices such as piezoelectric devices, catalysts, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors. This review covers the latest studies on strain engineering in both oxide and halide perovskites for energy conversion devices. The work provides a new insight that can lead breakthroughs for high performance energy conversion devices.








Abstract
Perovskite materials have garnered significant attention over the past decades due to their applications, not only in electronic materials, such as dielectrics, piezoelectrics, ferroelectrics, and superconductors but also in optoelectronic devices like solar cells and light emitting diodes. This interest arises from their versatile combinations and physiochemical tunability. While strain engineering is a recognized powerful tool for tailoring material properties, its collaborative impact on both oxides and halides remains understudied. Herein, strain engineering in perovskites for energy conversion devices, providing mutual insight into both oxides and halides is discussed. The various experimental methods are presented for applying strain by using thermal mismatch, lattice mismatch, defects, doping, light illumination, and flexible substrates. In addition, the main factors that are influenced by strain, categorized as structure (e.g., symmetry breaking, octahedral distortion), bandgap, chemical reactivity, and defect formation energy are described. After that, recent progress in strain engineering for perovskite oxides and halides for energy conversion devices is introduced. Promising methods for enhancing the performance of energy conversion devices using perovskites through strain engineering are suggested.

         <title>Active Materials for Functional Origami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Origami has emerged as a popular design strategy for engineering structures. Further, active materials can be integrated with origami for lightweight, programmable, self&#8208;deployable structures relevant to numerous aerospace, metamaterial, and biomedical applications. This review details active material actuation mechanisms, active origami applications, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication methods, as well as origami modeling, and provides insights into the future of active origami research.








Abstract
In recent decades, origami has been explored to aid in the design of engineering structures. These structures span multiple scales and have been demonstrated to be used toward various areas such as aerospace, metamaterial, biomedical, robotics, and architectural applications. Conventionally, origami or deployable structures have been actuated by hands, motors, or pneumatic actuators, which can result in heavy or bulky structures. On the other hand, active materials, which reconfigure in response to external stimulus, eliminate the need for external mechanical loads and bulky actuation systems. Thus, in recent years, active materials incorporated with deployable structures have shown promise for remote actuation of light weight, programmable origami. In this review, active materials such as shape memory polymers (SMPs) and alloys (SMAs), hydrogels, liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), magnetic soft materials (MSMs), and covalent adaptable network (CAN) polymers, their actuation mechanisms, as well as how they have been utilized for active origami and where these structures are applicable is discussed. Additionally, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication methods to construct active origami are highlighted. The existing structural modeling strategies for origami, the constitutive models used to describe active materials, and the largest challenges and future directions for active origami research are summarized.

         <title>Review&#8212;Extremely Thin Amorphous Indium Oxide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing the thickness of indium oxide, enabled by atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, can tune its material properties to achieve high performance devices beyond the capabilities of conventional oxide semiconductors. In this work, the history leading to the re&#8208;emergence of indium oxide, its fundamental material properties, growth techniques with a focus on ALD, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art indium oxide device research are reviewed.








Abstract
Amorphous oxide semiconductor transistors have been a mature technology in display panels for upward of a decade, and have recently been considered as promising back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line compatible channel materials for monolithic 3D applications. However, achieving high&#8208;mobility amorphous semiconductor materials with comparable performance to traditional crystalline semiconductors has been a long&#8208;standing problem. Recently it has been found that greatly reducing the thickness of indium oxide, enabled by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, can tune its material properties to achieve high mobility, high drive current, high on/off ratio, and enhancement&#8208;mode operation at the same time, beyond the capabilities of conventional oxide semiconductor materials. In this work, the history leading to the re&#8208;emergence of indium oxide, its fundamental material properties, growth techniques with a focus on ALD, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art indium oxide device research, and the bias stability of the devices are reviewed.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Materials in Droplet Manipulation for Biochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation strategies, featured in contactless interaction, high&#8208;spatiotemporal resolution, and biocompatibility, are considered promising, particularly for biochemical applications. Special attention is paid to the underlying mechanisms, recent advancements of light&#8208;responsive materials, and the most notable applications of light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation in this review.








Abstract
Miniaturized droplets, characterized by well&#8208;controlled microenvironments and capability for parallel processing, have significantly advanced the studies on enzymatic evolution, molecular diagnostics, and single&#8208;cell analysis. However, manipulation of small&#8208;sized droplets, including moving, merging, and trapping of the targeted droplets for complex biochemical assays and subsequent analysis, is not trivial and remains technically demanding. Among various techniques, light&#8208;driven methods stand out as a promising candidate for droplet manipulation in a facile and flexible manner, given the features of contactless interaction, high spatiotemporal resolution, and biocompatibility. This review therefore compiles an in&#8208;depth discussion of the governing mechanisms underpinning light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation. Besides, light&#8208;responsive materials, representing the core of light&#8211;matter interaction and the key character converting light into different forms of energy, are particularly assessed in this review. Recent advancements in light&#8208;responsive materials and the most notable applications are comprehensively archived and evaluated. Continuous innovations and rational engineering of light&#8208;responsive materials are expected to propel the development of light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation, equip droplets with enhanced functionality, and broaden the applications of droplets for biochemical studies and routine biochemical investigations.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Articular Cartilage&#8208;Like Hydrogel Coating for Durable Aqueous Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy is developed for constructing an articular cartilage&#8208;like hydrogel coating on the surface of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene, which exhibits an ultralow friction coefficient of 0.0048 during 10&#160;000 cycles under a load of 0.9&#160;MPa, and thus has important implications for development of biological lubricating materials.








Abstract
Articular cartilage has an appropriate multilayer structure and superior tribological properties and provides a structural paradigm for design of lubricating materials. However, mimicking articular cartilage traits on prosthetic materials with durable lubrication remains a huge challenge. Herein, an ingenious three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy is developed for constructing an articular cartilage&#8208;like bilayer&#160;hydrogel coating on the surface of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene (BH&#8208;UPE), which makes full use of conceptions of interfacial interlinking, high&#8208;entanglement crosslinking, and interface&#8208;modulated polymerization. The hydrogel coating is tightly interlinked with UPE substrate through hydrogel&#8208;UPE interchain entanglement and bonding. The hydrogel chains are highly entangled with each other to form a dense tough layer with negligible hysteresis for load&#8208;bearing by reducing the amounts of crosslinker and hydrophilic initiator to p.p.m. levels.&#160;Meanwhile, the polymerization of monomers in the top surface region is suppressed via interface&#8208;modulated polymerization, thus introducing a porous&#160;surface for effective aqueous lubrication. As a result, BH&#8208;UPE exhibits an ultralow friction coefficient of 0.0048 during 10&#160;000 cycles under a load of 0.9&#160;MPa, demonstrating great potential as an advanced bearing material for disc prosthesis. This work may provide a new way to build stable bilayer coatings and have important implications for development of biological lubricating materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Thermal&#8208;Shock Resistance Enabled by Radiative Cooling and Latent Heat Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Radiative cooling technology is well known for its sub&#8208;ambient temperature cooling performance under sunlight radiation. However, the intrinsic maximum cooling power of radiative cooling limits the performance when the objects meet the thermal shock. Here, we proposed a dual&#8208;function strategy composed of radiative cooling and latent heat storage simultaneously enabling the efficient sub&#8208;ambient cooling and high&#8208;efficiency thermal&#8208;shock resistance performance. The electrospinning and absorption&#8208;pressing methods were employed to assemble the dual&#8208;function cooler. The high sunlight reflectivity and high mid&#8208;infrared emissivity of radiative film allows excellent sub&#8208;ambient temperature of 5.1&#160;&#176;C. When subjected the thermal shock, the dual&#8208;function cooler demonstrates a pinning effect of huge temperature drop of 39&#160;&#176;C and stable low&#8208;temperature level by isothermal heat absorption compared with the traditional radiative cooler. The molten phase change materials provide the heat&#8208;time transfer effect by converting thermal&#8208;shock heat to the delayed preservation. This strategy paves a powerful way to protect the objects from thermal accumulation and high&#8208;temperature damage, expanding the applications of radiative cooling and latent heat storage technologies.

         <title>Strategies for Improving Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted widespread research and commercialization attention because of their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication cost. The long&#8208;term stability of PSCs should satisfy industrial requirements for photovoltaic devices. Inverted PSCs with a p&#8208;i&#8208;n architecture exhibit considerable advantages because of their excellent stability and competitive efficiency. The continuously broken&#8208;through PCE of inverted PSCs shows huge application potential. This review summarizes the developments and outlines the characteristics of inverted PSCs including charge transporting layers (CTLs), perovskite compositions, and interfacial regulation strategies. The latest effective CTLs, interfacial modification, and stability promotion strategies especially under light, thermal and bias conditions are emphatically analyzed. Furthermore, the applications of the inverted structure in high&#8208;efficiency and stable tandem, flexible photovoltaic devices, and modules and their main obstacles are systematically introduced. Finally, the remaining challenges faced by inverted devices are discussed, and several directions for advancing inverted PSCs are proposed according to their development status and industrialization requirements.

         <title>Customized Intranasal Hydrogel Delivering Methylene Blue Ameliorates Cognitive Dysfunction against Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black phosphorus&#8208;methylene blue (BP&#8208;MB) is continuously released from intranasal BP&#8208;MB@Gel and delivered to the brain, exerting synergistic therapeutic effects by suppressing tau neuropathology, restoring mitochondrial function, and alleviating the neuroinflammation, thus inducing cognitive improvements in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings highlight a potential strategy for brain&#8208;targeted drug delivery in the management of the complex pathologies of AD.









Abstract
The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregates is a key pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and induces mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species overproduction. However, the treatment of AD remains challenging owning to the hindrance caused by the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the complex pathology of AD. Nasal delivery represents an effective means of circumventing the BBB and delivering drugs to the brain. In this study, black phosphorus (BP) is used as a drug carrier, as well as an antioxidant, and loaded with a tau aggregation inhibitor, methylene blue (MB), to obtain BP&#8208;MB. For intranasal (IN) delivery, a thermosensitive hydrogel is fabricated by cross&#8208;linking carboxymethyl chitosan and aldehyde Pluronic F127 (F127&#8208;CHO) micelles. The BP&#8208;MB nanocomposite is incorporated into the hydrogel to obtain BP&#8208;MB@Gel. BP&#8208;MB@Gel could be injected intranasally, providing high nasal mucosal retention and controlled drug release. After IN administration, BP&#8208;MB is continuously released and delivered to the brain, exerting synergistic therapeutic effects by suppressing tau neuropathology, restoring mitochondrial function, and alleviating neuroinflammation, thus inducing cognitive improvements in mouse models of AD. These findings highlight a potential strategy for brain&#8208;targeted drug delivery in the management of the complex pathologies of AD.

         <title>In Vivo Stimulation of Therapeutic Antigen&#8208;Specific T Cells in an Artificial Lymph Node Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an injectable T cell&#8208;stimulating scaffold, the artificial lymph node (aLN), is developed that works with the host immune system to create an immunostimulatory niche. The aLN&#160;can activate and expand rare, antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells from fully na&#239;ve, endogenous populations. aLN stimulated cells are fully functional and synergize with immune checkpoint blockade to reduce tumor burden and prolong survival.








Abstract
T cells are critical mediators of antigen&#8208;specific immune responses and are common targets for immunotherapy. Biomaterial scaffolds have previously been used to stimulate antigen&#8208;presenting cells to elicit antigen&#8208;specific immune responses; however, structural and molecular features that directly stimulate and expand na&#239;ve, endogenous, tumor&#8208;specific T cells in vivo have not been defined. Here, an artificial lymph node (aLN) matrix is created, which consists of an extracellular matrix hydrogel conjugated with peptide&#8208;loaded&#8208;MHC complex (Signal 1), the co&#8208;stimulatory signal anti&#8208;CD28 (Signal 2), and a tethered IL&#8208;2 (Signal 3), that can bypass challenges faced by other approaches to activate T cells in situ such as vaccines. This dynamic immune&#8208;stimulating platform enables direct, in vivo antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell stimulation, as well as recruitment and coordination of host immune cells, providing an immuno&#8208;stimulatory microenvironment for antigen&#8208;specific T cell activation and expansion. Co&#8208;injecting the aLN with na&#239;ve, wild&#8208;type CD8+ T cells results in robust activation and expansion of tumor&#8208;targeted T cells that kill target cells and slow tumor growth in several distal tumor models. The aLN platform induces potent in vivo antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell stimulation without the need for ex vivo priming or expansion and enables in situ manipulation of antigen&#8208;specific responses for immunotherapies.

         <title>Acoustic Higher&#8208;Order Topological Insulators Induced by Orbital&#8208;Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital&#8208;interactions between degenerate acoustic cavity modes are introduced to demonstrate versatile higher&#8208;order corner states and orbital&#8208;dependent edge states embedded in the bulk, opening the avenue for exploring orbital&#8208;related topological physics and sound&#8208;wave interaction beyond the single&#8208;orbital systems. It also provides new opportunities for the applications such as sound trapping and sensing.








Abstract
The discovery of higher&#8208;order topological insulator metamaterials, in analogy with their condensed&#8208;matter counterparts, has enabled various breakthroughs in photonics, mechanics, and acoustics. A common way of inducing higher&#8208;order topological wave phenomena is through pseudo&#8208;spins, which mimic the electron spins as a symmetry&#8208;breaking degree of freedom. Here, this work exploits degenerate orbitals in acoustic resonant cavities to demonstrate versatile, orbital&#8208;selective, higher&#8208;order topological corner states. Type&#8208;II corner states are theoretically investigated and experimentally demonstrated based on tailored orbital interactions, without the need for long&#8208;range hoppings that has so far served as a key ingredient for Type&#8208;II corner states in single&#8208;orbital systems. Due to the orthogonal nature of the degenerate p orbitals, this work also introduces a universal strategy to realize orbital&#8208;dependent edge modes, featuring high&#8208;Q edge states identified in bulk bands. These findings provide an understanding of the interplay between acoustic orbitals and topology, shedding light on orbital&#8208;related topological wave physics, as well as its applications for acoustic sensing and trapping.

A conceptually new, coupled flow fuel cell (CF&#8208;FC) by integrating acidic oxygen reduction reaction and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction is developed, leading to a significantly increased theoretical open&#8208;circuit voltage of 2.057&#160;V. More specifically, a CF&#8208;FC based on a typical transition metal single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C cathode demonstrates a high electricity output and excellent durability, far superior to the conventional fuel cells.








Abstract
Conventional H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells suffer from the low output voltage, insufficient durability, and high&#8208;cost catalysts (e.g., noble metals). Herein, this work reports a conceptually new coupled flow fuel cell (CF&#8208;FC) by coupling asymmetric electrolytes for acidic oxygen reduction reaction and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction. By introducing an electrochemical neutralization energy, the newly&#8208;developed CF&#8208;FCs possess a significantly increased theoretical open&#8208;circuit voltage. Specifically, a CF&#8208;FC based on a typical transition metal single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C cathode catalyst demonstrates a high electricity output up to 1.81&#160;V and durability with an ultrahigh retention of 91% over 110&#160;h, far superior to the conventional fuel cells (usually, &lt; 1.0&#160;V, &lt; 50% retention over 20&#160;h). The output performance can even be significantly enhanced easily by connecting multiple CF&#8208;FCs into the parallel, series, or combined parallel&#8208;series connections at a fractional cost of that for the conventional H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells, showing great potential for large&#8208;scale practical applications. Thus, this study provides a platform to transform conventional fuel cell technology through the rational design and development of advanced energy conversion and storage devices by coupling different electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics Utilizing Intrinsic Charge Generation in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) can generate charges without a donor&#8211;acceptor interface. This is shown using transient absorption measurements and confirmed using computational methods. A small amount of donor material significantly enhances exciton splitting into free charges, resulting in well&#8208;performing donor&#8208;dilute OPVs. Semitransparent OPV modules with 2.2% light utilization efficiency are achieved by employing the optimized donor&#8208;dilute device concept.








Abstract
In organic semiconductors, a donor/acceptor heterojunction is typically required for efficient dissociation of excitons. Using transient absorption spectroscopy to study the dynamics of excited states in non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), it is shown that NFAs can generate charges without a donor/acceptor interface. This is due to the fact that dielectric solvation provides a driving force sufficient to dissociate the excited state and form the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state. The CT state is further dissociated into free charges at interfaces between polycrystalline regions in neat NFAs. For IEICO&#8208;4F, incorporating just 9 wt% donor polymer PTB7&#8208;Th in neat films greatly boosts charge generation, enhancing efficient exciton separation into free charges. This property is utilized to fabricate donor&#8208;dilute organic photovoltaics (OPV) delivering a power conversion efficiency of 8.3% in the case of opaque devices with a metal top&#8208;electrode and an active layer average visible transmittance (AVT) of 75%. It is shown that the intrinsic charge generation in low&#8208;bandgap NFAs contributes to the overall photocurrent generation. IEICO&#8208;4F&#8208;based OPVs with limited PTB7&#8208;Th content have high thermal resilience demonstrating little drop in performance over 700&#160;h. PTB7&#8208;Th:IEICO&#8208;4F semitransparent OPVs are leveraged to fabricate an 8&#8208;series connected semitransparent module, demonstrating light&#8208;utilization efficiency of 2.2% alongside an AVT of 63%.

         <title>Self&#8208;Timed and Spatially&#8208;Targeted Delivery of Chemical Cargo by Motile Liquid Crystal</title>

Abstract
A key challenge underlying the design of miniature machines is encoding materials with time&#8208; and space&#8208;specific functional behaviors that require little human intervention. Dissipative processes that drive materials beyond equilibrium and evolve continuously with time and location represent one promising strategy to achieve such complex functions. Here we report how internal non&#8208;equilibrium states of liquid crystal (LC) emulsion droplets undergoing chemotaxis can be used to time the delivery of a chemical agent to a targeted location. During ballistic motion, hydrodynamic shear forces dominate LC elastic interactions, dispersing micodroplet inclusions (microcargo) within double emulsion droplets. Scale&#8208;dependent colloidal forces then hinder the escape of dispersed microcargo from the propelling droplet. Upon arrival at the targeted location, a circulatory flow of diminished strength triggers the microcargo to cluster within the LC elastic environment such that hydrodynamic forces grow to exceed colloidal forces and thus trigger the escape of the microcargo. We illustrate the approach by using microcargo that initiate polymerization upon release through the outer interface of the carrier droplet. These findings provide a platform that utilizes non&#8208;equilibrium strategies to design autonomous spatial and temporal functions into active materials.

         <title>Reduction of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)Furan at High Current Density Using a Ga&#8208;doped AgCu:Cationomer Hybrid Electrocatalyst</title>

Abstract
Hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived chemicals is of interest for the production of biofuels and valorized chemicals. Thermochemical processes for biomass reduction typically employ hydrogen as the reductant at elevated temperatures and pressures. Here we investigate direct electrified reduction of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to a precursor to bio&#8208;polymers, 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF). Noting a limited current density in prior reports of this transformation, we investigated the use of a hybrid catalyst consisting of ternary metal nanodendrites mixed with a cationic ionomer, the latter purposed to increase local pH and facilitate surface proton diffusion. We found that the approach, when implemented using Ga&#8208;doped Ag&#8208;Cu electrocatalysts designed for p&#8208;d orbital hybridization, steered selectivity to BHMF, achieving a faradaic efficiency of 58% at 100&#160;mA/cm2 and a production rate of 1&#160;mmol/cm2/h, this latter a doubling in rate compared to the best prior reports.

         <title>Sprayable Hydrogel Sealant for Gastrointestinal Wound Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Naturally occurring internal bleeding, such as in stomach ulcers, and complications following interventions, like polyp resection post&#8208;colonoscopy, may result in delayed (5&#8208;7 days) post&#8208;operative adverse events&#8212;such as bleeding, intestinal wall perforation, and leakage. Current solutions for controlling intra&#8208; and post&#8208;procedural complications are limited in effectiveness. Hemostatic powders only provide a temporary solution due to their short&#8208;term adhesion to GI mucosal tissues (less than 48 hours). In this study, we developed a sprayable adhesive hydrogel for facile application and sustained adhesion to GI lesions using clinically available endoscopes. Upon spraying, the biomaterial (based on polyethyleneimine&#8208;modified Pluronic&#174; micelles precursor and oxidized dextran) instantly gels upon contact with the tissue, forming an adhesive shield. In vitro and in vivo studies in guinea pigs, rabbits, and pig models confirm the safety and efficacy of this biomaterial in colonic and acidic stomach lesions. Our findings highlight that this family of hydrogels ensures prolonged tissue protection (3&#8208;7 days), facilitates wound healing, and minimizes the risk of delayed complications&#8212;a readily adoptable approach for gastrointestinal wound management.

         <title>Polymeric Conductive Adhesive based Ultrathin Epidermal Electrodes for Long&#8208;term Monitoring of Electrophysiological Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrophysiology, exploring vital electrical phenomena in living organisms, anticipates broader integration into daily life through wearable devices. However, addressing the challenges of electrode durability and motion artifacts is essential to enable continuous and long&#8208;term biopotential signal monitoring, presenting a hurdle for its seamless implementation in daily life. To address these challenges, we present an ultrathin poly(3,4&#8208; ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate)/polyvinyl alcohol/d&#8208;sorbitol (PPd) electrode with enhanced adhesion, stretchability, and skin conformability. It was designed according to the theoretical criteria for skin&#8208;conformal electrodes based on the mechanical analysis of epidermal electronics. Thus, we obtained impedance stability over 1&#8208;week of daily life, and the PPd electrode addresses the challenges related to durability during prolonged usage. Proving stability in electromyography (EMG) signals during high&#8208;intensity exercise, our wireless PPd measurement system exhibits high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) signals even in situations involving significant and repetitive skin deformation. Throughout continuous 1 week&#8208;long electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life, the system consistently preserves signal quality, underscoring the heightened durability and applicability of the PPd measurement system.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiology, exploring vital electrical phenomena in living organisms, anticipates broader integration into daily life through wearable devices. However, addressing the challenges of electrode durability and motion artifacts is essential to enable continuous and long-term biopotential signal monitoring, presenting a hurdle for its seamless implementation in daily life. To address these challenges, we present an ultrathin poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate)/polyvinyl alcohol/d-sorbitol (PPd) electrode with enhanced adhesion, stretchability, and skin conformability. It was designed according to the theoretical criteria for skin-conformal electrodes based on the mechanical analysis of epidermal electronics. Thus, we obtained impedance stability over 1-week of daily life, and the PPd electrode addresses the challenges related to durability during prolonged usage. Proving stability in electromyography (EMG) signals during high-intensity exercise, our wireless PPd measurement system exhibits high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals even in situations involving significant and repetitive skin deformation. Throughout continuous 1 week-long electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life, the system consistently preserves signal quality, underscoring the heightened durability and applicability of the PPd measurement system.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Revealing Seed&#8208;mediated Structural Evolution of Copper&#8208;Silicide Nanostructures: Generating Structured Current Collectors for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal silicide thin films and nanostructures typically employed in electronics have recently gained significant attention in battery technology, where they are used as active or inactive materials. However, unlike thin films, the science behind the evolution of silicide nanostructures, especially 1&#8208;D Nanowires (NWs), is a key missing aspect. CuxSiy nanostructures synthesized by solvent vapor growth technique (SVG) are studied as a model system to gain insights into metal silicide formation. The temperature&#8208;dependent phase evolution of CuxSiy structures proceeds from Cu&gt;Cu0.83Si0.17&gt;Cu5Si&gt;Cu15Si4. The role of Cu diffusion kinetics on the morphological progression of Cu silicides is studied, revealing that the growth of 1D metal silicide NWs proceeds through an in&#8208;situ formed, Cu seed&#8208;mediated, self&#8208;catalytic process. The different CuxSiy morphologies synthesized were utilized as structured current collectors (CC) for K&#8208;ion battery anodes. Sb deposited by thermal evaporation upon Cu15Si4 tripod NWs and cube architectures exhibited reversible alloying capacities of 477.3 and 477.6 mAh/g at a C/5 rate. Furthermore, Sb deposited Cu15Si4 tripod NWs anode tested in Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries demonstrated reversible capacities of &#8764;518 mAh/g and 495 mAh/g.

         <title>Flat&#8208;Knit, Flexible, Textile Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lightweight, low&#8208;cost metasurfaces and reflectarrays that are easy to stow and deploy are desirable for many terrestrial and space&#8208;based communications and sensing applications. This work demonstrates a lightweight, flexible metasurface platform based on flat&#8208;knit textiles operating in the cm&#8208;wave spectral range. By using a colorwork knitting approach called float&#8208;jacquard knitting to directly integrate an array of resonant metallic antennas into a textile, we realize two textile reflectarray devices, a metasurface lens (metalens) and a vortex&#8208;beam generator. Operating as a receiving antenna, the metalens focuses a collimated normal&#8208;incidence beam to a diffraction&#8208;limited, off&#8208;broadside focal spot. Operating as a transmitting antenna, the metalens converts the divergent emission from a horn antenna into a collimated beam with peak measured directivity, gain, and efficiency of 21.30&#160;dB, 15.30&#160;dB, and &#8211;6.00&#160;dB (25.12%), respectively. The vortex&#8208;beam generating metasurface produces a focused vortex beam with a topological charge of m = 1 over a wide frequency range of 4.1&#8208;5.8&#160;GHz. Strong specular reflection is observed for our textile reflectarrays, caused by wavy yarn floats on the backside of the float&#8208;jacquard textiles. Our work demonstrates a novel approach for scalable production of flexible metasurfaces by leveraging commercially available yarns and well&#8208;established knitting machinery and techniques.

         <title>Wireless Bioelectronics for In Vivo Pressure Monitoring with Mechanically&#8208;compliant Hydrogel Biointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent electronics&#8208;tissues biointefacing technology has offered unprecedented opportunities for long&#8208;term disease diagnosis and treatment. It remains a grand challenge to robustly anchor the pressure sensing bioelectronics onto specific organs, since the periodically&#8208;varying stress generated by normal biological processes may pose high risk of interfacial failures. Here, we&#160;report a general yet reliable approach to achieve the robust hydrogel interface between wireless pressure sensor and biological tissues/organs, featuring highly desirable mechanical compliance and swelling resistance, despite the direct contact with biofluids and dynamic conditions. The sensor is operated wirelessly through inductive coupling, characterizing minimal hysteresis, fast response times, excellent stability and robustness, thus allowing for easy handling and eliminating the necessity for surgical extraction after a functional period. We&#160;have demonstrated the operation of the wireless sensor with a custom&#8208;made pressure sensing model and In Vivo intracranial pressure monitoring in rats. This technology may be advantageous in real&#8208;time post&#8208;operative monitoring of various biological inner pressures after the reconstructive surgery, thus guaranteeing the timely treatment of lethal&#160;diseases.
