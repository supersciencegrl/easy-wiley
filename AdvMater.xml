         <title>Origin of B&#8208;Type Blinking at 2D/3D Heterojunction Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B&#8209;type photoluminescence blinking is observed in WS2/Si heterojunctions, originating from the competition between two hot&#8209;carrier relaxation pathways either leading to A exciton or localized exciton formation. F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer sustains the blinking by modulating localized exciton density. This finding broadens the understanding of carrier dynamics in 2D/3D systems and help the degsin of stable optoelectronic device. 








Abstract
Photoluminescence blinking is a common phenomenon that occurs across various low&#8208;dimensional materials, like 0D quantum dots or 1D nanowires. Two blinking types in 0D and 1D systems have been observed and extensively studied, revealing the mechanisms of non&#8208;equilibrium photocarrier kinetics, thereby enhancing emission stability and optimizing emitter performance. However, the origin of blinking in 2D materials is still less understood compared to those in quantum dots and single molecules and only the A&#8208;type blinking has been reported. Here, a B&#8208;type photoluminescence blinking is identified at the WS2/Si heterointerface through the statistics of fluorescence lifetime&#8208;intensity distribution. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and transient absorption spectra show that the blinking arises from the dynamic competition between two hot carrier relaxation pathways: one leading to A exciton emission and the other to localized exciton recombination. Moreover, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer modulates the localized exciton density at the heterointerface and sustains the blinking phenomenon, which is distinct from other B&#8208;type blinking. This B&#8208;type blinking broadens the understanding of photocarrier dynamics in 2D/3D systems, which will benefit the development of optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials.

         <title>Promoting Active Hydrogen Supply and Nitrate Adsorption by Disordering Tetrahedral&#8208;Octahedral Structure of CuAl2O4&#8208;&#948; for Efficient Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A disordered tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral structure of CuAl2O4&#8208;&#948; (CAO) by Co doping promotes water dissociation for hydrogen supply and formation of oxygen vacancy for hydrogen storage, enabling high&#8208;efficiency deoxygenation and hydrogeneration of nitrate reduction to ammonia.








Abstract
Modulating the local coordination environment can optimize the electronic structure and reaction pathway of nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR), beneficial to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity. Herein, a disordered tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral structure of CuAl2O4&#8208;&#948; (CAO) is proposed by Co doping as an efficient catalyst. Theoretical calculations reveal Co doping induces strong Co&#8208;Al orbital interactions at octahedral sites, which lowers the energy barrier for water dissociation, and meanwhile, Oxygen vacancies (Vos) induced by Co doping not only enhance NO3&#8722; adsorption, but also serve as reservoir sites for transient *H storage, thereby promoting hydrogenation steps. The synergistic Cu&#8208;Vo interaction facilitates the conversion of *NO3&#8211; to *NO2&#8211; and the interfacial electron transfer between Co and Cu suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The substitution of 30% Co in CAO (Co&#8208;3) nanofibers creates the most Vos, resulting in a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.00% and a substantial NH3 yield rate of 27.86 mg h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1cat. in neutral media. Additionally, it exhibits exceptional long&#8208;term electrochemical durability and chemical stability. Thermodynamic analysis unveils the potential&#8208;determining step of *NO2 to *NO for Co&#8208;3 possesses a low free energy of only 0.05 eV, highly superior to 0.29 eV for the pristine CAO.

         <title>Cyclically Regenerated Solid&#8208;State Bulk&#8208;Phase Electrocatalyst for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;lon Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclically regenerated Co atom clusters (Coac) from the heterostructured CoSe&#8208;ZnSe bimetallic selenide anode are novel, high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state bulk electrocatalysts. They significantly accelerate ZnSe anode conversion reactions for fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries, overcoming solid&#8208;state bulk catalyst design bottlenecks with high catalytic efficiency, electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;passivation in long&#8208;cycle tests, endowing the battery with excellent cycle stability and ultra&#8208;high rate performance.









Abstract
Catalysts are pivotal in enhancing reaction kinetics across various domains, including energy conversion and storage. However, their application in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) has been largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges posed by solid&#8208;solid conversion reactions in bulk electrode materials, and electrochemical instability and passivation of electrocatalysts during cycling. Herein, this study presents that Co atom clusters (Coac) cyclically regenerate from a designed heterostructure of bimetallic selenides anode (CoSe&#8211;ZnSe) during electrochemical lithiation process as a novel and effective solid&#8208;state bulk&#8208;phase electrocatalyst can significantly accelerate conversion reactions of ZnSe anode for fast&#8208;charging LIBs. The propose strategy overcomes the bottlenecks in solid&#8208;state bulk&#8208;phase catalyst design, imparting Coac catalyst with high catalytic efficiency, full&#8208;voltage&#8208;range electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;passivation during long&#8208;cycling test. With catalytic effect of Coac, the batteries demonstrate fast&#8208;charging performance such as unprecedented rate capability up to 50 A g&#8722;1, as well as high&#8208;rate long cyclability (3000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1).

         <title>Integrated Hollow Microfibers of Covalent Organic Framework on Cu Foil as a Gradient Zn Metal Anode Host for Bottom&#8208;Up Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated hollow microfibers of covalent organic framework on Cu foil (HMCOF&#8208;Cu) is designed as a gradient host for Zn metal anode. Owing to the carbonyl groups in the surface HMCOF layer and hierarchical pores, the HMCOF&#8208;Cu host presents rapid desolvation of hydrated Zn2+, fast Zn2+ ions diffusion and reduced volume change for bottom&#8208;up Zn deposition without dendrite.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn metal batteries are promising choices for future grid&#8208;scale energy storage because of cost&#8208;effectiveness, high&#8208;rate performance and safety. Nonetheless, the sluggish desolvation of hydrated Zn2+ ions usually leads to uncontrolled Zn dendrite growth and detrimental side reactions on Zn metal anodes (ZMAs). Herein, we report the formation of integrated hollow microfibers of covalent organic frameworks on Cu foil (denoted as HMCOF&#8208;Cu) as a ZMA host with gradient design. Of note, interactions between carbonyl groups of HMCOF and H2O in [Zn(H2O)6]2+ promote rapid desolvation of hydrated Zn2+. Besides, 3D&#160;HMCOF network can accelerate Zn2+ diffusion and accommodate the volumetric deformation during the deposition/stripping cycles. Moreover, the gradient design can induce bottom&#8208;up deposition for dendrite&#8208;free ZMA. As a result, the HMCOF&#8208;Cu host enables stable Zn plating/stripping processes over 2500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full cell based on HMCOF&#8208;Cu@Zn anode presents a long&#8208;term stability over 7000 cycles at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Selective Growth of Ferroelectric Ultrathin Nonlayered &#947;&#8208;In2Se3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precursor&#8208;guided CVD method is developed to selectively grow ultrathin &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 crystals with a nonlayered, vacancy&#8208;ordered screw form structure. &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;phase In2Se3 are synthesized using different precursors. Ex situ STEM reveals a &#947;&#8208;In2Se3&#8208;to&#8208;InSe phase transition at 600&#160;&#176;C, highlighting the potential of &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 for next&#8208;generation polytypes&#8208;dependent nanoelectromechanical and memory devices.








Abstract
Indium selenide (In2Se3) has received increasing interest due to its diverse polytypes and associated polytype&#8208;dependent ferroelectric properties, making it one of the promising platforms guiding the development of ultrathin ferroelectric nanodevices. To date, &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#946;'&#8208;phase In2Se3 have been well studied, but nonlayered &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 remains underexplored because of sophisticated formation paths and minor energy differences with other phases. Therefore, understanding the growth mechanisms and electronic structures of &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 is crucial to present the full roadmap of the InxSey family. Herein, a precursor&#8208;guided chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is proposed to selectively grow ultrathin &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 crystals with a nonlayered, vacancy&#8208;ordered screw form (VOSF) structure. The sublimation temperature of precursors plays a critical role in selectively synthesizing &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;phase In2Se3 using different precursors (In2Se3, In2O3, InCl3). Ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveals a &#947;&#8208;In2Se3&#8208;to&#8208;InSe phase transition at 600&#160;&#176;C, consecutively triggered by interlayer bonds broken, vacancy reorganization and removal of Se atoms. Away from existing literature, only out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity in &#947;&#8208;In2Se3, driven by vertical off&#8208;center displacements of Se atoms, is detected. Therefore, a full spectrum of In2Se3&#8217;s polytypes, particularly nonlayered ferroelectric &#947;&#8208;In2Se3, is selectively obtained, presenting great potential for next&#8208;generation In2Se3&#8208;based polytypes&#8208;dependent nanoelectromechanical and memory devices.

         <title>Michell's&#8208;Instability&#8208;Mediated Fast Reconfiguration of Hydrogel&#8208;Based Ring Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic hydrogel&#8208;based ring actuator exhibits fast reconfiguration from a saddle&#8208;shape to a figure of eight upon heating or light irradiation, resulting in varied stiffnesses of the gel and reduced critical twist of the ring for Michell's instability. Such ring actuators with fast rotational deformation are harnessed for executing specific tasks.








Abstract
Michell's instability, a classic type of mechanical instability, has received tremendous interest from different disciplines. It occurs when the pre&#8208;torsion in an elastic ring surpasses a critical value; the elastic ring spontaneously undergoes a transition from a flat or warped shape to a figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight configuration. However, such instability has rarely been exploited in designing soft actuators. Here, by employing a stimulus&#8208;triggered Michell's instability, hydrogel&#8208;based ring actuators capable of fast shape morphing are developed. Upon heating or light irradiation, the hydrogel ring transforms rapidly from the saddle&#8208;shape into the figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight configuration. Rigorous experiments and simulations reveal the underlying mechanism and attribute it to the stimuli&#8208;induced variations in bending and torsional stiffnesses of the gel string with anisotropic structure and response, which reduces the critical twist for Michell's instability of the ring actuator. Moreover, effects of light intensity, environmental temperature, ring size, and pre&#8208;torsion on reconfiguration are also investigated. The fast action of the ring actuators in aqueous conditions has been demonstrated through various tasks, such as screwing a bottle cap, kicking a ball, and triggering synergetic deformations. The design principle of soft actuators by harnessing Michell's instability should merit the development of other soft machines with fast action and large&#8208;amplitude reconfiguration.

         <title>Dry Transfer of CVD Graphene Film Using Adhesion Switchable Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic charge doping of graphene can tailor its adhesion to the copper surface, thus enabling etchant&#8208;free dry delamination. A switchable ferroelectric P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) film first acts as a graphene transfer support layer, where polarization controls adhesion to peel graphene from copper, and subsequently releases graphene onto SiO2 substrates upon depolarization. This method yields clean graphene with low crack density and is extendable to other 2D materials.








Abstract
Although chemical vapor deposition (CVD) produces meter&#8208;scale, high&#8208;quality graphene (Gr) on copper (Cu) foils, its practical integration is hampered by challenges in the transfer process. Conventional wet transfers are slow, produce chemical waste, and lack scalability, whereas existing dry transfer methods struggle with mechanical damage and residues due to strong Gr&#8208;Cu adhesion and the difficulty in precisely tuning interfacial forces. Here, a fully dry, industrially compatible transfer platform utilizing a ferroelectric poly(vinylidene&#8208;fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) film with electrostatically switchable adhesion, serving as both a mechanical support and a transfer layer, is demonstrated. Negative Corona poling of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) induces p&#8208;type doping in graphene. Density Functional Theory calculations confirm that this simultaneously reduces Gr&#8208;Cu adhesion while increasing P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;Gr adhesion, enabling clean, large&#8208;scale graphene delamination from Cu foils with &gt;99% coverage. Subsequent thermal annealing above P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8217;s Curie temperature (&#8776;135&#160;&#176;C) depolarizes the film, neutralizing the interfacial charge for a clean release. The versatility of this method is shown for other two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, including molybdenum disulfide and hexagonal boron nitride. Crucially, the process has been validated on cm&#8208;scale samples using a fully automated system with a transfer time of &lt;5 min, highlighting a viable path toward industrial&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality 2D material films.

         <title>LPS&#8208;Binding Hydrogel for TLR4&#8208;Mediated Microbiota&#8208;Immune Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic LPS&#8208;binding hydrogel integrates polymyxin B (PMB)&#8208;mediated Gram&#8208;negative bacterial membrane disruption and LPS release with polyethyleneimine (PEI)&#8208;driven LPS scavenging to block LPS&#8208;TLR4 signaling, rebalance the microbiota&#8208;immune microenvironment, and promote coordinated neutrophil&#8208;macrophage&#8208;epithelial/fibroblast interactions, achieving regenerative healing of oronasal&#8208;perforating wounds&#8212;complex and infection&#8208;prone complications associated with cleft palate repair.








Abstract
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a conserved component of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, is a potent immune activator that disrupts tissue repair when released during microbial dysbiosis. LPS&#8208;scavenging strategies are often limited by the poor accessibility of lipid A, the bioactive core of LPS, which is shielded by variable oligosaccharide structures and embedded in bacterial membranes. To address this, a synergistic LPS&#8208;binding hydrogel (OCMC&#8208;PMBP) is developed, combining polymyxin B (PMB) for lipid A&#8208;targeted bacterial lysis and polyethyleneimine (PEI) for electrostatic LPS capture. This system is applied to oronasal&#8208;perforating wounds, a complex and infection&#8208;prone condition associated with cleft palate repair. Clinical microbiome analysis and murine models reveal that LPS&#8208;TLR4 signaling contributes to immune dysregulation and impaired healing. OCMC&#8208;PMBP treatment reduces LPS levels, restores microbiota balance, suppresses inflammation, and accelerates epithelial regeneration and collagen remodeling. Integrated 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomics, and single&#8208;cell transcriptomics show that the hydrogel reprograms immune cell phenotypes and modulates macrophage interactions with neutrophils, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts across healing phases. This study introduces a biomaterials design combining antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions to resolve dysbiosis&#8208;induced inflammation and enhance regenerative healing in complex mucosal wounds.

         <title>COFs on MOFs: Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Synthesis of MOF@COF Nanoparticles with Synergistic Adsorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer strategy enables the growth of crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) shells on metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles, creating core&#8211;shell structures with tunable porosity. Ordered interstitial mesopores are formed during shell growth, which are connected with the COF's intrinsic micropores, thereby enhancing water sorption. This approach offers precise structural control and improved adsorption performance through cooperative pore connectivity.








Abstract
Synergistic effects between porous materials offer a powerful route to enhance key functionalities such as adsorption, catalysis, and molecular transport. In this context, the combination of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provides a promising platform for engineering hybrid adsorbents with synergistic sorption behavior. Here, a versatile layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer strategy is presented for the controlled growth of crystalline COF shells on MOF nanoparticles, yielding uniform MOF@COF nanocomposites as stable aqueous colloids. This approach enables precise tuning of shell thickness and porosity under mild conditions. The resulting core&#8211;shell hybrids exhibit enhanced water adsorption, driven by the formation of interfacial mesopores. Modeling studies indicate that a minimum number of COF growth cycles is necessary to induce these mesopores, which interconnect with the intrinsic micropores of the COF shell and facilitate synergistic uptake. This work presents a scalable and modular approach to creating porous hybrid nanoparticles with programmable interfacial architectures and enhanced sorption performance.

         <title>Autonomous Spatiotemporal Regulation of Reversible Hydrogel Actuators by Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators with reversible response to thiols are developed using reversible binding of thiols to Michael acceptors. Autonomous spatiotemporal regulation of reversible movement of these hydrogels is achieved using thiol&#8208;based chemical reaction networks containing both positive and negative feedback.








Abstract
Achieving autonomous spatiotemporal regulation of reversible hydrogel movement remains challenging, as existing approaches typically rely on external regulation or irreversible actuation mechanisms. This work presents the autonomous spatiotemporal regulation of reversible hydrogel actuators using thiol&#8208;based chemical reaction networks (CRNs). The core innovation is a bilayer actuator whose active layer is functionalized with phenylcyanoacrylate Michael acceptors. In their initial state, these groups are hydrophobic, keeping the active layer moderately collapsed. Binding to thiols, such as cysteamine or thiocholine, converts the acceptors into more hydrophilic adducts. This change drives water uptake, causing the active layer to swell and the entire structure to bend. The screening revealed that a methoxy&#8208;substituted acceptor provides the optimal balance of binding strength and reversibility for robust actuation. Autonomous control of reversible actuation is achieved by an autocatalytic, thiol&#8208;producing CRN coupled with negative feedback in the form of slow oxidation of thiols or their irreversible addition to acrylamides. In the hydrogel, this CRN generates a wave of thiols, which causes forward and reverse actuation. This principle is demonstrated with linear, flower&#8208;shaped, and hand&#8208;like actuators. This integrated system, which unites reversible chemistry with spatiotemporal control, takes a significant step toward emulating the autonomy of motion found in living systems.

         <title>Unveiling of Unpaired Surface Spins Regulated Magnetism in 2D &#945;&#8208;Te Nanosheets: an Implication on Magnetoelectric Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;2D tellurium nanosheets unveil a novel form of magnetism regulated by their unpaired surface spins. This emergent property, coupled with ferroelectricity, generates a giant magnetoelectric response. When utilized as a catalyst, this effect significantly accelerates the hydrogen evolution reaction, drastically reducing the required overpotential and demonstrating impressive electrochemical stability for next&#8208;generation energy technologies.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D tellurium (Te) unlocks surface spins (of valence 5p4 electrons) of tunable ferromagnetic order and response to strain&#8208;engineered electronic properties of widespread applications. In spin&#8211;orbit coupling, the inversion symmetry is broken in a 1S0 &#8594; 3S1 spin&#8208;transition of the ground electronic state, a synergetic pathway to charge spin&#8208;order under applied driving forces. The surface magnetism, combined with the ferroelectricity, gives a giant magnetoelectric response (absent in 1S0 bulk Te state) that is explored to boost the H2 evolution reaction (HER) with 2D &#945;&#8208;Te as a synergetic catalyst. High&#8208;quality 2D &#945;&#8208;Te synthesized as nanosheets is ordered primarily along (001) facets at duly enhanced d001 atomic spacing in the 5s2&#8208;Te lone pair electrons (diamagnetic) are spaced (Coulomb repulsion) via the 5p2 unpaired spins. Poled 2D &#945;&#8208;Te in small fields, such as 30 mT, presents a HER overpotential that is decreased up to 100&#160;mV, while the Tafel slope is declined up to 138 from 211&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 for the bulk sample. The electrochemical stability of 2D &#945;&#8208;Te is found quite impressive with 93% current retention (71% if non&#8208;magnetized) under chronoamperometric conditions. The results present that the 2D &#945;&#8208;Te plays a game&#8208;changing role towards sustainable energy technologies, spintronics, and next&#8208;generation magnetoelectric devices.

         <title>Toward Standardized Evaluation of PFAS Sorbents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective highlights the need for consistent reporting standards in PFAS sorbent research. It proposes a structured framework encompassing sorbent characterization, water matrix and PFAS details, and sorption&#8211;regeneration performance (including flow&#8208;through packed&#8208;bed evaluation). The guidelines aim to improve transparency, reproducibility, and comparability, thereby accelerating the development of effective PFAS remediation technologies.








Abstract
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental contaminants with global distribution and documented risks to human and environmental health. Sorbent&#8208;based technologies are widely explored for PFAS removal, yet the advancement of this field is impeded by inconsistent and incomplete experimental reporting, hindering reproducibility and comparative analysis.&#160;In this perspective, a structured framework is presented to guide the comprehensive characterization when reporting of new PFAS sorbents. The proposed framework defines three essential domains for experimental evaluation: i) sorbent characterization, ii) water matrix specification and PFAS details, and iii) sorption and regeneration performance, including flow&#8208;through packed&#8208;bed evaluation (both bench&#8208; and pilot&#8208;scales). General guidelines are provided for each domain to promote consistency, transparency, and comparability across studies. This Perspective aims to facilitate rigorous cross&#8208;study comparison and accelerate the development of effective PFAS sorbents.

         <title>Electron Percolating Shielded Interlayer Enabling Ultrastable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilayer of PTAA/SnO2 (PS) is designed at the LLZTO solid electrolyte and Li metal interface, which creates a reverse electric field to block electron leakage, significantly reducing the electronic conductivity of LLZTO. Li dendrite formation is greatly suppressed at the surface and bulk of LLZTO, which contributes to the outstanding electrochemical performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
The electron percolation of grain boundaries in Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) induces internal lithium deposition and penetration, causing short circuits of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, which has become a significant obstacle hindering the practical application of LLZTO. In this work, an electron&#8208;percolating shielded interface constructing strategy is proposed between LLZTO and lithium metal (Li) to simultaneously suppress the Li dendrite growth at both the interface and within the LLZTO electrolyte. A Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;triMethylphenyl)aMine] (PTAA)/SnO2 (PS) bilayer is therefore designed between LLZTO and Li metal (LLZTO&#8208;PS|Li), where the hole&#8208;rich PTAA and electron&#8208;rich SnO2 generate a reverse electric field that effectively blocks the electron leakage, thereby reducing the electronic conductivity of LLZTO and preventing its internal dendrite formation. Furthermore, the smooth and compact PTAA/SnO2 coating significantly enhances interfacial contact and equalizes the interfacial potential to promote a uniform Li plating. As a result, the Li|LLZTO&#8208;PS|Li symmetric battery achieves stable cycling for over 5000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 2500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The Li|LLZTO&#8208;PS|LiFePO4 full battery demonstrates 86.2% capacity after 2000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;C. This study presents a novel interfacial engineering strategy for enhancing the performance and durability of garnet&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

A Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-triMethylphenyl)aMine] (PTAA)/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PS) bilayer is therefore designed between LLZTO and Li metal (LLZTO-PS|Li), where the hole-rich PTAA and electron-rich SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generate a reverse electric field that effectively blocks the electron leakage, thereby reducing the electronic conductivity of LLZTO and preventing its internal dendrite formation. Furthermore, the smooth and compact PTAA/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coating significantly enhances interfacial contact and equalizes the interfacial potential to promote a uniform Li plating. As a result, the Li|LLZTO-PS|Li symmetric battery achieves stable cycling for over 5000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 2500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The Li|LLZTO-PS|LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full battery demonstrates 86.2% capacity after 2000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;C. This study presents a novel interfacial engineering strategy for enhancing the performance and durability of garnet-based all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stopping Phase Separation Enables Durable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Photovoltaic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locking polyquaternium network strategy is proposed to suppress local electric fields that drive light&#8208;induced phase segregation. This approach enables wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite photovoltaics to achieve high efficiencies under both indoor and outdoor illumination, accompanied by extended operational stability. The findings establish a general design principle for durable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites and open new opportunities for indoor energy harvesting and integration with the Internet of Things.








Abstract
Light&#8208;induced halide segregation presents a fundamental barrier to the longevity of wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, a multifunctional ionic polymer, polyquaternium&#8208;37, is reported as an effective grain boundary passivator to inhibit the degradation pathway. This dual&#8208;interaction mechanism concertedly arrests halide migration at grain boundaries, thereby suppressing local electric&#8208;field and ultimately curbing light&#8208;induced phase separation. Consequently, the modified WBG perovskites demonstrate robust photostability under light stress. The champion inverted perovskite photovoltaic device delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.86% under AM 1.5G illumination and an outstanding indoor PCE of 43.19% under 1000 lux. Remarkably, the modified device exhibits a projected T90 lifetime exceeding 10 000 h under continuous indoor light cycling. This work pioneers a facile solution to halide segregation via grain boundary engineering, paving the way for operationally stable WBG perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Macrophages Mediate Mesoscale Brain Mechanical Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the role of infiltrating immune cells in sculpting the developing brain. Using Brillouin microscopy and active microrheology, we found microglia actively maintain tissue viscoelasticity. Moreover, colony stimulating factor one receptor (CSF1R)&#8208;driven stromal remodeling alters brain mechanics in vivo. These findings link immune activity, viscoelastic integrity, and neural tissue plasticity, offering insights for CSF1R&#8208;targeted therapies in cancer and neurodegeneration.








Abstract
Mechanical cues orchestrate cellular behavior in the brain, yet how they interface with immune regulation remains unresolved. Here, gigahertz&#8208;frequency Brillouin microscopy with optical trap&#8208;based active microrheology is integrated to map the mechanical impact of macrophage activity across timescales. It is revealed that microglia, brain's resident macrophages, actively sustain tissue viscoelasticity, rather than quiescently residing within the tissues under normal conditions. Moreover, macrophage colony&#8208;stimulating factor 1 receptor (csf1r)&#8208;driven stromal remodeling alters brain mechanical properties in vivo. These findings establish a direct link between immune activity, viscoelastic integrity, and structural plasticity of neural tissue. By bridging high&#8208;frequency material responses with immune&#8208;driven remodeling, the approach provides a framework for decoding how biophysical properties regulate slower&#8208;timescale signaling and offers mechanistic insights for increasing the efficacy of csf1r&#8208;targeted therapies in cancer and neurodegeneration.

         <title>Akkermansia Muciniphila&#8208;Inspired Oral siRNA Delivery by Active Matrix&#8208;Penetration and Intracellular Endoplasmic Reticulum Accumulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural oral nucleic acid delivery system inspired by Akkermansia muciniphila is developed, which efficiently penetrates the intestinal mucus by degrading mucins and targets the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via Golgi apparatus&#8211;ER transport. This enables effective PD&#8208;L1 silencing and immune checkpoint blockade therapy for colorectal cancer.









Abstract
Oral delivery of small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)&#160;is highly challenging due to the multiple barriers present in the gastrointestinal tract and within cells. Herein, inspired by intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila, the use of Akkermansia muciniphila membrane vesicles (AMVs) is introduced as an effective tool for oral delivery of siRNA. It is revealed that, distinct from common passive mucus&#8208;penetrating nanoparticles, AMVs enable active mucus penetration by degrading intestinal mucins, thereby enhancing their ability to traverse the intestinal barrier by approximately 4.6 times. Additionally, AMVs can markedly heighten siRNA penetration into tumor tissues. Once inside tumor cells, AMVs bypass the traditional endosomal&#8208;lysosomal degradation pathway typical of lipid&#8208;based delivery systems. Instead, they utilize a rapid transport expressway from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), facilitating the accumulation of siRNA within the ER and thereby markedly enhancing gene silencing efficiency. In a mouse model of colorectal cancer, this formulation effectively inhibits tumor growth by 91.6%, and it exhibits a favorable biosafety profile. Overall, this research unveils a unique and promising bioinspired platform for oral siRNA delivery, advancing the development of safe and efficient oral nucleic acid therapeutics.

         <title>Deterministic Switching of Antipolar Variants in Antiferroelectric Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;beam engineering of freestanding PbZrO3 membranes enables selective and reversible switching between in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane antiferroelectric domain variants. By tuning the built&#8208;in electric field through beam focusing, deterministic control of antipolar order is achieved. This programmable, non&#8208;contact approach offers a general strategy for reconfigurable domain engineering in perovskite antiferroelectrics and nanoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric (AFE) materials, characterized by their antiparallel dipole alignments, offer distinct ferroic functionalities desirable for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage and next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronic devices. However, the intrinsic degeneracy among antipolar domain variants poses a critical obstacle to their deterministic, nonvolatile control and practical integration into functional architectures. Here, selective and reversible manipulation of AFE domain configurations in freestanding PbZrO3 membranes via electron beam irradiation are demonstrated. By tailoring the electron beam&#8211;induced built&#8208;in electric field, controlled writing and erasure of both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane antipolar domain variants are enabled. Complementary phase&#8208;field simulations uncover the underlying energetic landscape and domain evolution under varying irradiation conditions, offering mechanistic insight into the observed transformations. These findings demonstrate a promising strategy for domain&#8208;level engineering of antiferroelectrics, establishing a generic and programmable approach to deterministically control antipolar ordering in perovskite systems&#8212;suggesting a pathway toward controlled, reversible switching of AFE domains in nanoscale oxide architectures.

         <title>Artificial Microtubules from Microrobot Swarm Unraveling for Directed Cargo Transport under Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by molecular transport on microtubules, here it is shown that artificial microtubules can spontaneously form when propelling microrobot swarms encounter pointwise or edgewise confinements and work effectively for cargo transport in biological setting such as in blood, making it a particularly exciting delivery platform.








Abstract
Cargo transport on artificial microtubules (AMTs) has been extensively explored in various biomedical applications, including drug delivery and cancer therapy. However, the transport velocity and directional controllability are still poor compared to their natural counterparts, especially under confinement. Here, we show that confinement can induce the spontaneous formation of AMTs from structural transformations of microrobot swarms, and that these AMTs are particularly adept at directionally controlled cargo transport. It is shown that a magnetically driven microrobot cluster, when locally pinned, can be unraveled along the boundary into a strand that can function as a microtubule thanks to collective tangential flows. We demonstrate with both experiments and simulations that the local pinning required for AMT formation can come from a single pinned particle, or from corners and necks ubiquitous in microchannels and cavities. By modulating the driving magnetic field, the microtubule formation process can be precisely manipulated following periodic perturbations and re&#8208;establishments of local order, thereby simultaneously controlling the velocity and direction of cargo transport.

     alt="Artificial Microtubules from Microrobot Swarm Unraveling for Directed Cargo Transport under Confinement"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by molecular transport on microtubules, here it is shown that artificial microtubules can spontaneously form when propelling microrobot swarms encounter pointwise or edgewise confinements and work effectively for cargo transport in biological setting such as in blood, making it a particularly exciting delivery platform.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargo transport on artificial microtubules (AMTs) has been extensively explored in various biomedical applications, including drug delivery and cancer therapy. However, the transport velocity and directional controllability are still poor compared to their natural counterparts, especially under confinement. Here, we show that confinement can induce the spontaneous formation of AMTs from structural transformations of microrobot swarms, and that these AMTs are particularly adept at directionally controlled cargo transport. It is shown that a magnetically driven microrobot cluster, when locally pinned, can be unraveled along the boundary into a strand that can function as a microtubule thanks to collective tangential flows. We demonstrate with both experiments and simulations that the local pinning required for AMT formation can come from a single pinned particle, or from corners and necks ubiquitous in microchannels and cavities. By modulating the driving magnetic field, the microtubule formation process can be precisely manipulated following periodic perturbations and re-establishments of local order, thereby simultaneously controlling the velocity and direction of cargo transport. The general applicability of this method has also been tested in biological environments including flowing blood, as well as in an in vitro delivery model under confinement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microbubble Shell Stiffness Engineering Enhances Ultrasound Imaging, Drug Delivery, and Sonoporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#160;Shell&#8208;engineered poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) microbubbles with tunable stiffness improve ultrasound imaging and therapy. Adjusting the length of the alkyl chain and the glass transition temperature maintains a narrow microbubble size distribution while enhancing drug loading, sonoporation and the acoustic response. Atomic force microscopy confirms over tenfold tunability in shell stiffness, enabling optimized imaging and therapeutic performance through precise polymer shell engineering.








Abstract
Microbubbles (MB) are widely used as contrast agents for ultrasound (US) imaging and US&#8208;enhanced drug delivery. While the majority of studies utilize commercial MB formulations, increasing experimental evidence indicates that distinct MB features critically determine their diagnostic and therapeutic performance. Here, it is shown that shell stiffness engineering of poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) (PACA) MB, via introducing monomers with varying alkyl chain lengths and glass transition temperatures, preserves a narrow size distribution &#8776;2&#8211;3&#160;&#181;m, while enhancing MB drug loading, in vitro sonoporation capability, and in vitro and in vivo acoustic responses. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations and spectroscopic experiments demonstrate that MB shell engineering increases drug diffusion rates in the shell, maximizing the loading capacity of the formulations. Atomic force microscopy demonstrates that the stiffness of the MB shell can be tailored by more than ten&#8208;fold, boosting sonoporation and imaging performance. Altogether, the work provides new insights into the control of polymeric MB structure and performance via dedicated shell engineering, promoting applications in US imaging and therapy.

         <title>Achieving Ultrahigh n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Power Factor in an Intrinsically Large Transport&#8208;Fermi Energy Gap Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectric polymer, P(TDPP&#8208;BT&#8208;LEG) is reported, with a record&#8208;high power factor of 397 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2. This exceptional performance is attributed to its intrinsically large transport&#8208;Fermi energy gap, enhanced doping facilitated by side chain&#8208;ionized dopant interactions, and efficient interchain coupling via BT units, offering valuable insights for the design of advanced organic thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
The conductivity of organic thermoelectric materials has seen significant improvements in the past few years, but often at the expense of the Seebeck coefficient. Consequently, the thermoelectric performance, especially for n&#8208;type materials, remains considerably lower than that of their inorganic counterparts. Herein, a high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectric polymer, P(TDPP&#8208;BT&#8208;LEG) is reported, with an unexpectedly high Seebeck coefficient and ultrahigh power factor, driven by its intrinsically large energy gap between the Fermi and transport energy levels and high charge carrier mobility. Notably, it is shown that strong electrostatic interactions induced by the ethylene glycol side chains facilitate charge transfer between the dopants and the polymer. This enables effective doping of polymers with high LUMO levels. Furthermore, efficient charge transport, arising from favorable molecular packing, allows the polymer to maintain high electrical conductivity even at low charge carrier concentrations. Ultimately, this polymer achieves a record&#8208;high n&#8208;type power factor of 397 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, with a high Seebeck coefficient of &#8722;420 &#181;V&#160;K&#8210;1. This study highlights the potential of enhancing the Seebeck coefficient through precise energy level tuning and molecular design, fundamentally advancing the rational design of high&#8208;performance organic thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Implanting Metal&#8208;Oxo Single Sites on Metal Surface: A Path to Geometric and Electronic Synergy in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedding isolated metal&#8211;oxo sites onto a metallic surface enables synergistic covalent hybridization and geometric regulation, thereby optimizing the adsorption strength of ORR intermediates.








Abstract
Promising and diverse strategies have emerged for creating isolated catalytic active sites, such as single&#8208;atom catalysts and single&#8208;atom alloys, aiming at achieving efficient and selective catalysis. However, the structural tunability of isolated active sites has largely been restricted to their chemical compositions, primarily due to the absence of a higher&#8208;order structure associated with these isolated atoms. To address this, an additional degree of freedom is introduced by incorporating functional groups onto these active sites. Specifically, metal&#8208;oxo single sites are implanted onto metal surfaces to achieve geometric and electronic synergy. As a demonstration of this concept, bismuth single sites are embedded onto a palladium surface, promoting p&#8208;d orbital hybridization and facilitating the formation of terminal Bi&#8208;oxo species. This cooperative interaction optimizes the adsorption strength of intermediates through both covalent electronic hybridization and geometric interactions. The Bi&#8208;oxo&#8208;embedded Pd hybrid nanostructure, created through consecutive etching and displacement deposition, enables the simultaneous optimization of key intermediates for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction. Remarkably, this hybrid nanostructure achieves specific and mass activities 11.03 and 8.45 times greater than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates high stability and achieves a power density of 280 mW cm&#8722;2 in direct methanol fuel cells.

         <title>Facile Bottom&#8208;Up Assembly of Photonic Micropatterns via Surface&#8208;Guided Colloidal Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution photonic micropatterns with vivid structural colors are fabricated through bottom&#8208;up assembly, guided by surface&#8208;dependent regioselective heterogeneous nucleation and crystal growth of colloidal particles. Full&#8208;spectrum color tunability is achieved by controlling particle size and interparticle attraction, while in situ color mixing is enabled by exclusive crystallization of bidisperse particles, expanding the accessible color palette.








Abstract
Photonic micropatterns derived from colloidal self&#8208;assembly are highly sought after for next&#8208;generation optical and functional devices. However, achieving high optical quality, spatial precision, and stopband tunability with a simple fabrication process remains challenging due to the limitations of conventional top&#8208;down techniques. Here, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is reported for fabricating high&#8208;resolution photonic micropatterns via regioselective heterogeneous nucleation and crystallization of polystyrene particles, directed by surface&#8208;dependent nucleation behavior. On strongly charged glass, nucleation is suppressed, while on weakly charged photoresist surfaces, it is promoted via depletion&#8208;mediated attraction. Photoresist micropatterns prepared by standard photolithography enable single&#8208;step, spatially localized crystal growth without physical confinement. The resulting crystalline grains exhibit uniform orientation and minimal intergrain gaps, displaying intense structural colors. By systematically tuning depletant and salt concentrations, an optimal pair potential well depth is identified that yields superior&#8208;quality photonic micropatterns. Full&#8208;spectrum color tunability is achieved by varying particle size while maintaining this optimal interaction range. Moreover, bidisperse systems show exclusive crystallization of distinct grain types within a single pattern, enabling in situ color mixing and extended color palettes. Beyond photolithography, that accessible charge&#8208;guided patterning is demonstrated using vapor&#8208;phase masking, oil stamping, and even fingerprints, highlighting the versatility and scalability of this bottom&#8208;up approach.

         <title>Close&#8208;Loop Cathode Chemistry Enables Self&#8208;Rejuvenating Aqueous Zn&#8211;Te Batteries Compromised by Non&#8208;Equilibrium Redox Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triethylsulfonium iodide (TESI) inhibits Te shuttling in aqueous Zn&#8208;Te batteries through three synergistic functions. TES+ forms a protective interphase on Zn, blocking shuttling and enabling uniform plating. I&#8722; catalyzes Te redox with reduced hysteresis, while generated I3&#8722; establishes closed&#8208;loop I3&#8722;/&#8722; redox to regenerate the cathode. This enables 94.3% capacity retention after 1500 cycles with a 12&#8208;hour rest.








Abstract
Tellurium (Te) emerges as an alluring cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, boasting an unrivaled six&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer capacity (1260 mAh g&#8722;1 and 7829 mAh cm&#8722;3). However, the battery performance and cycling stability are severely degraded by inherent TeOx&#183;H2O(aq) shuttle arising from proton&#8208;tunneling&#8208;induced non&#8208;equilibrium electrochemical hydrolysis, where proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dominates. In this work, a rejuvenation of dead Zn&#8211;Te batteries is demonstrated based on a close&#8208;loop chemistry via employing organic triethylsulfonium iodide (C6H15SI, TESI). The triiodide anions (I3&#8722;) are found to reduce dissolved TeOx&#183;H2O(aq.) with thermodynamic favorability to revitalize Te cathode, meanwhile, generated I2 is recycled back into the electrolyte by reacting with iodide anions. Simply left resting for 12&#160;h, a completely degraded Zn&#8211;Te cell (1500 cycles) recovered 94.3% of its initial capacity (465 mAh g&#8722;1). Furthermore, TES+ is found to promote an anode solid electrolyte interphase via detaching ethyl. The functional layer efficaciously prevented anode passivation caused by tellurium&#8208;shuttling and facilitated efficient zinc&#8208;ion transfer to achieve dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. This loop chemistry not only extends the lifespan of batteries but also enables the reuse of materials, potentially reducing the overall cost of battery production and resource consumption.

         <title>MXene Membrane as Multifunctional Interface for Vapor Splitting via Photothermal&#8208;Catalytic Membrane Distillation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional MXene&#8208;based membrane integrates photothermal evaporation and photocatalytic vapor splitting in a sweeping&#8208;gas membrane distillation (PTC&#8208;SGMD) platform, simultaneously generating freshwater and hydrogen. The SrTiO3/MX@PVDF interface leverages broad&#8208;spectrum solar absorption, efficient heat/mass transfer, and gas&#8211;solid catalysis to achieve high flux, robust H2 production, and long&#8208;term stability, highlighting a sustainable water&#8211;energy solution.








Abstract
Advancements in solar&#8208;driven processes are fundamentally transforming the production of freshwater and energy into a more sustainable manner. Realizing such potential requires developing highly efficient solar responsive materials and advanced solar systems. Here, an MXene&#8208;based membrane is reported as a multifunctional interface capable of simultaneously producing freshwater and hydrogen through a strategically designed photothermal&#8208;catalytic sweeping gas membrane distillation (PTC&#8208;SGMD) system. By leveraging membrane interface engineering, the innovative design integrates solar evaporation, vapor transportation, and vapor splitting within a single membrane. Unlike conventional liquid&#8211;solid systems, this liquid&#8211;solid&#8211;gas configuration overcomes photocatalyst leaching, interfacial heat loss, and inefficient mass transfer. The multifunctional membrane exhibits enhanced solar absorption and optimal permeability, enabling the MXene&#8208;photocatalyst composite to achieve efficient photocatalytic vapor splitting. Remarkably, the optimized SrTiO3/MX@PVDF membrane achieves a simultaneous water flux of 2.37&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2h&#8722;1 and hydrogen production of 947.8&#160;&#181;mol m&#8722;2h&#8722;1 under 1 sun irradiation. The PTC&#8208;SGMD system demonstrates total solar efficiency of 92.305% with outstanding stability over 72 h of continuous operation. This innovative approach offers a scalable solution to global water scarcity and energy challenges.

         <dc:description>
This review discusses the mechanisms and mitigation strategies for the degradation of organic active materials in aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs).

Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are promising candidate for the next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage. To develop a stable and cost&#8208;effective AORFB system, the organic active materials and ion&#8208;selective membranes (ISMs) are the most significant components to take into account. However, the degradation and crossover of organic materials downgrade the stability of AORFBs and represent major challenges for their practical application. Therefore, mitigating the degradation of organic species and designing high&#8208;performance ISMs are of highly desired. In this review, the degradation mechanisms of several representative organic species are first discussed in detail. And then some effective strategies for degradation mitigation are summarized. In addition, the updated advancements in ISMs research are analyzed, with particular emphasis on strategies for mitigating the crossover issue via the design and regulation of ion transport channels. Finally, current research hotspots and future research priorities are discussed, offering insights into the challenges and potential approaches for the optimizations of these two key components.

         <title>Polymer&#8211;Perovskite Microcrystal Heterojunction for Self&#8208;Powered Optical Sensing and Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable fabrication strategy is demonstrated for self&#8208;powered polymer&#8208;perovskite microcrystal heterojunction (PPMC HJ) photodetectors with clean interfaces and excellent performance: ultralow dark current, high dark&#8208;to&#8208;light ratio, fast response, and long&#8208;term stability. Design optimization boosted yield to 38%. KPFM revealed the Br&#8722; vacancy effects. Integration into an LISF converter validated its potential for next&#8208;gen optoelectronic and optical communication applications.








Abstract
The quasiepitaxial polymer&#8208;perovskite interface is a critical enabler for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, offering opulent features of efficient exciton dissociation and carrier transport. However, interfacial complexities, including energy barriers, poor interface, and defect states, pose significant challenges to scalability and performance. This study maps the nanoscale barrier landscape across the polymer&#8208;perovskite interface, revealing excellent photodetection performance and robust optical communication capacity. A tactical quasiepitaxial growth approach enables the fabrication of a high&#8208;yield inorganic&#8211;organic abrupt hybrid heterojunction (HHJ) photodetector by integrating CsPbBr3 monocrystal with a patterned poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (P3HT) film. This strategy boosts the fabrication yield from 5% to 38% and exhibits significant autonomous light&#8208;sensing performance, including an ultra&#8208;low dark current of below 10 fA at room temperature, a substantial dark&#8208;to&#8208;light conductivity ratio exceeding 106, a linear dynamic range (LDR) of &#8776;132.2&#160;dB, and an open&#8208;circuit photovoltage of &#8776;0.7&#160;V. The critical role of Br&#8722; vacancies in governing the photoelectrical behavior of the polymer&#8208;perovskite microcrystal heterojunction&#160;(PPMC HJ) device is revealed precisely at the nanoscale using various advanced KPFM techniques. Additionally, a light&#8208;to&#8208;frequency converter demonstrates its advanced sensing capabilities. These findings highlight the importance of precision&#8208;engineered polymer&#8208;perovskite microcrystal heterojunctions in overcoming current performance bottlenecks, paving the way for scalable, ultrafast photonic devices with superior performance and reliability.

         <title>Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvent Processed Shortwave Infrared Organic Photodetectors Using Sub&#8208;1&#160;eV Bandgap Acceptor with Cyano Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic photodetector using a cyano&#8208;substituted non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (6CN) achieves efficient shortwave infrared (SWIR) detection up to 1250&#160;nm. Processed from the eco&#8208;friendly solvent o&#8208;xylene, the devices deliver excellent responsivity and low noise.









Abstract
Shortwave infrared (SWIR) organic photodetectors (OPDs) offer significant potential but face persistent challenges such as limited responsivity and high noise under reverse bias. This work presents the development of high&#8208;performance OPDs for SWIR sensing, leveraging a newly designed non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) named 6CN.

         <title>Dual Vacancy&#8208;Driven &#8220;Lattice Softening&#8221; NiFeAlx LDHs for High&#8208;Rate and Durable Chloride Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a mild room&#8208;temperature etching strategy, rational construction of dual&#8208;vacancy domains and multidimensional ion pathways is realized in NiFeAlx layered double hydroxide cathodes. The vacancy&#8208;rich, lattice&#8208;softened framework enables elastic strain accommodation and rapid Cl&#8722; diffusion, delivering unprecedented cycling stability and high&#8208;rate performance beyond previously reported chloride&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Defect engineering becomes an essential strategy for enhancing electrochemical performance, yet its application in anion&#8208;based systems such as chloride&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) remains largely unexplored. Herein, a rational defect&#8208;engineering strategy is developed to overcome these bottlenecks by constructing dual&#8208;vacancy NiFeAlx layered double hydroxides (LDHs) featuring coexisting cationic and oxygen vacancies, achieved via a room&#8208;temperature alkaline etching process that selectively leaches Al3+ while retaining layered integrity. The optimized NiFeAl0.04&#8208;24h&#8208;Cl LDH exhibits unprecedented &#8220;lattice softening&#8221; behavior, enabling elastic deformation and dynamic structural reconstruction to accommodate volumetric fluctuations during Cl&#8208;intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. Benefiting from this defect&#8208;induced structural flexibility, the electrode delivers a high reversible capacity of 101.4 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, along with the Coulombic efficiency of 99.91%. Multiscale mechanistic analyses demonstrate that the coupled vacancies regulate local electronic distribution and coordination environments while simultaneously imparting pronounced lattice softening and structural elasticity to the NiFeAl0.04&#8208;24h&#8208;Cl LDH, thereby facilitating enhanced Cl&#8722; ion accommodation. Furthermore, the vacancies construct interconnected 3D ion highways, which dramatically accelerate Cl&#8722; diffusion, enhance interfacial adsorption kinetics, and minimize charge&#8208;transfer resistance. Such lattice&#8208;adaptive regulation resolves the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between anion&#8208;storage capacity and structural stability in LDH&#8208;based systems, offering a promising strategy for designing efficient anion&#8208;hosting electrodes for advanced CIB systems.

         <title>Unprecedented Energy Density of Polyimide Dielectrics at Elevated Temperatures Utilizing Atomic Engineering to Decouple &#960;&#8208;Conjugation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study establishes a site&#8208;specific ortho&#8208;chlorination strategy for semi&#8208;aromatic polyimides, which localizes &#960;&#8208;electrons and induces conformational distortion to disrupt intrachain &#960;&#8208;conjugation and interchain &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Consequently, the Cl&#8208;PI films deliver discharged energy densities of 7.22 J cm&#8722;3 with &gt;90% efficiency at 200 &#176;C and 6.79 J cm&#8722;3 at 250 &#176;C, demonstrating excellent high&#8208;temperature dielectric performance.








Abstract
Emerging demands for polymer dielectrics in high&#8208;power electronics and harsh environments call for polymers with simultaneously high thermal stability and electrical performance. However, most polymers suffer from rapid conduction loss at elevated temperatures. Here it is shown that atomic&#8208;level backbone chlorination of polyimide (Cl&#8208;PI) imposes &#960;&#8208;electron localization and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane steric barriers that, together, suppress through&#8208;plane hopping arising from both intrachain &#960;&#8208;conjugation and interchain &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, dismantling long&#8208;range conduction pathways. This cooperative mechanism markedly curtails high&#8208;temperature conduction loss and yields outstanding capacitive performance, delivering discharge energy densities (Ud) of 9.52 J cm&#8722;3 at 150 &#176;C and 7.22 J cm&#8722;3 at 200 &#176;C, with efficiencies exceeding 90%. Even at 250&#176;C, an unprecedented Ud of 6.79 J cm&#8722;3 is retained, outperforming reported high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers. Moreover, Cl&#8208;PI exhibits excellent self&#8208;cleaning behavior and cycling durability, sustaining over 106 cycles at 200&#160;&#176;C and 400&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 with minimal degradation. This work underscores the potential of atomic&#8208;level backbone engineering to enable next&#8208;generation polymer dielectrics for reliable, high&#8208;temperature capacitive energy storage.

         <title>Grain Welding Strategy Suppressing Chemomechanical Failure in Polycrystalline Cathode for High&#8208;Voltage Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grain welding strategy is presented to achieve densification of particle in polycrystalline O3&#8208;NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode material via introducing Li2CO3 and Na2CO3 eutectics to form liquid phase sintering. The modified cathode suppresses the generation of microcracks and high&#8208;voltage phase transition, impeding chemomechanical failure and achieving high&#8208;voltage fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Chemomechanical failure is critical bottleneck for Na&#8208;based layered oxides (especially polycrystalline material) to achieve the stable operating at high&#8208;voltage with fast&#8208;charging ability. Although attempts like coating and doping are presented to alleviate this issue, the inherent intergranular crevices are inevitable during the synthetic process, which facilitates the chain reaction of chemomechanical failure. Herein, a concept of grain welding strategy is presented to achieve densification of powder particle by introducing liquid phase sintering process, strengthening intergranular adhesion force. The designed polycrystalline NaLi0.05[Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3]0.95O2 shows dense structure attributed to the formation of eutectics which lowers the melting point with fast mass transfer. The Li doping also well manipulates the interlayer properties in unit cell, suppressing the high&#8208;voltage phase transition. Multiple characterizations like cross&#8208;sectional images and synchrotron&#8208;based full&#8208;field transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy confirm that the modified material suppresses the generation of microcracks during electrochemical cycles, impeding the chemomechanical breakdown. Consequently, it shows advanced capacity of 152.8 mAh g&#8722;1, excellent fast charging capability (121.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;C, 12&#160;min), as well as long&#8208;life of 1000 cycles.

         <title>Beyond Conventional Cooling: Advanced Micro/Nanostructures for Managing Extreme Heat Flux</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the design, application, and manufacturing of biomimetic or engineered micro/nanostructures for managing high heat&#8208;flux in multi&#8208;level electronics by enhancing conductive, convective, phase&#8208;changing, and radiative heat transfer mechanisms, highlighting their potential for efficient, targeted thermal management, and future prospects.








Abstract
The surge in device integration has escalated thermal losses, compromising performance and safety, necessitating advanced thermal management solutions with extraordinary heat flux capabilities to address power and heat dissipation challenges in high heat&#8208;flux electronics. Micro/nanostructures have emerged as promising solutions for targeted heat dissipation in electronics due to their outstanding performance, miniature footprint, and design flexibility. However, a comprehensive review of recent advancements in heat transfer control via micro/nanostructures and their current and potential applications for high heat&#8208;flux thermal management, particularly for electronic devices, remains lacking. This review systematically examines the fundamental heat transfer mechanisms enabled by micro/nanostructures at multiscales. A wide range of bio&#8208;inspired or engineered designs are highlighted as formidable candidates for highly efficient thermal and hydrodynamic metamaterials. Novel micro/nano&#8208;patterns that significantly contribute to the modulation of coupled heat transfer processes in practical applications for electronic thermal management are elaborated. Furthermore, the strengths and limitations of existing design and manufacturing methods for micro/nanostructures are comparatively summarized. Finally, key challenges and prospects of micro/nanostructure&#8208;based thermal management techniques are discussed, drawing insights from previous applications. This review underscores the transformative potential of micro/nanostructures in achieving reliable, sustainable, and targeted thermal management for high&#8208;performance electronic devices in the near future.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Creep Adhesive Tapes via Trapped&#8208;Entanglement&#8208;Regulated Topological Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under continuous external force, creep deformation occurs on the adhesive joint insidiously, which will gradually result in failure. Authors introduce topological trapped entanglements to build a permanent yet compliant polymer network, effectively improving the long&#8208;term adhesion performance of adhesive tapes under static load condition.








Abstract
Adhesive tapes with high adhesion strength are critical in applications from structural bonding, biomedical devices, to flexible electronics. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by creep&#8212;time&#8208;dependent deformation under sustained stress&#8212;which leads to irreversible failure in long&#8208;term applications. While transient non&#8208;covalent interactions are widely engineered to enhance short&#8208;term energy dissipation, they inherently compromise creep resistance due to their dynamic reversibility. Herein, this persistent challenge is addressed by designing anti&#8208;creep adhesive tapes through precise topological regulation of polymer networks. By systematically comparing linear, covalent&#8208;crosslink, and trapped&#8208;entanglement&#8208;dominated architectures, the entanglement&#8208;stabilized networks are demonstrated to achieve a three&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction in creep rate while maintaining strong interfacial adhesion. The unique combination of long&#8208;chain entanglements and spare crosslinks enables efficient elastic energy storage without sacrificing tackiness, resolving the trade&#8208;off between dynamic dissipation and permanent mechanical integrity. This work provides both a mechanistic framework for understanding creep in adhesive materials and a scalable strategy for developing durable, high&#8208;performance polymer adhesives.

         <title>Metamaterials Break the Constraints of Traditional Civil Infrastructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical metamaterials offer a new path to overcome the limits of traditional civil infrastructure. This perspective explores how they can enhance strength&#8208;to&#8208;density ratios, expand the design space beyond conventional Ashby plot limits, and enable advanced functionalities. In this framework, construction metamaterials can sense, process, and communicate, functioning as the brain, eyes, and skin of future civil infrastructure.








Abstract
Advanced materials are essential for enhancing the resilience, efficiency, and adaptability of civil infrastructure. Yet, the core materials used in civil infrastructure systems today have remained largely unchanged for nearly a century, with fixed properties that limit their ability to realize these capabilities. Mechanical metamaterials offer a path to overcome the inherent constraints of conventional civil infrastructure materials. This perspective explores how mechanical metamaterials can redefine the backbone of civil infrastructure systems at the material level by encoding function in geometry, thereby enabling programmable mechanics and advanced multifunctional responses. Their scope of influence spans buildings, transportation networks, underground structures, offshore platforms, and architectural or interior systems, where thousands of components currently designed with conventional materials can be reimagined using optimized metamaterial counterparts. A mechanical metamaterial approach to civil infrastructure design can enhance structural performance by improving strength&#8208;to&#8208;density ratios, expanding the design space beyond conventional Ashby plot limits, and supporting applications such as seismic isolation, vibration damping, and lightweight construction. The discussion underscores the potential of mechanical metamaterials to introduce advanced functionalities such as energy harvesting, sensing, and wireless communication within civil infrastructure systems. These capabilities, traditionally associated with electronic devices, can be incorporated directly into structural components to create infrastructure with higher autonomy and adaptability. Multimodal integration with electromagnetic and photonic metamaterials further extends these possibilities by allowing materials to exhibit intrinsic communication, stealth behavior, or visual responsiveness. The perspective concludes with a roadmap outlining key developments and challenges toward a more integrated and responsive metamaterial&#8208;driven infrastructure. Within this framework, structurally tuned construction metamaterials can sense their environment, process information, and communicate with surrounding systems, functioning as the brain, eyes, and skin of future civil infrastructure.

         <title>Interfacial Charge Flow Modulation of CaF2/CaAl12O19:Dy Heterojunctions for Enhanced Mechanoluminescence in Flexible Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterojunctions are constructed by in situ growing CaF2:Dy on the CaAl12O19:Dy particles. Compared with the single&#8208;phase materials, the constructed CaF2/ CaAl12O19:Dy heterojunction interfaces via F&#9472;Al&#9472;O and F&#9472;Ca&#9472;O bonds boost the charge flow from CA6 to CaF2, enhancing the interfacial triboelectricity and thus yielding improved mechanoluminescent performance in terms of intensity, repeatbility, and self&#8208;recoverability in flexible composites.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) flexible composites show broad application prospects in stretchable optoelectronics and wearable devices. However, challenges such as low brightness, inadequate repeatability, and restricted self&#8208;recoverability hinder their practical use. Aiming to these issues, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of the heterojunction strategy on the interfacial triboelectricity&#8208;induced ML in flexible composites. Herein, the typical interfacial triboelectricity&#8208;dependent ML material of CaF2:Dy is in situ grown on the trap&#8208;controlled ML material of CaAl12O19:Dy (CA6:Dy) because of their high crystal lattice matching ability. Compared with the single&#8208;phase materials, the CaF2/CA6:0.06Dy heterojunctions exhibit outstanding ML performance in the flexible polydimethylsiloxane matrix, which can achieve repeatable ML for over 10&#160;000 times with a self&#8208;recovery degree of ca. 91.60%. The trap&#8208;controlled mechanism and interfacial triboelectrification&#8208;induced electron bombardment model are both responsible for the ML of CaF2/CA6:0.06Dy heterojunctions. Theoretical calculation results suggest that the construction of heterojunction interfaces via F&#9472;Al&#9472;O and F&#9472;Ca&#9472;O bonds can effectively prompt the charge flow from CA6 to CaF2. This endows CaF2/CA6:0.06Dy with enhanced interfacial triboelectricity and enriched trap structure, leading to improved ML properties. This work confirms that rational heterojunction design can overcome the limitations of single&#8208;phase materials in flexible matrices, offering a robust platform for the development of high&#8208;performance and flexible ML materials.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Observation of Atom Motion and Manipulation of Structural Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely controling focused electron beam irradiation on KTaO3 single crystal, not only atomic scale phase transformation from KTaO3 to K6Ta10.8O30 can be triggered along a specific crystalline direction, but also Ta atom migration process is directly observed. Moreover, the tetragonal tungsten bronze K6Ta10.8O30 formed here remains stable at ambient condition.








Abstract
Precisely controlling structural transformations is essential for realizing novel functionalities in crystal materials, as these transformations often result in significant changes in physical and chemical properties. However, such structural control at the atomic scale remains a formidable challenge. Here the direct observation and realization of atomic scale structural transformation is demonstrated from KTaO3 to K6Ta10.8O30 via high&#8208;energy electron beam manufacturing in scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), which can finally manipulate the Ta atom movements. The K and O vacancies in KTaO3 can be introduced via the knock&#8208;on energy transferred from the controled high&#8208;dose electron beams. These vacancies can further accommodate Ta atom emerging at the interstitial sites of the TaO2 plane in KTaO3. Thus, all atom species in KTaO3 can be stimulated via electron beam and the cooperative movements of them trigger the final formation of the new K6Ta10.8O30 phase. The detailed mechanisms are revealed by low&#8208;dose, in situ, atomic scale imaging under STEM. The controllability of this electron beam manufacture process and the stability of the new K6Ta10.8O30 phase is further validated. DFT calculations rationalize the triggering steps of the manufacture process and show the transformation is energetically beneficial at the condition of K and O vacancies introduced by knock&#8208;on effect.

     alt="In-Situ Observation of Atom Motion and Manipulation of Structural Transformation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By precisely controling focused electron beam irradiation on KTaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystal, not only atomic scale phase transformation from KTaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to K&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;10.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; can be triggered along a specific crystalline direction, but also Ta atom migration process is directly observed. Moreover, the tetragonal tungsten bronze K&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;10.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; formed here remains stable at ambient condition.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precisely controlling structural transformations is essential for realizing novel functionalities in crystal materials, as these transformations often result in significant changes in physical and chemical properties. However, such structural control at the atomic scale remains a formidable challenge. Here the direct observation and realization of atomic scale structural transformation is demonstrated from KTaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to K&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;10.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; via high-energy electron beam manufacturing in scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), which can finally manipulate the Ta atom movements. The K and O vacancies in KTaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be introduced via the knock-on energy transferred from the controled high-dose electron beams. These vacancies can further accommodate Ta atom emerging at the interstitial sites of the TaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plane in KTaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, all atom species in KTaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be stimulated via electron beam and the cooperative movements of them trigger the final formation of the new K&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;10.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; phase. The detailed mechanisms are revealed by low-dose, in situ, atomic scale imaging under STEM. The controllability of this electron beam manufacture process and the stability of the new K&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;10.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; phase is further validated. DFT calculations rationalize the triggering steps of the manufacture process and show the transformation is energetically beneficial at the condition of K and O vacancies introduced by knock-on effect. This work not only investigates the microscopic mechanism of electron beam-induced structural transformation, but also establishes a versatile pathway for synthesizing new functional materials with tailored properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible Organic Solar Cells: From Material Design and Morphology Optimization to Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent breakthroughs in flexible organic solar cells (F&#8208;OSCs), with a particular emphasis on the relevant material design strategies, morphology optimization, and wearable applications. Its purpose is to identify future research directions and accelerate the development of F&#8208;OSCs for next&#8208;generation flexible and sustainable energy solutions.








Abstract
Flexible organic solar cells (F&#8208;OSCs), characterized by lightweight, intrinsic flexibility, indoor&#8208;light compatibility, and biocompatibility, represent a promising energy solution for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, the inherent multi&#8208;layer architecture of F&#8208;OSCs introduces complex mechanical failure mechanisms, necessitating a systematic study on degradation pathways to guide rational device engineering. This review summarizes the main strategies for enhancing the mechanical durability of F&#8208;OSCs while maintaining their optoelectronic performance. First, an outline of standardized mechanical testing protocols for active layers and devices is provided. Subsequently, the design principles of key materials are analyzed, with a focus on optimizing molecular aggregation and entanglement in the active layers to achieve fracture&#8208;resistant flexible photovoltaics. Afterward, the discussion extends to progress in stretchable interface materials and electrode architectures, which collectively reinforce the device durability under deformation. By highlighting emerging applications, the successful integration of F&#8208;OSCs with low&#8208;power wearable systems is showcased. Finally, the remaining challenges, future directions, and the necessity of an unified mechanical&#8208;electrical optimization strategy from molecular engineering to device architecture are discussed. This comprehensive review aims to accelerate the development of mechanically robust F&#8208;OSCs for practical wearable technology.

         <title>Bioinspired Janus Spider&#8208;Web Nanofibrous Membranes Integrating Triboelectric Energy Harvesting, Adaptive Thermo&#8208;Moisture Regulation, and Bactericidal Activity for Multifunctional Wearables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;web&#8208;inspired Janus ferroelectric nanofibrous membrane integrates asymmetric wettability, high porosity, and robust flexibility. The membrane achieves self&#8208;powered thermo&#8208;moisture regulation, enhanced water transport, and antibacterial protection, demonstrating stable triboelectric output and multifunctional adaptability for wearable electronics, healthcare monitoring, and smart protective textiles.








Abstract
The development of multifunctional membranes integrating asymmetric wettability, breathable waterproofing, antibacterial activity, and energy&#8208;harvesting capabilities is critical for smart textiles and medical protective equipment, yet balancing robustness, environmental adaptability, and energy conversion efficiency remains challenging. Here, we engineer a bioinspired Janus nanofibrous membrane with a spider&#8208;web&#8208;like hierarchical architecture via synchronous electrospinning&#8208;electrospraying of poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and polyamide 6 (PA6). This design achieves dual&#8208;scale wettability (hydrophobic/hydrophilic asymmetry), 83.6% porosity, and mechanical durability (99% structural integrity after 2000 bends). It enables intelligent environmental regulation (7.4 &#8451; thermal gradient under 1 kW/m&#178; solar irradiation), while the electric&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced design accelerates water transport by 20% vs. passive diffusion. Its triboelectric performance surpasses existing breathable membranes (177.5 V open&#8208;circuit voltage, 0.63 W/m2 power density, stable output over 10,000 cycles), enabling encrypted Morse&#8208;code communication for programmable human&#8208;machine interaction. The hierarchical structure exhibits exceptional antibacterial efficacy: 99.92% against Escherichia coli (E. coli), 100% against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and 95% against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Via a scalable, low&#8208;cost process compatible with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing, this approach holds promise for industrial integration in next&#8208;generation wearable healthcare and protection systems.

         <title>Amorphous A&#8208;BiOI@PEG Nanoenzyme Targets Imaging and Synergistic Phototherapy in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amorphous a&#8208;BiOI@PEG nanoenzyme developed in this study is applied to specific dual&#8208;mode imaging tracking and near&#8208;infrared synergistic phototherapy for differentiated thyroid cancer. This material demonstrates high targeting efficiency, high biosafety, and superior imaging performance. Moreover, it exhibits efficient phototherapy in the near&#8208;infrared range while demonstrating synergistic effects with immunotherapy.








Abstract
The integration of medical nanomaterials into cancer diagnosis and treatment presents a multifaceted challenge, given the simultaneous necessity of achieving high targeting and excellent diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a PEGylated amorphous BiOI (a&#8208;BiOI@PEG) nanoenzyme is developed, whose abundant unsaturated bonds, iodine&#8208;containing delivery systems, and reduced bandgap facilitate active/passive uptake by thyroid cancer cells and response to second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II), respectively. This allows for accurate DTC&#8208;specific targeting of tumor cells for ultrasound and computer tomography (CT) imaging and enhances synergistic phototherapy. Consequently, the results show that a&#8208;BiOI@PEG outperforms the common CT contrast agent iohexol and B&#8208;mode ultrasonography. This process is followed by the generation of remarkable ROS and an increase in temperatures above 48&#160;&#8451; in 10&#160;min under 1064&#160;nm NIR, inducing impressive immunogenic cell death and exerting long&#8208;term anti&#8208;tumor effects at primary and metastatic sites to prevent cancer metastasis, while normal cells are rarely killed. This study reveals the intricate relationship between amorphous structures and diagnostic integration, laying the foundation for the design of highly targeted and efficient amorphous nanoenzymes that simultaneously target thyroid tumors.

         <title>Trace&#8208;Level Green Bio&#8208;Derived Amino Acid Molecular Leveling Agent Enables Dendrite&#8208;Free and Long&#8208;Lifespan Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;derived BICINE is introduced as a green and efficient leveling agent to regulate Zn2+ solvation structure and guide uniform Zn nucleation. It also promotes the formation of a stable organic/inorganic hybrid SEI, effectively suppressing dendrites and side reactions, achieving over 5400 h of stable cycling at 5 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The poor reversibility of Zn metal anodes, caused by dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced side reactions, hinders the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). To address these issues, regulating Zn2+ solvation structure, controlling nucleation behavior, and constructing a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are crucial. Herein, a trace&#8208;level (10&#160;mg mL&#8722;1) bio&#8208;derived surface&#8208;leveling agent, N,N&#8208;dihydroxyethyl glycine (BICINE), is introduced to tailor the interfacial environment. With multiple coordinating groups, BICINE adsorbs onto the Zn surface, homogenizes nucleation, reconstructs solvation sheath, and induces a hybrid SEI. Meanwhile, it promotes the formation of a uniform cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), stabilizing cathode morphology and preventing irreversible degradation. These synergistic effects suppress dendrite growth and parasitic reactions, enabling highly reversible Zn plating/stripping. Consequently, symmetric Zn||Zn cells demonstrate remarkable stability, with the capability to operate for over 5,300&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 and maintain stable performance at a high depth of discharge (88.2%). Asymmetric Cu||Zn cells exhibit exceptional Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% over 1,650 cycles. Even with a low N/P ratio of 3, Zn||NH4V4O10 full cells retain 89.7% of their capacity after 250 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. The low&#8208;cost BICINE strategy holds great promise for advancing the commercialization of AZIBs.

         <title>Unveiling Hydrogen Coverage on Ru Nanoparticles Through Modeling and Experiments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study illustrates the particle size&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent hydrogen coverage on Ru particles. For small nanoparticles with the appearance of corner and edge atoms, the hydrogen uptake can exceed 1 ML and even reach &gt; 2 ML. This study provides insights into the accurate characterization of nanoparticle size and the control of hydrogen poisoning, paving the way for more efficient catalyst designs.








Abstract
Understanding metal&#8208;hydrogen interactions is essential in catalysis research. Hydrogen activation on metal catalysts is crucial in industrially catalytic processes, and measurements of hydrogen uptake are widely used to estimate the dispersion of supported metal catalysts. Here, advanced computational strategies, including density functional theory (DFT), ab initio phase diagrams, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations, are combined with experiments to quantitatively examine hydrogen uptake by Ru at the atomic scale. The results reveal that small Ru nanoparticles (&#8776;1&#160;nm) can adsorb more than two monolayers (ML) of hydrogen (H/Ru &gt; 2) under ambient conditions, while even for larger particles (&#8776;4.8&#160;nm), hydrogen uptake remains higher than 1.2 ML (H/Ru &gt; 1). This size&#8208;dependent behavior, confirmed experimentally using high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and chemisorption, challenges the conventional assumption of a uniform 1 ML saturation coverage on surfaces, and indicates that conventional chemisorption analyses may significantly overestimate Ru dispersion or underestimate particle size. Furthermore, DPMD simulations also qualitatively predict hydrogen uptake on Ru surfaces at ambient and working temperatures. The findings provide a more accurate database of Ru&#8211;H interactions, correcting for Ru particle size&#8211;dependent hydrogen uptake, and can potentially be applied to both academic research and industrial applications.

         <title>Trace Oxygen&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of High&#8208;Quality Graphene with Improved Electrical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the critical role of trace oxygen in graphene synthesis. Superclean graphene films are synthesized via trace oxygen&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition. Experimental and computational analyses elucidate the dual role of oxygen in etching amorphous carbon and assisting defect repair during graphene growth. This strategy substantially enhances graphene's crystallinity while simultaneously improving its electronic performance.








Abstract
Point defects and amorphous carbon contamination, which are almost inevitable during the high&#8208;temperature chemical vapor deposition growth process, are demonstrated to severely degrade the intrinsic properties of graphene films, particularly their electronic performance. This study puts forward a trace oxygen&#8208;assisted strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;quality graphene by effectively eradicating amorphous carbon contamination and then promoting the repair of underlying lattice defects. Both experimental results and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that lattice healing is inhibited when the lattice is covered by amorphous carbon but facilitated with the aid of oxygen. The high crystallinity of the synthesized graphene is evidenced by its strong resistance to electron&#8208;beam radiation and mechanical property (2D Young's modulus &#8776;355 N&#160;m&#8722;1 and fracture strength &#8776;1778 nN) comparable to that of exfoliated graphene. Furthermore, the as&#8208;obtained graphene film exhibits enhanced electronic performance, including a low sheet resistance of 174.4 &#177; 31.9 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and a high carrier mobility exceeding 15&#160;000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature. This work not only elucidates the novel functions of oxygen in the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene but also offers new prospects for further enhancing the performance of graphene.

         <title>Chiral Nanoagonist Targeting EGFR for Nerve Injury Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral nanoagonist is proposed to effectively activate EGFR for nerve injury repair. D&#8208;Histidine ZnO nanorods promote cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in a chirality&#8208;dependent manner through EGFR signaling networks. Further incorporated into a biodegradable bandage, enhanced nerve regeneration and function recovery are demonstrated in both peripheral and central nervous system injury models.








Abstract
Nerve injury repair is limited by the incapacity to regenerate neurons in the nervous system. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in the development of the nervous system, but its potential in nerve regeneration and repair has remained underappreciated. Herein, a chiral nanoagonist, D&#8208;Histidine ZnO nanorods (NRs), is reported to effectively activate EGFR and initiate multiple downstream cascade signaling pathways, promoting nerve cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in three different types of neural cells. D&#8208;Histidine ZnO NRs not only achieve more than 85% differentiation rate (with neurite length larger than 50 &#181;m), but also induce the transdifferentiating of Schwann cells into a stem&#8208;like phenotype. A biodegradable band&#8208;aid&#8208;like bandage incorporating D&#8208;Histidine ZnO NRs is developed and applied in nerve injury repair in both sciatic nerve and spinal cord injury models. The neurorestoration and functional recovery are significantly improved after 4&#8208;week therapy. This study reveals that chirality&#8208;dependent regulation of nerve cell behavior by chiral nanoagonist targeting EGFR is a pioneering and promising strategy in nerve regeneration therapies.

A hybrid&#8208;sulfonamide electrolyte (HSE) stabilizes 4.5 V&#8208;class Li&#8208;ion batteries with high&#8208;nickel cathodes and Si&#8208;majority graphite anodes by forming a self&#8208;limiting inorganic interphase at the Si||electrolyte junction. The HSE enables a broad operating temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C and excellent cycling performance of 1.4 Ah pouch cells with 80% capacity retention after 1150 cycles.








Abstract
4.5&#160;V&#8208;class lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) pairing LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathodes with silicon&#8208;majority graphite (SmG, &gt;1500 mAh g&#8722;1) anodes can surpass 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, but their cycling stability, safety, and low&#8208;temperature operation are constrained by the difficulty in constructing stable interphase. This study reports a hybrid&#8208;sulfonamide electrolyte (HSE) that can survive the aggressive chemistry of high&#8208;voltage NMC811 and programs a self&#8208;limiting inorganic interphase on Si by leveraging the electron&#8208;limited onset at the Si||electrolyte junction. At first lithiation, the semiconductor characteristic and native SiOx create a space&#8208;charge (depletion) region, so the anionic&#8208;structure&#8208;like sulfonamides bias first&#8208;electron reduction, seeding lithium halide/chalcogenide inorganics that are electronically insulating yet Li+&#8208;permeable. The resulting thin, dense layer suppresses electron tunneling, dissolution, and resists crack&#8208;induced stress concentration during Si expansion&#8212;thereby self&#8208;limiting further growth. Consequently, NMC811||SmG coin cells with the HSE retain 80% capacity after 500 cycles at 4.5&#160;V and &#8776;5 mAh cm&#8722;2 and operate over a wide range of temperature from &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C, markedly outperforming the carbonate electrolyte. 1.4 Ah pouch cells maintain 80.0% of initial capacity after 1150 cycles and exhibit thermal stability up to 300 &#176;C. This work establishes self&#8208;limiting interphase formation on Si as a practical electrolyte design target for high&#8208;energy LIBs.

Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs) continue to encounter challenges in long&#8208;term stability and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficits, thereby constraining the performance and stability of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs). Constructing 3D/2D perovskite heterojunctions represents a promising avenue for performance enhancement; nonetheless, notable shortcomings still persist in carrier transport efficiency and thermal&#8208;stability at the 3D/2D heterojunction interface. Herein, a newly designed cross&#8208;linked polymer is meticulously deposited onto the surface of 3D perovskite, of which freely distributed carbonyl group (C&#9552;O) and N/O atoms effectively saturate surface defects and alleviate tensile strains. The improvement of surface properties induces the generation of gradient energy levels, effectively minimizes the recombination loss caused by the accumulation of minority carriers at the 3D/2D interface. More interestingly, the cross&#8208;linked polymer skeleton employs a strong physical barrier to effectively halt the migration of volatile A&#8208;site cations across the 3D/2D interface under thermal stress, maximizing the heterostructure's stability. The resultant wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite TSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.23% and 28.26% (certified 27.29%), accompanied by exceptional thermal&#8208;stability. This work underscores the vast potential of 3D/2D heterojunction design, offering valuable insights for the advancement of wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite TSCs.

         <title>Light&#8208;Up Nanostructures with Allosterically Controlled Fluorogenic DNA Aptamers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By customizing allosteric regulation into fluorescent DNA aptamers, switchable fluorescent nanodevices become achievable. Such a sequence&#8208; and structure&#8208;dependent engineering leads to the realization of clear&#8208;cut fluorescent ON&#8211;OFF switches alongside more advanced operations like Boolean gates and combinatorial circuits. The incorporation of allosteric aptamers with tunable fluorescent properties in DNA nanostructures points a versatile platform of DNA data storage and computing.








Abstract
In this study, a systematic approach is presented for the rational design of synthetic allosteric DNA aptamers. This methodology enables precise control over the allosteric ON&#8211;OFF transition in fluorescent DNA aptamers, allowing for the engineering of aptamers with highly tunable fluorescent properties. When combined with toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, a series of allosteric aptamers is developed in which the target sequence functions as a specific allosteric modulator. Furthermore, these aptamers are applied in synthetic DNA computing and in the construction of responsive nanostructures that light up upon activation.

         <title>Programmable Photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Triggered by a Temperature&#8208;Adaptation Spin Polarization Electron Pump</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a temperature&#8208;adaptation spin polarization electron pump that enables directional electron transfer and suppresses charge recombination. The injected spin polarization electrons stabilize CO* intermediates and promote their hydrogenation toward CH4, achieving reversible product selectivity and enhanced CO2 photoreduction efficiency.








Abstract
Selective control of CO2 photoreduction toward CO or CH4 is essential for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion. Reversible switching between these two products remains challenging because conventional photocatalysts cannot adjust charge behavior with temperature, and polar intermediates are insufficiently stabilized. A temperature&#8208;adaptation photocatalytic platform that acts as a spin polarization electron pump, delivering programmable interfacial electron injection and dynamically steering CO2 reduction pathways in real time is reported. At low temperature, adaptive modulation increases interfacial electron accumulation at the reaction interface, extending the lifetime and reactivity of deep&#8208;pathway intermediates without altering catalyst composition. Consequently, product selectivity reversibly shifts from CO at high temperature to CH4 at low temperature, enabling controlled access to either shallow or deep reduction products under reliably well&#8208;defined thermal conditions. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance demonstrate enhanced spin polarization and reduced charge recombination upon cooling, consistent with stronger interfacial electron retention. In situ infrared spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics reveal that spin polarization&#8208;selective transfer bends CO2 and induces C&#9472;O bond asymmetry, which facilitates CHO* formation and lowers the barrier for CO* hydrogenation to CH4. Collectively, these findings establish a generalizable strategy that integrates spin polarization with temperature responsiveness to realize dynamically programmable product selectivity in solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion.

         <title>Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Achieved by Microcapsule Rupture&#8208;Triggered In&#8208;Situ Polymerization for High&#8208;Contrast Damage Visualization and Advanced Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>

         <dc:description>
This study develops a microcapsule rupture&#8208;triggered in&#8208;situ polymerization strategy for mechano&#8208;responsive ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with full&#8208;color tunable emissions. This approach paves the way for the development of self&#8208;healing smart coatings capable of high&#8208;contrast damage visualization, as well as advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems featuring mechanically activated dynamic RTP responses.








Abstract
Polymer materials with mechano&#8208;responsive ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly desired but challenging to achieve. Herein, a microcapsule (MC) rupture&#8208;triggered in&#8208;situ polymerization strategy is proposed to achieve such RTP with full&#8208;color tunable emissions. It involves co&#8208;encapsulating organic phosphors and moisture&#8208;reactive hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) in MCs, which are dispersed into a polymer matrix. Mechanical damage ruptures MCs, releasing HDI that undergoes moisture&#8208;initiated polymerization to form a rigid cross&#8208;linked network at the damaged site. This network effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative decay pathways of triplet excitons, thereby activating &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; ultralong RTP signals specifically and exclusively at the damaged sites. The system achieves&#160;ultralong RTP lifetimes exceeding 1.5&#160;s and a phosphorescence quantum yield of 11.2%. Notably, these RTP systems demonstrate&#160;exceptional stability under harsh conditions, including immersing in neutral, acidic, alkaline aqueous environments and various organic solvents, as well as exposure to high temperatures. Full&#8208;color tunable afterglow emissions, ranging from blue to red, are readily achieved by employing different organic phosphors. This approach facilitates the development of self&#8208;repairing smart coatings with high&#8208;contrast damage visualization and advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems featuring mechanically activated dynamic RTP responses.&#160;Furthermore, the compatibility of MCs with diverse polymer matrices expands the practical applicability of such stimuli&#8208;responsive ultralong RTP materials.

         <title>Optically Driven Eutectogel Pyroelectric for Efficient Deformable Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an elastomeric, self&#8208;powered photodetector based on a polyvinyl alcohol pyroelectric eutectogel, which achieves an ultrabroad spectral response, high responsivity and detectivity, as well as a fast response time. Its versatile applicability is demonstrated in encrypted optical communication, conformal image sensing, and diffuse reflection imaging.








Abstract
Ionic gels are emerging stimuli&#8208;response elastomers for biomimetic sensors in diverse fields. Photoresponse ionic gels can detect light as a photoreceptor to emulate biological vision for artificial retina and skin. However, the existing ionic gel&#8208;based photosensors face limited response speeds and detecting sensitivity due to inefficient ion transport. Here, a high&#8208;performance elastomeric photodetector made of polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;based pyroelectric eutectogels, containing polar ions and crystalline domains, is reported, which exhibits a high pyroelectric coefficient and enables efficient optical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion via spontaneous polarization, even under 30% tensile strain. The resulting self&#8208;powered photodetector features a broad spectral response spanning 365&#8211;1300&#160;nm, with photoresponsivity, detectivity, and response time of 42.06&#160;mA W&#8722;1, 7.65 &#215; 1010 Jones and 24/35&#160;ms at 455&#160;nm, respectively. The photodetector array enables light&#8208;encrypted communication and sensitive optical imaging.

         <title>Silver Ions as Ambipolar Dopants in InAs Nanocrystal Solids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8314; ions post&#8208;introduced into InAs nanocrystal films act as ambipolar dopants whose effect depends on host polarity and dopant concentration. In n&#8208;type InAs nanocrystal films, Ag&#8314; occupies interstitial sites to yield n&#8208;type doping effect, whereas in Zn&#8208;doped p&#8208;type InAs nanocrystal films, it first forms p&#8208;type surface doping effect and later induces n&#8208;type doping effect, enabling polarity&#8208;tunable III&#8211;V nanocrystal devices.








Abstract
The precise control of semiconductor polarity in nanocrystals (NCs) is crucial for optimizing device performance in various optoelectronic applications. In this study, it is shown that Ag&#8314;, added post&#8208;synthetically to InAs NCs using an AgNO3 solution, can induce either n&#8208;type or p&#8208;type doping of the solid, depending on the intrinsic polarity of the host and the dopant concentration. In n&#8208;type InAs NCs, Ag&#8314; consistently acts as an interstitial n&#8208;type dopant, shifting the conduction band minimum closer to the Fermi level. Conversely, in p&#8208;type InAs NCs (innately doped with Zn during synthesis), Ag&#8314; initially exhibits a p&#8208;type doping effect at low concentrations by forming surface dipoles but transitions to an n&#8208;type doping effect at higher concentrations through interstitial incorporation. These results offer a unified understanding of the intricate and adjustable doping behavior of Ag&#8314; in colloidal NC systems and present new opportunities for post&#8208;synthetic polarity engineering in III&#8211;V nanomaterials.

         <title>Submicron Structure Confined Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel strategy for fabricating intrinsically stretchable polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) by incorporating microcrystalline elastomers into light&#8208;emitting polymers. This approach enhances crystallinity, carrier transport, and light outcoupling efficiency. The stretchable PLEDs achieved 4.70% external quantum efficiency, a 3.70 V turn&#8208;on voltage, and 32 013 cd m&#8722;2 luminance, with excellent stability under strain, showing significant potential for wearable displays.








Abstract
Stretchable polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) hold promises for skin&#8208;like wearable displays, yet simultaneously achieving high stretchability, efficient luminescence performance, and facile integration remains challenging. Here, a novel strategy introducing microcrystalline elastomer into light&#8208;emitting polymer matrices to fabricate intrinsically stretchable PLEDs that meet all these characteristics is presented. This approach enables the formation of submicron optical self&#8208;gain structures in light&#8208;emitting polymers and the structures confine polymers to form a nanofiber morphology through spatial nanoconfinement effects, which improves polymer crystallinity, facilitates carrier transport, and enhances light outcoupling efficiency through increased reflection and scattering. Leveraging these characteristics, the intrinsically stretchable PLEDs achieved a current efficiency (CE) of 13.70&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.70%, a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.70&#160;V and a luminance of 32&#160;013&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 at 9&#160;V. Additionally, 12&#160;&#215;&#160;12 intrinsically stretchable PLED arrays are fabricated by electrohydrodynamic printing, which exhibit excellent photoelectric stability under tensile and bending strain. This approach holds significant potential for high&#8208;performance stretchable and wearable displays.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled MUC1 Ablation via Steric Locking of Turn&#8208;On Reactors Enhances Pyroptosis&#8208;Immunotherapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly engineered theranostic reactor is developed, which could bind to MUC1 on glycoengineered triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells and enter a sterically locked state. It inactivates MUC1 under remotely&#8208;controlled light signals while enabling in&#8208;situ visualization of membrane MUC1, leading to a potent pyroptosis&#8208;associated immunostimulatory effect.








Abstract
Mucin 1 (MUC1) is aberrantly upregulated in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and presents major roles in orchestrating TNBC pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance. Herein, a bioorthogonal MUC1&#8208;binding strategy is reported to install MUC1&#8208;lockable aggregation&#8208;induced emission theranostic reactor (AIETR) onto MUC1 for pyroptosis&#8208;immunotherapy while enabling in situ MUC1 visualization. TNBC&#8208;bearing hosts are first treated with 1,3,4&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;N&#8208;azidoacetylmannosamine&#8208;containing bioresponsive nanoassemblies to generate azido groups on MUC1 via sialic acid metabolism pathway. Dibenzocyclooctyne and MUC1&#8208;binding aptamer arms in AIETR can separately bind with azide moieties and aptamer binding domains in MUC1 of glycoengineered TNBC cells and restrict intramolecular rotation to activate their AIE&#8208;dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and fluorescence imaging capacity. The proximity&#8208;dependent ROS damage abolishes membrane MUC1 to activate pyroptosis cascades. Moreover, treatment&#8208;enabled MUC1 inactivation also ameliorates MUC1&#8208;dependent immunosuppression in TNBC microenvironment to boost anti&#8208;TNBC immunity. This study offers an effective approach for precision TNBC theranostics in the clinic.

         <title>Resolving the mRNA Encapsulation&#8208;Release Trade&#8208;off via Compensatory Forces in Engineered Ionizable Lipids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a computational&#8211;experimental framework and structural validation, a &#8220;contact number&#8221; metric is introduced to guide IL design. Incorporating hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs balanced Coulombic and short&#8208;range forces, enabling robust mRNA encapsulation with efficient intracellular release, advancing vaccines and non&#8208;viral gene therapies.








Abstract
A critical challenge in lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) is the inherent trade&#8208;off between stable encapsulation and efficient intracellular release. Here, this challenge is addressed through rationally engineering compensatory forces between mRNA and LNP, leveraging short&#8208;range intermolecular interactions (van der Waals, hydrogen bonding) to dynamically balance long&#8208;range Coulombic binding. Guided by a computational&#8208;experimental framework, a &#8220;contact number&#8221; metric is developed to decipher mRNA and LNP binding hierarchies, enabling the strategic incorporation of short&#8208;range&#8208;interaction motifs (e.g., urea, carbamate) into ionizable lipid (IL) structures. These designs achieve optimal mRNA encapsulation while promoting endosomal escape and cytosolic release, resulting in enhanced mRNA translation. Compared to commercial mRNA vaccine counterparts, the engineered LNP (OT13&#8208;LNP) induces a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses and 77.9% tumor inhibition in melanoma. In hepatic gene editing, OT13&#8208;LNPs achieve comparable transthyretin (TTR) on&#8208;target editing efficiency to ALC0315&#8208;LNPs (0.5&#160;mg kg&#8722;1), but elicit a markedly stronger silencing effect, reducing serum TTR levels by over 90% compared with &#8776;58% for ALC0315&#8208;LNPs. This study may highlights the potential of compensatory&#8208;force engineering for next&#8208;generation mRNA therapeutics in oncology, gene editing, and infectious diseases.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Actuated Hot&#8208;Carrier/Polarization Triggers Catalysis to Coordinate Staphylococcus aureus Ribosome Stalling and Treat Deep&#8208;Seated Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medical microwave actuation of Seebeck&#8208;type and pyroelectric&#8208;type tandem reactors generates hot&#8208;carrier and quick&#8208;change polarization, respectively, by triggering the temperature, while synergizing with microwave&#8208;induced bacterial ribosome stalling to efficiently eliminate deep&#8208;seated bacterial infections.








Abstract
Due to the low energy of microwaves (MW), MW dynamic therapy (MWDT) remains inefficient in treating deep&#8208;seated infections. Here, an MW&#8208;actuated hot&#8208;carrier/polarization&#8208;triggers catalysis strategy is proposed via two types of tandem reactors to amplify the efficacy of MWDT. By combining MW&#8208;thermosensitive carbon nanotube (CNT) with thermal&#8208;electricity conversion materials, the Seebeck&#8208;type and pyroelectric&#8208;type MW&#8208;thermal&#8208;electricity tandem reactors (CNT&#8208;Bi2Te3 and CNT&#8208;ZnO) are prepared. The CNT converts MW into a local heat source and rapidly heats Bi2Te3 or ZnO to activate hot&#8208;carrier or polarization for high&#8208;yield reactive oxygen species production to treat deep&#8208;seated infections. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses reveal MW stalls the ribosomes of Staphylococcus aureus, thereby hindering its proliferation. Therefore, the biocompatible tandem reactor synergizes with bacterial ribosome stalling to demonstrate a targeted bactericidal effect in vivo and in vitro.

&lt;p&gt;Medical microwave actuation of Seebeck-type and pyroelectric-type tandem reactors generates hot-carrier and quick-change polarization, respectively, by triggering the temperature, while synergizing with microwave-induced bacterial ribosome stalling to efficiently eliminate deep-seated bacterial infections.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the low energy of microwaves (MW), MW dynamic therapy (MWDT) remains inefficient in treating deep-seated infections. Here, an MW-actuated hot-carrier/polarization-triggers catalysis strategy is proposed via two types of tandem reactors to amplify the efficacy of MWDT. By combining MW-thermosensitive carbon nanotube (CNT) with thermal-electricity conversion materials, the Seebeck-type and pyroelectric-type MW-thermal-electricity tandem reactors (CNT-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CNT-ZnO) are prepared. The CNT converts MW into a local heat source and rapidly heats Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or ZnO to activate hot-carrier or polarization for high-yield reactive oxygen species production to treat deep-seated infections. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses reveal MW stalls the ribosomes of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, thereby hindering its proliferation. Therefore, the biocompatible tandem reactor synergizes with bacterial ribosome stalling to demonstrate a targeted bactericidal effect in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, a series of antimicrobial products is developed for precise and efficient antimicrobial therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bond&#8208;Discretization in Nickel Oxide to Boost Capacity for Rechargeable Nickel&#9472;Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bond&#8208;discretization strategy is developed to greatly enhance electrochemical performances for aqueous Ni&#8211;Zn batteries. Engineering a low&#8208;symmetry crystal structure with a reduced Ni&#8211;Ni coordination number of 9 enables the NiO cathode to achieve a near&#8208;theoretical capacity. This modification boosts material utilization and facilitates OER/ORR reactions, providing new strategies for the design of high&#8208;performance electrodes.








Abstract
Aqueous Ni&#9472;Zn batteries are highly attractive for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, their energy density is limited by the underutilization of nickel&#8208;based cathode materials. Here, a bond&#8208;discretization strategy in NiO is developed to overcome this challenge. By designing a low&#8208;symmetry crystallographic structure with a reduced Ni&#8211;Ni coordination number of 9, the NiO cathode achieves a near&#8208;theoretical capacity for the one&#8208;electron reaction. This structural modification leads to a discretization of Ni&#9472;O bonds and achieves a ratio of 50% for weak O&#9472;H bonds in the transformation product of Ni(OH)2, equal to the proportion (50%) of H atoms that needs to be detached from Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH, which can realize nearly theoretical capacity for the one&#8208;electron reaction. The bond&#8208;discretization also promotes catalytic activity for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions, enabling the integration of Ni&#9472;Zn batteries with Zn&#8208;air batteries. The low&#8208;symmetry NiO cathode demonstrates high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and superior cycling stability, with a full cell paired with a zinc anode achieving a specific energy of 459&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at a specific power of 995.7&#160;W kg&#8722;1. This work provides a new bonding&#8208;engineering strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>NH3&#8208;Guided Low&#8208;Temperature Nanostructural Refinement Boosts Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven H2O2 Synthesis in Ionic Carbon Nitrides</title>

         <dc:description>
A nanostructural refinement strategy is reported for KPHI photocatalysts using NH4Cl in a molten salt environment to induce coherent domain fragmentation and controlled cyano defect formation. This dual modification promotes n&#8594;&#960;* transitions, enhances charge separation, and accelerates ORR kinetics, yielding exceptional AQY values of 49% (410 nm) and 5% (525 nm) without cocatalysts.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven oxygen reduction on ionic carbon nitride frameworks presents a compelling strategy for sustainable hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Herein, a nanostructural engineering strategy is presented to tailor the morphology and defect chemistry of potassium poly(heptazine imide) (KPHI), enabling extended solar coverage and enhance photocatalytic performance. By incorporating NH4Cl into a molten KCl/LiCl eutectic medium, simultaneous nanoscale fragmentation of KPHI crystals and controlled introduction of cyano (&#8211;C&#8801;N) defects are achieved. These molecular modifications induce n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transitions, facilitate efficient charge separation, and accelerate oxygen reduction reaction kinetics. The optimal catalyst reaches an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 49% at 410&#160;nm and 5% at 525&#160;nm without the need for cocatalysts, among the highest values reported for metal&#8208;free photocatalyst systems. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms preferential photoexcited electron localization at &#8211;C&#8801;N sites, highlighting their key role in enhancing the charge carrier dynamics. Crucially, autogenous NH3 pressure is harnessed from NH4Cl decomposition to unlock a low&#8208;temperature (500 &#176;C) KPHI variant that delivers analogous performance to its counterpart produced at 600&#160;&#176;C, offering a more sustainable synthetic route. This study elucidates the structure&#8208;activity relationship in ionic carbon nitrides and provides a generalizable approach for controlling their morphology and defect characteristics.

         <title>High Thermal Conductivity Porous Organic Polymers with Low Permittivity via Desolvation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops porous polyacrylonitrile (P&#8208;PAN) films via PEG&#8208;induced desolvation. This strategy creates uniform micropores (reducing permittivity to 1.44, &#8208;73.1%) while simultaneously promoting PAN chain reorganization into aligned crystalline domains. This enhances thermal conductivity tenfold to 1.39 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1, overcoming the typical permittivity&#8208;thermal conductivity trade&#8208;off in organics. As a thermal interface material, P&#8208;PAN reduces chip temperature by 5.7&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Miniaturization of microelectronic devices demand organic dielectric polymers with ultralow permittivity (k &lt; 2.0) and high thermal conductivity (&#955; &gt; 1.0 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1) to mitigate signal delay and thermal accumulation. However, organic polymers inherently face a trade&#8208;off: porosity reduces k but sacrifices &#955; due to disordered pores and interchain hopping barriers. Here, a desolvation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed, fabricating all organic porous polyacrylonitrile (P&#8208;PAN) films. By incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a porogen and plasticizer, followed by water exchange and freeze drying, the P&#8208;PAN film features uniform microscale holes, which reduce dipole density and electronic polarization, resulting in k to 1.44 (73.1% reduction from PAN). Simultaneously, PEG&#8208;induce hydrogen bonds enable PAN chains mobility, promoting the reorganization of amorphous chains into crystalline domains during desolvation. This ordered framework facilitates efficient phonon transport via crystalline domains, elevating &#955; to 1.39&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, nearly tenfold improvement over PAN (0.13&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). Notably, P&#8208;PAN synergizes k &lt; 2.0 and &#955; &gt; 1.0 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1 without fillers, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic polymers. As a proof of concept, P&#8208;PAN as a thermal interface material (TIM) reduces chip temperature by 5.7&#160;&#176;C, decoupling the k&#8208;&#955; trade&#8208;offs in organic polymers and demonstrating its potential for flexible electronics.

         <title>Adaptive Co&#8208;Crystals with Switchable Host&#8208;Guest Stoichiometry for Dynamic Regulation of Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycle&#8208;based adaptive co&#8208;crystals with switchable host&#8208;guest stoichiometry is proposed, enabling vapor&#8208;induced phase transitions, precise D/A ratio modulation, and dynamic TSCT/photoluminescence regulation. Unlike traditional systems, they access intermediate states for fine&#8208;tuned chromic behaviors in the solid state, advancing supramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor materials.








Abstract
The development of photoluminescence materials with tunable properties through structural and functional modifications remains a fascinating yet challenging task. In this work, the concept of adaptive co&#8208;crystals featuring switchable host&#8208;guest stoichiometry within the realm of pillararene&#8208;based supramolecular chemistry is proposed. This strategy allows for the rational design of a diverse range of through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer co&#8208;crystals, enabling dynamic modulation of photoluminescence in the solid state. Experimental and theoretical findings unveil two distinct phases within each set of co&#8208;crystal architectures, characterized by different donor/acceptor stoichiometric ratios as well as molecular packing modes. Notably, these co&#8208;crystalline phases undergo vapor&#8208;induced stoichiometry switching and structural interconversion, resulting in unique charge&#8208;transfer transition states and enabling reversible control over photoluminescent behavior. Particularly, this dynamic modulation of the cavity apertures, driven by stoichiometric variation, facilitates highly selective capture and release of 1&#8208;bromoalkane under mild conditions. The present study highlights the potential application of vapor&#8208;mediated co&#8208;crystals with switchable stoichiometry as a supramolecular strategy for modulating the intrinsic characteristics of intermolecular donor&#8211;acceptor materials.

&lt;p&gt;Macrocycle-based adaptive co-crystals with switchable host-guest stoichiometry is proposed, enabling vapor-induced phase transitions, precise D/A ratio modulation, and dynamic TSCT/photoluminescence regulation. Unlike traditional systems, they access intermediate states for fine-tuned chromic behaviors in the solid state, advancing supramolecular donor-acceptor materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of photoluminescence materials with tunable properties through structural and functional modifications remains a fascinating yet challenging task. In this work, the concept of adaptive co-crystals featuring switchable host-guest stoichiometry within the realm of pillararene-based supramolecular chemistry is proposed. This strategy allows for the rational design of a diverse range of through-space charge-transfer co-crystals, enabling dynamic modulation of photoluminescence in the solid state. Experimental and theoretical findings unveil two distinct phases within each set of co-crystal architectures, characterized by different donor/acceptor stoichiometric ratios as well as molecular packing modes. Notably, these co-crystalline phases undergo vapor-induced stoichiometry switching and structural interconversion, resulting in unique charge-transfer transition states and enabling reversible control over photoluminescent behavior. Particularly, this dynamic modulation of the cavity apertures, driven by stoichiometric variation, facilitates highly selective capture and release of 1-bromoalkane under mild conditions. The present study highlights the potential application of vapor-mediated co-crystals with switchable stoichiometry as a supramolecular strategy for modulating the intrinsic characteristics of intermolecular donor&#8211;acceptor materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrostatically Enhanced Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Anchoring for Scalable and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel electrostatically enhanced anchoring strategy (EEAS). This work employs sulfonamide&#8208;based post&#8208;treatments to modulate the protonation state of phosphonic acid groups in SAMs, resulting in stronger electrostatic interactions with TCO substrates and simultaneously effectively passivating buried interfacial defects, ultimately improving device performance. This scalable and generalizable strategy for advancing PSCs toward industrial standards.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have substantially advanced the efficiency of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), yet weak interfacial adhesion to transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrates and perovskite compromises both scalability and thermal stability. Here, an electrostatically enhanced anchoring strategy (EEAS) is presented using sulfadiazine (SDZ) molecules to deprotonate phosphonic acid groups in SAMs, generating phosphate anions that strengthen electrostatic interactions with the positively charged TCO substrates. The protonated SDZ species concurrently establish strong coordination interactions with the buried perovskite interface. This approach enables the formation of uniform and robust buried interfaces while improving perovskite crystallinity and facilitating charge extraction. The resulting PSCs achieve a certified efficiency of 26.23% (steady&#8208;state 25.42%) over 1 cm2 areas. This EEAS is scalable, enabling 20.7&#8208;cm2 modules with a PCE of 24.72%. The devices demonstrate exceptional operational stability, retaining over 94% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous illumination at 65 &#176;C (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).

         <title>Electrically Readable Lateral Flow Assay Using Organic Transistors for Diagnostic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) are integrated with lateral flow (LF) paper fluidics to create a reusable, portable, and low&#8208;cost point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) diagnostic test. The devices are validated for Human Immunoglobulin G detection, achieving high sensitivity (0.1 fm), selectivity, and reproducibility with rapid results in 20&#8211;30 min. A miniaturized USB&#8208;connected reader demonstrates its potential for next&#8208;generation digital LF assays.








Abstract
Electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) are emerging as powerful, ultrasensitive label&#8208;free biosensors, but their applicability as portable diagnostic tools remains constrained by poor microfluidic miniaturization and complex multi&#8208;step ex situ assays. Simultaneously, paper&#8208;based lateral flow (LF) immunoassays hold significant relevance for integrated diagnostic applications in the market, but are limited by the low sensitivity of optical detection. To address these challenges, a simple EGOFET integrated with LF paper fluidics are reported to obtain a reusable, highly portable, and cost&#8208;effective point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) test with rapid results (&#8776;20&#8211;30&#160;min). The test is validated for Human Immunoglobulin G detection, achieving a wide linear range, high selectivity, reproducibility, and a low limit of detection of 0.1 fm. The portability of the system is demonstrated in a designed prototype with a miniaturized electronic reader, operating via an adapted USB&#8208;connected smart device. This work fulfills the requirements of low&#8208;cost PoC tests and offers a foundation for the next generation of digital LF assays.

Implantable Reinforced Cardiac Tissue Patches
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202504765), Lewis S. Jones, Robert K. Katzschmann, and co&#8208;workers introduce the reinforced cardiac patch (RCPatch) for intraventricular myocardial repair. The multimaterial design integrates a stiffness&#8208;tuned, cardiomyocyte&#8208;infiltrated 3D metamaterial with a hydrogel&#8208;filled melt&#8208;electrowritten mesh. In a large&#8208;animal model, the RCPatch sealed a myocardial defect, prevented bleeding, and restored hemodynamic stability, providing a surgically implantable and regenerative platform for cardiac repair.

Light&#8208;Harvesting Nanomaterials
Light harvesting in plants inspires researchers to develop nanomaterials mimicking this fascinating process. In the Review by Andrey S. Klymchenko, Deep Sekhar Biswas, and Pascal Didier (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202501237), light&#8208;harvesting nanomaterials based on organic dyes are reviewed, highlighting fundamental challenges on aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and exciton migration. Owing to efficient energy transfer from light&#8208;harvesting ensemble of dyes to a single acceptor, these materials enable signal amplification (antenna effect) important for (bio)sensing and molecular diagnostics.

High Entropy Alloy HER Electrode
The proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) stands out for its high efficiency, yet its catalysts still face an inherent trade&#8208;off between activity and stability. In Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202510703), Xiongjun Liu, Rui Li, Zhaoping Lu, and co&#8208;workers report a porous (FeCoNiPt)2Nb high&#8208;entropy alloy HER electrode that breaks the trade&#8208;off via dissolution&#8211;deposition dynamic equilibrium. The electrode delivers exceptional performance and stability, operating continuously&#8212;and intermittently&#8212;for at least 2,200 h at 1 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Progress and Perspective on Heterogeneous Catalysis of Liquid Formic Acid Dehydrogenation: Coordination Structure Design, Activity Improvement, and Mechanism Insights</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation from perspectives of coordination structure design, catalytic performances, and reaction mechanisms. The design strategies, characterization technologies, activity evaluation and mechanism insights are presented in detail. These contents will provide a guidance for precise design of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts to enhance catalytic performance towards FA decomposition.








Abstract
Formic acid (FA) has attracted significant interest as a renewable liquid&#8208;phase hydrogen carrier. Hydrogen generation from FA decomposition is essential for the development of hydrogen economy. Designing highly efficient catalysts with different coordination environments for FA dehydrogenation is crucial for fuel&#8208;cell applications. Here, FA dehydrogenation from the perspectives of coordination structure design, activity evaluation, and mechanisms is focused. In particular, the structural design of active sites and dominant factors that determine the catalytic activity/selectivity and reaction mechanism are highlighted. Strategies to design catalysts are proposed based on the aspects of electronic effects, component regulation and synergistic effects, interface effects, and reaction active site design to boost the catalytic activity, selectivity, stability, rate&#8208;determining step activity, and overall performance. Simultaneously, it is important to investigate the structure&#8211;activity relationship during hydrogen generation. In addition, the experimental protocol (hydrogen generation from FA or FA&#8208;SF, SF: sodium formate), calculation of reaction parameters, and determination of products during hydrogen generation are summarized. Finally, challenges, conclusions, and developments based on FA decomposition are presented. Here, guidance for the precise design of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts is provided to enhance catalytic performance toward FA decomposition and satisfy the requirements for hydrogen generation in the future.

         <title>Interactions Between Active Matters and Endogenous Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review synthesizes endogenous field information and computational methods in contexts such as cancer, wounds, and biofilms. It organizes NAMs and AAMs by sensing, transmitting, and executing functions, compares their limitations, and from these contrasts proposes design strategies for next&#8208;generation AAMs, offering perspectives to foster interdisciplinary dialogue and future research.








Abstract
Active matter, encompassing both natural and artificial systems, utilizes environmental energy to sustain autonomous motion, exhibiting unique non&#8208;equilibrium behaviors. Artificial active matter (AAM), such as nano/micromotors, holds transformative potential in precision medicine by enhancing drug delivery and enabling targeted therapeutic interventions. Under the demand for increasing intelligence in AAM, controlling their non&#8208;equilibrium processes within complex in vivo environments presents significant challenges. Endogenous fields&#8212;biological fields generated within living systems&#8212;play a pivotal role in guiding natural active matter's (NAM) directional migration and collective transformations, offering a strategy for in vivo control of non&#8208;equilibrium systems. Research in NAMs&#8208;inspired AAMs spans biology, chemistry, materials science, engineering, and physics, yet communication barriers among disciplines often impede progress. This review seeks to bridge these gaps by summarizing the key characteristics of chemical and physical endogenous fields in biological contexts such as tumors, wounds, and inflammation. It explores how natural and artificial active matter sense, transmit, and execute responses to these fields, and discusses how insights from natural systems can inform the design of synthetic counterparts. Potential issues and prospects of this research direction are also discussed. It is hoped that this review fosters interdisciplinary collaborations and propels the development of intelligent active matter for biomedical applications.

         <title>Toward Rational Electrocatalyst Design: Dynamic Insights from Liquid Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing efficient electrocatalysts relies on a deep understanding of electrocatalytic processes under realistic reaction conditions&#8212;an area that has long remained a &#8220;black box.&#8221; This review highlights how liquid environmental transmission electron microscopy (LETEM) addresses fundamental challenges in electrocatalytic research. By bridging &#8220;material and environmental gaps&#8221;, LETEM provides unprecedented insights into the underlying mechanism and dynamic structure&#8208;activity relationship for electrocatalysis.









Abstract
Electrocatalysis, a pivotal field at the intersection of physical chemistry and materials science, plays a crucial role in advancing energy conversion and storage technologies through rational catalyst design. However, understanding reaction mechanisms at the atomic level remains a great challenge due to the intricate interplay between catalysts, reactants, and complex environments (e.g., electric fields, liquid electrolytes). This complexity has led to persistent &#8220;material&#8221; and &#8220;environment&#8221; gaps between conventional electrocatalytic research and the practical behavior of catalysts under realistic operating conditions. The emergence of liquid environmental transmission electron microscopy (LETEM) enables the characterization of the electrocatalysts coupled with precise electrochemical measurements under operando conditions with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. Recent breakthroughs in atomic&#8208;scale characterization of dynamic processes of electrocatalysts under realistic reaction environments have demonstrated the exceptional potential of LETEM for elucidating the nature of electrocatalysis and establishing robust atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity relationships. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the research progress in the dynamic evolution of electrocatalysts via LETEM, with a particular focus on the structural evolution of electrocatalysts under electro&#8208;liquid coupled environments. This review is expected to provide insights for unlocking fundamental mechanisms and the rational design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>From Carbon Nitrides to COFs: Opportunities and Prospects in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To underscore the potential of polymeric photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction&#8212;from carbon nitrides to covalent organic frameworks&#8212;the table of contents graphic presents recent breakthroughs in the design of light&#8208;responsive organic photocatalysts. These include strategies such as junction engineering, non&#8208;metallic site tuning, enhancement of crystallinity, metal incorporation, structural modulation, and optimization of molecular linkages.








Abstract
The continuing increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), a major greenhouse gas and accelerating climate change are driving demand for innovative mitigation strategies. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCO2RR) presents a promising and sustainable route to convert CO2 into useful hydrocarbons and fuels utilizing sunlight, thereby mitigating CO2 emissions. This review examines the developmental aspects of light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion using organic polymeric photocatalysts, focusing on carbon nitrides (CNs), covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). These materials are verified to possess great potential for PCO2RR, because they offer tunable band gaps, large surface areas, efficient light absorption, and remarkable activity and selectivity in photocatalysis. In this review, the comprehensive analysis of photocatalytic materials (e.g., CNs, CTFs, and COFs) are thoroughly discussed, along with their mechanisms, historical advancements, and urgent roles in PCO2RR. Strategies for enhancing the CO2 photoreduction efficiency of CNs, CTFs, and COFs are also highlighted. Each organic material brings distinct advantages. The review also addresses critical challenges, such as improving efficiency and managing charge transport dynamics for PCO2RR. Finally, the review underscores the need to develop scalable CO2 conversion applications, advance organic photocatalyst material science, and support sustainable energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Autonomous Implants</title>

         <dc:description>
An ideal implant should mimic native tissues such that it can integrate, sense, heal, and continue to function, i.e., be autonomous. Although early, there are good steps taken in this way, e.g., the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, self&#8208;powering, self&#8208;actuating, self&#8208;healing, self&#8208;regenerating, and self&#8208;aware implants. This forward&#8208;looking review outlines the research done thus far in this direction and efforts to assemble individual aspects of smart implants into a multifunctional implant in the future.








Abstract
With the increasing aging population, more implants are being used in the body. However, these implants often fail, and they suffer from a lack of integration or proper function. Efforts have been made to generate implants by employing bioactive materials, adding cellular components, and integrating smart characteristics such as self&#8208;healing properties. The vision is, however, to develop an implant that can mimic native tissues in their way of doing things, responding to challenges and remodeling. Such automated implants require the integration of advances made in various fields of science. Although early, there are good steps taken in this way, e.g., the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, self&#8208;powering, self&#8208;actuating, self&#8208;healing, self&#8208;regenerating, self&#8208;aware implants. Attempts to combine more than one smart property into these implants are still at the beginning, e.g., the integration of such special characteristics requires a new set of skills and thinking, which presents new challenges that warrant exploration and investment. Such an implant evolution is expected to be in stages, where the first implant will be able to communicate with doctors and hospitals; then, in the next stage, with patients, and later, they will be independent, sense any disturbances and aberrations from normal early on, and correct themselves before damage becomes irreversible. This forward&#8208;looking review looks at the research done thus far in this direction and efforts to assemble individual aspects of smart implants into multifunctional implants in the future. The stages of material, in vitro, and in vivo testing and clinical application, if any, are critically reviewed. In addition, the challenges facing the development of autonomous smart implants are discussed, and research directions and ideas are suggested.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Based Oxygen Electrocatalysts: Mechanistic Insights, Property Tuning Strategies, and Prospects toward Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights MXene&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis, emphasizing intrinsic properties, general principles for modulation strategies, and mechanistic understanding by in situ characterizations. 








Abstract
MXene delivers promising features that are highly compatible with oxygen electrocatalysis, such as excellent electroconductivity, high specific surface area, superhydrophilicity, and tailorable chemically functionalized surfaces, thus being recognized as the ideal platform for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for practical applications in industrial devices. A comprehensive understanding of oxygen catalytic mechanism on MXene ontology and a systematic refining of the general principles toward various physicochemical property regulation strategies are, respectively, the basis and effective alleyway to hitting the target, yet it is currently insufficient and need to be further explored in&#8208;depth. Herein, the fundamental effects of MXene on oxygen catalytic activity are sorted out thoroughly, and on this basis, the current mainstream strategies for tuning the property of MXene&#8208;based electrocatalysts are classified into four categories, including anion&#8208;tuning, cation&#8208;tuning, defect/vacancy regulation, and heterometallic dual&#8208;site collaboration, where the intrinsic mechanism of each strategy affecting the structure&#8211;activity relationship of catalysts is revealed accordingly. Particularly, the indispensability of advanced in situ characterizations in establishing the dynamic process of oxygen electrocatalysis, including real&#8208;time structural evolution and reaction pathways is emphasized. Finally, the latest advances of MXene&#8208;based electrocatalysts are reviewed from the viewpoint of the metal&#8211;support interactions effect, along with forward&#8208;looking perspectives on addressing the present thorny challenges.

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Nanomaterials Based on Dyes for Energy Transfer and Amplified Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>

Light harvesting (LH) in plants inspires researchers to develop artificial LH nanomaterials. Here, LH nanomaterials based on organic dyes are reviewed, considering fundamental challenges on aggregation&#8208;caused quenching, excitation energy transfer, and exciton migration length. The efficient energy transfer from LH nanomaterial to an acceptor leads to signal amplification (antenna effect) important for sensing.








Abstract
Fascinating process of light harvesting (LH) in plants and bacteria leads to photosynthesis of oxygen and organic matter on the planet. It inspires researchers in the last decades to develop synthetic analogues &#8211; artificial LH nanomaterials. Here, LH nanomaterials based on dyes (organic chromophores) are reviewed. The fundamental aspects of LH include dye assembly into materials with minimal energy losses (i.e., high fluorescence quantum yield with minimized aggregation&#8208;caused quenching) and fast excitation energy transfer with large exciton migration length. The efficient energy transfer from LH nanomaterial to an acceptor leads to an amplification of acceptor emission &#8211; antenna effect, which constitutes the key performance parameter of LH nanoantenna. Individual classes of dye&#8208;based LH nanomaterials are analyzed: covalent molecular arrays of dyes (e.g., dendrimers and macrocycles), aggregates of &#8220;classical&#8221; dyes, aggregation&#8208;induced emission nanomaterials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks, ion&#8208;associated nanomaterials, and hybrid dye&#8208;based organic systems, such as dye&#8208;biomolecule hybrids, micelles and supramolecular polymers, dye&#8208;loaded silica and polymeric nanoparticles. The design principles and key performance characteristics of their selected (non&#8208;exhaustive) examples are analyzed. Due to their capacity to amplify the acceptor fluorescence signal, LH nanomaterials are particularly suitable for amplified sensing of small molecules, ions, biomolecules, which is particularly attractive for biomedical applications.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Light Emission From Single Chiral Hedgehog Particles Coated with Nanofilms of Achiral Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) is observed from chiral &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; particles (CHIPs) coated with a nanofilm of achiral perovskite, with spectroscopic bands specific to the perovskites and chirality specific to the template CHIPs. Careful analysis of optical activity indicates that the CPLE of perovskite luminescence is dominated by post&#8208;emission scattering from the chiral surfaces of the same CHIPs.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites are known for their strong and tunable luminescence. However, the synthesis of perovskite&#8208;based particles with circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) remains challenging due to the complex interplay of metal&#8208;ligand chemistries, crystallization patterns, and chirality transfer mechanisms. Achiral perovskites can be deposited on chiral &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; particles (CHIPs) with twisted spikes, producing chiroptically active materials with spectroscopic bands specific to the perovskite and chirality specific to the template CHIPs. Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed CPLE is engineered into complex particles comprised of a layer of perovskite deposited onto CHIPs coated with an intermediate silica layer. The spectral position of chiroptical bands, the optical asymmetry g&#8208;factors, and single&#8208;particle circularly polarized microscopy indicate that the observed CPLE is dominated by the post&#8208;emission scattering from the twisted spikes of the parent particle. Templating luminescent nanofilms on CHIPs provides a simple pathway to a wide range of complex chiroptical materials; the dispersibility of the CHIPs in various solvents and the tunability of their chiral geometry enable their applications as single&#8208;particle emitters with strong and controllable polarization rotation.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ Bragg coherent X&#8208;ray diffraction imaging, 3D nanoscale strain maps of a stainless steel grain were&#160;measured during hydrogen charging. Results show dislocation relaxation and climb, elucidating the role of point defects in hydrogen&#8208;modified deformation behavior. Detailed strain measurements reveal shielding of dislocation strain fields. These experimental results validate theoretical predictions and provide new insights into embrittlement mechanisms.








Abstract
Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron&#8208;transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen&#8208;induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X&#8208;ray diffraction imaging to track three&#8208;dimensional (3D) dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen&#8208;enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen&#8208;induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen&#8208;driven dislocation behavior. The quantified nanoscale phenomena serve as critical inputs for multiscale modeling frameworks to predict bulk material responses and accelerate the development of HE&#8208;resistant&#160;alloys.

         <title>Role of Amorphous Phases in Mixed Conduction of Conjugated Regioblock Copolymers for Organic Electrochemical Synaptic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Critical roles of amorphous and crystalline phases in polymer&#8208;based mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors for organic electrochemical synaptic transistors using conjugated regioregular&#8208;block&#8208;regiorandom copolymers are demonstrated. Amorphous phases contribute to gradual polaron formation and strong ion trapping by bipolarons, leading to improved synaptic state modulation. The synaptic transistors with appropriate amorphous content exhibited low power consumption in the neuromorphic learning process.








Abstract
Growing interest in organic electrochemical synaptic transistors (OECT&#8208;STrs) based on conjugated polymer mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (CP&#8208;MIECs) has intensified, leading to the need to establish clear design rules and fundamentally understand the distinct roles of crystalline and amorphous domains in the electrochemical doping behavior of CP&#8208;MIEC films. Here, OECT&#8208;STrs based on regioregular&#8208;block&#8208;regiorandom (regioblock) conjugated copolymers with precisely controlled crystallinity are demonstrated. The crystallinity of a poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) regioblock copolymer is systematically tuned by varying the fraction of regiorandom blocks without altering the geometry or orientation of the crystalline phase. It is shown that incorporating an amorphous phase into the active channel of OECT&#8208;STrs significantly enhances the neuromorphic learning efficiency by improving modulation uniformity. This improvement results from sequential polaron formation in the amorphous regions and bipolaron formation in the crystalline domains during potentiation. Additionally, crystalline phases provide better state retention at low potentiation states, while amorphous phases contribute to improved long&#8208;term retention at high potentiation states by enhancing charge carrier localization through stronger Coulombic interactions. Neural network simulations based on actual device conductance demonstrate that OECT&#8208;STrs with a high amorphous fraction consume only 18% of the power required by devices with a highly crystalline film, owing to the need for fewer repetitive learning cycles.

         <title>Implantable Light&#8208;Powered Human Designer Cells for Electrical Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the eel's electric organ, a miniature implantable biohybrid device is developed to generate electricity under light activation. The device utilizes a light&#8208;dependent ion gradient formation that induced by genetically engineered human designer cells that express light&#8208;sensitive membrane ion channels and proton pumps, working in synergy with the device to generate electrical potential and deliver electrical energy.








Abstract
Herein, an implantable, miniature biohybrid device has been developed that utilizes light&#8208;dependent ion&#8208;gradient formation by genetically engineered human designer cells, expressing light&#8208;activated ion channels and proton pumps to generate electrical potential and deliver electrical energy. These designer cells are cultured in custom&#8208;designed polycarbonate chambers, connected by electrodes and separated from an ion reservoir by a proton&#8208;selective Nafion membrane. Upon illumination, the light&#8208;activated channels and pumps on the designer cells establish a sustained proton gradient across the Nafion membrane, which drives an electrical current in the external circuit. When exposed to simulated ambient sunlight of 3&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 of intensity, a single solar collection device (SCD), containing these designer cells, appropriately sized for subcutaneous implantation in mice, generates an electrical potential of &#8776;0.4&#160;V. By connecting multiple SCDs in series and increasing the cell suspension volume, the output can be scaled up sufficiently to power a commercial light&#8208;emitting diode. Thus, this study demonstrates the feasibility of a photovoltaic system based on optogenetically engineered mammalian cells for powering bioelectronic implants or wearable devices.

         <title>Anomalous Reconfigurable&#8208;Transport in MoS2 Transistors by Electrically&#8208;Switchable van der Waals Interfacial Dipole</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a tunable insulator&#8208;semiconductor heterostructure of BiOCl and MoS2, where interfacial charge transfer forms a strong dipole. By switching the dipole polarity with an electric field, reconfigurable transport characteristics are achieved in MoS2 transistors, including n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, anti&#8208;ambipolar, and &#8220;W&#8221;&#8208;shaped behaviors. A dual&#8208;gate configuration enables multi&#8208;state switching, offering potential for negative differential resistance and scalable 2D transistor applications.








Abstract
Interfacial charge transfer leads to the formation of an electric dipole at the interface of a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. The switching of dipole polarity using an electric field provides an effective method for modulating the electronic properties of vdW systems. However, the experimental observation of switched vdW dipoles is challenging, as it is concealed by the electrostatic gating effect. In this work, the significant electrical tunability of the strong interfacial dipole formed in an insulator&#8208;semiconductor heterostructure of high&#8208;work&#8208;function BiOCl and MoS2 are demonstrated. The heterostructured device essentially operates as a planar tunneling transistor, where band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling occurs within the vdW doping&#8208;defined junction, resulting in a subthreshold swing significantly lower than that of typical field effect transistors. More importantly, the anomalous reconfiguration of electronic transports is observed in MoS2 transistors due to the switching of vdW dipole and its competition with the electrostatic gating. By varying the BiOCl thickness, the n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, anti&#8208;ambipolar, and &#8220;W&#8221;&#8208;shaped transfer characteristics are achieved. Furthermore, a dual&#8208;gate configuration further enhances functionality of the device, enabling multi&#8208;state switching, which is of particularly interest for these applications requiring negative differential resistance. This work offers a scalable, versatile, and non&#8208;destructive strategy for tuning reconfigurable two&#8208;dimensional&#160;transistors.

         <title>An Epigenetic Nanoagonist Facilitates T Cell Priming, Recruitment, and Reinvigoration in Tumors Resistant to PD&#8208;L1 Therapy</title>

Epigenetic nanoagonist for multilevel T cell activation. a) DPM@iCARM1@siPVR assembly. b) Actions of the nanoagonist against PD&#8208;L1 &#8208; resistant tumors: 1) iCARM1 released in tumor cells activates cGAS&#8208;STING signaling for dendritic cell maturation, aiding T cell priming; 2) In T cells, iCARM1 facilitates their recruitment by upregulating CXCR3; 3) SiPVR silences pvr to reinvigorate T cells.








Abstract
Inefficient priming, poor recruitment, and inadequate reinvigoration of T cells challenges the therapy of PD&#8208;L1&#8208;resistant tumors. Herein, a pH&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;reversal nanoplatform integrating coactivator&#8208;associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) inhibitor (iCARM1) and poliovirus receptor siRNA (siPVR) is developed. Upon tumor penetration, iCARM1 released in tumor cells facilitates T cell priming by epigenetically activating cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling&#8208;mediated dendritic cell maturation. Meanwhile, in T cells, iCARM1 facilitates their recruitment by upregulating CXC&#8208;chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) expression. The released siPVR silences pvr to reinvigorate T cells. This epigenetic nanoagonist induces a robust immune response, dramatically suppresses tumor growth, metastasis, and relapse, and confers durable protection against secondary tumor challenge. Multiple PD&#8208;L1&#8208;resistant models demonstrate the broad applicability of this strategy. This study thus represents an innovative approach for facilitating multilevel T cell responses to combat PD&#8208;L1&#8208;resistant tumors.

&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic nanoagonist for multilevel T cell activation. a) DPM@iCARM1@siPVR assembly. b) Actions of the nanoagonist against PD-L1 - resistant tumors: 1) iCARM1 released in tumor cells activates cGAS-STING signaling for dendritic cell maturation, aiding T cell priming; 2) In T cells, iCARM1 facilitates their recruitment by upregulating CXCR3; 3) SiPVR silences &lt;i&gt;pvr&lt;/i&gt; to reinvigorate T cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inefficient priming, poor recruitment, and inadequate reinvigoration of T cells challenges the therapy of PD-L1-resistant tumors. Herein, a pH-responsive charge-reversal nanoplatform integrating coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) inhibitor (iCARM1) and poliovirus receptor siRNA (siPVR) is developed. Upon tumor penetration, iCARM1 released in tumor cells facilitates T cell priming by epigenetically activating cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling-mediated dendritic cell maturation. Meanwhile, in T cells, iCARM1 facilitates their recruitment by upregulating CXC-chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) expression. The released siPVR silences &lt;i&gt;pvr&lt;/i&gt; to reinvigorate T cells. This epigenetic nanoagonist induces a robust immune response, dramatically suppresses tumor growth, metastasis, and relapse, and confers durable protection against secondary tumor challenge. Multiple PD-L1-resistant models demonstrate the broad applicability of this strategy. This study thus represents an innovative approach for facilitating multilevel T cell responses to combat PD-L1-resistant tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interlayer Switching of NiO6 Octahedra Tilt via Interstitial Oxygen in Lan + 1NinO3n + 1 (n = 1, 2, 3)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research presents an anti&#8208;parallel interlayer tilt coupling of NiO6 octahedra induced by interstitial oxygen in high&#8208;pressure oxygen annealing Lan + 1NinO3n + 1(n = 1,2, 3). The new coupling pattern brings new symmetry along the caxis, alters the electronic structure, and hinders the superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, directing a micro&#8208;structural route to investigate and tune the novel functionalities in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite nickelates.








Abstract
Oxygen octahedra tilt, an important knob to tune properties of perovskite oxides and their derivatives, determines the coupling patterns and emergent states. Conventional methods, such as strain and doping, are primarily employed to modulate the magnitude of the octahedra tilt. The switching of the tilt, however, is challenging due to the intrinsic interlocked coupling. Here, we achieve the interlayer switching of NiO6 octahedral tilting via interstitial oxygen insertion in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Lan + 1NinO3n + 1 (n = 2). Interstitial oxygen with an alternative occupation in the rock&#8208;salt (LaO) layers induces completely opposite tilt patterns of NiO6 octahedra in neighboring perovskite (LaNiO3) layers. EELS reveals a lower unoccupied UHB and a spectral&#8208;weight transfer, which may contribute to the suppression of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 as confirmed by our high&#8208;pressure transport experiments. This mechanism of NiO6 octahedral tilt switching is further validated in Lan + 1NinO3n + 1 (n = 1 and 3), offering a promising strategy for regulating the properties of layered perovskite oxides.

         <title>A Bioinspired Piezoelectric Stress Buffer Layer for SiOx&#8208;Based Electrodes Toward High&#8208;Energy Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Breviceps adspersus epidermis in nature, a novel piezoelectric stress buffer layer is introduced to address challenges faced by SiOx electrodes. This innovative design significantly mitigates excessive volume expansion and stabilizes solid electrolyte interface of SiOx electrodes, yielding remarkable improvements in battery cycling and rate performance. These advances open pathways for achieving high&#8208;energy lithium battery applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;specific&#8208;capacity silicon suboxide (SiOx, 0 &lt; x &lt; 2) anodes have long faced the problems of huge volume expansion, fast capacity decay and unsatisfied rate performance. To overcome these bottlenecks, the volume expansion resistance and electrogenic Na+ transport functions of common rain frog (Breviceps adspersus) epidermis are introduced into the design philosophy of stress buffers for SiOx electrodes. Thereupon, a mechanically robust, piezoelectric (MP) stress buffer layer comprised of ferroelectric tetragonal BaTiO3 nanoparticles and a novel homopolymer (PCM) binder of cyanoethyl carbamate&#8208;containing methacrylate is developed. It is demonstrated that MP stress buffer layer with superior mechanical properties effectively inhibits excessive volume expansion and stabilizes the solid electrolyte interface along with much suppressed electrolyte decomposition. Meanwhile, MP stress buffer layer helps expedite the dealloying reaction kinetics of SiOx electrodes in half&#8208;cells, mainly owing to the generation of a stress&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field within MP stress buffer layer, conducive to improving battery rate performance. As a result, unprecedented cycling and rate performance can be realized in coin and home&#8208;made soft package cells with SiOx and SiOx/graphite composite electrodes. Such a design philosophy of stress buffer layers marks an important milestone in developing high&#8208;energy lithium batteries with SiOx&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Decoupling Transport of Salt Ions and Water in Hierarchically Structured Hydrogel for High Salinity Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically structured hydrogel evaporator enables controlled decoupling of salt&#8208;ion and water transport pathways for efficient solar desalination in hypersaline environments. Engineered radial and vertical channels direct salt away from the evaporative interface, enhancing water evaporation and ambient energy harvesting via a cold&#8208;surface effect. This integrated design supports a scalable zero&#8208;liquid&#8208;discharge desalination platform.








Abstract
Global water scarcity demands next&#8208;generation desalination technologies that transcend the limitations of energy&#8208;intensive processes and salt accumulation. Herein, a groundbreaking interfacial solar steam generation system capable of simultaneous hypersaline desalination and ambient energy harvesting is introduced. Through hierarchical hydrogel architecture incorporating a central vertical channel and radial channels with gradient apertures, the design effectively decouples salt transport and water evaporation: solar&#8208;driven fluid convection directs water outward for evaporation, while inward salt migration prevents surface crystallization and redistributes excess heat. The heat dissipation induces a sub&#8208;ambient &#8220;cold evaporation&#8221; effect, lowering the evaporative interface temperature and enhancing ambient energy utilization. The system achieves a remarkable water evaporation rate exceeding 12&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 in a 20 wt% hypersaline environment and operates continuously for 15 h without salt accumulation. Outdoor testing demonstrates a daily water production of 67.2 L m&#8722;2, with scalable potential for sustainable desalination and industrial brine treatment.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Compact Topological Photonic Crystal Rainbow Nanolasers Operating in the 1550 nm Telecom Band with Wavelength&#8208;Scale Mode Volumes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale rainbow light trapping for lasing emission in the 1550 nm telecom band is experimentally demonstrated. Ultra&#8208;compact 1D and 2D topological rainbow nanolasers are presented, featuring ultra&#8208;small mode volumes, ultra&#8208;low lasing thresholds, and remarkable robustness against fabrication imperfections and defects.








Abstract
Topological rainbow trapping, spatially separating and confining multiple topologically protected light frequencies, offers a prospective scheme for achieving robust multi&#8208;wavelength single&#8208;mode coherent emission within a single nanodevice. Here, ultra&#8208;compact topological photonic crystal rainbow nanolasers&#160;operating in the 1550 nm telecom band are experimentally demonstrated. Specifically, rainbow&#8208;like single&#8208;mode emission with a controllable free spectral range and a wavelength&#8208;scale mode volume is presented in a one&#8208;dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser, exhibiting robust rainbow spectral emission across a wide temperature range and a spectral tuning capability of approximately 70 nm. Additionally, an ultra&#8208;compact two&#8208;dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser is demonstrated in an exceptionally small footprint, featuring a broad rainbow spectrum with 64 continuously tuned single&#8208;mode lasing peaks. This work provides a promising approach for realizing robust and nanoscale multi&#8208;wavelength single&#8208;mode coherent emission within a single device, paving the way for numerous potential applications in ultra&#8208;compact high&#8208;throughput data processing systems, including on&#8208;chip wavelength&#8208;division&#8208;multiplexing and optical&#160;interconnects.

This work provides a promising approach for realizing robust and nanoscale multi-wavelength single-mode coherent emission within a single device, paving the way for numerous potential applications in ultra-compact high-throughput data processing systems, including on-chip wavelength-division-multiplexing and optical&#160;interconnects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>All&#8208;3D&#8208;Printed Multi&#8208;Environment Modular Microrobots Powered by Large&#8208;Displacement Dielectric Elastomer Microactuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully 3D&#8208;printed modular microrobots capable of performing a broad range of tasks across diverse environments are demonstrated. The key breakthrough lies in the development of a large&#8208;displacement microactuator for multi&#8208;environment navigation and a mesoscale multimaterial 3D printing platform for on&#8208;demand module fabrication. Together, these innovations advance the adaptability, versatility, and scalability of microrobotic systems.








Abstract
Microrobots are expected to push the boundaries of robotics by enabling navigation in confined and cluttered environments due to their sub&#8208;centimeter scale. However, most microrobots perform best only in the specific conditions for which they are designed and require complete redesign and fabrication to adapt to new tasks and environments. Here, fully 3D&#8208;printed modular microrobots capable of performing a broad range of tasks across diverse environments are introduced. For multi&#8208;environment navigation, large&#8208;displacement dielectric elastomer microactuators with a soft&#8208;stiff hybrid structure are developed, capable of powering microrobots to stride over obstacles on various terrestrial terrain and rapidly propel themselves across aquatic terrain. To further expand their capabilities beyond mere navigation, ten task&#8208;specific modules for the microrobots are developed. All modules are fabricated using a digital light processing multimaterial 3D printer capable of simultaneously printing multiple photocurable resins, providing a broadly applicable platform for fabricating mesoscale robotic components. The microrobots navigate across smooth, rough, granular, and aquatic environments, demonstrating tasks such as controlling the movements of nearby robots, interacting with humans to avoid collisions, and collaboratively dragging heavy objects through multi&#8208;unit operation. The study addresses key limitations hindering the integration of modular design into microrobots, enabling adaptation to new environments and tasks.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Solar Upcycling of Nitrate and Glycerol with Highly Efficient and Durable Organic Semiconductor&#8208;Based Photoelectrodes</title>

A bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical (PEC) upcycling system integrating bi&#8208;functional nickel&#8208;iron&#8208;phosphorus (Ni&#8208;Fe&#8208;P) catalysts with organic semiconductor (OS)&#8208;based dual photoelectrodes is reported. The system enables simultaneous solar&#8208;driven conversion of nitrate to ammonia and glycerol to formic acid with high efficiency and stability. This work demonstrates one of the highest&#8208;performing OS&#8208;based bias&#8208;free PEC systems reported to date.








Abstract
The sustainable management of biodiesel byproducts, nitrate (NO3&#8722;) and glycerol, remains a critical environmental challenge, disrupting global nitrogen and carbon cycles. Addressing this issue from a materials science perspective, a bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical (PEC) upcycling system based on the integration of functional energy materials is presented. A nickel&#8208;iron&#8208;phosphorus (Ni&#8208;Fe&#8208;P) electrocatalyst exhibits synergistic bi&#8208;functional activity for selective NO3&#8722; reduction and glycerol oxidation, driven by the redox dynamics of Ni and Fe and electronic modulation by phosphorus incorporation. Through a metal&#8208;foil encapsulation strategy, the catalyst is integrated with organic semiconductor (OS)&#8208;based photoanodes and photocathodes, forming a highly efficient OS&#8208;based PEC system capable of stable operation under continuous solar illumination. The individual photoelectrodes demonstrate photocurrent densities of +15.7 and&#8722;14.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under AM 1.5G conditions, while exhibiting remarkable stability with over 96% of initial performance retained after 60 h. To enable bias&#8208;free solar upcycling, a dual&#8208;photoelectrode PEC configuration is constructed, delivering a high reaction current of 11.04&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 along with &gt;95% Faradaic efficiencies and excellent selectivity for both ammonia (NH3) and formic acid (FA) production. This work underscores the potential of materials&#8208;driven PEC platforms for selective solar chemical upcycling.

         <title>Upgrading Natural Ores for Efficient Photothermal Polyester Recycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers a solar&#8208;driven plastic upcycling system using thermally activated natural pyrite minerals as photothermal catalysts. It overcomes key industrial challenges by utilizing abundant, low&#8208;cost minerals to achieve high&#8208;efficiency polyester waste conversion into valuable monomers. This innovation enables scalable, sustainable plastic valorization, accelerating the transition toward circular economies.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical upcycling of polyester waste into monomers represents a critical pathway to mitigate the global environmental crisis posed by plastic pollution. However, reconciling atomic&#8208;scale catalyst design with industrial manufacturing demands remains a fundamental challenge for addressing the &gt;80 million tons of polyester waste generated annually. Here, a solar&#8208;driven glycolysis platform is reported using thermally activated natural pyrite minerals (FeS2) as photothermal catalysts. Unlike conventional catalysts requiring complex synthesis, this mineral&#8208;derived system leverages low&#8208;cost, abundant raw materials, a green synthesis process, and easy scale&#8208;up. The activated pyrite exhibits a monomer yield 51.2&#8208;fold higher than pristine pyrite. Structural and mechanistic studies reveal that thermal activation generates iron&#8208;sulfur cooperative sites via topological transformation, which synergistically enhance the adsorption of polyester and ethylene glycol, boosting the subsequent nucleophilic substitution depolymerization reaction. The findings may catalyze innovations in polymer regeneration technologies and establish scalable pathways for plastic waste valorization, accelerating global transition to circular economies.

Fe&#8208;doped H2TiO3 anchored on rGO (rGO/H2TiO3&#8208;x&#8208;Fe) is designed as a novel separator modifier for Li&#8208;S battery. Fe&#8208;doping induces OVs with Lewis acidity, which causes sieving effect via the differentiated adsorption regulated by the Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. The optimized electronic structure and enhanced electronic conductivity promote the catalytic effect for the LiPSs redox to accelerate fast conversion of the blocked LiPSs.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have been hindered by the low active material utilization, sluggish kinetics and Li anode corrosion caused by the dissolution of Li polysulfides (LiPSs) intermediates. To solve these problems simultaneously, Fe&#8208;doped H2TiO3 anchored on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO/H2TiO3&#8208;x&#8208;Fe) is designed via dopant selection and doping content optimization as a novel separator modifier. Tunable Fe&#8208;doping induces the controllable generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs), endowing rGO/H2TiO3&#8208;x&#8208;Fe with suitable Lewis acid character, which causes a sieving effect via the differentiated adsorption between OVs and various LiPSs. All the long&#8208;chain LiPSs are blocked, while partial Li2S4 passes over the separator to react with the Li anode for forming robust SEI, which could ease the Li corrosion from LiPSs and suppress Li dendrite. Furthermore, the optimized electronic structure and the enhanced electronic conductivity from Fe&#8208;doping promote the catalytic effect for the LiPSs redox to accelerate the conversion of the blocked LiPSs. Consequently, with the synergistic effect between sieving effect and enhanced catalysis, rGO/H2TiO3&#8208;x&#8208;Fe modified separator provides Li&#8208;S battery remarkable cycling (fading rate: 0.035%@5 C during 1000 cycles), power, and shelving performances. This strategy, based on rational dopant selection and OVs regulation, offers a universal separator design for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries toward industrialization.

         <title>Copper Catalysts Inherit and Retain Precatalyst Morphology in Extended CO Electroreduction to n&#8208;Propanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash Joule heating enables the formation of quenched Cu oxide precatalysts with intragrain&#8208;in&#8208;grain architectures. These hierarchical structures are inherited after electroreduction, suppressing reconstruction even at high current densities in an MEA cell. The high intragrain boundary density enhances CO adsorption and C1&#8211;C2 coupling, leading to selective n&#8208;propanol formation &#8776;35%. This approach achieves both structural durability and improved C3 selectivity.








Abstract
Copper catalyst morphology, faceting, and oxidation state are each known to impact selectivity in the electroreduction of CO. Copper oxide precatalysts are synthesized using flash Joule heating and rapid cooling, and it is observed that temperature ramp rates can be used to control morphology, enabling us to implement &#8776;10&#160;nm&#8208;sized intragrain features within &#8776;35 nm grains. It is found that the structural features of the precatalysts are substantially transferred to Cu catalysts that are formed when they are employed in CO electroreduction in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The catalysts achieve &#8776;35% faradaic efficiency to n&#8208;propanol, among the highest selectivities to C3 from monometallic Cu. Both selectivity and morphology are retained following 330 h of operation at 100 mA cm&#8722;2. CO dilution studies reveal that catalysts with similar faceting, but smaller grain sizes, exhibit n&#8208;propanol selectivity that increases with CO concentration, suggesting that grain interfaces contribute to CO coverage and C1&#8211;C2 coupling. Complementary operando Raman spectroscopy shows that reducing grain size enables higher CO coverage, suggesting that structural features enhancing linear CO adsorption are correlated with improved selectivity to C3.

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Induced Ferroelectric Switching in Wurtzite/Fluorite Bilayers for High&#8208;Performance Ferroelectric Field&#8208;Effect Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proximity&#8208;induced switching in AlScN/HfZrO2 and AlN/HfZrO2 bilayers enables a novel combination of low remanent polarization and high coercive field. A ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor incorporating an AlN/HfZrO2 gate stack yields a wide memory window, superior retention, and endurance characteristics. This work pioneers a new strategy for engineering ferroelectric response through integrating distinct ferroelectric materials.








Abstract
Proximity ferroelectricity, wherein polarization switching in one ferroelectric layer with a lower energy barrier can trigger switching in an adjacent ferroelectric with a higher energy barrier, has been demonstrated only in bilayers composed of structurally similar wurtzite&#8208;structured materials. This work demonstrates proximity&#8208;induced ferroelectric switching across a heterostructure composed of crystallographically and functionally dissimilar materials, wurtzite&#8208;structured AlScN and fluorite&#8208;structured HfZrO2. The AlScN/HfZrO2 and AlN/HfZrO2 bilayers exhibit cooperative switching dynamics despite their contrasting symmetry and polarization behaviors. This interfacial coupling produces a unique ferroelectric response, characterized by low remanent polarization and a high coercive field. Using the AlN/HfZrO2 bilayer, a ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor is fabricated on a p&#8208;type Si substrate with phosphorus&#8208;doped source and drain regions. The device shows a wide memory window with excellent retention and endurance. These results establish a versatile materials design strategy for engineering ferroelectricity via structural and functional heterogeneity.

         <title>Upcycling PET Coupled with Energy&#8208;Saving H2 Production from Seawater at Asymmetric Active Center</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses the challenge of selectively oxidizing a single hydroxymethyl group while preserving the C&#9472;C bond during ethylene glycol electro&#8208;oxidation (EGOR). By integrating oxyphilic transition metals with noble metals, the Ru&#8208;(CoCu)2V2O7@Cu2O electrocatalyst featuring asymmetric active centers is designed to induce dynamic electron delocalization. This breaks EG molecular symmetry, enabling directed adsorption of key intermediates (*OCCH2OH and *OH), oriented deprotonation of hydroxymethyl, and timely desorption of C2 products.








Abstract
Electrochemically upcycling polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate (PET)&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) into high&#8208;value glycolic acid (GA) with H2 production elegantly addresses the dual challenges of clean energy production and plastic recycling. Herein, an electrocatalyst of Ru&#8208;(CoCu)2V2O7@Cu2O is reported, where the Co&#9472;O&#9472;Ru asymmetric active center triggers the dynamic electronic delocalization is constructed. Such innovative design facilitates the designated bonding of key intermediates for *OCCH2OH and *OH at the Ru and Co sites during EG oxidation reactions (EGOR), respectively, while maintaining the integrity of C&#9472;C bond. As a result, the Ru&#8208;(CoCu)2V2O7@Cu2O demonstrates remarkable performance for EGOR, requiring only 0.68 V@RHE to reach 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, reducing energy consumption by 60.1% compared to the traditional oxygen evolution. Notably, under industrial conditions (1.0 V@RHE, &#8776;600&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), it still maintains a Faraday efficiency of 96.6% and a selectivity of 93.5% for GA, breaking through the performance bottleneck of existing catalytic systems. Implemented at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell, this system converts PET hydrolysate into GA (0.0299&#160;mmol&#160;min&#8722;1) and produces H2 (1.531 mL&#160;min&#8722;1) from natural seawater simultaneously, with exceptional stability of &lt;12% decay after 120&#160;h at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work establishes an innovative paradigm for synergistic plastic upcycling and green hydrogen production.

         <title>Atomical&#8208;Rippled&#8208;Nanodomains Stabilized Large Polarization in BiSmCo2O6 Double&#8208;Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an atomical&#8208;rippled&#8208;nanodomains are introduced to BiCoO3 and SmCoO3 solid solution double&#8208;perovskite film due to its ferroelectric single&#8208;domain coupling. By engineering triaxial tensile strain, the ferroelectric ARNs are robustly formed in BiSmCo2O6 double&#8208;perovskite films, leading to a large ferroelectric polarization and ultra&#8208;enduring ferroelectric fatigue. These results represent a significant enhancement in the performance boundaries of orthorhombic type&#8208;II multiferroics.








Abstract
Double&#8208;perovskite ferroelectrics have attracted increasing attention due to their highly tunable structures, multifunctional coupling effects, and potential applications in next&#8208;generation nonvolatile ferroelectric semiconductor devices. Here, an atomical&#8208;rippled&#8208;nanodomains (ARNs) are introduced to BiCoO3 and SmCoO3 solid solution double&#8208;perovskite film due to its ferroelectric single&#8208;domain coupling. By engineering triaxial tensile strain, the ferroelectric ARNs are robustly formed in BiSmCo2O6 double&#8208;perovskite films, leading to a large ferroelectric polarization (&#8776;23.1 &#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2) and ultra&#8208;enduring ferroelectric fatigue resistance exceeding 1012 cycles without degradation. These results represent a significant enhancement in the performance boundaries of orthorhombic type&#8208;II multiferroics. The ferroelectric switching dynamics reveal the intrinsic correlation between the continuous switchable ARNs and the outstanding ferroelectric behavior. These findings underscore the effectiveness of nanodomain&#8208;coupling strategy for realizing high&#8208;performance ferroelectrics and offer a promising pathway toward designing correlated oxide&#8208;based ferroelectric semiconductor devices with exotic functionalities.

By engineering triaxial tensile strain, the ferroelectric ARNs are robustly formed in BiSmCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double-perovskite films, leading to a large ferroelectric polarization (&#8776;23.1 &#181;C&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ultra-enduring ferroelectric fatigue resistance exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; cycles without degradation. These results represent a significant enhancement in the performance boundaries of orthorhombic type-II multiferroics. The ferroelectric switching dynamics reveal the intrinsic correlation between the continuous switchable ARNs and the outstanding ferroelectric behavior. These findings underscore the effectiveness of nanodomain-coupling strategy for realizing high-performance ferroelectrics and offer a promising pathway toward designing correlated oxide-based ferroelectric semiconductor devices with exotic functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Converting Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode into Non&#8208;Shrinking Sacrificial Prelithiation Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode is converted into a lithium&#8208;rich disordered rocksalt (LRDO) prelithiation agent by structural reconstruction. The voltage&#8208;compatible characteristics and phase&#8208;transition&#8208;free nature of LRDO during lithium compensation enable its function as a non&#8208;volumetric&#8208;shrinkage sacrificial agent, which eliminates cathode architecture failure and interfacial degradation induced by conventional prelithiation processes, thereby enhancing practical lithium&#8208;ion battery energy density.








Abstract
To improve the energy density of Li&#8208;ion batteries, conventional sacrificial prelithiation agents (Li5FeO4, Li2O and Li2CO3, etc.) are introduced to compensate for active lithium loss, but they undergo serious volumetric shrinkage during decomposition, generating voids that compromise electrode architecture integrity and deteriorate electrochemical performance. Herein, the typical Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode is converted into Li&#8208;rich disordered rocksalt oxide (LRDO) prelithiation agent, achieving 330 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 charge capacity and retaining 130 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 reversible capacity (contributing 200 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 irreversible prelithiation capacity). Compared with the layered structure, the cation&#8208;disordered structure in LRDO tunes the local oxygen environment, completely activating oxygen&#8208;related anionic oxidation activity at lower potential (&lt;4.5&#160;V). Moreover, coupled with a fluorinated electrolyte additive, the nucleophilic oxygen species released during de&#8208;lithiation of LRDO are synergistically utilized, constructing a gradient cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase architecture with enhanced interfacial stability during the cell formation process. Most importantly, the phase&#8208;transition&#8208;free nature of LRDO during prelithiation completely eradicates volume shrinkage, effectively preventing electrode architecture degradation. Furthermore, a long&#8208;life graphite||LiFePO4 pouch cell with high discharge capacity of 150.02 mAh (7.59% higher than without prelithiation) are achieved, maintaining 91.33% capacity after 1800 cycles.

         <title>Delineating the Triphasic Side Reaction Products in High&#8208;Energy Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphasic side reaction products&#8212;gaseous, soluble, and solid CEI&#8212;formed at the interface between high&#8208;Ni cathodes and carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes have been quantitatively analyzed with online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), systematically elucidating the interrelationships among the reaction products, especially under elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Unwanted cathode&#8208;electrolyte side reactions remain a major challenge to the stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, especially at high temperatures. This study presents a quantitative analysis on gaseous, soluble, and solid byproducts generated by reactions between LiNiO2 and carbonate electrolytes. Online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) outgassing profiles reveal the emergence of a pre&#8208;plateau region as temperature increases, characterized by two small plateaus at 3.7 and 4.0&#160;V, which are attributed to catalytic ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) decomposition and ethylene carbonate (EC) hydrolysis, respectively. Activation energies for electrolyte oxidation reactions are quantified with OEMS, confirming that the main outgassing event is driven by direct oxygen&#8208;electrolyte chemical reactions. Nuclear magnetic resonance and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses show that EC decomposition yields both soluble and solid byproducts, while EMC produces mainly solid species, leading to a thicker, organic&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase; the presence of LiPF6 further accelerates solvent degradation. Additionally, the effectiveness of various dopants in suppressing gas evolution is evaluated across a broad temperature range, with magnesium&#8208;doped cathodes exhibiting the most effective suppression by stabilizing lattice oxygen. Overall, this work establishes a clear correlation among triphasic side&#8208;reaction products, guiding rational design of cathode materials and electrolyte formulations for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Waste&#8208;Free Closed&#8208;Loop&#8208;Recyclable and Thermally Superinsulating Polyimide Aerogels Utilizing Diels&#8208;Alder Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol for thermally recyclable poly(amide&#8208;imide) aerogels based on Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry is presented. Prepared from furan&#8208;modified poly(amide&#8208;imide) and bismaleimide, these aerogels offer thermal superinsulation and excellent thermo&#8208;mechanical performance. Notably, they can be depolymerized into soluble oligomers at elevated temperatures, which can be reconstructed into fresh aerogels&#8212;enabling efficient, waste&#8208;free, closed&#8208;loop recycling.








Abstract
Organic aerogels are an advanced class of lightweight materials with ultralow thermal conductivity and high porosity, widely used in applications such as thermal insulation, energy storage, and aerospace engineering. Among them, polyimide aerogels stand out for their excellent thermal stability, mechanical strength, and chemical resistance. However, their permanently cross&#8208;linked networks make them non&#8208;recyclable, posing a significant sustainability challenge. Here, a novel closed&#8208;loop recycling approach for polyimide aerogels based on dynamic Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry is presented, utilizing an aerogel&#8211;sol&#8211;aerogel (ASA) process. Matrimid, a commercial polyimide, is post&#8208;functionalized with furfurylamine to form a furan&#8208;modified poly(amide&#8208;imide) (PAI&#8208;FU), which reacts with bismaleimide via a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to create a thermally reversible cross&#8208;linked aerogel network. The resulting poly(amide&#8208;imide) aerogels (PAIAs) exhibit low bulk density (&#8776; 0.15 g cm&#8722;3), high porosity (&gt; 87%), ultralow thermal conductivity (16.0 mWm&#8722;1K&#8722;1), excellent thermal stability (Td5% &#8776; 400&#160;&#176;C), and remarkable mechanical strength (&#8776; 3.4 MPa). More importantly, PAIAs can be depolymerized at elevated temperatures into soluble oligomers that can be reconstructed into fresh aerogels without catalysts or purification steps. The recycled PAIAs retain their nanostructural morphology and key aerogel&#8208;specific properties, demonstrating efficient closed&#8208;loop recycling. This approach paves the way for advanced and sustainable thermally superinsulating materials.

         <title>Bionic Nanogel Interfaces Unlock Long&#8208;Term Stability in Zn Metal Electrodeposition&#8208;Based Electrochromic Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;layer bionic nanogel interlayer is introduced on Zn and transparent electrodes. Each layer has unique functions: the top hydrophobic layer mitigates water corrosion and suppresses by products, the middle fluorinated layer ensures uniform Zn ion transport, and the bottom colloidal layer dynamically adapts to the substrate. This design greatly enhances electrochemical performance and stability for advanced electrochromic windows.






.

Abstract
Aqueous zinc (Zn) metal electrodeposition&#8208;based electrochromic windows (AZWs) are a promising dynamic window technology due to their use of low&#8208;cost, nonflammable, nontoxic, and highly conductive aqueous electrolytes. However, their development is hindered by issues such as poor reversibility, byproduct formation, and hydrogen evolution, which limit the optical window and cycling lifespan. Herein, a bionic transparent nanogel interlayer (TGI) in triple&#8208;layer structure introduced on both Zn electrode and indium tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode is demonstrated to achieve highly reversible electrochemical reaction. In the spontaneously formed triple&#8208;layer nanogel architecture, the top hydrophobic protective layer effectively mitigates water corrosion and suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions as well as byproduct formation. The middle layer incorporates internal fluorinated functional groups to promote uniform and rapid Zn ion transport. The bottom colloidal adhesion layer dynamically adapts to the substrate surface, preventing detachment due to morphology changes during cyclic Zn deposition/stripping processes. Consequently, the AZWs incorporating TGI@Zn and TGI@ITO glass electrodes exhibit excellent electrochemical properties and solar heat modulation abilities, which are attributed to their enhanced reversibility and uniform deposition of Zn ions. Compared with the single&#8208;layer interlayer, the three&#8208;layer structure design significantly improves the electrode's stability and performance, providing new ideas for designing next&#8208;generation AZW electrodes.

Each layer has unique functions: the top hydrophobic layer mitigates water corrosion and suppresses by products, the middle fluorinated layer ensures uniform Zn ion transport, and the bottom colloidal layer dynamically adapts to the substrate. This design greatly enhances electrochemical performance and stability for advanced electrochromic windows.

.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc (Zn) metal electrodeposition-based electrochromic windows (AZWs) are a promising dynamic window technology due to their use of low-cost, nonflammable, nontoxic, and highly conductive aqueous electrolytes. However, their development is hindered by issues such as poor reversibility, byproduct formation, and hydrogen evolution, which limit the optical window and cycling lifespan. Herein, a bionic transparent nanogel interlayer (TGI) in triple-layer structure introduced on both Zn electrode and indium tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode is demonstrated to achieve highly reversible electrochemical reaction. In the spontaneously formed triple-layer nanogel architecture, the top hydrophobic protective layer effectively mitigates water corrosion and suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions as well as byproduct formation. The middle layer incorporates internal fluorinated functional groups to promote uniform and rapid Zn ion transport. The bottom colloidal adhesion layer dynamically adapts to the substrate surface, preventing detachment due to morphology changes during cyclic Zn deposition/stripping processes. Consequently, the AZWs incorporating TGI@Zn and TGI@ITO glass electrodes exhibit excellent electrochemical properties and solar heat modulation abilities, which are attributed to their enhanced reversibility and uniform deposition of Zn ions. Compared with the single-layer interlayer, the three-layer structure design significantly improves the electrode's stability and performance, providing new ideas for designing next-generation AZW electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Vacancy Engineering in Alloyed Ga&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cu&#8208;Se Quantum Dots for Photocatalytic 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Diformylfuran Conversion</title>

A dual&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered strategy is developed to construct Ga&#8208;Zn co&#8208;doped CuSe quantum dots (GZC QDs) via cation exchange using CuSe as a template. By precisely introducing Cu and Se vacancies, the optimized sample efficiently facilitates the selective photocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), achieving an HMF conversion rate of 89% and a DFF selectivity of up to 91%.








Abstract
Highly &#8208;active/&#8208;selective photocatalytic biomass conversion is of great importance for achieving remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. However, serious challenges, e.g., limited photon utilization, high charge recombination, and sluggish/uncontrolled reaction kinetics, remain for further development in this area. Herein, a dual&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineering strategy is employed to regulate the Ga&#8208;Zn co&#8208;doped Ga&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cu&#8208;Se (GZC) quantum dots (QDs) by a cation exchange route utilizing the CuSe template. The optimized GZC QDs exhibit excellent photocatalytic performances for the selective oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), with 89% HMF conversion and 91% DFF selectivity. Advanced ex situ/in situ characterizations, together with theoretical calculations, reveal the origins of the excellent performance: i) Zn doping enhances charge carrier mobility, thereby promoting the HMF&#8208;to&#8208;DFF conversion rate; ii) Ga doping introduces intermediate states in electronic structure, facilitating better charge separation/transfer; iii) Ga/Zn co&#8208;introduction results in formation of Se/Cu vacancies, which play a critical role in charge separation and reactive oxygen species generation. Overall, the research exhibits a rational strategy for designing vacancy&#8208;engineered photocatalysts, offering a promising approach for selective biomass conversion.

         <title>Advanced Thermal Interface Materials: Insights into Low&#8208;Temperature Sintering and High Thermal Conductivity of MgO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MgO has emerged as a promising candidate for improving thermal management in battery systems owing to its high thermal conductivity. In this study, it is demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of MgO is historically underestimated due to previously overlooked material behaviors. Furthermore, MgO&#8208;based TIMs can make a significant contribution to EV safety due to their excellent heat dissipation properties.








Abstract
The escalating frequency of electric vehicle (EV) fires has underscored the critical importance of effective thermal&#8208;management in battery package (TMBP). A key challenge in current TMBP lies with the low thermal conductivity (TC, 3&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) of commercial alumina&#8208;polymer composite (thermal interface materials, TIM). While magnesia (MgO) TIMs, which show high TC (8&#8211;10&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, this study) and low cost, are emerging as an alternative heat&#8208;dissipation material (HDM), their full potential remains untapped. Here, the development of novel MgO (&#8805; 80&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and MgO TIMs is presented as next&#8208;generation HDMs, designed to outperform conventional alumina (20&#8211;30&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and alumina TIMs. Crucially, the fundamental mechanisms enabling our new MgO to achieve an unprecedented TC of &#8805; 80&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 are elucidated, significantly surpassing the previously reported range of 40&#8211;60&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. This study provides fundamental insights into achieving such high thermal conductivity in MgO. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this novel MgO TIM cools EV batteries three times faster than commercial alternatives, offering a robust solution for effective EV fire prevention. Consequently, this high&#8208;TC MgO is poised to contribute significantly to enhancing EV safety.

         <title>Visualization of Thermal&#8208;Induced Degradation Pathways of High&#8208;Ni Cathode: a Comparative Study in Solid Chloride and Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes face challenges like oxygen release and thermal instability at high temperatures. In&#8208;situ heating STXM&#8208;ptychography reveals opposite degradation pathways in solid and liquid electrolytes: core&#8208;to&#8208;surface in solids and surface&#8208;to&#8208;core in liquids. Degradation correlates with particle size, with solid electrolytes stabilizing smaller particles. These findings emphasize electrolyte chemistry's role in thermal stability and safer battery design.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;rich&#8208;layered oxide cathodes are promising candidates for enhancing the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Higher energy density leads to severe oxygen release, poor thermal stability, and safety risks, as exothermic side reactions induce complex structural and chemical transformations at elevated temperatures. Herein, in&#8208;situ heating scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM)&#8208;ptychography to directly investigate the thermal degradation pathways of charged LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 in both solid chloride and liquid electrolytes is employed. A key finding is the opposite spatial degradation behavior: in solid electrolytes, oxygen loss and Ni reduction occur from the core to surface, while in liquid electrolytes, the degradation proceeds from surface to core. These observations are closely linked to the local structural disorder around Ni atoms, as oxygen loss directly weakens the Ni&#9472;O bonding environment, promoting the reduction of Ni and accelerating lattice instability at high temperatures. Additionally, the extent of degradation is found to correlate with particle size, with solid electrolytes effectively stabilizing smaller particles. These results reveal strong spatial heterogeneity in thermal degradation and highlight the critical role of electrolyte chemistry in dictating thermal stability. Our study provides new insights into the structural and chemical evolution of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes under thermal stress, offering valuable guidance for the design of safer, high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity in Ultra&#8208;Thin p&#8208;Type BiCuSeO Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D BiCuSeO films, grown using molecular beam epitaxy, demonstrate a well&#8208;defined crystal structure and robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity. Intrinsic ferroelectric transitions have been uncovered through piezoelectric force microscopy signals, which exhibit typical butterfly curves in amplitude and 180&#176; phase switching. This is further corroborated by the processes involved in writing and reading ferroelectric domains within the BiCuSeO films.








Abstract
Atomically thin 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductors, where polarization switching transpires within the channel material itself, are pivotal to advancing the next generation of high&#8208;performance electronics. Nevertheless, the challenge remains in either the controllable synthesis of films or the manipulation of associated ferroelectricity. Here, 2D p&#8208;type BiCuSeO (BCSO) films with a thickness down to &#8776;3 nm are successfully synthesized using molecular beam epitaxy. The room&#8208;temperature (RT) out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity is confirmed by piezoelectric force microscopy, showing robust ferroelectric switching capability. Insights derived from density functional theory, coupled with the ferroelectric dipole map in cross&#8208;sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy images, suggest that the polar displacement of [CuSe] layers under electric fields primarily contributes to ferroelectricity in the BCSO film. Furthermore, the switching behavior of the BCSO&#8208;based ferroelectric tunnel junction has been clarified, exhibiting distinct ON and OFF states. Our results illustrate that such an ultrathin RT ferroelectric semiconductor could serve as a versatile material for future multifunctional electronic devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically thin 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductors, where polarization switching transpires within the channel material itself, are pivotal to advancing the next generation of high-performance electronics. Nevertheless, the challenge remains in either the controllable synthesis of films or the manipulation of associated ferroelectricity. Here, 2D p-type BiCuSeO (BCSO) films with a thickness down to &#8776;3 nm are successfully synthesized using molecular beam epitaxy. The room-temperature (RT) out-of-plane ferroelectricity is confirmed by piezoelectric force microscopy, showing robust ferroelectric switching capability. Insights derived from density functional theory, coupled with the ferroelectric dipole map in cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy images, suggest that the polar displacement of [CuSe] layers under electric fields primarily contributes to ferroelectricity in the BCSO film. Furthermore, the switching behavior of the BCSO-based ferroelectric tunnel junction has been clarified, exhibiting distinct ON and OFF states. Our results illustrate that such an ultrathin RT ferroelectric semiconductor could serve as a versatile material for future multifunctional electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimensional Crossover Engineering in MoS2/Organic Superlattices Breaks the zT Barrier for 2D Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered microelectronics require thermoelectric devices (TEDs) with high efficiency and silicon compatibility. This study overcomes these challenges using dimensionally engineered MoS2/organic superlattices that facilitate electrical transport and reduce thermal conductivity. A record zT of 0.6 at 373 K is achieved&#8212;12 times higher than monolayer MoS2&#8212;enabling integration of high&#8208;performance 2D TEDs into microchips for Internet of things and wearables.








Abstract
The rapid development of self&#8208;powered microelectronics demands thermoelectric devices (TEDs) that can simultaneously achieve high energy conversion efficiency and silicon micro&#8208;fabrication compatibility. While for conventional bulk TEs, their incompatibility with silicon micro&#8208;manufacturing restricts microelectronic integration. 2D materials, though CMOS&#8208;fabrication&#8208;friendly and widely explored for microelectronic devices, face critical limitations in thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency due to their low zT values (&lt;0.2) stemming from unfavorable thermal conductivity&#8208;power factor tradeoffs. These challenges are overcome through orbital&#8208;property&#8208;driven dimensional engineering of hybrid MoS2/organic superlattices, which synergistically enhances electrical transport while suppressing thermal conductivity. Strain&#8208;adaptive intercalation of tert&#8208;butylamine (TBA) molecules creates MoS2 bilayer superlattices exhibiting an electronic structure crossover between monolayer&#8208;like and bulk&#8208;like characteristics, thereby maximizing the density of states near the Fermi level. The optimized MoS2 bilayer/TBA hybrid superlattice achieves a breakthrough zT of 0.6 at 373 K &#8211; 12&#8208;fold higher than monolayer counterparts and 100&#215; surpassing bulk crystals. This represents the highest experimentally reported zT for 2D material&#8208;based TEDs, approaching performance benchmarks of commercial bulk TEs. The work establishes a paradigm of dimensional engineering in hybrid superlattices, thus enabling integration of high&#8208;efficiency 2D materials&#8208;based TEDs into silicon microelectronics&#8211;a critical step toward self&#8208;powered IoT systems and wearable technologies.

         <title>High Latent&#8208;Heat, Soft yet Robust Crystalline Salogels via Dual&#8208;Network Design and Solvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;network and solvent engineering strategy utilizing in situ polymerization in salt hydrates achieves flexible crystalline salogels with high latent heat, overcoming challenges of crystalline rigidity for flexible application. The soft yet robust salogels PCMs exhibit long&#8208;term thermal cycling stability, proving an efficient, cost&#8208;effective platform for thermal and temperature management systems.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;liquid phase change materials (PCMs) hold great promise for addressing challenges in thermal energy storage and temperature management. Yet, they suffer from severe issues of melting leakage and crystalline rigidity in practical applications. Here, an approach is proposed to achieve flexible, high&#8208;latent heat PCMs with intrinsic softness and toughness in the crystalline state through the combination of dual polymer networks and inorganic salt hydrates. This strategy constructs salogels via in situ polymerization, leveraging strong polymer&#8211;ion&#8211;water interactions and introducing excess water to form a solvated polymer network embedded within crystalline salt hydrates. The prepared crystalline salogels demonstrated high energy density (&#8710;Hm, 179&#8211;209 J g&#8722;1) with ultra&#8208;soft (E, 0.05&#8211;5&#160;MPa) yet strong (&#963;b, 1&#8211;3&#160;MPa) and tough (&#915;, 2&#8211;6&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) mechanical performance, along with low contact thermal resistance (Rc = 0.03 cm2 K W&#8722;1). The fabricated thermal management devices present both phase&#8208;change&#8208;driven heat absorption and hygroscopicity&#8208;driven moisture absorption, enabling highly efficient thermal regulation, with a 10&#160;&#176;C reduction observed in a lab suit fitted with a 25 &#215; 15 &#215; 0.5&#160;cm3 salogel patch over 1&#160;h compared to one without the patch. This work provides guidelines for designing crystalline&#8208;flexible yet robust salogels from cost&#8208;effective salt hydrates for advanced thermal management applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision 3D Doping of Fused Silica Glass Derived from Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local integration of dopants enables the selective modification of color, luminescence or refractive index within a three&#8208;dimensionally shaped glass with micron resolution. Following the fabrication of porous glass preforms and infusion with a dopant mixture, the dopant is immobilized by lithographic techniques and subsequently debinded and sintered. This enables to integrate functions in complex&#8208;shaped glass components.








Abstract
Glasses are utilized for their outstanding optical, mechanical, and thermal properties. However, conventional production methods mostly yield in glasses with uniform compositions and material properties. Here a novel lithographic approach is presented for high&#8208;resolution 3D dopant integration at defined positions, which enables property modifications in specific regions. For this, a porous glass matrix derived from nanocomposites is shaped using 3D printing or injection molding. Using volumetric 3D printing like computed axial or two&#8208;photon lithography, doping is performed within the porous glass using photocurable metal oxide precursors. The dopant is then permanently integrated within the glass during a final sintering step. The local integration of dopants like Ti4+, Co2+, Eu3+ or Tb3+ allow to selectively change the color, luminescence or refractive index within a 3D&#8208;shaped glass with micron resolution. The process enables a wide range of novel applications from integrated optics and photonics to mass customization, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information storage.

         <title>Dynamic Regulation for the Well&#8208;Distribution of Electrons and Zn2+ Ions Achieving Uniform Zn Redox in Ah&#8208;Scale Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneer a strategy to dynamically regulate electrons and Zn2+ ions for uniform Zn redox, in which a series of additive molecules with varying electron delocalized spaces are designed to verify this dynamic regulation mechanism. Thanks to the dynamic regulation, Zn&#8208;halogen and Zn&#8208;manganese Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells exhibit favorable rate performance and cycle stability.








Abstract
Uneven distribution of the electric field and zinc ion (Zn2+), and crosstalk effects all lead to irreversible redox of Zn, eventually accelerating the failure of various Zn&#8208;metal energy storage devices, especially Ah&#8208;scale pouch batteries. This study pioneers a strategy to dynamically regulate electrons and Zn2+ ions for uniform Zn redox, in which a series of additive molecules with varying electron delocalized spaces is designed to verify this dynamic regulation mechanism. Due to the large electron delocalized space, the additives with delocalized &#960;&#8208;bonds and &#8210;COOH form a stable molecular layer for the Zn anode. This layer can effectively prevent side reactions and dynamically regulate the arrangement of electrons and Zn2+ ions by driving electrons to flow among conjugated atoms and functional groups, ultimately evening out the electric field and reaction sites of Zn2+ ions during the Zn redox process. Thanks to this dynamic regulation, the Ah&#8208;scale Zn//I2 pouch cell exhibits a high capacity of 1.473 Ah (188.7 Wh kg&#8722;1) at 2 mA cm&#8722;2 and outstanding rate performance. This dynamic regulation also presents great compatibility with Zn&#8208;manganese pouch cells and Zn&#8208;bromine cells. This work deepens the understanding of the regulation mechanism for highly reversible Ah&#8208;scale AZIBs.

This layer can effectively prevent side reactions and dynamically regulate the arrangement of electrons and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions by driving electrons to flow among conjugated atoms and functional groups, ultimately evening out the electric field and reaction sites of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions during the Zn redox process. Thanks to this dynamic regulation, the Ah-scale Zn//I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell exhibits a high capacity of 1.473 Ah (188.7 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 2 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and outstanding rate performance. This dynamic regulation also presents great compatibility with Zn-manganese pouch cells and Zn-bromine cells. This work deepens the understanding of the regulation mechanism for highly reversible Ah-scale AZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Soft Robotic Engines with Non&#8208;Reciprocal Motion by Physical Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Movement is vital, and it requires breaking symmetry. This study introduces a hydrogel engine that achieves non&#8208;reciprocal motion through kinetic asymmetry in repeated actuation cycles. This approach for breaststroke&#8208;swimming&#8208;like motion is embedded inside the material and establishes a new paradigm of physical intelligence for soft robotics.








Abstract
Movement is essential for living systems, enabling access to food, habitats, or escape from threats. Across scales, a key unifying principle is symmetry breaking to achieve non&#8208;reciprocal motion and accumulate work. In soft robotics, many actuators mimic biological responsiveness, but they typically exhibit reciprocal motion, where forward work is canceled in the return stroke &#8211; preventing work accumulation in cyclic operation. Here, a simple and broadly applicable hydrogel engine concept is presented that overcomes this limitation by encoding kinetic asymmetry into swelling and deswelling transitions. This hard&#8208;coded asymmetry yields non&#8208;reciprocal motion trajectories, enabling continuous mechanical work extraction under a single, uniform stimulus &#8211; without complex external control. The strategy embodies a material&#8208;based ratchet mechanism rooted in physical intelligence, independent of geometry or scale, and generalizable across stimuli. This hydrogel engine is implemented in soft robotic systems, including artificial cilia for fluid pumping and conveyor belts for object transport. Starting from macroscopic thermoresponsive systems, the design is extended to microscale formats via 3D printing and to other stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. This approach shifts the paradigm in soft robotics &#8211; from increasing chemical complexity to leveraging intrinsic material properties for emergent function &#8211; paving the way for scalable, autonomous systems driven by physical intelligence.

         <title>Linear and Symmetric Artificial Synapses Driven by Hydrogen Bonding for Accurate and Reliable Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven interface engineering enables highly linear and symmetric artificial synapses based on CsPbI3&#8211;PVA hybrids. This strategy suppresses trap states and guides directional ion migration, yielding stable optoelectronic plasticity. The devices achieve ultralow power operation and human&#8208;like learning in neuromorphic networks, offering a scalable route for edge AI and cognitive computing systems.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing addresses the von Neumann bottleneck by integrating memory and processing to emulate synaptic behavior. Artificial synapses enable this functionality through analog conductance modulation, low&#8208;power operation, and nanoscale integration. Halide perovskites with high ionic mobilities and solution processabilities have emerged as promising materials for such devices; however, inherent stochastic ion migration and thermal instability lead to asymmetric and nonlinear characteristics, ultimately impairing their learning and inference capabilities. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface engineering strategy to stabilize CsPbI3 artificial synapses. Density functional theory calculations and experimental analyses indicate that the hydroxyl groups in PVA form robust O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I&#8722; bonds with surface iodides, promoting vertical lattice ordering. This suppresses grain boundary defects and enables directional ion migration, resulting in extremely linear and symmetric optoelectronic conductance modulation (&#945;p = 0.004, &#945;d = 0.020), over eight fold reduction in interfacial trap density, and high&#8208;temperature retention (&gt;104 s). When integrated into a neural network, artificial synapses show large&#8208;scale image classification accuracy within 1.62% of the theoretical limit. The proposed strategy provides a scalable pathway toward overcoming the existing limitations of artificial synapses, exhibiting high potential for application in edge AI, autonomous systems, and material&#8208;based cognitive modeling.

         <title>Flexible Living Artificial Dura Mater for Efficient Therapy of Central Nervous System Injury Based on Neuronal Differentiation and Neuroprotective A2 Astrocyte Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible living artificial dura mater, which composed of &#8220;living&#8221; neural stem cell coating and flexible Au nanostrips patch, shows optimal interface integration with tissue, improves the immune microenvironment of defect site, promotes the survival and differentiation of NSCs in harsh inflammatory environment, and exerts positive therapeutic effects on the recovery of sensory and motor neural circuits after spinal cord injury.








Abstract
Central nervous system (CNS) injury is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. To prevent secondary cascade damages to CNS caused by dural defects, the repair of dural defects is an essential step in CNS injury treatment. Although various artificial dura maters have been developed, unfortunately, no one exerting positive therapeutic effects for CNS injury repair. Here, we suggested a flexible &#8220;living&#8221; artificial dura mater as a general strategy for CNS injury treatment by integrating the neural stem cells (NSCs) therapy and electrical stimulation. Under a rotating magnetic field based on magnetoelectric induction, NSCs seeded on a specially designed flexible patch with Au nanostrips produced therapeutic benefits to CNS injury. In vitro experiments prove that the magnetic field&#8208;driven Au nanostrips&#8208;mediated wireless electrical stimulation not only effectively accelerates NSCs differentiating into mature neurons with complex synaptic connections, but also induces astrocytes directionally activating into neuroprotective A2 reactive astrocytes. In vivo experiments with traumatic brain or spinal cord injury models confirm that the flexible living artificial dura mater shows optimal interface integration with tissue, effectively improving the immune microenvironment of the defect site, promoting the survival and differentiation of NSCs, and aiding the recovery of motor neural circuits after injury.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Mechano Symbiosis Dual&#8208;Mode Janus Bioaerogel for Context&#8208;Adaptive Atmospheric Water Harvesting Beyond Solar Reliance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar&#8208;mechano symbiosis dual&#8208;mode bio&#8208;based Janus aerogel (DBJA), capable of efficient atmospheric water harvesting beyond solar dependency, is created. The inherent hygroscopicity from the bio&#8208;based matrix and strongly anchored LiCl endow DBJA with excellent moisture harvesting capacity. The DBJA demonstrates outstanding advantages in solar&#8208;independent operation, adsorption, desorption, sustainability, and scalability.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SS&#8208;AWH) offers promise for addressing global freshwater scarcity. However, the SS&#8208;AWH heavily relies on favorable and sustained solar irradiation; yet real&#8208;world solar irradiation exhibits significant spatiotemporal fluctuations, limiting its sustainable application, as non/low&#8208;light conditions sharply reduce water productivity. This constraint is fundamentally due to the singleness of the water release pathway via photothermal desorption. Here, a novel dual&#8208;mode bio&#8208;based Janus aerogel (DBJA) is presented, enabling efficient, all&#8208;weather, multi&#8208;scenario atmospheric water harvesting via selectively solar&#8208;driven and compression&#8208;activated water release. The Janus structure optimizes mass/heat transfer between hygroscopic and photothermal domains, achieving the most balanced adsorption&#8211;desorption kinetics and compression&#8208;recovery strength for solar&#8208;mechano symbiosis. Under favorable sunlight, DBJA demonstrates a competitive water release efficiency of 1.32 g g&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 outdoors. Crucially, without solar irradiation, DBJA achieves a total water productivity of 12.80 g g&#8722;1 over 5&#8208;cycle adsorption&#8208;compression with 98% volume recovery and is stable within 50 cycles. Enhanced physical inlay and multiple chemical interactions ensure limited leakage of Li+ ions during compression, and the collected water easily conforms to the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water standards. This work provides a flexible approach for sustainable atmospheric water harvesting beyond solar reliance through multi&#8208;mode synergy and gradient architecture.

This research proposes a unique high&#8208;entropy perovskite&#8208;based (HEP) tri&#8208;phase composite, (La0.2Sr0.2Pr0.2Ba0.2Ce0.2)0.7CoO3&#8208;&#948;, using a one&#8208;pot sol&#8208;gel method. This marks the first demonstration of a HEP material functioning as an active and durable air electrode in large&#8208;area (10&#215;10 cm2) solid oxide cells, demonstrating high performance and stability and underscoring its substantial potential for energy conversion and storage applications.








Abstract
Reversible solid oxide cells (R&#8208;SOCs) are promising for energy applications but face limitations due to poor durability and slow oxygen&#8208;reduction/evolution reactions at air electrodes. Here, a high&#8208;entropy perovskite&#8208;based (HEP) tri&#8208;phase composite, (La0.2Sr0.2Pr0.2Ba0.2Ce0.2)xCoO3&#8208;&#948;, comprising an A&#8208;site deficient La0.2Sr0.2Pr0.2Ba0.2Ce0.2CoO3&#8208;&#948;, doped&#8208;CeO2, and Co3O4 phases are presented. The HEP phase provides catalytic sites and robust frameworks, the doped&#8208;CeO2 phase enhances oxygen&#8208;ion transport; and the Co3O4 nanoparticles offer additional active sites. The optimized (La0.2Sr0.2Pr0.2Ba0.2Ce0.2)0.7CoO3&#8208;&#948; electrode exhibits promising electrochemical performance: a low area&#8208;specific resistance of 0.058 &#937; cm2 at 700&#160;&#176;C and enhance stability (a 2&#8208;fold improvement in ambient air, a 6&#8208;fold enhancement in moisture resistance, and a 3&#8208;fold increase in Cr tolerance compare to (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#120575;). When applied as an air electrode for R&#8208;SOCs, it delivers excellent performance at 800&#160;&#176;C: a peak power density of 1.68&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in fuel cell (FC); a current density of 1.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.2&#160;V in electrolysis cell (EC). Significantly, this work represents the first application of a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;oxide&#8208;based material as an air electrode in large&#8208;area R&#8208;SOCs (10&#215;10 cm2). The assembled R&#8208;SOC achieves an output of 61&#160;W in FC and 66 A at 1.18&#160;V in EC at 800&#160;&#176;C, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

         <title>A Shape&#8208;Recovery Polycationic Fibroin for Hemostasis&#8208;Regeneration Transition by Recapitulating Natural Coagulation Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by fibrin's characteristics during coagulation, an artificial polycationic fibroin (pCSF/&#946;) recapitulates natural coagulation networks by replicating the aggregation state and maturation process of fibrin through intermolecular interaction and subsequent strain hardening originating from ethanol&#8208;inducing &#946;&#8208;sheet, which achieves hemostasis&#8208;regeneration transition.









Abstract
Large&#8208;scale and deep trauma restricts the effective hemostasis and tissue regeneration management, even causing death. The formation of the fibrin network is the initial stage of wound control. Inspired by Fn's characteristics during coagulation, an artificial polycationic fibroin (pCSF/&#946;) is designed to achieve hemostasis&#8208;regeneration transition. pCSF/&#946; replicates the aggregation state and maturation process of Fn through intermolecular interaction and subsequent strain hardening originating from ethanol&#8208;inducing &#946;&#8208;sheet to recapitulate natural coagulation networks, achieving mechanical reinforcement and shape recovery. Proteomics and transcriptomics analyses reveal that pCSF/&#946; connects hemostasis and regeneration through platelet contents&#8217; release and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The results of incompressible hemostasis, large&#8208;area skin repair, and penetrating liver regeneration in animal models such as minipigs confirm pCSF/&#946; is superior to clinical products in rapid hemostasis and synchronous tissue regeneration. The molecular design of pCSF/&#946; provides new insights for developing biomaterials in rapid hemostasis and simultaneous regeneration.

n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs, utilizing Cu self&#8208;doping and DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 modified, can achieve decoupling and optimize thermal and electrical transport properties, thereby enhancing the TEC effect. Additionally, the presence of Cu at the Zn sites increases carrier concentration and enhances POD&#8208;like activity. When combined with ferroptosis, these features lead to efficient ROS generation and GSH depletion, resulting in satisfactory therapeutic efficacy.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technology, a rapidly advancing field in medical therapy, encounters challenges in achieving efficient thermal and electrical transport properties within the limited thermal range compatible with biological systems. This study presents a high&#8208;performance thermoelectric catalytic therapy (TECT) utilizing Cu self&#8208;doped Cu2+xZn1&#8208;xSnSe4 nanosheets synthesized with non&#8208;stoichiometric ratios modified with DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 (n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs). Under 808 nm laser irradiation, n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs demonstrate an impressive photothermal conversion efficiency of 47.62%, rapidly establishing a significant local temperature gradient. This increase in temperature initiates thermoelectric catalysis (TEC), effectively generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are toxic to cancer cells. The thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of n&#8208;CZTSe@PEG NSs at room temperature is observed to be 45.45% higher than that of pure phase CZTSe. Experimental results, supported by density functional theory calculations, reveal that lattice disorder and the presence of highly degenerate electronic bands at the band edges decouple thermal and electrical transport, enhancing the TEC effect. The additional copper ions at zinc sites increase carrier concentration, hole conductivity, and peroxidase&#8208;like activity, thereby enhancing ROS production, depleting glutathione, accelerating lipid peroxidation, and inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4, ultimately inducing ferroptosis in cancer cells. Consequently, a synergistic TECT and ferroptosis effect is achieved, resulting in significant anti&#8208;cancer efficacy.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Bi Catalytic Pair Enables Selective Superoxide Radical Generation for Simultaneous Removal of Organic Pollutants and Heavy Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new oxygen activation regulation catalyst, with a Zn&#8208;Bi catalytic pair with a double d10 electronic configuration, and a model for the synergistic treatment of complex water pollutants, is constructed. This catalytic system can selectively activate O2 to generate superoxide radicals, thereby achieving efficient synergistic removal of Cr(VI) and ciprofloxacin.








Abstract
Manipulating exciton dissociation and charge&#8208;carrier transfer processes to selectively generate redox&#8208;capable superoxide (O2&#8226;&#8722;) for the removal of antibiotic&#8208;heavy metal&#8208;combined pollutants is challenging. To address this issue, a Zn&#8208;Bi catalytic pair with a dual d10 electronic configuration is constructed. The incorporation of Zn atoms into the lattice results in the formation of a Zn&#8208;Ov&#8208;Bi defect structure, thereby enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field by 5.1 times. This synergistically promotes exciton dissociation at oxygen vacancies and the directional migration of carriers. This strategy achieves an excellent charge mobility (3.76 ps) and selective activation of O2 to O2&#8226;&#8722; (selectivity: 86.6%, 2.01 mmol L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, an increase of 2.57 times). Owing to the unique charge separation mechanism, ZBOB performs excellently in the treatment of complex environmental pollutants, with simultaneous removal rates of ciprofloxacin and Cr(VI) reaching 0.55 and 0.41 min&#8722;1, respectively, which are four and three times higher than those of the unmodified catalyst, respectively. The catalyst exhibits excellent cycling performance and stability for the simultaneous removal of ciprofloxacin and Cr(VI). These findings highlight the mechanisms underlying the charge transfer and selective generation of free radicals and provide valuable insights for the design of more efficient photocatalysts.

&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; electronic configuration, and a model for the synergistic treatment of complex water pollutants, is constructed. This catalytic system can selectively activate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate superoxide radicals, thereby achieving efficient synergistic removal of Cr(VI) and ciprofloxacin.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulating exciton dissociation and charge-carrier transfer processes to selectively generate redox-capable superoxide (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) for the removal of antibiotic-heavy metal-combined pollutants is challenging. To address this issue, a Zn-Bi catalytic pair with a dual &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; electronic configuration is constructed. The incorporation of Zn atoms into the lattice results in the formation of a Zn-O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;-Bi defect structure, thereby enhancing the built-in electric field by 5.1 times. This synergistically promotes exciton dissociation at oxygen vacancies and the directional migration of carriers. This strategy achieves an excellent charge mobility (3.76 ps) and selective activation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (selectivity: 86.6%, 2.01 mmol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, an increase of 2.57 times). Owing to the unique charge separation mechanism, ZBOB performs excellently in the treatment of complex environmental pollutants, with simultaneous removal rates of ciprofloxacin and Cr(VI) reaching 0.55 and 0.41 min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, which are four and three times higher than those of the unmodified catalyst, respectively. The catalyst exhibits excellent cycling performance and stability for the simultaneous removal of ciprofloxacin and Cr(VI). These findings highlight the mechanisms underlying the charge transfer and selective generation of free radicals and provide valuable insights for the design of more efficient photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Flexible Superhydrophobic Film with Skin&#8208;Inspired Gradient Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable, robust, flexible superhydrophobic film with skin&#8208;inspired gradient design is successfully proposed by utilizing a force&#8208;engineered wool rolling technique, which facilitates the nanoparticle engulfment in polymer by pressure, electrostatic force, and enhanced capillary force. The resulting superhydrophobic film demonstrates excellent freestanding flexibility, mechanical robustness, weather resistance, and anti&#8208;icing performance.








Abstract
Flexible superhydrophobic materials are attractive in separation technology, thermal management, anti&#8208;icing, and wearable electronics since their adaptability to curved surfaces and deformation. However, their fragility and high susceptibility to abrasion, caused by the destruction of micro/nano structures, remain significant challenges. A skin&#8208;inspired gradient design is proposed to combine flexibility and superhydrophobicity by facilitating the nanoparticle engulfment in polymer through pressure, electrostatic forces, and enhanced capillary forces. The resulting freestanding superhydrophobic film demonstrates remarkable flexibility and robust superhydrophobicity against strain (70%), stretching or bending (&gt;5000 cycles), Taber abrasion (400 cycles), UV aging (&gt;1500 h), and salt spray corrosion (&gt;40 days). Combined with the low thermal conductivity, it exhibits high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;icing (icing delay time of &#8776;320 s) and durable de&#8208;icing (ice adhesion strength of &#8776;45 kPa, with no significant alterations over 20 icing/de&#8208;icing cycles). Additionally, its skin&#8208;like breathability and sensing support underwater electronics. This skin&#8208;inspired gradient strategy offers a promising paradigm for engineering freestanding, flexible, robust superhydrophobic materials design.

         <title>Near&#8208;Field Energy Transmission Mechanism of Switchable Quasi&#8208;Dipole Distribution in Triboelectric Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency near&#8208;field electrostatic energy transmission system is developed based on a switchable quasi&#8208;dipole distribution charge model at the triboelectric interface, enabling applications in a wireless air purification and conductive pattern mapping.








Abstract
Near&#8208;field energy transmission is important for wireless power supply in separated or isolated space. Electrostatic energy generated by triboelectrification is typically confined to the triboelectric interface and is hard to transmit in distance due to limited understanding of tribo&#8208;charge distribution and transfer behavior. Here, it is found that positive and negative tribo&#8208;charges spontaneously form a switchable quasi&#8208;dipole distribution at the dynamic triboelectric interface. Driven by the strong electric field of this quasi&#8208;dipole configuration, the extraction of electrostatic energy breaks traditional limitations and enables short&#8208;distance transmission through dielectric and air media, without the need for any auxiliary circuits. A high transmission efficiency of 65.2% is achieved through a 5&#160;mm dielectric medium by efficiently matching the electric field distribution with a collector structure and minimizing transmission loss. Finally, an air purification system and a conductor pattern mapping platform are developed by utilizing the wireless transmitted electrostatic energy, achieving air purification and diverse conductor pattern imaging under mechanical stimuli. This work provides an insight into the distribution and transmission of electrostatic energy, promoting its evolution from interfacial research toward spatial applications.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Modulated Asymmetric Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on MOF&#8208;Derived Carbon Enabling Durable Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric cobalt single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring Co&#8722;N3P1 active sites anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;phosphorus co&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Co&#8722;N&#8722;PC) derived from MOFs is rationally designed as an iodine cathode host, demonstrating enhanced iodine redox kinetics and cycling stability through synergistic electronic modulation and confinement effects, thus offering insights for long&#8208;life aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.








Abstract
The rational design of catalytic host materials with optimized electronic structures and confined architectures is crucial for addressing the shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics in aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. In this study, an asymmetric cobalt single&#8208;atom catalyst is developed by anchoring Co&#8722;N3P1 sites on a nitrogen&#8208;phosphorus co&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Co&#8722;N&#8722;PC) derived from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). The coordination engineering of Co centers via phosphorus incorporation disrupts the symmetry of conventional Co&#8722;N4 configurations, enhancing charge redistribution and reducing the energy barrier for iodine dissociation as confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Systematic optimization reveals that moderate Co and P doping balances active sites and electronic conductivity, achieving strong chemical adsorption of polyiodides while maintaining structural stability. In situ Raman and UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopies confirm effective confinement of iodine species and reversible iodine conversion. The optimized C3/I2 cathode exhibits exceptional cyclability, retaining a specific capacity of 100.6 mA h g&#8722;1 after 50,000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. Furthermore, practical applicability is demonstrated in flexible soft&#8208;pack batteries and 3D&#8208;printed/screen&#8208;printed micro&#8208;batteries, showing its potential for scalable energy storage. This work presents a heteroatom&#8208;modulation strategy for designing efficient catalytic hosts in conversion&#8208;type batteries.

         <title>Isoquinoline as an Electrolyte Additive for Electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 Batteries: Superior Cycling Stability and Areal Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoquinoline (C9H7N, 500 mg L&#8722;1) stabilizes Zn plating/stripping via surface adsorption and solvation shell modification in strongly acidic chloride&#8208;based electrolytes, enabling stability over 3650 cycles for electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 full batteries. It also facilitates a zinc metal anode&#8208;free design with &#8776;8 mAh cm&#8722;2 area capacity and &#8776;1.9 V discharge voltage, highlighting its critical role in advancing high&#8208;performance electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries hold great promise for energy storage applications owing to their high theoretical electromotive force and energy density. However, the zinc anode suffers from severe corrosion in strongly acidic electrolytes, leading to hydrogen evolution, low zinc utilization, and premature battery failure. To address these challenges, isoquinoline is introduced as an additive in a chloride&#8208;based acidic electrolyte. Isoquinoline molecules preferentially adsorb on the Zn surface and incorporate into the Zn2+ solvation sheath, thereby effectively suppressing zinc corrosion and enhancing Zn plating/stripping reversibility in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell configurations. At an optimized concentration of 500 mg L&#8722;1 isoquinoline, the modified electrolyte enables the electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 battery to achieve outstanding cycling stability, delivering 3650 cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of 98%, demonstrating highly competitive cycling performance among reported electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 systems. Furthermore, this electrolyte modulation supports the development of a zinc metal anode&#8208;free full cell, which delivers a high areal discharge capacity of &#8776;8 mAh cm&#8722;2 and maintains a stable discharge voltage plateau of &#8776;1.9 V. These findings underscore the pivotal role of isoquinoline in stabilizing the zinc interface and advancing the performance of electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries.

Furthermore, this electrolyte modulation supports the development of a zinc metal anode-free full cell, which delivers a high areal discharge capacity of &#8776;8 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains a stable discharge voltage plateau of &#8776;1.9 V. These findings underscore the pivotal role of isoquinoline in stabilizing the zinc interface and advancing the performance of electrolytic Zn&#8722;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>TriMag Microrobots: 3D&#8208;Printed Microrobots for Magnetic Actuation, Imaging, and Hyperthermia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TriMag microrobots are two&#8208;photon polymerized hydrogel structures embedded with in situ synthesized Fe3O4 and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, enabling magnetic actuation, high&#8208;resolution magnetic particle imaging (MPI), and efficient magnetothermal heating for deep&#8208;tissue biomedical interventions including tracking, navigation, and tumor ablation.








Abstract
Microrobots hold immense potential in biomedical applications, including drug delivery, disease diagnostics, and minimally invasive surgeries. However, two key challenges hinder their clinical translation: achieving scalable and precision fabrication, and enabling non&#8208;invasive imaging and tracking within deep biological tissues. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI), a cutting&#8208;edge imaging modality, addresses these challenges by detecting the magnetization of nanoparticles and visualizing superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs) with sub&#8208;millimeter resolution, free from interference by biological tissues. This capability makes MPI an ideal tool for tracking magnetic microrobots in deep tissue environments. In this study, &#8220;TriMag&#8221; microrobots are introduced: 3D&#8208;printed microrobots with three integrated magnetic functionalities&#8212;magnetic actuation, magnetic particle imaging, and magnetic hyperthermia. The TriMag microrobots are fabricated using an innovative method that combines two&#8208;photon lithography for 3D printing biocompatible hydrogel structures with in situ chemical reactions to embed the hydrogel scaffold with Fe3O4 nanoparticles for good MPI contrast and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles for efficient magnetothermal heating. This approach enables scalable, precise fabrication of helical magnetic hydrogel microrobots. The resulting TriMag microrobots, with the synergistic effects of Fe3O4 and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, demonstrate efficient magnetic actuation for controlled movement, precise imaging via MPI for imaging and tracking in biological fluid and organs, including porcine eye and mouse stomach, and magnetothermal heating for tumor ablation in a mouse model. By combining these capabilities, the fabrication and imaging approach provides a robust platform for non&#8208;invasive monitoring and manipulation of microrobots for transformative applications in medical treatment and biological research.

         <title>Design of Electrified Fiber Sorbents for Direct Air Capture with Electrically&#8208;Driven Temperature Vacuum Swing Adsorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through in&#8208;depth investigation of structure&#8208;performance interaction of air contactor material and process optimization, electrified fiber sorbent system capable of Joule heating is rationally designed for energy&#8208;efficient electrically&#8208;driven temperature vacuum swing adsorption for direct air capture.








Abstract
Joule heating is becoming accepted as a highly efficient regeneration technique for temperature vacuum swing adsorption in direct air capture (DAC). This acknowledgment arises from its ability to rapidly generate and transfer heat, along with the&#160;convenience of obtaining electrical power from renewable sources. This study presents a unique electrified fiber&#160;sorbent (i.e., e&#8208;fiber) design&#160;that facilitates Joule heating, enabling energy&#8208;efficient electrically&#8208;driven temperature&#8208;vacuum swing adsorption (e&#8208;TVSA) for DAC. The e&#8208;fiber sorbent is produced via a dip coating technique, in which a silver composite solution is applied to the surface of an open&#8208;porous polymer matrix. The resulting ultra&#8208;thin, interconnected porous conductive layer on the fiber surface not only minimizes the increase in diffusion resistance even after the surface coating process but also offers exceptionally low electrical resistance (0.5 &#937;&#160;cm&#8722;1). The e&#8208;fiber sorbent module achieves a desorption temperature of 110&#160;&#176;C in 80 s at 3&#160;V. Notably, only a 5% reduction in capacity is recorded following repeated&#160;cycles of e&#8208;TVSA at a CO2 concentration of 400&#160;ppm. The complicated nature of heat transfer processes is clarified caused by Joule heating in the e&#8208;fiber sorbent module through detailed case studies conducted with computational simulations, offering insights for design optimization and system engineering.

         <title>Stiffening Liquid Crystal Elastomers with Liquid Crystal Inclusions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of low molecular weight liquid crystals (LC) into liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) leads to a significant increase in their stiffness and output work density. Such remarkable stiffening is attributed to nanoscale phase&#8208;separation and the formation of induced&#8208;smectic domains in polydomain and monodomain LC&#8208;LCEs, respectively.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are promising building blocks for soft robots, given their large, programmable, reversible, and stimuli&#8208;responsive shape change. Enhancing LCEs&#8217; stiffness and toughness has been a longstanding desire previously explored by reinforcing them with fillers, crystalline microdomains, and interpenetrating polymer networks. While promising, these methods adversely affect molecular order and thermal strain. Here, a significant enhancement of the&#160;stiffness of LCEs is reported by loading them with low molecular weight liquid crystals (LMWLCs) without sacrificing thermal strain and molecular order. While pristine LCEs rapidly transition to a soft elastic plateau when strained from poly&#8208; to monodomain, LC&#8208;loaded samples (LC&#8208;LCEs) first experience a pronounced linear elasticity, followed by a soft elastic plateau at higher stresses. Further thermomechanical and X&#8208;ray analysis confirm the emergence of an additional mesophase in polydomain LC&#8208;LCEs, which evolves to short&#8208;range smectic (cybotactic) during the poly&#8208; to monodomain transition. Monodomain LC&#8208;LCEs show between 6.5&#8208; and 9.0&#8208;fold stiffness enhancement with improved molecular order and thermal strain. Their work densities are more than double that of pristine LCEs, with active thermal stroke of up to 25% under loads of over 2000 times their weight. Such remarkable behaviors are attributed to the interplay between post&#8208;polymerization phase separation of LCs and their strain&#8208;enhanced smectic ordering. The results suggest that LMWLC inclusion can be a simple yet robust method to significantly improve the mechanical properties of LCEs.

         <title>Volumetric 3D Printing and Melt&#8208;Electrowriting to Fabricate Implantable Reinforced Cardiac Tissue Patches</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an implantable reinforced cardiac patch (RCPatch) combining volumetrically 3D&#8208;printed metamaterials with melt&#8208;electrowritten (MEW) meshes. The design integrates tunable stiff polymer structures&#160;with soft, cell&#8208;laden hydrogels. The RCPatch withstands suturing, intraventricular pressure, and cardiac contraction in a large animal myocardial defect model. The patch prevents bleeding and enables partial hemodynamic restabilization, demonstrating its potential for myocardial repair.








Abstract
Cardiac patches to repair myocardial defects require mechanically stable materials that prevent bleeding and can be implanted via suturing. The current clinical standard, bovine pericardial patches (BPPs), serve this purpose but do not degrade or integrate with the myocardium, limiting their long&#8208;term effectiveness. Here, we present the reinforced cardiac tissue patch (RCPatch). This multimaterial patch comprises a stiffness&#8208;tuned, cardiomyocyte&#8208;infiltrated 3D metamaterial and a suturable, hydrogel&#8208;infiltrated mesh to reduce permeability and bleeding. Anisotropic metamaterials are designed and computationally optimized using a generative modeling approach and fabricated from poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) via volumetric 3D printing (VP). The metamaterial supports the infiltration of cardiomyocytes, which are viable and contract in vitro. The implantability and low blood permeability of the patch is enabled&#160;by adding a melt&#8208;electrowritten (MEW) mesh infiltrated with a fibrin hydrogel. In an acute large animal trial, the RCPatch was applied on an induced myocardial defect, where it withstood intraventricular blood pressure, prevented bleeding, and enabled hemodynamic restabilization (intraventricular pressure of 81 mmHg before, vs 66 mmHg after implantation). These findings establish a scalable framework for fabricating cardiac tissue patches that integrate mechanical reinforcement with biological function, offering a surgically implantable&#160;and future regenerative solution for intraventricular myocardial repair.

In an acute large animal trial, the RCPatch was applied on an induced myocardial defect, where it withstood intraventricular blood pressure, prevented bleeding, and enabled hemodynamic restabilization (intraventricular pressure of 81 mmHg before, vs 66 mmHg after implantation). These findings establish a scalable framework for fabricating cardiac tissue patches that integrate mechanical reinforcement with biological function, offering a surgically implantable&#160;and future regenerative solution for intraventricular myocardial repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Thick&#8208;Film All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by a Blade&#8208;Coating Process Assisted by a Direct Nonuniform Electric Field</title>

         <dc:description>
This study addresses the challenge of fabricating efficient thick&#8208;film all&#8208;polymer solar cells for industrial production by introducing a non&#8208;contact DC field method during blade coating. The technique optimizes bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology with enhanced vertical phase separation, eventually achieving a record efficiency of 17.59%.








Abstract
The incorporation of thick active layers (&gt;300&#160;nm) is an essential requirement for wide&#8208;scale industrial production of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it is still challenging to achieve efficient thick film devices, in particular for all&#8208;polymer OSCs, which are generally considered the most stable type of OSCs. In this study, a simple yet effective method is introduced by using a direct current (DC) field to manipulate the morphology of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films within all&#8208;polymer OSCs during a blade coating process. By utilizing this method, a favorable vertical phase distribution is achieved, thereby effectively reducing the electron percolation threshold and enhancing the overall device performance. With this, an outstanding efficiency of 17.59% is achieved for thick&#8208;film all&#8208;polymer devices by blade&#8208;coating, which is the best performance in this category. This study introduces a non&#8208;contact DC field method aimed at mitigating the fabrication challenges encountered when transitioning thick&#8208;film all&#8208;polymer systems from laboratory to manufacturing settings, and will potentially contributing to the advancement of the OSC industrialization.

         <title>Band Structure Engineering to Optimize Spin&#8208;Wave Propagation in Weyl ferromagnet Co2MnGa1&#8208;xGex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Band structure engineering in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co2MnGa1&#8208;xGex enables deterministic control over spin&#8208;wave propagation with ultra&#8208;low magnetic damping. Compositional tuning of the Fermi level yields an optimum Gilbert damping of 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and a spin&#8208;wave decay length over 100 &#181;m. This work unlocks the magnonic dimension of Weyl semimetal Co2MnGa1&#8208;xGex, developing a multi&#8208;functional and versatile materials platform for magnonics.








Abstract
Spin waves, the quantized excitations of magnetic order, have been widely explored as low&#8208;power information carriers in conventional metallic systems (e.g., NiFe) and insulating materials like yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Recently, magnetic Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have emerged as a novel platform for magnonics, leveraging their unique band structures, strong spin&#8208;orbit interactions, and fertile topological behavior. Despite this potential, spin&#8208;wave dynamics in magnetic WSMs remain largely uncharted. In this work, this gap is addressed by investigating spin&#8208;wave propagation in epitaxial Co2MnGa1&#8208;xGex (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 1) thin films, a prototypical magnetic WSMs system. By changing the ratio between Ga and Ge, how band&#8208;structure engineering, specifically tuning the Fermi level into the minority&#8208;spin pseudogap is demonstrated, systematically modulates the electronic and magnetic properties to achieve ultralow Gilbert damping (&#8776;1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3) alongside long spin&#8208;wave decay lengths over 100 &#181;m. These results establish a generalizable strategy for optimizing spin&#8208;wave media while unlocking a materials platform to probe intertwined charge, spin and orbit, with profound implications for next&#8208;generation spintronic and magnonic technologies.

         <title>Engineered Biomimetic Nanovesicles Derived From Bone Marrow Stromal Cells With Innate Homing Capability for Targeted Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>

The biomimetic nanovesicles (mNVs) coated bone marrow targeted delivery system actively delivers core drugs into bone marrow.








Abstract
Precise delivery of pharmaceuticals administered to bone marrow for various bone diseases is challenging, given the bone marrow&#8208;blood barrier (MBB). Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) derived from bone marrow can naturally infiltrate the MBB and home to bone tissue. Here, biomimetic nanovesicles (namely mNVs) engineered with the extracted cell membrane from BMSCs are reported for homing delivery of different core nanomedicines to bone marrow. The cargo&#8208;loaded mNVs exhibited excellent bone targeting in crossing natural barriers is demonstrated to augment drug concentrations in bone marrow, and the bio&#8208;function of mNVs is verified in typical models of chronic metabolic bone disease and metastatic carcinoma. In the induced osteoporosis model, engineered mNVs deliver the nanocore of teriparatide&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid), forming a sustained&#8208;release system of teriparatide, which can significantly slow bone loss, maintain bone mass, and alleviate osteoporosis indicators. In osseous and systematic metastatic breast carcinoma models, the mNVs are employed to deliver DNA tetrahedron embedded doxorubicin and efficiently inhibit tumor progression and osteolytic lesions. This work suggests that high&#8208;efficiency bone marrow delivery of medications can be camouflaged by the cell membrane derived from BMSCs, initiating a new platform for bone targeting drug delivery for developing more effective therapeutics for bone diseases.

         <title>Biphasic Ni&#8208;MXene Quantum&#8208;Confined Nanostructures: A Versatile Janus Platform for Advanced Energy Storage and Catalytic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic Ni&#8208;MXene quantum&#8208;confined nanostructure (Ni&#8208;MJQD) serves as a Janus platform, simultaneously achieving high&#8208;performance energy storage and efficient catalytic oxidation. The unique architecture enables superior energy storage performance and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation&#8208;symbolizing &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; for sustainable energy and catalysis.








Abstract
The demand for sustainable energy storage and ecofriendly catalysts has intensified the search for advanced multifunctional materials. Herein, this work presents the synthesis and characterization of Janus Ni&#8208;MXene quantum dot (Ni&#8208;MJQD), a novel material architecture that exhibits high performance in supercapacitor and catalytic applications. A Ni&#8208;MJQD cathode delivers an impressive gravimetric specific capacity of 168.75 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1, and its Janus structure optimizes the balance between capacity and ion diffusion. In an asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor (AHSC) with a porous activated carbon (PAC) anode, it achieves an energy density of 54.22&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, a power density of 1599&#160;W kg&#8722;1, and 88% capacity retention over 20&#160;000 cycles. As a catalyst, the Ni&#8208;MJQD also exhibits high activity in benzyl alcohol oxidation, reaching 95% conversion and 98.4% selectivity for benzaldehyde, with the largest turnover frequency of 8.8825 &#215; 10&#8722;3 moles g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as an oxidant. Mechanistic analysis reveals contributions from both radical and nonradical pathways. These findings emphasize the unique potential of the Ni&#8208;MJQD electrodes for sustainable energy storage and green synthesis applications.

         <title>3D Ordered Macroporous Superstructures of High Entropy Hydroxide with Strong Orbital Coupling Enhancing Water/Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensionally ordered macroporous high&#8208;entropy hydroxides enhances mass transfer and active sites exposure, and enhance local OH&#8722; concentration and electric field strength, and the strong coupling between atomic orbitals facilitates electron transfer and promotes electrical activity, which shows high durability and corrosion resistance in water/seawater electrolysis with high current density.








Abstract
The water splitting performance is strongly influenced by intrinsic properties of the catalyst and the accessibility of the active center. Herein, high&#8208;entropy hydroxides (HEH) with 3D ordered macroporous (3DOM) structure are prepared by chemical etching method with rational design. The 3DOM structure can maximize the exposure of the active sites and also facilitates bubble transport. As demonstrated by finite element analysis, the 3DOM structure modifies the spatial curvature of the catalyst, resulting in the enrichment of OH&#8722;. Moreover, the strong orbital coupling of transition metals significantly regulates the electronic structure of the catalyst, selectively adsorbs OH&#8722; at Fe sites, and inhibits the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. Thanks to these characteristics, 3DOM&#8208;HEH&#8208;300 shows the best oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in 1 m KOH (182 mV@100 mA cm&#8722;2, 211 mV@500 mA cm&#8722;2), and stables operation of more than 400 h. Besides, in natural seawater, it also exhibits the best catalytic activity (245 mV@100 mA cm&#8722;2, 278 mV@500 mA cm&#8722;2), which is better than similar catalysts without 3DOM structure. This work verifies the great synergistic effect of high entropy and mass transfer on the performance of OER, which also provides a new idea for constructing high&#8208;performance electrodes.

         <title>Body&#8208;Coupled&#8208;Driven Object&#8208;Oriented Natural Interactive Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;mode 2D/3D interaction is realized through body&#8208;coupled energy transfer, achieving 200 &#181;m&#8208;resolution 2D calligraphy reconstruction and 200 mm&#8208;range 3D tracking with sub&#8208;millisecond mode switching for seamless cross&#8208;dimensional control. Meanwhile, an object&#8208;oriented human machine interaction (HMI)&#160;framework is proposed to enable multi&#8208;device interoperability by detecting electromagnetic signatures, resolving device isolation through bioinspired face&#8208;to&#8208;face interaction adaptable to metaverse digital twins.








Abstract
The metaverse progressively demands heightened sophistication in human&#8208;multi&#8208;machine collaboration, accelerating development of hybrid immersive 2D tactile and 3D spatial perception interfaces. However, current interfaces struggle with the precision and adaptability in complex human&#8208;multi&#8208;machine interaction scenarios. This paper presents a transparent stretchable sensing interface synergizing 2D tactile and 3D spatial perception through body&#8208;coupled electromagnetic coupling. Its bi&#8208;modal coupling (resistive coupling and capacitive coupling) mechanism enables micrometer&#8208;scale 2D tactile sensing alongside broad 3D spatial perception (200&#160;mm range). The contact mode achieves calligraphy&#8208;grade trajectory reconstruction (200 &#181;m precision) with force tactile sensing, while the non&#8208;contact mode recognizes 38 gestures at 97.11% accuracy. The interface's mechanical transparency and elasticity permit seamless integration on curved surfaces (e.g., gloves and clothes) without perceptual interference. An object&#8208;oriented human&#8208;machine interaction (HMI) framework is developed to enable single&#8208;interface control of multiple devices through electromagnetic signature recognition, enhancing collaborative efficiency. This work can inspire designs of smart interfaces in intelligent healthcare monitoring, industrial robotics coordination, and cross&#8208;domain augmented reality applications.

         <title>Microstructural Evolution Dynamics in Rapid Joule Heating Densification of High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of high&#8208;temperature rapid Joule heating combined with two&#8208;step sintering drives full densification while suppressing grain coarsening in high&#8208;Ni cathodes. By activating lattice and grain boundary diffusion over surface diffusion, this approach achieves dense microstructures without excessive grain growth, offering insights into the relationship between sintering dynamics and microstructural evolution, and guiding the synthesis of fully densified, high&#8208;energy density materials.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy density materials are essential for the advancement of next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which power a wide range of applications from portable electronics to electric vehicles. Among them, high&#8208;Nickel (Ni)&#160;layered oxide cathodes have emerged as promising candidates due to their high capacity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, pores and excessive grain growth in high&#8208;Ni layered oxides compromise energy density and mechanical integrity, while oversized grains hinder lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics, necessitating a sintering strategy that promotes densification without inducing abnormal grain growth. Here, a rapid Joule heating technique combined with two&#8208;step sintering is introduced that significantly improves the microstructural integrity of high&#8208;Ni cathodes. This approach enables fast densification while suppressing grain growth, resulting in cathodes with higher density, reduced porosity, and enhanced mechanical strength. Through in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), and 3D ptychography analysis, it is found that the rapid Joule&#8208;heated cathodes exhibit mitigated phase separation, suppressed pore evolution, and improved resistance to crack propagation. They deliver superior cycling stability, coulombic efficiency, and rate performance. These results provide insights into the relationship between sintering dynamics and microstructural evolution, offering guidelines for synthesizing fully densified, high&#8208;energy density materials.

         <title>Tailoring Solvation Structures via Precise Diluent Engineering for High&#8208;Rate 500 Wh kg&#8722;1 Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring solvation structures via precise diluent engineering, this electrolyte design enhances both energy density and rate capability for practical lithium metal batteries (LMBs). As a result, a 2.95 Ah Li&#8208;NCM811 pouch cell with an energy density of 518 Wh kg&#8722;1/985 Wh L&#8722;1 retains &gt;92% of the initial capacity over 107 cycles at 0.2&#160;&#160;C charge/1 C discharge.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs), featuring lithium metal anodes (LMAs) paired with high&#8208;voltage cathodes, are promising candidates for achieving energy densities exceeding 500 Wh kg&#8722;1. However, their commercialization is hindered by unstable interphases and insufficient Li+ transport kinetics, especially under high&#8208;rate conditions. Here, a hybrid diluent strategy is reported for diluted high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (DHCEs) that decouples Li+ solvation from interfacial stabilization by combining fluorinated aromatics with fluorinated ethers. Fluorinated aromatics promote efficient Li+ desolvation and fast transport, while fluorinated ethers provide high oxidative stability and robust interphase formation. Their combination produces a synergistic solvation environment, simultaneously enhancing ion transport, extending voltage tolerance, and stabilizing electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. The tailored electrolyte enables 0.78 Ah Li&#8208;NCM622 pouch cells to achieve over 300 cycles at 0.33C charge/0.66C discharge under practical conditions (Li: 50 &#181;m; NCM622: 20 mg cm&#8722;2; electrolyte: 3 g Ah&#8722;1). Furthermore, a 2.95 Ah Li&#8208;NCM811 pouch cell demonstrates an energy density of 518 Wh kg&#8722;1/985 Wh L&#8722;1 and retains over 92% of its initial capacity after 107 cycles at 0.2C charge/1C discharge. This work establishes a scalable and cost&#8208;effective electrolyte design strategy that directly addresses the key failure mechanisms of LMBs, offering a viable pathway toward practical high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;rate applications.

         <title>Generalizable Porous Aromatic Framework&#8208;Included Polymer Membranes for Diffusion&#8208;Enhanced Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work contains a generalizable procedure for enhancing the gas permeability and aging resistance of polymer membranes without compromising selectivity by incorporating robust porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs). The PAF fillers are highly dispersible in a wide range of solvents, and amine&#8208;functionalization of the PAF enhances the plasticization resistance of the mixed&#8208;matrix membranes.








Abstract
Industrial separation processes account for 10&#8211;15% of global energy consumption. Membrane&#8208;based processes are less energy&#8208;intensive than traditional gas separation technologies; however, enhanced material separation performance and stability for numerous gas mixtures are needed for widespread industrial adoption. This work presents a generalizable strategy for preparing mixed&#8208;matrix gas separation membranes exceeding the performance upper bounds of existing polymer membranes for a wide variety of industrial gases. By incorporating robust porous aromatic framework (PAF) particles into various dense commercial polymer matrices, gas diffusivity and solubility can be enhanced. For diverse gas mixtures (e.g., CO2/N2, O2/N2, He/CH4, H2/N2, and C2H4/C2H6), the resulting composite membranes exhibit enhanced gas permeabilities&#8212;by as much as 520%&#8212;and largely unchanged selectivities even after 6 years of aging under simulated flue gas conditions. These improvements arise from the ultrahigh porosity, excellent chemical compatibility, and unique physicochemical properties of the embedded PAF particles. Functionalizing the PAFs with polyamines also enables composite membranes that achieve among the highest reported performances against plasticization, a common obstacle in commercializing gas separation membranes. Significantly, the PAF&#8208;1 particles are readily dispersible in various common membrane casting solvents, suggesting their broader utility as a filler for designing high&#8208;performance membranes for many industrial gas separations.

         <title>Universal NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Emitting Unimolecular Micelles with Tailorable Pharmacokinetic and Optical Properties for Adaptive Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses a long&#8208;standing challenge in optimizing the pharmacokinetics of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated phototheranostic materials by disrupting &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in polymer brush&#8208;engineered unimolecular micelles. Besides reducing nonspecific uptake, the blood circulation can be adjusted half&#8208;life over a 60&#8208;fold range and enhance the fluorescence emissions by unimolecular micelle designs, facilitating flexible imaging applications from detecting kidney dysfunction to identifying tumors.








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated fluorophores show great potential for NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;imaging owing to their superior brightness and photostability, yet their clinical translation has been hindered by suboptimal pharmacokinetics. To address this issue, a strategy is developed to tailor the in vivo behavior of &#960;&#8208;conjugate fluorophores by breaking &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in polymer brush&#8208;engineered unimolecular micelles. This approach marks a significant shift from traditional methods of tuning micelles, which rely on varying the hydrophilic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrophobic ratios and are often ineffective for &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems due to the dominance of &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. By disrupting &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in the unimolecular micelles, pharmacokinetics and photophysical properties can be precisely controlled by systematically varying the molecular weight and composition of the polymer brushes. Accordingly, the blood circulation half&#8208;life can be adjusted across a 60&#8208;fold range, and fluorescence emissions are improved by 47&#8208;fold, facilitating adaptive fluorophore applications from kidney dysfunction detection to tumor imaging. Additionally, the engineered unimolecular micelles exhibit reduced nonspecific uptake and improved tumor targeting efficiency, resulting in a 5&#8208;fold higher tumor&#8208;to&#8208;liver ratio than conventional &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked nano&#8208;aggregates. These findings offer a solid solution to the pharmacokinetic optimization issues and provide a new design principle for &#960;&#8208;conjugated phototheranostic materials.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Fe3+&#8208;Doped Dendritic Mesoporous Organosilica Nanocomposites as Ferroptosis Inducers for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>

The designed TME&#8208;responsive nanocomposites, based on Fe&#8208;DMOS NPs as a novel ferroptosis inducer and cornerstone to deliver CaO2&#8208;HA NPs, which enable release Fe3+, Ca2+, and H2O2 rapidly in TME for the activation of ferroptosis&#8208;mediated ICD. With the assistance of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1, the long&#8208;term anti&#8208;tumor immune response will be activated and effectively suppress the growth and metastasis of tumors.








Abstract
Dendritic mesoporous organosilica (DMOS) nanoparticles are widely used to transport therapeutic agents to cancer sites and rapidly release them owing to their rapid biodegradability in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the role of these DMOS nanoparticles as nanocarriers is limited, and their applications remain relatively simple. In this study, Fe3+&#8208;doped dendritic mesoporous organosilica (Fe&#8208;DMOS) nanoparticles are designed as a new type of ferroptosis inducer and are combined with sodium hyaluronate&#8208;modified calcium peroxide to form TME&#8208;responsive nanocomposites. The nanocomposites can effectively generate a large number of hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction between the released Fe3+ and self&#8208;compensated hydrogen peroxide, and mitochondrial injury caused by Ca2+ overload further promotes this process. Both Fe3+ and disulfide bonds can induce glutathione depletion, thus downregulating the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 and triggering lethal levels of lipid peroxidation products, further facilitating ferroptosis in tumor cells. Additionally, the ferroptosis&#8208;mediated process of immunogenic cell death promotes a long&#8208;term antitumor immune response to prevent metastasis of tumor cells with the assistance of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1). Fe&#8208;DMOS nanoparticles are synthesized with ferroptosis&#8208;inducing capabilities and established TME&#8208;responsive nanocomposites combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor to effectively improve tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Driven Weak Electrostatic Interaction of Polybenzimidazole&#8208;Based Membrane for Alkaline Zinc&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlF3&#8208;PBI membranes with Lewis acid&#8208;modulated electronic structure enable high&#8208;performance alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow batteries. By reducing electron density on benzimidazole rings, AlF3 weakens interactions between charge&#8208;balance ions and polymer, achieving enhanced ionic conductivity. The optimized membrane delivers a high power density of 1000 mW cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over cycles at 140 mA cm&#8722;2, offering a novel strategy for durable grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow batteries (AZIFBs) are one of the promising aqueous redox chemistries for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, the energy efficiency (EE) and power density of batteries with low&#8208;cost polybenzimidazole (PBI) membranes are still limited due to the relatively poor ionic conductivity of PBI in an alkaline medium. Here, this study proposes a novel chemical approach for regulating the chemical environment of the PBI membrane. Specifically, AlF3, as a representative Lewis acid, is employed to reduce the electron cloud density of the benzimidazole (BI) ring, weaken the electrostatic interactions between the BI ring and charge&#8208;balancing ions, and thereby accelerate the diffusion of charge&#8208;balancing ions. Characterizations on the AlF3&#8208;PBI membranes reveal that the enhanced ion transport can be ascribed to decreased electron cloud density of BI rings and reduced ion diffusion resistance. Charge density difference analysis further illustrates the electron&#8208;withdrawing feature of AlF3 as a Lewis acid. AZIFBs using AlF3&#8208;PBI membrane demonstrate excellent rate capability from 40 to 240 mA cm&#8722;2 with EE of more than 80%, and an outstanding power density of nearly 1000 mW cm&#8722;2. The battery also performs decent cycle stability of 500 cycles at a high current density of 140 mA cm&#8722;2 with EE over 80%, resulting from the robust stability of the AlF3&#8208;PBI membrane and the reliability of the strategy. This study highlights the potential of Lewis acid&#8208;based chemical regulation to optimize PBI&#8208;based membranes, offering a new perspective for enhancing the performance of AZIFBs.

AZIFBs using AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PBI membrane demonstrate excellent rate capability from 40 to 240 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with EE of more than 80%, and an outstanding power density of nearly 1000 mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The battery also performs decent cycle stability of 500 cycles at a high current density of 140 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with EE over 80%, resulting from the robust stability of the AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PBI membrane and the reliability of the strategy. This study highlights the potential of Lewis acid-based chemical regulation to optimize PBI-based membranes, offering a new perspective for enhancing the performance of AZIFBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Optoelectronic Memristor with All&#8208;Optical Modulation for Microscopic Biological Motion Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared all&#8208;optical modulated optoelectronic memristor is constructed by combining upconversion nanoparticles with ZnO. Under the ultraviolet (350 nm) and near&#8208;infrared (980 nm) light stimulation, the device exhibits bidirectional synaptic plasticity, encompassing both excitatory and inhibitory responses. A series of logical functions with fault&#8208;tolerance capability and microscopic biological motion recognition is demonstrated here.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) synaptic devices are characterized by unique optical sensitivity and synaptic plasticity, possessing high potential to significantly broaden the visual spectrum accessible to humans. Moreover, these devices seamlessly integrate neuro&#8208;morphological computing with infrared optical communication, attracting significant attention for future low&#8208;power, high&#8208;efficiency neuromorphic visual systems. However, the irreversible optical response of most optical synapses under short&#8208;wavelength infrared light severely restricts the practical application of these devices. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a NIR optoelectronic memristor with all&#8208;optical modulation based on ZnO&#8208;upconversion nanoparticles (ZnO&#8208;UCNPs) nanocomposite film. The proposed device exhibits bidirectional light response characteristics under 350&#160;and 980&#160;nm light stimulations. The memristive mechanism can be attributed to the photothermal effect of upconversion nanoparticles in the nanocomposite film in conjunction with optical excitation in ZnO. Due to the all&#8208;optical plasticity, a series of logical functions with fault&#8208;tolerance capability, including are demonstrated in the proposed synaptic device. In addition, by leveraging the tissue&#8208;penetrating capability of NIR light, the proposed device can be used in microscopic biological motion detection tasks and edge detection functions. This work introduces a promising method for developing fully optically controlled memristors and advancing the field of neuromorphic vision.

         <title>Anchoring Redox Mediator on COFs for Efficient Solar to Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, Fe ions are first fixed on COFs skeleton to construct a novel 2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction (BWO/Fe/TP1C). The cycling of Fe3+/Fe2+ significantly improves the electron transfer rate. In addition, the construction of 2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction not only promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers but also ensures its high redox activity. As a result, 25% BWO/Fe/TP1C demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic performance, achieving a hydrogen evolution rate of 6.31 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, which surpasses most COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
To address severe carrier recombination in Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, redox mediators such as IO3&#8722;/I&#8722; or Fe3&#8314;/Fe2&#8314; are often introduced, yet their dispersion in solution causes instability, low electron transport efficiency and side reactions. Herein, an innovative Fe&#8208;coordinated 2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction composed of TpPa&#8208;1&#8208;COF (TP1C) and Bi2WO6 (BWO) is developed for efficient photocatalytic H2 production. Unlike traditional indirect Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, the Fe3+/Fe2+ mediator is firmly anchored on the skeleton of COFs, thus enhancing recyclability, charge migration and long&#8208;lasting stability, which is supported by extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and a range of electrochemical tests. In addition, the formation of 2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions not only retains high redox properties but also provides abundant active sites for photocatalytic reactions. Consequently, the photocatalytic H2 production rate of 25% BWO/Fe/TP1C reaches up to 6.31 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 without the addition of co&#8208;catalysts, being about 28.68 times as high as that of pure COFs and 2.3 folds over that of 25% BWO/TP1C, exceeding a host of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. The findings of this research highlight the potential of novel indirect Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions for advanced photocatalytic applications, offering a new pathway to overcome the limitations of traditional COF&#8208;based systems in hydrogen production.

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Brightness NIR&#8208;II Emission: Molecular Locking and Wrapping Strategies in Fluorescent Material Design for in Vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a molecular design strategy for bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores by addressing fluorescence quenching and low absorption in aggregates. Through structural optimization of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor small molecules (DTTD, DMTTD, DETTD), high NIR&#8208;II brightness is achieved. DETTD nanoparticles enabled high&#8208;resolution in vivo imaging, establishing a general paradigm for enhancing NIR&#8208;II fluorescence performance.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging has transformed biomedical imaging by providing low autofluorescence, deep tissue penetration, and superior spatial resolution, essential for precise in vivo biological visualization. However, developing NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting molecular fluorophores with high brightness remains challenging due to the difficulty in simultaneously achieving high absorption coefficients and excellent fluorescence emission in aggregated states. This study addresses these challenges at both the molecular and aggregate levels through a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) configured small molecules. The initial twisted molecule, DTTD, exhibits low absorption and significant fluorescence quenching upon aggregation. To mitigate these issues, DMTTD is synthesized with a planarized backbone by locking the &#960; bridge with the phenylene ring of donor, resulting in a higher absorption coefficient and reduced quenching due to its rigid structure and bulky donors. Further enhancement is achieved by incorporating branched alkyl chains into DMTTD for wrapping the molecular skeleton, creating DETTD, which maintains a high absorption coefficient and improved resistance to quenching in aggregated states. DETTD nanoparticles (NPs) with high NIR&#8208;II brightness of 117.5&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1 enabled high&#8208;resolution imaging of mice vasculature and gastrointestinal tract. This study establishes a general paradigm for simultaneously mitigating fluorescence quenching and improving absorption coefficients to achieve bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.

         <title>Dynamic Dissolution&#8208;Deposition Equilibrium Enables Unprecedented HER Stability in Acidic PEMWE</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen energy is key to achieving carbon neutrality. Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) enables efficient green hydrogen production but faces catalyst instability issues. This work introduces a low&#8208;platinum catalyst with a dynamic equilibrium mechanism, balancing durability and activity. The catalyst achieves industrial&#8208;grade stability (&gt;2&#160;200&#160;h) and high performance, offering a scalable solution for cost&#8208;effective, durable electrolyzers and advancing renewable energy storage.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) holds substantial promise for effectively utilizing renewable energy to produce green hydrogen. However, it faces critical durability challenges due to acid&#8208;driven catalyst degradation under intermittent renewable power. Here, this study reports a dynamic dissolution&#8208;deposition equilibrium that achieves exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) stability through rational design of a high&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;derived architecture. Dealloying FeCoNiNbPt HEA creates a porous scaffold with dual&#8208;functional components: an amorphous NbOx buffer suppressing metal dissolution, while multicomponent Pt3(FeCoNi) nanocrystals synergistically enhancing HER activity (137 mV@1 A cm&#8722;2, 2.5 &#215; lower than Pt/C) that thermodynamically favors redeposition. This dynamic self&#8208;adaptive mechanism maintains equilibrium under harsh operating conditions, demonstrating exceptional durability (&gt;2200&#160;h @1 A cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles). The self&#8208;supported catalysts can be easily mass&#8208;produced with 8.87&#160;wt.% Pt loading (60% reduction vs Pt/C), indicating its industrial applicability. The equilibrium&#8208;driven design paradigm opens new avenues for industrial proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane devices operating under fluctuating power.

Here, this study reports a dynamic dissolution-deposition equilibrium that achieves exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) stability through rational design of a high-entropy alloy-derived architecture. Dealloying FeCoNiNbPt HEA creates a porous scaffold with dual-functional components: an amorphous NbOx buffer suppressing metal dissolution, while multicomponent Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(FeCoNi) nanocrystals synergistically enhancing HER activity (137 mV@1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2.5 &#215; lower than Pt/C) that thermodynamically favors redeposition. This dynamic self-adaptive mechanism maintains equilibrium under harsh operating conditions, demonstrating exceptional durability (&amp;gt;2200&#160;h @1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles). The self-supported catalysts can be easily mass-produced with 8.87&#160;wt.% Pt loading (60% reduction vs Pt/C), indicating its industrial applicability. The equilibrium-driven design paradigm opens new avenues for industrial proton-exchange-membrane devices operating under fluctuating power.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CsPbBr3 Perovskite Planar Detectors Surpass CdZnTe in High&#8208;Energy Gamma&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CZT and CsPbBr3 differ primarily in charge transport. CZT's much lower hole &#181;&#964; leads to charge trapping and broader high&#8208;energy peaks. In contrast, CsPbBr3 has balanced electron and hole &#181;&#964; products, reducing trapping and producing sharper photopeaks. As a result, planar detectors of CsPbBr3 deliver superior spectral resolution above 500&#160;keV.








Abstract
The detection of high&#8208;energy gamma radiation (&gt;1 MeV) at room temperature requires large&#8208;volume semiconductor crystals with high absorption efficiency, charge transport properties, and stability. The CsPbBr3 perovskite is a promising candidate due to its congruent melting growth, high defect tolerance, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication. In this study, the performance of CsPbBr3 is evaluated as a gamma&#8208;ray detector across a wide energy range and up to 1332 keV and compare its efficacy to commercial CdZnTe (CZT) detectors of similar crystal thickness. The CsPbBr3 detectors demonstrate high energy resolution, superior spectral fidelity for high&#8208;energy gamma peaks (&gt;1 MeV), and long&#8208;term operational stability over 225 days without performance loss. Notably, CsPbBr3 resolves closely spaced gamma lines with an excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, including weak emissions from depleted uranium sources. Its more balanced charge transport compared to CZT minimizes signal distortion, even in thick detectors, and enables precise spectral peak definition without complex correction algorithms. Comparative measurements on planar detectors demonstrate that CsPbBr3 achieves comparable energy resolution to CZT at energies &lt;0.5 MeV and outperforms at high energies, making it a strong alternative for next&#8208;generation radiation detection applications.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired MXene Electrode with the Highly Interconnected Gradient Nanoconfined Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a bamboo&#8208;inspired gradient nanoconfined MXene (GNC&#8208;MX) electrode is designed. Combining the multiscale architecture, in situ deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation for tunable interlayer channels, and scalable group&#8208;welding strategies, the thick GNC&#8208;MX electrodes achieved an ultra&#8208;high area&#8208;specific capacitance of 20.7 F cm&#8722;2, which surpassing conventional MXene systems and validating the potential of gradient&#8208;confined architectures in practical energy storage applications.








Abstract
Achieving efficient ion transport in thick electrodes remains a fundamental challenge in electrochemical systems with high energy density, primarily due to prolonged diffusion pathways and poorly integrated architectures. Leveraging the nanoconfinement effect, (sub)nanoscale channels can significantly accelerate ion transport kinetics to maximize electrochemical performance. Inspired by the hierarchical network structure of bamboo membrane, a gradient nanoconfined MXene electrode (GNC&#8208;MX) is designed, where multiscale interlayer spacing is coupled with in&#8208;plane mesopores that bridge adjacent nanoconfined channels, enabling synergistic vertical and horizontal ion migration. Finite element simulations and density functional theory calculations reveal the synergistic optimization mechanism of ion transport via the gradient nanoconfined channels and in&#8208;plane mesopores. Compared to pristine MXene, GNC&#8208;MX electrodes exhibit substantially enhanced ion transport kinetics and charge storage performance. To optimize the nanoconfined channels, an in situ deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation strategy is introduced to strengthen electrostatic repulsion and weaken hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions of the MXene interlayer, enabling quasi&#8208;permanent expansion of ion transport channels. Furthermore, a scalable group&#8208;welding method is developed to fabricate 400 &#181;m&#8208;thick electrodes with an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 20.7 F cm&#8722;2, surpassing current MXene&#8208;based electrodes. This work provides a scalable and tunable biomimetic platform for advanced ion nanoconfinement in energy storage systems.

An unconventional high&#8208;entropy oxide prepared by a reduction&#8208;oxidation method with inner metallic coordination and surface medium&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;OH realizes durable PEM water electrolysis at 2 A cm&#8722;2 for over 1500 h.








Abstract
The multicomponent synergistic effect has become increasingly important for electrocatalysis; however, there remain large unexplored compositional and structural spaces. Here, an unconventional high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) with inner metallic coordination interactions and surface medium&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;OH for durable proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) is presented. The metallic clusters inside the HEO particles generate the inner metallic coordination interactions that reserve electrons, with a multicomponent effect, to inhibit Ru/Ir overoxidation and switch reaction mechanisms toward an exclusive adsorbate evolution mechanism for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Surface medium&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;OH groups enable adaptive interfacial water networks to trap reactive water and promote proton transfer, reducing mass transport resistance at large current densities. Resultantly, this RuIrNiCoCrO2&#8208;incorporated PEMWEs achieve the ultralow voltages of 1.71 V@2.0 A cm&#8722;2 and 2.03 V@5.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 80&#160;&#176;C, and unprecedented durability &gt;1500 h@2.0 A cm&#8722;2. Thus, the dual engineering of inner multicomponent coordination environments and surface functional groups overcomes the activity&#8208;stability dilemma in the PEMWEs.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence of ZnS Under Easily Tailored Phase Transitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored phase transitions reveal key insights into the mechanoluminescent mechanisms of Mn/Cu&#8208;doped ZnS. A reversible wt&#8208;ZnS &#8596; sp&#8208;ZnS phase transition is achieved through low&#8208;pressure pressing and thermal annealing. Screw dislocation movement drives the phase transition and mediates enhanced mechanoluminescece in ZnS:Mn and suppressed emission in ZnS:Cu. This work provides a foundation for designing next&#8208;generation luminescent materials and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Mn/Cu&#8208;doped ZnS has emerged as a highly promising self&#8208;recoverable mechanoluminescent (ML) materials with significant potential in intelligent sensing, dynamic displays, and artificial intelligence. However, the exact ML mechanism remains elusive, and the energy transfer processes governed by complex interactions remain unknown. This study finds dislocation&#8208;mediated ML enhancement in ZnS:Mn and ML suppression in ZnS:Cu under easily tailored the phase transition. By precisely increasing uniaxial machine pressure (0&#8211;30&#160;MPa), the study achieves for the first time a gradual phase transition from hexagonal wurtzite (wt&#8208;ZnS) to cubic sphalerite (sp&#8208;ZnS) at room temperature, which can be reversibly tuned through thermal annealing. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy results show that screw dislocation slip under uniaxial pressure induces sp&#8208;ZnS stacking faults within the wt&#8208;ZnS lattice, with fault density dependent on pressure and dopant concentration. Spectroscopic analyses indicate that the phase transition enhances ML emission but suppresses photoluminescence (PL) in ZnS:Mn, reflecting distinct dislocation&#8208;mediated energy transfer behaviors in ML and PL processes. This work establishes a powerful strategy for controllable phase transition engineering to tailor and enhance the ML properties, provides fundamental insights into the ML mechanisms, and offers a practical design strategy for the development of advanced luminescent materials and optoelectronic devices.

A machine learning&#8208;guided strategy identifies 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an effective electrolyte additive for aqueous Zn batteries. By regulating interfacial kinetics and suppressing side reactions, DMAP enables uniform Zn deposition and exceptional cycling stability. This study offers a data&#8208;driven approach to interfacial engineering for durable and scalable aqueous energy storage systems.








Abstract
Dendritic growth and parasitic reactions severely hinder aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to interfacial instability and uncontrolled charge transfer. Here, a machine learning&#8208;accelerated strategy for rational additive screening, establishing a predictive framework that links the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to the adsorption and reduction behavior of Zn2+, is reported. An interpretable machine learning model (Adaptive Boosting), trained on a curated molecular dataset, achieves high accuracy (Mean Squared Error = 0.2977, Pearson Correlation Coefficient = 0.8032) in HOMO prediction. Guided by this model, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine is identified as a high&#8208;performance additive, which can suppress Zn dendrite formation by slowing interfacial charge transfer and mitigating local ion starvation through kinetic matching between mass transport and deposition. Moreover, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine effectively excludes interfacial H2O molecules, significantly inhibiting parasitic reactions. Consequently, Zn anode delivers high reversibility of plating/stripping with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.85% over 1600 cycles. The 0.3&#8208;Ah NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O|Zn pouch cell delivers stable cyclability for 70 days, with a capacity retention of 73% after 250 cycles. This work pioneers the integration of machine learning with interfacial electrochemistry, offering a generalizable approach for additive discovery and electrolyte design, and sets a new paradigm for achieving dendrite&#8208;free metallic anodes in aqueous systems.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Engineered Carbon Scaffold for Interface&#8208;First Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

An all&#8208;carbon&#8208;fiber symmetric architecture based on oxygen&#8208;doped carbon fibers enables dual&#8208;interface regulation, uniformly plating Na at the anode while anchoring and catalyzing polysulfides at the cathode, effectively eliminating dendrite formation and shuttle migration for long&#8208;life, high&#8208;rate room&#8208;temperature Na&#9472;S batteries.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#9472;S) batteries offer high theoretical energy density (1274&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and low&#8208;cost, abundant materials, making them promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, commercialization is hindered by multiple challenges: polysulfide shuttling and sluggish kinetics at the cathode, coupled with dendrite growth and interfacial failure at the anode. Here, an oxygen&#8208;doped carbon fiber (OCF) framework is designed and employed as a bifunctional host within a symmetric all&#8208;carbon&#8208;fiber cell architecture to simultaneously address these issues. The 3D porous OCF framework chemically anchors polysulfides, catalyzes their redox reactions, and guides uniform sodium nucleation/deposition. This synergy suppresses polysulfide shuttling and dendrite growth. Performance tests demonstrate an extremely low Na nucleation overpotential (27&#160;mV at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and stable, dendrite&#8208;free cycling exceeding 3600 h. In full Na&#9472;S cells, this design delivers a specific capacity of 753 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 C, retains &#8776;85% capacity after 2000 cycles at 0.5 C, and exhibits excellent rate performance (5 C). Mechanistic studies reveal OCF enhances Na&#8314; transport and interfacial kinetic stability. This work presents a generalizable, interface&#8208;first design paradigm for safe, long&#8208;lasting, low&#8208;cost Na&#9472;S batteries free from shuttling and dendrites.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloy/Intermetallic Compound Heterostructures for Efficient Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloy/intermetallic compound heterostructure with a bicontinuous nanoporous architecture as bifunctional electrocatalyst is constructed by a facile and scalable alloying/dealloying approach for hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted water electrolysis. It exhibits exceptional activities and durability by virtue of strain engineering of multicomponent intermetallic compound core, which enables high&#8208;entropy NiFeCoCuCrMn alloy surface with multiple active centres for *N2Hx intermediate spillover to lower kinetic barriers.








Abstract
Configuring integrative catalytic heterostructures is an efficient strategy to circumvent the universal linear scaling relationships for accelerating multiple&#8208;intermediate redox reactions. Here this study reports nonprecious metal&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy alloy/intermetallic compound heterostructure with a 3D nanoporous architecture as a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for hydrazine oxidation reaction. By making use of strain engineering of hexagonal close&#8208;packed multicomponent intermetallic compound core, high&#8208;entropy NiFeCoCuCrMn alloy surface is comprised of multiple active centers with undulatory adsorption energies, which enable *N2Hx intermediate spillover to adjust rate&#8208;determining step and lower kinetic barriers. As a consequence of nanoporous architecture endowing abundant multiple active surfaces, this heterostructure mediates hydrazine electrooxidation of as high as ampere&#8208;level current densities at &gt;0.08&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, showing genuine potential to replace sluggish oxygen evolution reaction for hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Its hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted water electrolyser delivers 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at ultralow cell voltage of 0.87&#160;V, and maintains exceptional stability for 1000 h.

         <dc:description>
Pd single&#8208;atoms doped Cu3P quantum dots effectively drive the novel multifunctional &#8220;formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate&#8221; galvanic system for wastes purification, electricity generation, and the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NH3, H2, and formate simultaneously, leveraging the green environment and promising clean energy for a sustainable future.








Abstract
Nitrate and formaldehyde, which are substantial wastes in industrial and agricultural effluents, pose significant hazards to the human health and ecosystem. Current purification technologies remain great challenges due to the unsatisfactory energy&#8208;intensive, time&#8208;consuming and noticeably costly reasons. Herein, a bifunctional electrocatalysts of Pd single&#8208;atoms doped Cu3P quantum dots (Pd&#8208;Cu3P SA&#8208;QDs) are reported to moderately optimize the H* sorption behaviors for accelerating the kinetics of nitrate reduction (NO3RR) and formaldehyde oxidation (FOR) reactions in a dual&#8208;directional way, thus realizing the high activity and selectivity for both cathodic ammonia (NH3) synthesis and anodic H2 production concurrently. Specifically, a very positive onset potential of +0.36 V (versus RHE) is recorded for NO3RR with a high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99 % for NH3 at &#8722;0.3V (versus RHE), while the FOR can be initialized at a very low onset potential of &#8722;0.07 V (versus RHE) with &gt; 90 % FE for formate and &gt; 95 % FE for H2 at 0.3 V (versus RHE). Notably, a self&#8208;powered galvanic system can be triggered by integrating the above two electrode&#8208;based reactions, thus exhibiting an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.892 V, a peak power density of 12.1 mW cm&#8722;2, and capable of generating 8.8 KWh kg&#8722;1 of electrical energy.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Ionic Liquid Structured Polymer Electrolytes with Multi&#8208;Channel Ion Transport Pathways for Wide&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the wide&#8208;temperature performance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries, a novel PEO&#8208;based electrolyte is developed. This electrolyte incorporates amino&#8208;functionalized MOF nanoparticles, encapsulated with ionic liquids (ILs) and dispersed within a PEO&#8208;filled electrospun membrane. The MOFs facilitate rapid Li+ interfacial hopping, while the encapsulated ILs improve bulk&#8208;phase transport. Together, these components establish a multi&#8208;channel conduction pathway ensuring both high Li+ conductivity and robust structural stability across a broad temperature range (&#8722;10 to 120&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) enhanced with ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, offering advantages in interfacial compatibility and processability. However, their application across a broad temperature range has been hindered by a fundamental trade&#8208;off between mechanical robustness and ionic conductivity. To overcome this limitation, the study designs an innovative poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based CPE architecture to decouple these properties. This architecture utilizes amino&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles to encapsulate and immobilize ILs within PEO&#8208;filled electrospun membranes, establishing stable multi&#8208;channel ion pathways across wide temperatures. Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that the functionalized MOF enables fast Li&#8314; hopping at interfaces, and the MOF&#8208;confined IL boosts bulk ion transport. This multi&#8208;path mechanism ensures high Li&#8314; conductivity and structural stability from &#8722;10 to 120&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the optimized CPE facilitates the formation of a LiF&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interphase and an inorganic&#8208;dominated cathode electrolyte interphase, significantly enhancing interfacial stability. Consequently, LiFePO4||Li cells exhibit excellent cyclability, retaining 96.8% capacity after 1000 cycles at 3 C, and demonstrate stable operation for over 400 cycles at both &#8722;10 and 120&#160;&#176;C. These results establish a novel strategy for decoupling the intrinsic compromise between mechanical and electrochemical performance in CPEs.

         <title>Polydopamine&#8208;Polyoxometalate Composites in Neutral pH Enable High&#8208;Efficiency and Ultra&#8208;Stable Organic Solar Cells via Mutual Doping Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine&#8208;polyoxometalate composites (PDA&#8208;PMA and PDA&#8208;PMA(N))&#160;enable ultrahigh doping densities through distinct pathways: PMA&#8208;initiated polymerization yields PDA&#8208;PMA with&#160;organic/inorganic mutual doping, while ammonia&#8208;neutralized PDA&#8208;PMA(N) shifts to&#160;organic&#8208;dominated doping&#160;via structural rearrangement. The neutral&#8208;pH PDA&#8208;PMA(N) eliminates energy barriers by enabling&#160;quantum tunneling, delivering&#160;OSCs with record 20.29% efficiency&#160;and&#160;exceptional stability, surpassing PEDOT:PSS.








Abstract
Heavy doping critically minimizes depletion region widths for efficient charge transport in organic solar cells (OSCs), yet systematic studies elucidating its underlying mechanisms remain scarce. To address this, two polydopamine&#8208;polyoxometalate composites (PDA&#8208;PMA and PDA&#8208;PMA(N)) are designed via innovative mutual doping pathways. PDA&#8208;PMA achieved ultrahigh doping density (1.17 &#215; 1023 cm&#8722;3) through H3[P(Mo3O10)4] (PMA) initiated oxidative polymerization of dopamine, where electron transfer simultaneously induced p&#8208;doped PDA and n&#8208;doped PMA. Remarkably, neutralization with ammonia yielded PDA&#8208;PMA(N), which retained even higher doping density (3.74 &#215; 1023 cm&#8722;3) via structural rearrangement&#8208;driven organic doping. XPS/ESR studies revealed distinct pathways: dual organic/inorganic doping in PDA&#8208;PMA versus organic&#8208;dominated doping in PDA&#8208;PMA(N). This deep doping compressed depletion region widths from 44.42&#160;nm in undoped controls (the blend of PDA and PMA) to 0.052&#160;nm (PDA&#8208;PMA(N)), surpassing PEDOT:PSS (0.238&#160;nm) and enabling barrier&#8208;free hole transport. Consequently, PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs with PDA&#8208;PMA and PDA&#8208;PMA(N) achieved exceptional power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 20.02% and 20.29%, respectively. Furthermore, the neutralized PDA&#8208;PMA(N) demonstrated superior stability (86.2% PCE retention after 1800&#160;h illumination) by suppressing interfacial corrosion. This work elucidates structure&#8208;dependent doping mechanisms and provides a universal strategy for developing high&#8208;performance hole transport layers through tailored doping, advancing OSC commercialization.

         <title>Size&#8208;Induced High Entropy Effect for Optimized Electrolyte Design of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A size&#8208;induced high&#8208;entropy effect has been demonstrated for electrolyte design. The proposed small&#8208;sized system exhibits higher entropy and increased configurational diversity, leading to smaller Li&#8314; solvation clusters and enhanced cluster mobility. As a result, Li&#8314; conductivity, the de&#8208;solvation process, and the interfacial layer configuration are optimized, endowing lithium&#8208;ion batteries with exceptional fast&#8208;charging/discharging capability and superior low&#8208;temperature performance.








Abstract
Electrolyte design is critical for high energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) but is struggling with the trade&#8208;offs between conductivity and stability. Increasing electrolyte entropy can improve the conductivity without compromising stability. A size&#8208;induced high entropy effect is identified for electrolyte design, which increases configurational entropy and is more pronounced than conventional number&#8208;induced high entropy effect. The developed size&#8208;induced high&#8208;entropy electrolyte (HEE) with small&#8208;sized esters exhibits enhanced configurational diversity and entropy, resulting in smaller Li+ solvation clusters, a lower freezing point (&#8722;96.6 &#176;C), threefold higher ionic conductivity at &#8722;60 &#176;C, improved wettability and facilitated Li+ de&#8208;solvation compared to conventional number&#8208;induced HEE. These advantages contribute to more uniform Li deposition and the formation of a robust and thin cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811). Consequently, Li || NCM811 employing the small&#8208;sized HEE (SHEE) demonstrates superior cycling stability for 2000 cycles at a decay rate of 0.0162%/cycle under 10 C, and an exceptional rate capability under ultralow temperatures, i.e., capacity retention of 84.3% at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. A 1.0 Ah graphite || NCM811 pouch cell further exhibits 97.7% capacity retention for 300 cycles. The size&#8208;induced high entropy design strategy of electrolyte promises practical operation of LIBs under extreme conditions.

         <title>Characterizing Emerging Detector Materials for Low&#8208;Dose X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 45, November 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray medical imaging requires detectors that deliver images at as low as reasonably possible dose. This perspective outlines a universal characterization framework of X&#8208;ray imaging detectors, suitable for both emerging semiconductor and scintillator materials, introduces a novel unified figure of merit that links dose with resolution, and offers an open&#8208;access calculator, enabling fair benchmarking of detector prototypes at early technology&#8208;readiness levels.








Abstract
Modern clinical diagnostics significantly rely on X&#8208;ray medical imaging detectors, which play a key role in obtaining high&#8208;quality images while ensuring patient radiation exposure adheres to the &#8220;as low as reasonably achievable&#8221; principle. The last decade has seen a renewed exploration of promising materials for X&#8208;ray detection, foremost focusing on lead&#8208;based perovskites and other metal halides as direct&#8208;conversion semiconductors and scintillators. However, the reported performance characteristics, particularly X&#8208;ray sensitivity and the limit of dose rate detection, are often incomplete or misleading for assessing the practical utility of materials. This perspective surveys various approaches to the X&#8208;ray detector characterization of emerging materials, specifically focusing on Detective Quantum Efficiency within the context of low&#8208;dose medical imaging applications. Guidelines are provided for choosing, estimating, and presenting the relevant figures of merit, encompassing Detection Efficiency, Noise Equivalent Dose, response time, and spatial resolution, accompanied by ready&#8208;to&#8208;use computational tools, including a MATLAB application, a Mathcad worksheet, and an interactive website.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern clinical diagnostics significantly rely on X-ray medical imaging detectors, which play a key role in obtaining high-quality images while ensuring patient radiation exposure adheres to the &#8220;as low as reasonably achievable&#8221; principle. The last decade has seen a renewed exploration of promising materials for X-ray detection, foremost focusing on lead-based perovskites and other metal halides as direct-conversion semiconductors and scintillators. However, the reported performance characteristics, particularly X-ray sensitivity and the limit of dose rate detection, are often incomplete or misleading for assessing the practical utility of materials. This perspective surveys various approaches to the X-ray detector characterization of emerging materials, specifically focusing on Detective Quantum Efficiency within the context of low-dose medical imaging applications. Guidelines are provided for choosing, estimating, and presenting the relevant figures of merit, encompassing Detection Efficiency, Noise Equivalent Dose, response time, and spatial resolution, accompanied by ready-to-use computational tools, including a MATLAB application, a Mathcad worksheet, and an interactive website.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;In their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202507057"&gt;10.1002/adma.202507057&lt;/a&gt;), Dong-Gyun Kim, Jeong Jae Wie, Yong Seok Kim, and co-workers report the first closed-loop and sustainable 4D printing of sulfur-rich polymers and their magnetic particle composites. 3D-printed structures exhibit shape-morphing and reprinting capabilities, and can be modularly assembled. Notably, magneto-responsive soft robots demonstrate obstacle climbing, cargo release, and on-demand catalyst releasing for chemical synthesis.

Balancing CT and LE for Dual&#8208;Function Emitters
Synergistic control of charge transfer (CT) and locally excited (LE) characters enables a molecular design that unites thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA). This approach simultaneously advances OLED efficiency and opens avenues for high&#8208;performance bioimaging.

         <title>Interface Engineering and Optimization Strategies for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries Based on Polymer Composite Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the interface challenges of composite polymer electrolytes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries are delved into, innovative improvement strategies are explored, and their future industrialization is envisioned. By offering comprehensive insights, it serves as a valuable reference for researchers and engineers in the energy storage domain.








Abstract
Polymer composite electrolytes (PCEs) offer significant advantages in enhancing the safety, stability, and energy density of batteries, making them a crucial component for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage systems. However, one of the primary bottlenecks in improving the performance of PCEs lies in the interface challenge, which can be exacerbated and manifested in interface instability, side reactions, and poor interface compatibility, ultimately leading to a significant decline in ion conduction efficiency and overall battery performance of high&#8208;voltage or high&#8208;energy&#8208;density systems. Therefore, systematically analyzing the critical technical narrowing and proposing targeted solutions under high&#8208;energy&#8208;density conditions is of great significance for advancing the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. Although existing strategies have shown promising results, their applicability in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries remains uncertain. In this work, a comprehensive analysis of the interface challenges associated with high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer batteries is performed, the feasibility of existing approaches is evaluated, and practical optimization strategies are proposed to address these critical issues. Moreover, the insights presented here provide valuable guidance for the industrial&#8208;scale production of PCEs, helping to bridge the gap between laboratory innovations and practical applications.

         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the design and development of self&#8208;healing materials mediated by host&#8211;guest (HG) interactions, with particular emphasis on cyclodextrins (CDs). Furthermore, this review highlights cutting&#8208;edge applications of &#946;CD&#8208;based self&#8208;healing materials in sensors, 3D printing, tissue engineering, anti&#8208;corrosion coating, shape memory devices, and composites, demonstrating their adaptability to modern technological demands.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;healing (SH) materials have gained considerable attention for their ability to autonomously repair damage, thereby improving the longevity and performance of various systems. This review focuses on the design and development of SH materials mediated by host&#8211;guest (HG) interactions, with particular emphasis on cyclodextrins (CDs). Owing to their biocompatibility and excellent inclusion complexation capabilities, CDs&#8212;especially &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;CD)&#8212;play a key role in constructing HG&#8208;based SH systems. Recent progress in &#946;CD&#8208;based SH hydrogels for biomedical applications such as drug delivery, wound healing, and tissue engineering is discussed. In addition to healthcare, their application in smart coatings&#8212;including anti&#8208;fogging, fresh&#8208;keeping, and anti&#8208;corrosion layers&#8212;is reviewed. These materials are also integrated into sensors, demonstrating adaptability for real&#8208;time environmental and physiological monitoring. Emerging strategies involving 3D printing and shape memory functionalities further broaden their design potential. Despite these advances, challenges remain&#8212;particularly in scalability, environmental sensitivity, and achieving a balance between mechanical strength and healing efficiency. This review critically examines these limitations and highlights future directions, emphasizing the need for innovative fabrication approaches and interdisciplinary collaboration. By leveraging the unique properties of supramolecular interactions, &#946;CD&#8208;based SH materials offer promising solutions for a wide range of biomedical, industrial, and environmental applications.

         <title>Failure Mechanisms and Practical Optimizations for Ah&#8208;Scale Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, a comparative dissection of coin cells versus pouch cells is systematically conducted, identifying key challenges when scale&#8208;up. Furthermore, the multiscale failure mechanisms in pouch cells are deeply analyzed. Based on these insights, the practicality&#8208;oriented strategies are proposed to address the practical demands of Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are emerging as a key technology for the safe, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. While the research on coin cells has achieved significant advancements, the failure mechanisms and design strategies of pouch cells that hold great practical potentiality, remain relatively underexplored. This review aims to fill this gap via providing an in&#8208;depth exploration of the failure mechanisms and practical optimizations of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion pouch cells. A comparative analysis between coin cells and pouch cells is conducted in terms of the research status, bridging principles, and configuration&#8208;specific distinctions. Further interpretation of failure mechanisms at both electrodes and device is systematically discussed; these include the instability associated with cathode and anode, and the device&#8208;scale failures such as current collector and binder degradation, interfacial mismatch, and packaging&#8208;induced defects. The practicality&#8208;oriented strategies for Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells are further proposed. The final section advocates that future research should emphasize high&#8208;loading and large&#8208;area design, enhancement of kinetic performance, and tolerance to extreme operating conditions. This review contributes the theoretical insight and practical guidance to Ah&#8208;scale aqueous zinc&#8208;ion pouch cell technologies, which are expected to promote their application in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems.

         <title>A Ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Bottle Strategy: Crosslinking Amines and Epoxides inside MOF Pores for Enhanced CO2 Capture Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; strategy is used to grow oligomers inside of a MOF by crosslinking alkylamines with epoxides within the pores of Cr&#8208;BDC. When tested in postcombustion carbon capture applications, the composites show excellent performance with high CO2 adsorption capacity, exceptional CO2/N2 selectivity, and enhanced stability over 100 adsorption/desorption cycles. The crosslinking strategy effectively prevents amine leaching and degradation, making the composites more stable than the MOF containing non&#8208;crosslinked alkylamines amines.








Abstract
This study introduces a &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; technique to impregnate porous supports with amines via a straightforward in situ polymerization process. Specifically, alkylamines&#8212;tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TAEA) and tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA)&#8212;are crosslinked with epoxides&#8212;trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether (TMPTE) and 1,3&#8208;butadiene diepoxide (BDE)&#8212;within the pores of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) Cr&#8208;BDC (also MIL&#8208;101(Cr), where BDC = 1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate), producing four distinct MOF&#8208;polymer composites. These composites are subsequently evaluated for their efficacy in postcombustion carbon capture, examining metrics such as CO2 capacity, CO2/N2 selectivity, isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption, kinetic breakthrough times, and cyclability. Among the composites, Cr&#8208;BDC&#8208;TAEA&#8208;BDE (branched&#8208;linear) demonstrates the most promising results, achieving a CO2 capacity of 2.2&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 0.15&#160;bar and 313 K, a CO2/N2 selectivity of 301, and an isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption of &#8722;110&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1. This composite also exhibits superior breakthrough performance, with N2/CO2 separation times of 103 and 143 min per gram under dry and humid conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the four MOF&#8208;polymer composites are subjected to up to 100 temperature swing adsorption/desorption&#160;cycles (at 313 and 393 K, respectively), revealing minimal amine leaching or degradation over time. Notably, the composites also show significantly enhanced cyclability compared to Cr&#8208;BDC impregnated with amines without epoxide crosslinking agents; this indicates that crosslinking inhibits amine leaching.

         <title>A Generalizable Fluorescence Sensor Platform for Sample Preparation&#8208;Free Protein Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular fluorescence sensor platform enables single&#8208;step, sample preparation&#8208;free detection of protein analytes in complex samples. The design uses HaloTag to tether a fluorogenic dye to a nanobody, where target binding promotes dye activation and fluorescence. This generalizable system achieves picomolar sensitivity across diverse targets and offers a simple, plug&#8208;and&#8208;play format for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.








Abstract
Modern molecular detection assays such as enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) offer excellent sensitivity and specificity, but typically require multiple reagents and extensive sample preparation, limiting their usefulness as rapid diagnostics. A generalizable biosensor platform is introduced that enables single&#8208;step, sample preparation&#8208;free detection of protein analytes with high sensitivity in complex samples. The NanoFluor system employs Janelia Fluor dyes coupled to a nanobody via HaloTag conjugation with a flexible glycine&#8208;serine linker, where the dye undergoes a switch from a non&#8208;fluorescent to a fluorescent state when the coupled nanobody binds to its target. It is demonstrated that the NanoFluor design achieves detection limits as low as picomolar concentrations across diverse protein targets. Molecular dynamics simulations, coupled with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics computational models, reveal the mechanistic basis for the fluorescence change, and demonstrate the feasibility of multiplexed detection in complex samples including undiluted serum. This versatile, simple biosensor design can prove valuable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics and other molecular detection applications.

         <dc:description>
Robust hydrogel sensors have been constructed using covalent organic frameworks and polyacrylamide; the intermolecular mechanical interlocking promotes energy dissipation and ion transport, resulting in superior strength, high toughness, and high ionic conductivity, holding great promise for non&#8208;invasive health monitoring.








Abstract
The compromise of tensile strength and toughness is essential for conductive hydrogels to enhance their cycling stability and mechanical durability in wearable strain sensors. It is effective but challenging to balance energy dissipation. Herein, a new strategy based on the intermolecular mechanical interlocking of the hydrogels has been proposed for improving their tensile strength and toughness. The hydrogels are readily fabricated through non&#8208;covalently threading linear polymer chains into covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The mechanical interlocking between polyacrylamide and COFs significantly promotes the energy dissipation with synchronous increment of ion transport, which endows hydrogels with superior mechanical performance and high conductivity. The tensile strength, toughness, and ionic conductivity are as high as 0.19 &#177; 0.03 MPa, 2.11 &#177; 0.33 MJ m&#8722;3 and 2.30 &#177; 0.55 S m&#8722;1, respectively, which greatly surpass those in the polyacrylamide counterpart and rank the top in the reported hydrogels. The resultant hydrogel sensor achieves a fast strain response of 4.8 ms and high cyclic stability over 100 cycles, and could non&#8208;invasively monitor human health. This work provides one promising approach to the construction of robust hydrogels based on COFs for the development of advanced wearable sensors.

Tunable nucleation growth of large&#8208;area monolayer p&#8208;type semiconductor films is achieved by controlling the precursor evaporation area via atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition. The device array fabricated with as&#8208;grown monolayer film exhibits high electrical performance of 48&#160;&#177;&#160;16&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 mobilities and &#8776;108 on/off ratio, exhibiting competitive electrical performance compared with most of the reported TMDC&#8208;based transistors.








Abstract
2D semiconductors open new avenues in the post&#8208;Moore era for semiconductor technologies immune from the short&#8208;channel effect due to their atomic&#8208;scale thicknesses and dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces. However, it still remains a big challenge to obtain large&#8208;area and high&#8208;quality monolayer p&#8208;type semiconductors so far. Herein, a controlled nucleation is realized by tuning the evaporation areas of Se precursors during the p&#8208;type WSe2 growth. By optimizing the nucleation density, centimeter&#8208;scale uniform monolayer WSe2 and Nb&#8208;incorporated WSe2 films are synthesized. The field effect transistor array based on WSe2 film exhibits p&#8208;type behavior with hole mobilities of 34&#160;&#177;&#160;17&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 and an average on/off ratio of 4&#160;&#215;&#160;107, which can be further improved by Nb incorporation with much higher hole mobility of 48&#160;&#177;&#160;16&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 with an average on/off ratio of &#8776;108. The work paves the way for synthesizing large&#8208;scale uniform 2D p&#8208;type semiconductors for electrical devices and integrated circuits.

         <title>Nonlinear Optical Response in Layer&#8208;Stacked Gallenene with Ferroelectric Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metals are utilized in applications ranging from soft robotics to conductive inks, owing to their physical properties providing distinct mechanical, electrical, and thermal advantages. This work uses classical material science techniques to characterize ferroelectric polarization in supercooled liquid gallium and utilizes second harmonic generation imaging for further perturbation analysis.








Abstract
Polar metals are very rare and challenging to realize due to the incompatibility of ferroelectricity and metallicity. Mobile electrons in polar metals effectively screen the static electric field and dipoles. Recent studies show that 2D van der Waals metals without an inversion center can have polar order due to specific layer stacking. However, room temperature reversible ferroelectricity and nonlinear second harmonic generation in non&#8208;centrosymmetric polar metals remain unrealized. Here, the experimental realization of AB&#8208;stacked gallenene (a100) nanocrystals with a room temperature ferroelectric polarization in a liquid gallium environment is reported. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, the origin of spontaneous polarization (Ps) due to a broken symmetry in multilayer gallenene structures, resulting in P1 (space group) and C1 (point group) symmetry is explained. The reversible polarization switching is characterized using piezoresponse force microscopy. This results demonstrate the reversible nonlinear optical response of the AB&#8208;stacked gallenene crystal through second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. The intensities of SHG signals are controlled via angular rotations and thermal heating, which indicate a phase transition at high temperatures. Furthermore, electrical perturbation enables the tunability of SHG intensity. Bipolar resistive switching is demonstrated in a two&#8208;terminal device. These findings open avenues for advancements in 2D ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and topological superconductivity.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Forbidden Rectification via Dynamic Phase Transitions in the Weyl Metallic State of ZrTe5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite preserving inversion symmetry, ZrTe5 exhibits rectification and high harmonic generation through a current&#8208;driven dynamic phase transition. This symmetry&#8208;breaking bifurcation enables forbidden nonlinear responses, unveiling a new regime of topological transport. The work establishes ZrTe5 as a benchmark platform for studying nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, with broad implications for terahertz technologies, energy harvesting, and next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Weyl metals, known for their topological structure and chiral anomaly, exhibit nonlinear transport that defies conventional theory. In this study, ZrTe5, an inversion&#8208;symmetric Dirac semimetal tunable to a Weyl state by magnetic field, is investigated, and rectification (alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) conversion) and third harmonic generation in longitudinal configurations is revealed. Despite its bulk inversion symmetry, symmetry&#8208;forbidden rectification and a dynamic phase transition arising from the chiral anomaly are observed. Rectification shows threshold behavior at a critical current density (&#119869;&#119888;) and temperature (&#119879;* &#8776; 30 K), while third&#8208;harmonic generation remains threshold&#8208;free. In transverse setups, even harmonics up to sixth order and a DC response, also symmetry&#8208;forbidden and threshold&#8208;sensitive, are detected. These results highlight the role of topology and dynamic symmetry breaking in enabling nonlinear responses and establish ZrTe5 as a model for terahertz and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Driven 3D Open Fluidic Networks for Versatile Continuous Flow Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capillary&#8208;driven 3D open fluidic networks (OFNs), composed of connected polyhedral frames, enable precise, programmable, and versatile manipulation of unary, binary, and multiple continuous flows in both spatial and temporal dimensions. OFNs represent a significant leap beyond conventional microfluidics, unlocking new possibilities for selective metallization, programmable mixing, spatiotemporal control of multi&#8208;step reactions, and enhanced mass and heat transfer.








Abstract
Human civilization hinges on the capability to manipulate continuous flows. However, continuous flows are often regulated in closed&#8208;pipe configurations to address their instability, isolating the flows from the environment and considerably restricting their functionality. Manipulating continuous flows in open systems remains challenging. Here, capillary&#8208;driven 3D open fluidic networks (OFNs) composed of connected polyhedral frames are reported. Each frame acts as a fluid chamber with free interfaces that enable fluid entry and exit; the connecting rods function as valves, allowing precise control over the direction, velocity, and path of the flow. The OFNs seamlessly adapt to various fluid systems, enabling precise 3D manipulation of multiple flows. Leveraging these distinctive features, a series of applications, including selective metallization, programmable mixing and diagnostics, and spatiotemporal control of multi&#8208;step reactions, are achieved. The OFNs&#8217; free fluid interfaces also facilitate controlled drug release and efficient heat exchange. These versatile OFNs will significantly advance technological innovations in engineering, microfluidics, interfacial chemistry, and biomedicine.

OFNs represent a significant leap beyond conventional microfluidics, unlocking new possibilities for selective metallization, programmable mixing, spatiotemporal control of multi-step reactions, and enhanced mass and heat transfer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human civilization hinges on the capability to manipulate continuous flows. However, continuous flows are often regulated in closed-pipe configurations to address their instability, isolating the flows from the environment and considerably restricting their functionality. Manipulating continuous flows in open systems remains challenging. Here, capillary-driven 3D open fluidic networks (OFNs) composed of connected polyhedral frames are reported. Each frame acts as a fluid chamber with free interfaces that enable fluid entry and exit; the connecting rods function as valves, allowing precise control over the direction, velocity, and path of the flow. The OFNs seamlessly adapt to various fluid systems, enabling precise 3D manipulation of multiple flows. Leveraging these distinctive features, a series of applications, including selective metallization, programmable mixing and diagnostics, and spatiotemporal control of multi-step reactions, are achieved. The OFNs&#8217; free fluid interfaces also facilitate controlled drug release and efficient heat exchange. These versatile OFNs will significantly advance technological innovations in engineering, microfluidics, interfacial chemistry, and biomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploiting Brownian Motion of Plasmonic Nanoparticles Using Optical Printing Approach for on&#8208;Demand Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stochastic&#8208;to&#8208;deterministic transformation of the optical printing approach is exploited as a robust and physically grounded entropy source for on&#8208;demand physical unclonable function (PUF) fabrication at mesoscopic scales. The designed ternary PUF consisting of as few as 25 gold nanoparticles provides ample security and high encoding density, demonstrating its feasibility for integration into microelectronic systems.








Abstract
An on&#8208;demand fabrication method for additive physical unclonable functions (PUFs), a hardware&#8208;based security primitive, is inevitably required, especially considering increasingly miniaturized microelectronic devices. An optical printing approach is regarded as an alternative method to fabricate functional nano/microscale patterns against conventional methods due to its superior fabrication flexibility. However, owing to the Brownian motion of nanoparticles, achieving highly precise and selective printing persists an ongoing obstacle for the applicability of optical printing methods. Here, it is shown that the optical printing approach possesses plenty of room to fabricate on&#8208;demand PUFs by exploiting the obstacle from the perspective of randomness. To demonstrate this, an optical PUF based on a mesoscopic lattice pattern consisting of optically printed gold nanoparticles is proposed. Comprehensive analyses on physical features occurring naturally and multi&#8208;modal keys generated from them reveal that both exhibit randomness. Through a ternary bit system and key integration approach, the capability of the physical unclonable function using as few as 25 nanoparticles can be ensured in terms of the amount of information, complexity, uniqueness, and encoding capacity. The versatility of optical printing regarding the usability of a broad range of substrates and the ability to create arbitrary patterns with tunable dimensions are also shown.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Regulated Interface Chemistry Enables Depolarization for Ultra&#8208;High Capacity LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4) forms interfacial atomic&#8208;scale adsorption bonding with the highly delithiated LiCoO2 surface during electrochemical processes, enabling in situ HF/H2O scavenging, and constructing a cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) rich in Si&#8208;based components and polymers with enhanced Li+ conductivity. Consequently, the CEI's depolarization effect allows the LiCoO2 cathode to achieve a ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 220 mA h g&#8722;1 at 4.55 V.








Abstract
Unlocking the capacity potential of mainstream LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode materials for stable cycling at a high upper cut&#8208;off voltage is undoubtedly one of the most economical approaches to achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, significant polarization issues induced by interfacial and interphase degradation during high&#8208;voltage cycling remain well known. This study demonstrates the efficient depolarization effects of cyclic organosiloxane additive 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4) at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface, facilitating interfacial charge transfer and enhancing the capacity of LCO||Li cells to 220&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 even at 4.55&#160;V (vs Li/Li+). Specifically, V4D4 tends to adsorb onto the surface of highly delithiated LCO cathodes, and its preferential oxidation intermediates help stabilize lattice oxygen, eliminate harmful HF/H2O, and form an ultrathin cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) that reduces interface resistance to Li+ diffusion and stabilizes the surface structure. Additionally, with the assistance of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), long&#8208;term cycling produces a homogeneous, chemo&#8208;mechanically stable CEI enriched in organic silicon&#8208;containing compounds and LiF. This CEI suppresses excessive bulk electrolyte decomposition, reinforces the reversibility of the significantly enhanced O3&#8212;H1&#8208;3 phase transition, and enables capacity retention of &#8776;97% after 200 cycles.

2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs (dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based TPE&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF) with Kagome (kgm) topology are synthesized using imine&#8208;linked dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based COF (DBC&#8208;Imine&#8208;COF) as the template. DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits an impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 172.93&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in water, especially 105.30 and 80.04&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 3 wt.% saltwater and natural seawater, respectively.

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have emerged as prominent photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, the exquisite design of linkage and topological structures is crucial for efficient charge generation, separation, and transfer in the planar periodic framework. Here, an imine&#8208;linked dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based COF (DBC&#8208;Imine&#8208;COF) is presented as a template for topology&#8208;templated synthesis of two 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs (dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based TPE&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF) with Kagome lattice to boost photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The fully conjugated DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF is highly luminescent and exhibits topology&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;electron transmission and charge carrier mobility. Significantly, DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits an impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 172.93&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and excellent reusability in the presence of 0.8 wt.% Pt under light irradiation, with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 14.9% at 420&#160;nm. More importantly, DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF demonstrates a hydrogen evolution rate of 105.30 and 80.04&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 3 wt.% saltwater and natural seawater, respectively, highlighting its potential in real&#8208;world scenarios. DFT calculations and various spectroscopic analyses reveal that the highly coplanar structure of DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF strengthens donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, facilitating charge generation and separation. In summary, this work provides an effective strategy to construct highly planar and full &#960;&#8208;conjugated dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COF as a promising platform for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

Abstract
Electrical manipulation of magnetism in 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet (FM) holds promise for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. Investigating field&#8208;free, ultrafast switching at room temperature in wafer&#8208;scalable vdW heterostructures can advance the development of faster memories and enhance the understanding of magnetization switching mechanisms in 2D FMs. In this study, field&#8208;free, room temperature spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) switching at subnanosecond timescales in a wafer&#8208;scalable Fe3GaTe2/Pt heterostructure by epitaxial growth engineering is demonstrated. The introduction of a variable concentration gradient of Fe is used to establish the coexistence of in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) within the ferromagnetic layer. The field&#8208;free switching, driven by the SOT from Pt, is achieved by using the IMA component to break the in&#8208;plane symmetry during the switching process. This work paves the way for the integration of efficient 2D vdW materials in advanced spintronic devices and faster memory technologies.

         <title>Ionoelastomer Synapses With Configurable Synaptic Plasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic heterostructures of polycationic chains and anions and semiconducting polymers form artificial synapses that update their synaptic weights via anion redistribution under electrical stimulation. Memory effects depend on anion species, enabling synaptic plasticity modulation. Continuously programmable nonvolatile conductance states are utilized to emulate a neural network, achieving handwritten digit and fashion image recognitions with high accuracies by using only 16 discrete device states.








Abstract
An organic heterostructure, composed of an ionoelastomer that comprises polycationic chains and mobile anions, and a semiconducting polymer, forms a new class of artificial synapses. These ionoelastomer synapses update their synaptic weights by modifying device conductance through the spatial redistribution of anions in response to electrical stimuli. The memory effect of these synapses is highly dependent on the specific anion species present, providing a unique means to modulate synaptic plasticity simply through anion selection. The continuously programmable and nonvolatile states of the selected ionoelastomer synapse are harnessed to emulate a soft neural network and perform the handwritten digit and fashion image recognition tasks, which achieve high recognition accuracies comparable to ideal numeric model but only using 16 discrete device states.

Schematic illustration of MBSLS design and its application in spinal cord injury (SCI) treatment.








Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) repair represents an immense challenge globally. Despite various beneficial strategies having been attempted for SCI repair, the ideal therapy has not yet been achieved. In this study, a multidimensional biomimetic spinal cord&#8208;like scaffold (MBSLS) is designed with a hierarchical structure and embryonic neurogenetic microenvironment and neural regeneration in SCI repair. MBSLS successfully regulated the neural differentiation of loaded neural stem cells (NSCs) and regenerated spinal cord&#8208;like tissue in vitro by promoting neurogenesis, gliogenesis, axonogenesis, axon ensheathment, synapse organization, and calcium homeostasis. Moreover, the NSC&#8208;loaded scaffold achieves exceptional SCI repair through highly efficient axonal regeneration and neural circuit reconstruction, which significantly improves the recovery of motor function, sensory function, and autonomic function in vivo. Importantly, the MBSLS scaffold achieves seamless integration with the host spinal cord in only 5 min, allowing early cell infiltration and repair. Finally, the feasibility of the minimally invasive implantation of human&#8208;sized MBSLS in a pig SCI model is confirmed, demonstrating its potential and prospects for clinical translation to treat SCI.

         <title>Double Heterostructures for Monolayer Materials with Record Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a lateral double&#8208;heterostructure leveraging type&#8208;I band alignment in a double&#8208;gate design, where carriers transport through a wide indirect&#8208;bandgap WSe2 multilayer and are confined in a narrow direct&#8208;bandgap MoTe2 monolayer for efficient emission. The device achieves record 1% external quantum efficiency among TMDC p&#8208;n junctions and 24&#8208;fold power efficiency that of single MoTe2 counterpart, enabling silicon&#8208;integrated light sources.








Abstract
2D semiconductor materials have shown great potential and advantages for a wide variety of optoelectronic devices, especially compact and integrated light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers. However, the lack of a type&#8208;I double&#8208;heterostructure has severely hindered the development of efficient LEDs and lasers based on 2D materials. In this article, a lateral double&#8208;heterostructure is proposed based on a single type&#8208;I heterostructure composed of multilayer WSe2 and monolayer MoTe2 with double back&#8208;gates. This design synergizes the high mobility of the multilayer and the direct bandgap of the monolayer: carrier injection and transport are facilitated in the WSe2 barrier layer, while they are transferred and confined in the MoTe2 well layer for efficient radiative recombination through type&#8208;I band alignment. Therefore, the double&#8208;heterostructure reaches an external quantum efficiency of 1% level, a new record for p&#8208;n junctions based on transition metal dichalcogenides. Additionally, the heterostructure device achieves a 40&#8208;fold enhancement of the maximum electroluminescent intensity and a 24&#8208;fold enhancement of power efficiency compared with the single monolayer MoTe2 counterpart at room temperature. This promising strategy can also be extended to other 2D&#8208;semiconductor LEDs and could bring 2D&#8208;materials devices into practical applications of micro&#8208;LED displays, electrically injected 2D&#8208;materials lasers, and silicon&#8208;based on&#8208;chip light sources.

This study presents an Ir1@FA@MOFs nanocomposite that exploits copper&#8208;coordination and glutathione reduction to trigger an in situ Type II&#8208;to&#8208;Type I photodynamic switch, effectively alleviating tumor hypoxia while simultaneously inducing cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and PANoptosis, thereby potentiating immunogenic cell death for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract
The clinical translation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces dual challenges of tumor hypoxia and antioxidant defense mechanisms. To address these limitations, herein tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;adaptive nanoparticles are rationally designed that enable oxygen&#8208;independent PDT while reprogramming immunosuppressive TME. An Ir(III) complex (Ir1) is engineered to achieve copper&#8208;mediated and glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activated switching of photodynamic modes from oxygen&#8208;dependent Type II to hypoxia&#8208;tolerant Type I PDT via coordination&#8208;induced modulation of electron transfer. This dynamic photosensitizer is precisely integrated into folate receptor&#8208;targeted azomidazole&#8208;bridged Cu(II)&#8208;MOFs, creating an &#8220;AND logic&#8221; responsive nanoplatform (Ir1@FA@MOFs) that simultaneously depletes GSH and generates hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8210;) under light irradiation. Mechanistic studies reveal that Ir1@FA@MOFs orchestrate multimodal cell death induction including cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and PANoptosis through mitochondrial damage. In 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice, Ir1@FA@MOFs demonstrate high tumor growth inhibition while converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors to immunogenic hotspots. The work pioneers a TME&#8208;responsive photodynamic modality switching strategy that overcomes traditional PDT limitations through metal&#8208;coordination and GSH&#8208;activating immunogenic death programming, offering new dimensions for precision photo&#8208;immunotherapy.

The work pioneers a TME-responsive photodynamic modality switching strategy that overcomes traditional PDT limitations through metal-coordination and GSH-activating immunogenic death programming, offering new dimensions for precision photo-immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Containing Bilayer Polymers With Programmable Wrinkling Dynamics Coherent With Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilayer polymers comprising lanthanide&#8208;coordinated skins and polyurethane substrates exhibit programmable wrinkling dynamics during relaxation. The evolving surface topography modulates visible light, enabling transitions among scattering, iridescence, and transparency. Independently, the metallopolymer layer emits multicolor luminescence under UV light. These features offer a durable, rewritable, dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with high adaptability and spatiotemporal control.








Abstract
A family of lanthanide metallopolymer/polyurethane bilayer polymers exhibiting multicolor luminescence and tunable wrinkling behavior are engineered to combat escalating challenges in information forgery and data leakage. These architectures are fabricated by spin&#8208;coating a lanthanide&#8208;coordinated metallopolymer skin layer onto a polyurethane substrate, facilitating strained&#8208;induced topographical transformations through a tensile&#8208;release process. During dynamic relaxation, the emergent wrinkled topographies modulate optical diffraction, yielding three distinct states: diffuse scattering (frosted glass effect), constructive interference (iridescent rainbow effect), and optical transparency. The metallopolymer skin layer demonstrates high&#8208;efficiency luminescence with broad&#8208;spectrum chromatic emission, while the polyurethane substrate confers exceptional mechanical robustness, optical transparency, and intrinsic self&#8208;healing properties. Consequently, a dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform integrating luminescence and structural coloration is realized, offering facile activation, immediate visual verification, and enhanced durability with recyclability. These multifunctional materials exhibit superior performance metrics in encryption and hierarchical anti&#8208;counterfeiting paradigms, surpassing contemporary security technologies in adaptability and functional sophistication.

         <title>Modulating Interfacial Solvent Aggregation Chemistry to Enable Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries is hindered by solvent aggregation in the inner Helmholtz plane, leading to sluggish Na+ diffusion. This study reveals that a free&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, in which polarization interactions induced by orbital overlap between solvent molecules and free radicals, disrupts solvent alignment. This strategy enhances cycling stability, maintaining performance at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C for 2400 cycles.








Abstract
The capability of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) to operate under extreme temperatures is highly desirable; however, achieving stable performance remains challenging due to limitations in interfacial dynamics. Here, it is revealed that at low temperatures, linear solvents tend to aggregate within the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), leading to the formation of a solvent&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) with sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics. To address this issue, it is proposed to leverage the polarization interaction induced by the orbital overlap between the solvent molecules and free radicals as an effective approach to breaking solvent aggregation. This interaction leads to a redistribution of electron density, reducing the electron cloud density and lowering molecular polarity. Significantly, the reduced polarity weakens intermolecular ordering, promoting interfacial restructuring that enhances mass transfer and facilitates the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Herein, trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTF) is identified as an optimal electric double&#8208;layer regulator, which generates radicals in situ and interacts with the solvent to reconstruct the IHP layer. Consequently, commercial hard carbon paired with the TMSOTF&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits superior cycling stability, achieving a lifespan over 2400 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, whereas the conventional electrolyte fails to sustain cycling. This study provides critical insights into interfacial design strategy for advancing low&#8208;temperature battery technologies.

         <title>Off&#8208;the&#8208;Shelf Granular Microtissue Bioinks: Long&#8208;Term Preserved Cellularized Porous Microgels with Enhanced Cell Activity for Shelf&#8208;Ready Biofabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces long&#8208;term preserved cellularized porous microgels that 1) achieve a considerably long preservation duration (up to 14&#160;months); 2) enable better cell and tissue growth due to the presence of internal interfaces; and 3) allow for injectable and 3D bioprinting use as a novel granular bioink. It advances the form of bioinks and represents a future trend of tissue engineering toward ready&#8208;to&#8208;use products.








Abstract
Off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf cellularized products greatly advance the therapeutic practice for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, it remains a challenge to achieve long&#8208;term preservation and superior biological outcomes. Here, the cryo&#8208;gelation methodology is optimized to develop a cellularized porous microgel platform that allows for long&#8208;term cryopreservation on the shelf (up to 14&#160;months) and favors tissue growth due to the presented subvoxel interfaces. The modular granular microtissues serve as an injectable formulation for non&#8208;invasive therapy and innovative printable bioinks for precise biofabrication, free of on&#8208;site operations on cell isolation and preparation. The internal biomaterial interfaces down to the microtissue building blocks significantly enhance cell growth and function, compared to the conventional bulk counterpart. The ready&#8208;to&#8208;use potential of months&#8208;preserved hMSC&#8208;laden modules is demonstrated through subcutaneous injection and critical&#8208;sized skull defect repair in rats, which confirms the benefits of subvoxel interfaces for tissue regeneration. These off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf granular cellularized blocks enable highly accessible and on&#8208;demand use in cell&#8208;based regenerative medicine.

         <title>Host Cell Membrane&#8208;Cloaked Nanomedicine Reprograms Endothelial Surface for Enhanced Patency in Allogeneic Vascular Grafts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed a host red blood cell membrane&#8208;cloaked nanomedicine loaded with a TGF&#8208;&#946; signaling inhibitor for metabolically&#8208;guided cell surface reprogramming to enhance the patency of allogeneic vascular grafts via the synergistic combination of localized steric immune shielding and in situ therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
The endothelium serves as the first point of contact following the implantation of allogeneic vascular grafts (AGs) or organs. Rapid endothelial injury triggered by immunocytotoxicity, combined with subsequent endothelial dysfunction during vascular tissue remodeling, collectively exacerbates complications, including thrombosis, inflammation, and intimal hyperplasia, ultimately leading to graft failure. In this study, a nanomedicine, R&#8208;SB@PLGA, is developed for use in metabolically guided cell surface reprogramming (CSR) in AGs. R&#8208;SB@PLGA is fabricated by encapsulating SB431542 (SB)&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles within host red blood cell membranes (RBCM). Upon immobilization, this nanomedicine reprograms the epitope presentation of endothelial cells (ECs), establishing localized steric immune shielding to preserve endothelial integrity without the need for systemic immunosuppression. Concurrently, the nanomedicine releases SB to inhibit the transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;)&#8208;mediated endothelial&#8208;to&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EndMT), thereby preventing endothelial dysfunction during vascular tissue remodeling. In animal models of allogeneic carotid artery transplantation, R&#8208;SB@PLGA showed significant efficacy in enhancing graft patency by reducing vascular inflammation and intimal hyperplasia. By integrating site&#8208;specific immune shielding with in situ therapeutic delivery, a novel paradigm is established for improving transplant outcomes through localized intervention, which is highly promising for promoting the success of allogeneic vascular or organ transplantation.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Structure Determination of Superconducting La4Ni3O10&#8208;&#948; under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade of structural transitions from P21/a to Bmab and to I4/mmm is reported in the nickelate superconductor La4Ni3O10, revealing a correlation between I4/mmm and the emergence of superconductivity. These results demonstrate that ambient&#8208;pressure grown nickelate single crystals can superconduct under high pressure, and reveal a new intermediate structure under high pressure, providing new insights into the physics of nickelate superconductivity.








Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper nickelates have attracted enormous attention since the discovery of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity in bilayer La3Ni2O7 under high pressure. However, the crystal structure under high pressure remains elusive due to the lack of single crystal diffraction data. Here, high&#8208;pressure superconductivity with a superconducting onset temperature approaching 30K and a zero&#8208;resistance state at 7K at 53.8 GPa is reported in high&#8208;quality single crystals of trilayer La4Ni3O10&#8208;&#948; grown at ambient pressure. A cascade of structural transitions from P21/a at 5.7 GPa to Bmab at 11.0 GPa and to I4/mmm at 16.6 GPa is unambiguously determined via synchrotron X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction, revealing a correlation between the tetragonal I4/mmm and the emergence of superconductivity. These results not only demonstrate that ambient&#8208;pressure grown nickelate single crystals can superconduct under high pressure but also reveal an intermediate structure that was not reported under high pressure, providing new insights into the physics of nickelate superconductivity.

         <title>Fast, Reconfigurable Domain&#8208;Wall Logic in a Magnetic Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructures of magnetic insulator TbIG and ultrathin Co layers enable field&#8208;free current&#8208;driven domain&#8208;wall motion over 1.4 km&#160;s&#8722;1. All 16 two&#8208;input Boolean logic operations are experimentally demonstrated within a single domain&#8208;wall device via current density and initial magnetization state adjustment, holding the potential for energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;density in&#8208;memory computing architectures.








Abstract
Conventional computing systems, based on silicon transistors, face challenges in meeting the growing demand for high computing efficiency in applications such as big data and artificial intelligence. Spin&#8208;based logic devices, particularly those utilizing chiral domain walls, offer a promising alternative due to their potential for high&#8208;performance and integration with high&#8208;density memory. Here, heterostructures composed of magnetic insulator TbIG and ultrathin Co layers are created, enabling field&#8208;free current&#8208;driven domain&#8208;wall motion at speeds exceeding 1.4&#160;km s&#8722;1. Based on the unique velocity phase diagram with respect to the in&#8208;plane field and current density, the implementation of all 16 two&#8208;input Boolean logic operations, including NAND, AND, XOR, and XNOR, is experimentally demonstrated by adjusting the current density and initial magnetization state. The results highlight the feasibility of multifunctional logic gates in spintronic systems and show the potential for energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;density in&#8208;memory computing architectures.

Virus&#8208;like nanoparticle (VNP) platform is engineered through rational integration of lipid scaffolding, siRNA encapsulation, and surface&#8208;anchored DNA aptamer&#8208;based LYTAC (DbLYTAC). This modular design synergistically combines gene silencing with targeted protein degradation capabilities while enhancing structural stability. VNP is a paradigm&#8208;shifting platform that overcomes the limitations of protein&#8208;based viral mimics, paving the way for multifunctional nanotherapeutics in cancer therapy.








Abstract
Virus&#8208;like particle (VLP) holds significant promise for drug delivery and cancer therapy; however, they encounter challenges related to structural stability and functional versatility. This study reports a biomimetic virus&#8208;like nanoparticle (VNP) platform, which is engineered through rational integration of lipid scaffolding, siRNA encapsulation, and surface&#8208;anchored DNA aptamer&#8208;based LYTAC (DbLYTAC). This modular design synergistically combines gene silencing with targeted protein degradation capabilities while enhancing structural stability. In vitro experiments validate the exceptional efficacy of the VNPs in achieving targeted protein degradation, while in vivo studies using animal models demonstrate their promising potential for tumor therapy. This approach establishes a paradigm&#8208;shifting platform that overcomes the limitations of protein&#8208;based viral mimics, paving the way for multifunctional nanotherapeutics in cancer therapy.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Bioinspired Meta&#8208;Structural Perovskite Catalysts for Dry Reforming of CH4 and CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed bioinspired meta&#8208;structural perovskite catalyst (LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3/pseudo&#8208;boehmite) with gradient woodpile channels (0.5&#8211;3 mm) is developed, achieving 82.13% CH4 conversion and 9.69 mmol g&#8722;1 syngas yield in DRM. Mass transfer and catalytic performance are synergistically coupled by configuring gradient hierarchical pores and tailored flow dynamics, providing a design paradigm for robust, high&#8208;performance catalysts applicable to diverse processes.








Abstract
Conventional packed&#8208;bed catalysts suffer from single&#8208;scale porosity, insufficient mechanical strength, and suboptimal mass transfer efficiency. Inspired by the fractal structure of the lung bronchi, a design and 3D printing method for gradient meta&#8208;structural catalysts is proposed by integrating synthesized LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3 (LFN) perovskite with pseudo&#8208;boehmite, achieving ultralow pressure drop and high catalytic efficiency.&#160;Computational fluid dynamics and reaction simulations guide the design of uniform and gradient&#8208;structured catalysts with hierarchical woodpile channels (0.5&#8211;3&#160;mm). Compared with homogeneous catalysts, the gradient design theoretically exhibits 1.5&#8208;fold and 1.1&#8208;fold increases in flow velocity and hydrogen production, respectively. Meta&#8208;structural catalysts are fabricated with gradient multi&#8208;peak pore distribution (9.32&#160;nm, 103.75&#160;nm) by regionally modulating unit cell sizes and LFN content (11&#8211;35%) combined with the dehydroxylation of pseudo&#8208;boehmite. 3D&#8208;printed perovskite catalysts demonstrate a 78.7&#8208;fold increase in specific surface area (102.26 m2 g&#8722;1) and compressive strength of 8.48&#160;MPa. In dry reforming of methane (DRM) tests, it achieves 82.13% CH4 conversion, and 9.69&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 syngas yield, outperforming conventional powder&#8208;packed beds by 10% efficiency. This study achieves mass transfer and catalytic performance coupling by tuning gradient hierarchical pores and tailoring flow dynamics, offering a paradigm for robust, high&#8208;efficiency catalyst design across diverse applications.

This article&#160;presents a Trojan horse&#8208;inspired biomimetic lipoprotein nanocarrier (A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP) that electrostatically binds aflibercept to phosphatidic acid (PA) and incorporates an apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1)&#8208;mimetic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#160;via self&#8208;assembly. This nanocarrier enables noninvasive delivery through corneal and conjunctival&#8211;scleral&#8211;choroidal pathways and effectively suppresses choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a laser&#8208;induced mouse model.








Abstract
Pathological neovascularization is a major cause of vision loss in various ischemic and inflammatory ocular fundus diseases, with current anti&#8208;VEGF therapies requiring invasive and frequent intravitreal injections. In this study, a Trojan horse&#8208;inspired biomimetic lipoprotein nanocarrier (A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP) is developed for noninvasive anti&#8208;VEGF therapy via topical administration. Utilizing phosphatidic acid (PA), specifically 1,2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate (DOPA), as the sole phospholipid, the nanocarrier enables electrostatic tethering of aflibercept, with a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;functionalized apoA1 mimetic peptide (&#945;CPP) incorporated through self&#8208;assembly. Molecular dynamics simulations and intermolecular interaction experiments confirm effective PA&#8211;protein interactions and &#945;CPP incorporation. The nanocarrier demonstrates high encapsulation efficiency, size uniformity, and long&#8208;term stability. It enhances transcellular and paracellular transport by promoting cellular uptake, bypassing lysosomal degradation, and modulating tight junctions. When topically administered, A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP efficiently delivers to the posterior segment via corneal and conjunctival&#8211;scleral&#8211;choroidal pathways. In a laser&#8208;induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) mouse model, A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP eye drops show therapeutic efficacy comparable to a single intravitreal injection, while maintaining excellent ocular and systemic biocompatibility. This biomimetic platform highlights the potential of PA&#8208;mediated protein binding in nanocarrier design, offering a promising strategy for home&#8208;based anti&#8208;VEGF therapy and extending the potential to other protein&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>A Wideband Multimodal Flexible Sensor Integrating Vertical Graphene and Sea Urchin&#8208;Like Nanoparticles for Post&#8208;Stroke Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a speech reconstruction framework based on a dual&#8208;sensor system that collects wideband signals from vocal vibrations and throat muscle movements. An encoder&#8208;cycle&#8208;consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) model maps the signals to speech without requiring a large&#8208;scale paired training dataset. The system achieves over 95% intent recognition accuracy and generates natural&#8208;sounding speech with a mean opinion score of 2.9.








Abstract
Stroke is a leading cause of long&#8208;term disability worldwide, with post&#8208;stroke aphasia significantly impairing communication and social interaction. Traditional rehabilitation devices are often bulky, expensive, and impractical for daily use, particularly in speech recovery, where accessible and effective solutions remain limited. To address this challenge, this study introduces a portable and wearable sensor system for stroke&#8208;induced aphasia rehabilitation. The proposed sensor integrates a flexible, ultrasensitive, and durable dual&#8208;sensor system comprising an Ag&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based sea&#8208;urchin&#8208;like nanoparticle pressure sensor to detect high&#8208;frequency vocal vibrations and a vertical graphene/polydimethylsiloxane (VGr/PDMS) strain sensor to capture low&#8208;frequency muscular movements. The sensors, integrated into a flexible circuit, employ an encoder&#8208;cycle&#8208;consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN)&#160;model that recognizes users' intent and recovers voice, significantly reducing dependency on large&#8208;scale labelled datasets. Experimental results demonstrate accurate intent recognition with accuracies for certain commands exceeding 95%. The reconstructed speech exhibits improved naturalness based on objective and perceptual evaluations, highlighting potential clinical utility in enhancing daily communication and interaction for stroke survivors.

         <title>3D Acoustic Imaging Hitting the Diffraction Limit via Fully Parameter&#8208;Optimized Meta&#8208;Lens and Frequency&#8208;Domain Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article employs a binary genetic algorithm to design an ultra&#8208;fine ultrasonic meta&#8208;lens, achieving lateral super&#8208;resolution imaging in the far field (&gt;20&#955;&#8320;). Building on this, longitudinal resolution is effectively restored through frequency domain reconstruction. Additionally, the nonlinear effect of sound waves in the medium is leveraged to significantly enhance both lateral and longitudinal resolutions, reaching &#8776;0.2&#955;&#8320; and 0.68&#955;&#8320;.








Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution imaging is the long&#8208;sought goal pursued in acoustics. In the past decade, many solutions have been proposed by utilizing various metamaterial devices. For example, in acoustics, the holographic meta&#8208;lens is employed to improve the lateral resolutions of ultrasonic imaging. However, the filtering effect of meta&#8208;lens broadens the acoustic wave pulses, which severely degrades longitudinal resolutions, making the high&#8208;resolution 3D imaging hitherto quite challenging. Here, an innovative solution is proposed by designing and implementing a fully parameter&#8208;optimized meta&#8208;lens. At the fundamental frequency, this meta&#8208;lens can achieve a lateral resolution of 80&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;0.37&#955;0), successfully breaking the diffraction limit. Through the frequency&#8208;domain reconstruction, the longitudinal resolution is increased to 296&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;1.36&#955;0). Utilizing the nonlinear effect of ultrasound in water, the acoustic meta&#8208;lens can furtherly optimize its imaging quality at the harmonic frequency, where the lateral resolution is increased to 44&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;0.2&#955;0) with the longitudinal resolution to 148&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;0.68&#955;0). The work breaks the bias on meta&#8208;lenses with deteriorated longitudinal resolution for broad applications in functional ultrasonic imaging.

         <title>Multimodal Super&#8208;Cooling Textiles for All&#8208;Scenario Passive Hygrothermal Comfort</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a multimodal supercooling textile that integrates radiative, conductive, and evaporative functions by a 3D cladding strategy of nanosheets for all&#8208;scenario personal cooling. With high solar reflectance, a 3D thermally conductive network, and a Janus wetting structure, it cools 2&#160;&#176;C lower than cotton in a hot and humid environment, offering a new perspective for highly efficient human hygrothermal management.








Abstract
Radiative cooling textiles hold great promise for achieving personal thermal comfort amidst the rising global temperatures while enhancing productivity and saving energy. However, despite extensive research, most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art radiative cooling textiles possess solely radiative functions, failing to achieve highly efficient cooling across all scenarios, particularly as high temperatures and high humidity diminish non&#8208;radiative cooling power. This work presents a multimodal super&#8208;cooling textile that integrates radiative, conductive, and evaporative mechanisms through a 3D cladding strategy to enhance the cooling effect in various scenarios without compromising radiative performance. This method enables the surfaces of all 1D single fibers to be closely 3D clad with 2D boron nitride nanosheets, thereby achieving ultra&#8208;high solar reflectivity (97.30%), omnidirectional heat dissipation (in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 2.40 and 0.33&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, respectively), and unidirectional moisture&#8208;wicking properties (transport index of 1547%) through high backscattering efficiency, a 3D thermal conductivity network structure, and a Janus wetting structure. Enabled by the multi&#8208;cooling mechanisms, MST drops temperature by 20&#160;&#176;C versus cotton in outdoor sunlight. Even in hot, humid circumstances, it still provides a 2&#160;&#176;C cooling advantage over cotton. This work thereby provides a promising strategy for personal thermal and moisture management textiles across various complex environments.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents Inverted PAINT, a label&#8208;free super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging method optimized for thick and non&#8208;transparent semiconductor materials. By employing electrostatic dye&#8211;surface interactions in an inverted geometry, the technique enables material&#8208;specific, multicolor, and 3D nanoscale imaging, with applications in semiconductor metrology, defect detection, and analysis of various inorganic nanomaterials.








Abstract
Recent advances in super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy have extended its application beyond traditional biological samples to include various organic materials such as polymers and lipid layers. However, its application to inorganic materials, including semiconductor substrates, still remains limited due to technical challenges associated with their thickness, optical opacity, and the lack of effective fluorophore labeling methods. To overcome these challenges, a label&#8208;free Inverted point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) imaging method is developed for thick and non&#8208;transparent inorganic nanomaterials by addressing the limitations of conventional PAINT imaging. By placing the sample in an inverted orientation and utilizing electrostatic interactions to control dye movement against gravity, silica&#8208;specific and silicon&#8208;specific nanoimaging of silica&#8211;silicon line&#8208; and hole&#8208;patterned semiconductor wafers, respectively is achieved. Through systematic optimization of polymer coating, dye charge, pH, refractive index, and dye concentration, it is demonstrated that the Inverted PAINT imaging method successfully visualizes sub&#8208;100&#160;nm line patterns with a resolution of &#8776;12&#160;nm, as well as enables multi&#8208;color and 3D nanoimaging. The method is anticipated to serve not only as a non&#8208;destructive and material&#8208;specific nanoimaging technique for a variety of inorganic nanomaterials, but also as a next&#8208;generation tool for semiconductor metrology and defect inspection.

         <title>Flexible Photovoltaic Neurostimulator for Analgesia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible photovoltaic Neurostimulator for Analgesia. This study introduces a fully implantable, wireless photovoltaic neurostimulator that integrates flexible self&#8208;rolling cuff electrodes with biocompatible Cu(In,Ga)Se2 photovoltaic cells. This adaptive optoelectronic system enables near&#8208;infrared&#8208;triggered nerve electrical stimulation, showing significant pain reduction in neuropathic conditions.








Abstract
Chronic neuropathic pain remains a significant clinical challenge, often requiring prolonged opioid use and exposing patients to associated complications. Current nerve electrical stimulation (ES) techniques show promise for analgesia but are constrained by their invasive nature and the potential risk of iatrogenic nerve injury. In this study, a novel approach is introduced to managing chronic pain through the development of a fully implantable, wireless, and self&#8208;adaptive photovoltaic neurostimulator (PVNS). This innovative device combines flexible, self&#8208;rolling cuff electrodes with biocompatible flexible Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin&#8208;film photovoltaics, enabling near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered nerve ES. In vivo neuralgia models demonstrate significant analgesic effects, while mechanistic studies reveal the involvement of inflammatory pathway regulation and modulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1). The PVNS eliminates the difficulty for tethered stimulation and reduces the risk of peripheral nerve injury, offering a groundbreaking and minimally invasive solution for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.

         <title>A Nanobiocatalyst&#8208;Driven Hybrid System for Efficient and Sustainable Hydrogen Production via Electron Flow Optimization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermetallic nanobiocatalyst LPBC, featuring an ordered atomic structure and defined electronic properties, is designed and integrated with Clostridium pasteurianum to construct an efficient, sustainable biohydrogen hybrid system. LPBC stimulates transcriptional enhancement for biohydrogen production, and targets NADH and [FeFe] hydrogenase to catalyze intracellular tandem reactions for directional electron modulation, achieving a 103% production rate increase with 30&#8208;day long&#8208;lasting performance.








Abstract
Biohydrogen production offers a promising pathway for developing clean and renewable energy sources. However, its practical application has been hindered by low efficiency and sustainability issues. Here, it is introduced an energy&#8208;efficient and output&#8208;sustainable hybrid system (LPBC/CH system) for biohydrogen production by integrating self&#8208;assembling intermetallic (L10) FePt@polypyrrole nanobiocatalysts (LPBC) with Clostridium pasteurianum. The engineered LPBC, characterized by optimal atomic structures and defined electronic properties, demonstrates robust transcriptional enhancement efficiency and biocatalytic capability, leading to an &#8776;103% increase in hydrogen production rate and a 57% enhancement in hydrogen yield to the bare C. pasteurianum system. Within the LPBC/CH system, the nanobiocatalysts target NADH and [FeFe] hydrogenase, triggering efficient tandem biocatalytic reactions for proton reduction. Notably, the LPBC achieves sustained performance for at least 30 days &#8211; a benchmark unmatched by other reported nanobiocatalysts. This study not only advances the frontiers of biohydrogen production but also establishes a universal framework for constructing hybrid systems with superior efficiency and sustainability.

         <title>Unravelling Microstructure Selection in an Additively Manufactured Eutectic High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Processing&#8211;microstructure&#8211;property relationships in additively manufactured high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are studied, showing&#160;how increasing solidification rate drives solidification morphology from coupled eutectic to anomalous eutectic and eventually to single&#8208;phase structures, enabling tunable strength&#8211;ductility combinations. Integrated thermodynamic modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and multiscale characterization clarify the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic factors in microstructure selection of additively manufactured HEAs.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are promising candidates for advanced structural applications due to their excellent mechanical properties. Additive manufacturing (AM), with its rapid solidification conditions, enables the creation of unique nonequilibrium microstructures. To fully leverage the synergy between AM and HEAs, understanding how processing affects structure and properties is essential. Here, how solidification rate influences microstructure evolution and phase transformation pathway in laser additively manufactured AlCrFe2Ni2 eutectic HEAs is investigated. By increasing the laser scan speed and hence the solidification rate, distinct solidification modes evolving from coupled eutectic to anomalous eutectic and eventually to single&#8208;phase solidification are revealed. These transitions result in distinct microstructures and a wide range of mechanical properties. Thermodynamic modeling and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that low cooling rates allow for sufficient atomic diffusion and phase separation, facilitating coupled eutectic growth. In contrast, rapid cooling suppresses diffusion and destabilizes the solid&#8211;liquid interface, promoting anomalous or single&#8208;phase solidification. This integrated experimental and computational approach provides a multiscale understanding of solidification mechanisms in HEAs and underscores how kinetic effects can over&#8208;ride thermodynamic predictions under nonequilibrium conditions. These results demonstrate that AM can serve as a powerful tool to design HEAs with tailored microstructures and properties.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Perfect Pt Cocatalyst with a Spatially Oriented Distribution of Pt2+/Pt0 for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;perfect Pt cocatalyst is developed featuring a near&#8208;zero proton reduction barrier and isolated O2 adsorption by precisely regulating the Pt2+/Pt0 ratio. This work underscores the critical role of spatial orientation distribution of Pt valence states in photocatalytic reactions, demonstrating generalizable design principles applicable to photoelectrocatalysis, organocatalysis, and environmental catalysis.








Abstract
Loading the cocatalyst, e.g., Pt, is a promising strategy for photocatalytic overall water splitting, in which metallic state Pt&#176; facilitates proton reduction and positive valence state Pt2+ inhibits H2/O2 recombination. However, simultaneously leveraging the advantages of Pt0 and Pt2+ in Pt&#8208;photocatalyst hybrids for photocatalytic water splitting is challenging. Herein, a universal strategy is demonstrated for modulating Pt valence state, obtaining a spatially oriented distribution of Pt2+/Pt3 and a close to zero proton reduction barrier, along with isolated O2 adsorption. As a proof of concept, Pt undergoes electron transfer to ZnIn2S4, accompanied by partial oxidation from Pt0 to Pt2+ through the introduction of electron&#8208;deficient centers in ZnIn2S4 via vanadium doping and sulfur vacancy (V&#8208;Sv&#8208;ZIS). Reverse electron transfer induces Pt2+ dominating 83% of the region near the Pt/V&#8208;Sv&#8208;ZIS interface and Pt0 dominating in the remaining 17% near the Pt cluster center, which can be extended to other Pt&#8208;based catalyst systems. The dominant Pt2+ inhibits O2 adsorption and induces the lowest H2/O2 recombination rate of 4%, and the minimal Pt0 obtains a 152.2&#8208;fold increase in photogenerated electron density, ultimately realizing a 45.4&#8208;fold increase in photocatalytic activity. A 10 m2 large&#8208;area photocatalytic system is fabricated, producing 6.4 L of H2 per day under natural sunlight.

However, simultaneously leveraging the advantages of Pt&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and Pt&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in Pt-photocatalyst hybrids for photocatalytic water splitting is challenging. Herein, a universal strategy is demonstrated for modulating Pt valence state, obtaining a spatially oriented distribution of Pt&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Pt&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a close to zero proton reduction barrier, along with isolated O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption. As a proof of concept, Pt undergoes electron transfer to ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, accompanied by partial oxidation from Pt&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to Pt&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; through the introduction of electron-deficient centers in ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; via vanadium doping and sulfur vacancy (V-Sv-ZIS). Reverse electron transfer induces Pt&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dominating 83% of the region near the Pt/V-Sv-ZIS interface and Pt&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; dominating in the remaining 17% near the Pt cluster center, which can be extended to other Pt-based catalyst systems. The dominant Pt&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; inhibits O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and induces the lowest H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recombination rate of 4%, and the minimal Pt&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; obtains a 152.2-fold increase in photogenerated electron density, ultimately realizing a 45.4-fold increase in photocatalytic activity. A 10 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; large-area photocatalytic system is fabricated, producing 6.4 L of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per day under natural sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In this work, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hybrid flow machine learning (HFML) framework is designed to efficiently discover HEO compositions. The factors affecting structural stability, including s&#8208;block metal ions, Cu2+, high&#8208;valence d0 and d10 metal ions are further verified. In conclusion, this work accomplishes the full chain study from artificial intelligence material prediction, and performance verification to pilot application.








Abstract
How to proficiently and accurately explore the vast compositional space of materials and accelerate the development of new materials with outstanding properties, especially structurally complex high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), remains a challenge in materials science. To address this, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hybrid flow machine learning (HFML) framework is proposed, which combines ensemble learning, unsupervised learning, and Bayesian optimization, enabling efficient discovery of hidden patterns and comprehensive exploration of the component space. Based on the proposed HFML, a new HEO cathode material is screened out from over 2 million candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (Na0.95Li0.06Ni0.25Cu0.05Fe0.1Co0.05Mn0.44Ti0.05O2), which shows excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 83.6% after 1200 cycles) and high&#8208;rate performance (110 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, and 96 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 C). Key factors affecting structural stability are identified, including s&#8208;block metal ions, Cu2+, high&#8208;valence d0 and d10 metal ions, and are verified by electrochemical tests and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Additionally, pilot&#8208;scale production is achieved, and 2 Ah pouch cells based on this cathode demonstrate 95.0% capacity retention after 600 cycles. This work accomplishes the full chain study from artificial intelligence material prediction, creation, and performance verification to pilot application (mass production and pouch sodium batteries).

         <title>Origin of Synergy in Bicomponent Metal Nitride&#8211;Metal Single Atom Catalysts for Advanced Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive coupling model for metal nitride (MN) and metal single atoms (M&#8722;SA) is proposed to optimize the behavior of polysulfides, and elucidate the principles by which the hybrid catalyst facilitates the conversion of polysulfides. W&#8722;SA/WN as the model prepared and dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon sheets rendered batteries the increased capacity, superior rate performance, and enhanced cycling stability.








Abstract
To catalyze the sulfur redox kinetics of lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries (LSBs) can well enhance the capacity and longevity. However, the synergistic essence of bicomponent electrocatalysts for LSBs remains obscure. Here, this work introduces standardized descriptors to describe the underlying origin of catalysts&#8217; synergy for LSBs. Specifically, it pertains to the bi&#8722;functional electrocatalysts comprising a series of metal nitrides (MN) and partner metal single atoms (M&#8722;SA) for the conversion and migration of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The M&#8722;SA with higher eg/t2g promotes the conversion of Li2S4&#8722;dominated decisive steps, alleviating the shuttling. Concurrently, MN with abundant bonding facilitates the migration of lithium sulfide, which significantly reduces the accumulation of insulating sulfide. Such independent but synergistic hybridization makes the bicomponent MN/M&#8722;SA possess improved catalysis over the S electrochemistry compared to their single components, which is also experimentally verified with W&#8722;SA/WN as the representative. The batteries provide considerable sulfur utilization, superior rate capability, and the assembled 6.31 Ah pouch&#8722;pack battery even has an ultra&#8722;high incipient energy density of 506.2&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 under high sulfur loading and lean&#8722;electrolyte. A thorough comprehension of the catalytic properties from both electronic and structural standpoints provides a novel viewpoint for understanding and designing LSBs&#8217; catalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Mechanoluminescent Haptic Sensor via Dual&#8208;Functional Chromatic Filtration by a Conjugated Polymer Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;resolution mechanoluminescence (ML) platform is achieved through&#160;chromatic filtration strategy using a conjugated polymer shell (F8BT) on copper&#8208;doped zinc sulfide microparticles. This shell narrows the emission bandwidth, selectively filtering out blue noise, while simultaneously boosting intensity via ML photon recycling process. The dual action significantly enhances signal clarity and stability, enabling precise multi&#8208;signal differentiation in haptic sensors and advanced stress&#8208;sensing technologies.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence materials have emerged as promising candidates for haptic interface sensors due to their mechanically driven luminescent property. However, the inherently broad emission spectra of most mechanoluminescence materials hinder sharp signal generation and high spectral resolution. Here, a chromatic filtration strategy is suggested employing poly(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;alt&#8208;benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) as a conjugated polymer shell on copper&#8208;doped zinc sulfide to achieve a highly refined and intensified signal. By selectively suppressing spectral components below 490&#160;nm, the F8BT shell effectively narrows the emission bandwidth, yielding a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#160;nm during the mechanoluminescence process. In particular, F8BT shell efficiently mitigates signal intensity loss, which can be ascribed to the chromatic filtration ability, through mechanoluminescence photon recycling performance. This dual functionality significantly reduces spectral noise in the blue region with high intensity, enhancing the resolution in actual powerless haptic controllers. The novel approach establishes a scalable framework for high&#8208;resolution mechanoluminescence platforms, providing a versatile pathway toward next&#8208;generation, power&#8208;free stress&#8208;sensing applications with unprecedented spectral precision and optical fidelity.

         <title>Prelithiation of Alloy Anodes via Roll Pressing for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general prelithiation method is developed for alloy&#8208;type negative electrodes via solid&#8208;state lithiation using roll&#8208;pressing with thin lithium foil. This mechanical prelithiation method is compatible with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll processing and allows for a controlled extent of prelithiation. Prelithiated Si, Al, and Sn anodes, as well as multi&#8208;component foil anodes, exhibit improved Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability in solid&#8208;state batteries with sulfide&#8208;based electrolytes.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries with alloy&#8208;type negative electrodes can feature enhanced energy density and safety compared to conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, diffusional Li trapping within Li alloys often causes low initial Coulombic efficiency and leads to capacity loss with cycling. Here, a general roll&#8208;pressing prelithiation method compatible with a variety of alloy&#8208;type negative electrodes (silicon, aluminum, tin, and multi&#8208;phase alloys) is introduced, which is shown to improve performance in solid&#8208;state batteries. By warm&#8208;rolling lithium foil of controlled thickness with various alloy&#8208;type electrodes, both slurry&#8208;cast and foil&#8208;type electrodes can be uniformly prelithiated via direct chemical reaction. The prelithiated electrodes exhibit enhanced specific capacity and extended cycle life in batteries with Li6PS5Cl solid&#8208;state electrolyte. Prelithiated multi&#8208;phase foil electrodes with a tailored interface are shown to exhibit superior cycling stability down to 2&#160;MPa stack pressure.

     alt="Prelithiation of Alloy Anodes via Roll Pressing for Solid-State Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general prelithiation method is developed for alloy-type negative electrodes via solid-state lithiation using roll-pressing with thin lithium foil. This mechanical prelithiation method is compatible with roll-to-roll processing and allows for a controlled extent of prelithiation. Prelithiated Si, Al, and Sn anodes, as well as multi-component foil anodes, exhibit improved Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability in solid-state batteries with sulfide-based electrolytes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state batteries with alloy-type negative electrodes can feature enhanced energy density and safety compared to conventional Li-ion batteries. However, diffusional Li trapping within Li alloys often causes low initial Coulombic efficiency and leads to capacity loss with cycling. Here, a general roll-pressing prelithiation method compatible with a variety of alloy-type negative electrodes (silicon, aluminum, tin, and multi-phase alloys) is introduced, which is shown to improve performance in solid-state batteries. By warm-rolling lithium foil of controlled thickness with various alloy-type electrodes, both slurry-cast and foil-type electrodes can be uniformly prelithiated via direct chemical reaction. The prelithiated electrodes exhibit enhanced specific capacity and extended cycle life in batteries with Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl solid-state electrolyte. Prelithiated multi-phase foil electrodes with a tailored interface are shown to exhibit superior cycling stability down to 2&#160;MPa stack pressure. This prelithiation technique offers a pathway to overcome intrinsic challenges in alloy anodes for solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biovision&#8208;Inspired Perovskite Intelligent Camera for Panchromatic and Metameric Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biovision&#8208;inspired intelligent imaging system combines perovskite photodetectors, single&#8208;pixel imaging and deep learning&#8211;driven color fusion to emulate the best of mantis shrimp&#8208;like multispectral vision and human color perception. With multispectral channels in a compact filter&#8208;free setup, the system enables full&#8208;color imaging and metamerism resistance, portending a new paradigm in adaptive color vision technology.








Abstract
Biological vision systems excel at acquiring and processing information, but there is often a trade&#8208;off between these capabilities. For instance, mantis shrimp possess exceptional spectral sensing but poor color perception due to limited neural processing. Taking the best of both worlds, the mantis shrimp's spectral detection ability and the human&#8208;like visual processing power are integrated to achieve full&#8208;color perception. Using an aerosol&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid spraying technique, an array of high&#8208;quality, excess ion migration enhanced perovskite narrowband photodetectors spanning the ultraviolet to visible spectrum is developed. These detectors enable a computational multispectral imaging system that captures seven spectral images in one shot. A deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based color fusion network is designed to efficiently translate multispectral inputs into an RGB representation, significantly enhancing color recognition of these mantis shrimp&#8208;inspired multispectral cameras and affording the capability to overcome metamerism. These perovskite intelligent camera leverages the strengths of biological vision and demonstrate a novel approach to multispectral imaging that could advance applications in machine vision, remote sensing, and medical imaging.

         <title>Color Tuning in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals using Triptycene/Hydrazone Chiral Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF*LCs)&#160;have been obtained by doping a polar liquid crystal host (DIO) with chiral triptycene/hydrazone&#8208;based bistable photoswitches. Upon irradiation with 442 and 340&#160;nm light sources, the pitch of the NF*LCs can be reversibly phototuned at 50&#160;&#176;C, resulting in the reflection and locking&#8208;in of the primary colors, red, green, and blue.








Abstract
The development of light&#8208;tunable ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NFLCs) will allow for the multi&#8208;stimuli control over the properties of this newly discovered LC phase. Here on the development of photoresponsive chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF*LCs) is reported by incorporating chiral triptycene/hydrazone&#8208;based bistable photoswitchable dopants into the polar liquid crystal mesogen DIO. The propeller&#8208;like dopants exhibit high helical twisting powers with values of 13.5 &#181;m&#8722;1 in DIO, with a further increase in value to 31.0 &#181;m&#8722;1 upon 442&#160;nm light&#8208;induced Z &#8594; E photoisomerization. This process results in the tuning of the NF*LC's reflection color from near infrared, to red, green, and finally blue at 50&#160;&#176;C. The reverse color transition can be induced by 340&#160;nm light irradiation, which drives the E&#8594;Z photoisomerization of the hydrazone. The ferroelectric nature of the NF*LC phase is confirmed by applying an alternating current electric field (0.67&#160;V/ &#181;m, 10&#160;Hz, square wave), which initiated azimuthal deformations of the ferroelectric helix.

The successful demonstration of fully implanted devices for vagus nerve stimulation in mice highlights solid&#8208;state &#120580;&#8208;CGN&#8208;based electrolytes as a promising platform for scalable, implantable circuits and next&#8208;generation bioelectronic technologies.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are crucial for next&#8208;generation (bio&#8208;)electronic devices but are often constrained by the use of aqueous electrolytes, which introduce crosstalk, hinder miniaturization, and limit circuit integration. Here, a photo&#8208;patternable solid&#8208;state electrolyte based on &#120580;&#8208;carrageenan (&#120580;&#8208;CGN) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) is presented, enabling high&#8208;performance OECTs and complementary circuits. The &#120580;&#8208;CGN electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity (&gt;10 mS cm&#8722;1), comparable to a 0.1 m NaCl aqueous electrolyte, while supporting precise patterning down to 15 &#181;m, fast transient response times, minimal hysteresis, and excellent stability in both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type OECTs. Compact solid&#8208;state NAND/NOR gates (500 &#215; 800 &#181;m2), 4&#8208;input NAND gates (1600 &#215; 800 &#181;m2, 8 OECTs), and half&#8208;adders (2 &#215; 1 mm2, 18 OECTs) are demonstrated, all exhibiting correct logic functions and low&#8208;voltage operation. To highlight its potential for implantable bioelectronics, solid&#8208;state spiking circuits, monolithically integrated with flexible cuff electrodes, are developed for vagus nerve stimulation in mice. These findings establish &#120580;&#8208;CGN&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes as a promising platform for scalable, implantable circuits, paving the way for next&#8208;generation bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Solvation Design of an Interfacial Self&#8208;Compatible Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte for High&#8208;Loading Sodium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an additive&#8208;induced solvation strategy toward an interface self&#8208;compatible quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte for high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries. The additive exhibits stronger coordination with anion than EMC molecules, preventing solvent co&#8208;intercalation, and decomposes preferentially to form a thin and robust CEI. Consequently, the in situ fabricated quasi&#8208;solid SDIBs with high loading demonstrate stable cycling performance and a commendable rate capability.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) attract extensive attention in stationary energy storage for their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high working voltage. However, traditional liquid electrolytes for SDIBs undergo solvent co&#8208;intercalation and severe oxidation decomposition at high voltage, causing unstable cathode structure and low Coulombic efficiency, especially with high loading (&gt;5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Herein, an interfacial self&#8208;compatible quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte (ACPE) is developed via an additive&#8208;induced solvation design strategy. The additive exhibits stronger coordination with Hexafluorophosphate anion (PF6&#8722;) than ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) molecules, prevents solvent co&#8208;intercalation, and decomposes preferentially to form a thin and robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI). ACPE offers a high oxidation stability (5.5&#160;V) and effectively curbs solvent co&#8208;intercalation at the graphite cathode. On the sodium anode, an ACPE&#8208;derived robust interphase enables stable sodium plating/stripping for over 300&#160;h. Consequently, for the first time, an in situ fabricated quasi&#8208;solid SDIB with high loading (&gt;6.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) demonstrates stable cycling performance (above 900 cycles) and a commendable rate capability (84.6% capacity retention at 10&#160;C), among the best quasi&#8208;solid DIBs. Even with an ultra&#8208;high&#8208;loading cathode (&gt;16.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), the SDIB maintains a stable capacity for 300 cycles.

     alt="Solvation Design of an Interfacial Self-Compatible Quasi-Solid Electrolyte for High-Loading Sodium-Based Dual-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work proposes an additive-induced solvation strategy toward an interface self-compatible quasi-solid electrolyte for high-mass-loading sodium-based dual-ion batteries. The additive exhibits stronger coordination with anion than EMC molecules, preventing solvent co-intercalation, and decomposes preferentially to form a thin and robust CEI. Consequently, the in situ fabricated quasi-solid SDIBs with high loading demonstrate stable cycling performance and a commendable rate capability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-based dual-ion batteries (SDIBs) attract extensive attention in stationary energy storage for their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high working voltage. However, traditional liquid electrolytes for SDIBs undergo solvent co-intercalation and severe oxidation decomposition at high voltage, causing unstable cathode structure and low Coulombic efficiency, especially with high loading (&amp;gt;5&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Herein, an interfacial self-compatible quasi-solid electrolyte (ACPE) is developed via an additive-induced solvation design strategy. The additive exhibits stronger coordination with Hexafluorophosphate anion (PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) than ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) molecules, prevents solvent co-intercalation, and decomposes preferentially to form a thin and robust cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI). ACPE offers a high oxidation stability (5.5&#160;V) and effectively curbs solvent co-intercalation at the graphite cathode. On the sodium anode, an ACPE-derived robust interphase enables stable sodium plating/stripping for over 300&#160;h. Consequently, for the first time, an in situ fabricated quasi-solid SDIB with high loading (&amp;gt;6.0&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) demonstrates stable cycling performance (above 900 cycles) and a commendable rate capability (84.6% capacity retention at 10&#160;C), among the best quasi-solid DIBs. Even with an ultra-high-loading cathode (&amp;gt;16.0&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the SDIB maintains a stable capacity for 300 cycles. This solvation strategy of electrolytes paves a new way for developing high-loading DIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Dual Functionality in Triazine&#8208;Based Emitters: Synergistic Enhancement of Two&#8208;Photon Absorption and TADF&#8208;OLED Performance with Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational molecular design strategy is presented for simultaneously enhancing two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) by incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing units into a CzTRZ scaffold. The resulting materials exhibit high 2PA cross&#8208;sections, efficient reversed intersystem crossing, and excellent OLED performance, opening new possibilities for advanced imaging probes and organic semiconductors.








Abstract
The simultaneous realization of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in a single molecular system remains challenging due to an inherent trade&#8208;off in their molecular design requirements. In this study, we present a strategy to enhance both properties by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents into the CzTRZ scaffold, thereby leveraging an electron&#8208;withdrawing&#8208;enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (EWICT) character. The incorporation of TRZCF3 and TRZCN units effectively enhances the charge transfer (CT) character of CzTRZ, resulting in high 2PA cross&#8208;sections (156 GM for CzTRZCF3 and 200 GM for CzTRZCN) and a reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST = ES1 &#8211; ET1). Computational and experimental studies reveal that incorporating TRZCF3 and TRZCN units selectively stabilizes the S1 state and reduces &#916;EST, significantly facilitating the reversed intersystem crossing (RISC) process. Notably, 1c exhibits the fastest RISC rate (kRISC), leading to superior TADF properties and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.5% in OLEDs. Moreover, a relatively high two&#8208;photon brightness of 174 GM is estimated for 1c. These findings demonstrate a rational molecular design strategy for the synergistic enhancement of 2PA cross&#8208;sections and excellent OLED performance, paving the way for applications in advanced imaging probes and organic semiconductors.

This work presents narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (BTT&#8208;DTPn and BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F) for SWIR organic photodetectors. The optimized devices through solvent vapor annealing suppress dark current and enhance detectivity while enabling high&#8208;quality blood&#8208;pressure monitoring and real&#8208;time optical communication. The co&#8208;engineering strategy bridges molecular design and device processing to advance SWIR organic photodetectors.








Abstract
The limited noise&#8208;responsivity balance in Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) organic photodetectors (OPDs) restricts their biomedical and optoelectronic applications. In this study, this challenge is addressed through molecular&#8208;device co&#8208;engineering by designing two fluorinated narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (BTT&#8208;DTPn and BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F) coupled with solvent vapor annealing (SVA), achieving low noise and high detectivity in SWIR OPDs. The optimized devices based on BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F, which features enhance &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking due to terminal fluorination, extend its absorption capability to 1300&#160;nm. Under &#8722;0.1&#160;V bias, the SVA&#8208;processed BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F devices demonstrate an ultra&#8208;low dark current (Jd) of 4.93 &#215; 10&#8722;8 A cm&#8722;2 and exhibit a suppressed trap density of states (tDOS) reduced by an order of magnitude, achieving a shot&#8208;noise limited detectivity (Dsh&#8727;$D_{{\mathrm{sh}}}^*$) of 7.19 &#215; 1011 Jones at 1200&#160;nm. The synergy of molecular design and post&#8208;processing enables an ultra&#8208;fast response time (1.44/1.20 &#181;s rise/fall) and a record&#8208;high &#8722;3&#160;dB cutoff frequency (f&#8722;3&#160;dB) of 648&#160;kHz, demonstrating remarkable performance for SWIR OPDs. These advancements facilitate two groundbreaking applications: deep&#8208;tissue photoplethysmography (PPG) for cuff&#8208;less blood pressure monitoring and high&#8208;speed, real&#8208;time SWIR optical communication. This methodology presents a general strategy to harmonize molecular design with device fabrication in SWIR OPDs.

         <title>Lifting Triplet Degeneracy Through Organic&#8208;Cation Driven Structural Perturbation to Modulate Luminescence of Sb3+&#8208;Doped Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing a single&#8208;source, multi&#8208;emissive perovskite with better control over excited&#8208;state manifold splitting is a key challenge. Here, unique 2D Sb3+&#8208;doped halide double perovskites are developed, exhibiting triplet symmetry breaking through organic cation driven structural distortions, in concert with spin&#8208;orbit coupling and Jahn&#8208;Teller interactions. This enables a selective population of emissive non&#8208;degenerate states, a key step toward spin&#8208;polarized emission.








Abstract
The spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect (JTE) alter the orbital degeneracy in materials, leading to unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties essential in spintronics, quantum computing, and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, the study employs luminescent p&#8208;xylylenediammonium (PXA) instead of Cs+ in Cs2NaInCl6 to yield 2D Sb3+&#8208;doped (PXA)2NaInCl8 double perovskite and demonstrates a non&#8208;degenerate triplet state resulting from enhanced JTE in the strong SOC regime, featuring distinct emission centers. Consequently, a broadband emission from both PXA and [SbCl6]3&#8722; spans the entire spectrum (350&#8211;750&#160;nm), representing a rare single&#8208;source multi&#8208;emissive 2D perovskite. With in&#8208;depth comparative structural, temperature&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;physical, and theoretical studies, it is elucidated that the synergistic effect of SOC and JTE on the Eg and T2g lattice modes modulate the electronic structure of [SbCl6]3&#8722; by splitting the doubly degenerate E levels of 3T1u&#8727;$^{3}{\mathrm{T}}_{1u}^*$ into non&#8208;degenerate states. The physical model, supported by theoretical studies, explains the energy level splitting required to realize two kinds of radiative minima in the relaxed excited state.

         <title>Pyridocarbene&#8208;Based Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes for Long Device Lifetime over 500 h in Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8211;Emitting Diodes</title>

Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy exhibit external quantum efficiencies of 24.5% and 27.4% at the 3&#160;wt.% doping concentration, respectively. In particular, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy doped blue PhOLEDs optimized for stability demonstrate a device lifetime of up to 95% of the initial luminance of 543 and 228 h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which has never been achieved in the blue PhOLEDs.








Abstract
Blue phosphorescent organic light&#8211;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) face challenges in achieving high efficiency, color purity, and long device lifetime due to exciton quenching and high energy requirements. In this study, two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy, are designed and synthesized by incorporating pyridocarbene in their ligands. Pyridocarbene enhances the electrochemical stability, strengthens triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer characteristics, and improves the spin&#8211;orbit coupling, effectively shortening the exciton lifetime and minimizing the quenching effects. Additionally, the introduction of a methyl group as a conformation manager in Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy further improves the color purity by blue&#8208;shifting and narrowing the emission spectrum. As a result, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy exhibit external quantum efficiencies of 24.5% and 27.4% at the 3&#160;wt.% doping concentration, respectively. In particular, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy doped blue PhOLEDs optimized for stability demonstrate a device lifetime of up to 95% of the initial luminance of 543 and 228&#160;h at 1,000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which has never been achieved in the blue PhOLEDs. This study demonstrates that the synergistic combination of pyridocarbene and the methyl conformation manager is an effective strategy for improving blue PhOLED performance, enhancing their potential for practical applications.

         <title>A Universal Orientation&#8208;Engineering Strategy for Enhancing Mechano&#8208;Electric Conversion Performance in Semi&#8208;Crystalline Biopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a systematic design of high&#8208;charge&#8208;output triboelectric biopolymers through multiscale orientation engineering. The triboelectric output performance of silk fibroin is systematically analyzed for the first time from the perspective of interfacial charge transfer and bulk charge transport. The enhanced mechano&#8208;electric conversion mechanism of orientation&#8208;optimized semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers is further explored based on molecular dynamic simulations and first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
High&#8208;charge&#8208;density triboelectric materials are the key to developing high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerators. However, most semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers exhibit low triboelectric output performance due to the limitations in their intrinsic structure and physicochemical properties. Herein, orientation&#8208;regulated silk fibroin nanofibers (SFNs) with phase transition polarization and enhanced carrier migration are developed through high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;speed synergistic electrospinning technology. To analyze the molecular and aggregation structural changes of SFNs during high&#8208;voltage electric fields and stress&#8208;induced orientation processes, a multiscale structural evolutionary model is constructed from microscopic molecular chains to mesoscopic aggregation structures, and then to macroscopic fiber arrangements. It is found that as the orientation coefficient increases, the molecular conformation shifts from disordered &#945;&#8208;helices to ordered stacked &#946;&#8208;sheets. The aggregated molecular chains gradually slip, recombine, and arrange in an orderly manner along the direction of the stress field, which contributes to regulating the charge capture and carrier migration properties. The orientation&#8208;regulated SFNs significantly enhance the interfacial charge transfer and bulk charge transport capacity, thereby greatly improving the triboelectric performance. This work not only provides new insights into the mechano&#8208;electric conversion mechanisms of semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers but also offers guidance for the design of high&#8208;charge&#8208;density triboelectric materials.

         <title>Exceptional n&#8208;Type Ionic Thermoelectric Hydrogels by Synergistic Hydrophobic and Coordination Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based n&#8208;type ionic thermoelectric hydrogel is developed by synergistic coordination and hydrophobic interactions. This strategy yields a high negative Seebeck coefficient (&#8722;38.6&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1) and excellent stretchability (382.5%). The hydrogel powers flexible sensors and harvests low&#8208;grade heat, offering a new approach for stretchable ionic thermoelectrics in wearable sensors and heat conversion devices.








Abstract
Ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) materials show promise for flexible energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing due to their high ionic Seebeck coefficients (Si). However, achieving both high thermoelectric performance and mechanical stretchability, especially in n&#8208;type systems, remains a critical challenge. Herein, a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based n&#8208;type i&#8208;TE hydrogel is presented that exhibits both large negative Si (&#8722;38.6&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1) and excellent stretchability (382.5%) through synergistic effect of coordination and hydrophobic interactions. Leveraging the amphiphilic nature of PVA, its hydrophilic hydroxyl groups form coordination bonds with Cu2+ ions from copper chloride (CuCl2), while its hydrophobic backbone interacts with water&#8208;soluble conjugated polymer (poly(3&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;triethylammonium&#8208;1&#8242;&#8208;propy&#8208;loxy)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;thiophene chloride (PMNT). Meanwhile, hydrophobic associations also occur among PMNT chains due to strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and backbone hydrophobicity. This dual&#8208;interaction strategy approach enhances the thermophoretic difference between chloride anions (from both CuCl2 and PMNT) and cations, enabling the giant ionic thermopower. Besides, the long&#8208;range hydrophobic interactions contribute to the overall mechanical robustness. The developed hydrogels are successfully implemented in self&#8208;powered temperature sensors and low&#8208;grade heat harvesting systems, such as powering a cooling fan by utilizing the waste heat from a working tablet. This work offers an alternative pathway toward developing high&#8208;performance i&#8208;TE materials for wearable electronics and low&#8208;grade heat harvesting applications.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Assisted Rapid Gelation and Foaming of Gradient Hydrogel as Human&#8208;Machine Interfaces with Regulated Charge Accumulation/Dissipation and Enhanced Tactile Sensing Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy is proposed to improve the performance of hydrogel&#8208;based tactile sensors through manipulating the interfacial properties and ion transport kinetics rather than barely enlarging the contact area. The phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced hydrogel foam with gradient porous structure and interfacially accumulated MXene nanosheets simultaneously achieves high sensitivity of 4267 kPa&#8722;1 and a wide detectable range up to 100 kPa.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based tactile sensors, typically featuring a sandwiched structure of electrode/hydrogel/electrode with charges (electrons and ions) accumulated at both interfaces forming electrical double layers (EDLs), are considered promising candidates as human&#8208;machine interfaces (HMIs); however, the continuous dense structure limits the deformability of bulk hydrogels, hindering the achievement of high&#8208;sensitivity and wide detectable range. Moreover, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for enhancing sensitivity predominantly focus on enlarging the changes of hydrogel/electrode contact area upon external force, while overlooking the design of interfacial properties and ion transport kinetics. Herein, polyacrylamide/chitosan/MXene (PAM/CS/MXene, PCM) hydrogels with gradient porosity and tailorable softness are developed following the phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced foaming mechanism. Ti3C2TX MXene plays critical roles in promoting rapid gelation, stabilizing bubbles, regulating ion transport kinetics, and modulating charge accumulation/dissipation at the hydrogel/electrode interfaces. As a consequence, the obtained PCM foam (PCMF) tactile sensor exhibits an optimal sensitivity of 4267 kPa&#8722;1 together with a wide detectable pressure range up to 100 kPa. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications are demonstrated for acquiring and identifying gesture commands to control a robotic arm for swab sampling and the movement of an electric car in a maze game by integrating PCMF sensors with a digital camera for visual feedback and machine learning for accurate recognition, respectively.

         <title>Nonresonant Raman Control of Ferroelectric Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonresonant Raman excitation with mid&#8208;infrared pulses induces large&#8208;amplitude lattice motion and ultrafast ferroelectric reversal in lithium niobate. A suite of spectroscopic techniques uncovers the underlying dynamics, establishing a low&#8208;energy route to reshape complex energy landscapes and synthesize hidden material phases with unique functionalities on ultrafast timescales.








Abstract
Important advances is recently made in the search for materials with complex multi&#8208;phase landscapes that host photoinduced metastable collective states with exotic functionalities. In almost all cases so far, the desired phases are accessed by exploiting light&#8211;matter interactions via the imaginary part of the dielectric function through above&#8208;bandgap or resonant mode excitation. Nonresonant Raman excitation of coherent modes is experimentally observed and proposed for dynamic material control, but the resulting atomic excursion is limited to perturbative levels. Here, this challenge is overcome by employing nonresonant ultrashort pulses with low photon energies well below the bandgap. Using mid&#8208;infrared pulses, ferroelectric reversal is induced in lithium niobate, and the large&#8208;amplitude mode displacements are characterized through femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering and second harmonic generation. This approach, validated by first&#8208;principle calculations, defines a novel method for synthesizing hidden phases with unique functional properties and manipulating complex energy landscapes at reduced energy consumption and ultrafast&#160;speeds.

         <title>Pyrazinoquinazoline&#8208;Based Eu&#8208;MOF Ratiometric Fluorescence Sensing: Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Meat Spoilage Enabled by Dynamic Regulation of LMCT/LLCT Triggered by Biogenic Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>

By developing a dual&#8208;emission Eu&#8208;MOF ratiometric platform using pyrazinoquinoxaline ligands, achieving biogenic amine detection via LMCT/LLCT&#8208;regulated fluorescence color shifts, integrated with hydrogel&#8208;encapsulated smartphone RGB analysis for real&#8208;time shrimp/chicken spoilage monitoring.








Abstract
This study develops a dual&#8208;emission Eu&#8208;MOF ratiometric fluorescence sensor for biogenic amine detection in food spoilage monitoring. The sensor exhibits dual emission at 495 nm (ligand &#960;&#8594;&#960;* transition) and 615 nm (ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, LMCT) through the antenna effect. Biogenic amines specifically regulate the intensity ratio (I495nm/I615nm) by adsorbing into MOF pores via hydrogen bonding, triggering a dynamic equilibrium switch between LMCT and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (LLCT), causing fluorescence color shift from orange to green. Theoretical calculations reveal this response mechanism for the first time. Encapsulating Eu&#8208;MOF in agarose hydrogel&#8208;based portable tags with smartphone RGB analysis enables rapid quantitative detection of biogenic amines (detection limit: 3.7&#8211;9.1 &#181;M, response time &lt;10 min). The sensor allows real&#8208;time tracking of spoilage in shrimp and chicken stored at 0&#8211;25 &#176;C, with visual fluorescence color transitions reflecting amine accumulation levels. This work provides molecular insights into dynamic charge transfer regulation and establishes a high&#8208;sensitivity, visual, wearable solution for on&#8208;site food safety detection, advancing smart sensing technology in the food industry.

         <title>Ternary Strategy and Molecular Electrostatics Collaboratively Optimize Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Polymer Donor Organic Solar Cells: Over 20% Efficiency and High Scalability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inefficient low&#8208;molecule&#8208;weight LWPM6&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs) using trimeric acceptor TYT&#8208;S are optimized, enhancing power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. LWPM6 flexible devices show excellent mechanical stability and solution&#8208;processability, offering new insights for OSCs commercialization.








Abstract
Achieving consistent performance across polymer donor batches is crucial for the commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs). Compared with high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PM6 (HWPM6), low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PM6 (LWPM6) has lower efficiency but better stress&#8208;dispersion characteristics and solution&#8208;processability, making its performance improvement vital for practical applications. Here, LWPM6&#8208;based OSCs are optimized by introducing a trimeric guest (TYT&#8208;S). TYT&#8208;S improves PM6:Y6 compatibility, achieving a finer phase separation and a favorable interpenetrating network morphology. A ternary strategy, leveraging molecular electrostatic potential differences, promotes LWPM6 pre&#8208;aggregation, extends film&#8208;formation time, and enhances molecular ordering. The LWPM6&#8208;based ternary system exhibits an optimized vertical phase distribution, with maximum exciton dissociation occurring near the cathode, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.23% (LWPM6&#8208;based binary with a low PCE of 17.35%). When BTP&#8208;eC9 replaces Y6, the LWPM6&#8208;based ternary devices achieve a PCE of 20.12% (LWPM6&#8208;based binary with a low PCE of 17.64%). Additionally, LW polymers can dissipate stress via segmental motion. After 3000 bending cycles, LWPM6&#8208;based flexible devices retain higher initial efficiency than HWPM6&#8208;based one, demonstrating better mechanical stability. In mini&#8208;modules, they also have good solution&#8208;processability. This work demonstrates that a trimer guest strategy can significantly enhance the photovoltaic performance of low&#8208;efficiency LWPM6, offering new insights for OSCs commercialization.

Strong aromatic conjugated ammonium salt (PyPAI) spacers spontaneously form self&#8208;assembled columnar stacks via synergistic cation&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This simultaneously regulates crystallization and establishes a continuous charge transport pathway through a robust &#960;&#8208;conjugated network, overcoming dielectric confinement. Resultant 2D/3D PSCs achieve 26.41% efficiency with enhanced stability.








Abstract
2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions exhibit simultaneous improvement of efficiency and stability to meet commercial applications. However, dielectric confinement and an intrinsically uncontrollable crystallization process in 2D perovskites typically lead to large exciton binding energies and poor film quality, hindering charge dissociation, carrier transport, and ultimately device performance. Here, a strong aromatic conjugated ammonium salt spacer (PyPAI) that can spontaneously form self&#8208;assembled columnar stacks via synergistic cation&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions is introduced, thereby simultaneously regulating crystal growth and enhancing charge transfer for high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The in situ generated 2D perovskite phases effectively modulate nucleation and crystallization kinetics, yielding superior films with vertically oriented crystals and reduced grain boundary density. Concurrently, the robust aromatic &#960;&#8208;conjugated network establishes continuous energy bands, enabling highly efficient carrier shuttling between the inorganic Pb&#8208;I framework and the cationic organic layers. Consequently, PyPAI&#8208;optimized PSCs achieve a remarkable PCE of 26.41% with superior environmental and operational stability.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Selective Defects Engineering in A&#8208;Site Ordered Layered Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance Reversible Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A cation&#8208;selective defects strategy is proposed to decouple and optimize activity and durability of A&#8208;site ordered layered perovskites air electrode for reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs). A specific cations&#8208;deficient Pr(Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.95Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; displays superior activity and stability when used as an RPCCs air electrode, accelerating its commercialization.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic cells facilitate efficient chemical&#8208;electrical energy interconversion, advancing renewable energy utilization. Commercial viability, however, demands intermediate&#8208;to&#8208;low temperatures (ILT, 400&#8211;600&#160;&#176;C) operation, currently constrained by air electrode performance. A&#8208;site ordered layered perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) promises, yet faces activity and stability issues at ILT. Cation defects effectively tune defect structures in simple perovskites, boosting electrochemical performance, but their specific effects in A&#8208;site ordered perovskites with dual A&#8208;site environments remain unexplored. Here, A&#8208;site cation&#8208;selective defects are engineered to tune PBSCF's performance, with Pr&#8208;deficient (Pr0.95Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948;, p&#8208;PBSCF) and Ba/Sr&#8208;deficient (Pr(Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.95Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948;, bs&#8208;PBSCF) variants revealing distinct defects&#8208;performance relationships. Pr defects weaken Co&#9472;O covalency to activate Co sites, enhancing oxygen electrocatalytic activity. Concurrently, it lowers oxygen vacancy concentration, inhibiting hydration&#8208;induced lattice expansion. This stabilizes Ba&#9472;O/Sr&#9472;O bonds and mitigates Ba/Sr segregation, enhancing stability. However, the reduced oxygen vacancy concentration inhibits the material's hydration, lowering proton conduction and thus restricting activity enhancement. In contrast, Ba/Sr defects not only weaken Co&#9472;O covalency to activate Co sites, but also increase oxygen vacancy concentration, promoting proton and oxygen&#8208;ion transport, thereby significantly enhancing electrode activity. Furthermore, despite increased hydration, bs&#8208;PBSCF's larger&#8208;radius cation defects yield a smaller unit cell versus p&#8208;PBSCF, further strengthening Ba&#9472;O/Sr&#9472;O bonds and inhibiting Ba/Sr segregation, thus leading to superior stability.

         <title>Hydrogen Storage in Magnesium Hydride at Room Temperature Enabled by Graphene&#8208;Stabilized Multivalent Niobium Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene&#8208;stabilized multivalent niobium oxides catalyst enables rapid and reversible hydrogen storage in MgH2, even under room&#8208;temperature or subzero conditions. The in situ formation of multivalent Nb species (Nb0/Nb2+/Nb4+) facilitates barrierless H2 dissociation and enhances H diffusion. This work offers critical insights into low&#8208;temperature hydrogen storage via a synergistic electronic and catalytic mechanism.








Abstract
Reversible hydrogen storage in magnesium hydride (MgH2) remains hindered by intrinsic, complicated kinetic barriers associated with both hydrogen release and uptake, particularly under mild conditions. In this work, graphene&#8208;confined, low&#8208;crystallinity niobium oxide nanoparticles are developed to optimize the kinetic barriers across all stages of hydrogen absorption and desorption in MgH2. This is realized by the synergistic effect of in situ&#8208;generated stable multivalent niobium oxide (NbOx) and the electronically modulating graphene. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that Nb2+ enhances H2 dissociation and diffusion, while Nb4+ facilitates Mg&#9472;H bond cleavage and recombination of H2. Graphene serves a dual function by modulating the electronic environment at NbOx interfaces to facilitate charge transfer, while confining nanoparticles to prevent aggregation and hence maintain the catalytic stability of NbOx. Moreover, graphene suppresses the excessive hydrogen binding tendency of over&#8208;reduced Nb0, which otherwise traps H and impedes hydrogen diffusion. This integrated structure ensures the stabilization of active Nb species and lowers energy barriers across all key steps of hydrogen storage. As a result, an effective hydrogen absorption even at 0&#160;&#176;C and an onset hydrogen desorption temperature of 155.9&#160;&#176;C is realized. This provides a versatile strategy for engineering multivalent oxides for promoting hydrogen storage of MgH2.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Omnidirectional Wind Domain Energy Harvesting Based on Dual&#8208;Mode Complementary Strategy of Wind&#8208;Induced Vibration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;mode complementary strategy of wind&#8208;induced vibration realizes broadband breeze vibration energy harvesting and optimizes wind energy collection in a wide range of wind speed and direction, filling the gap in energy collection when the transmission line does not vibrate due to wind direction changes.








Abstract
The harvesting and utilization of vibration energy from transmission lines can effectively advance the development of smart grids. However, variations in wind direction significantly affect the vibration status of transmission lines&#8208;a problem often overlooked in research. This paper clarifies the gap problem of wind&#8208;induced vibration energy harvesting in transmission lines for the first time, and presents a dual&#8208;mode complementary strategy of wind&#8208;induced vibration for transmission lines. The core innovation is to achieve self&#8208;adaptive omnidirectional wind domain energy harvesting by wind&#8208;vibration energy collaborative response, which overcomes the limitation of single vibration energy harvesting in transmission lines that depend on a specific wind direction. The designed wind&#8208;vibration hybrid nanogenerator (W&#8208;VHNG) ingeniously integrates two different TENG mechanisms to achieve broadband breeze vibration energy capture (vibration frequency range of 5&#8211;60&#160;Hz), wide wind speed and direction adaptability (wind speed range of 4.2&#8211;14 m&#160;s&#8722;1 and the wind direction range of &#177;30&#176;), and mW&#8208;scale power output (maximum mean power of 1.33&#160;mW). Finally, the potential of the W&#8208;VHNG for self&#8208;powered sensing of transmission lines is highlighted through three application strategies. This research provides a new solution for the sustainable harvesting of complex and variable high&#8208;entropy energy in transmission lines.

         <title>Breaking the Efficiency&#8208;Stability&#8208;Sustainability Trilemma in all&#8208;perovskite Tandem Solar Modules via Oxidative Blockchain Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an oxidation&#8208;triggered blockchain molecular&#8208;assisted buried interface engineering strategy for achieving comprehensive lifecycle management of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules and breaking the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;sustainability trilemma for practical applications.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites are vital for all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules (TSMs), yet their commercialization remains limited by challenges in balancing efficiency, stability, and sustainability. Here, we presented an oxidation&#8208;triggered blockchain molecular (BCM) interface engineering strategy, which modified the poly (3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) surface and constructed a dynamic functional layer at the buried PEDOT:PSS/Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite interface through synergistic effects of biocompatible rutin molecules and their oxidation derivatives. This approach enabled full&#8208;cycle optimization from film formation to operational longevity via sequential regulation of crystallization and carrier dynamics, along with persistent defect passivation through synergistic coordination and hydrogen bonding. Resulting NBG devices achieved champion efficiencies of 23.50% (0.045 cm2) and 17.10% (10.4 cm2), respectively. The all&#8208;perovskite TSMs (10.4 cm2) attained a 23.00% aperture efficiency (an active&#8208;area efficiency of 24.30%) and retained &#8764;90% efficiency after 640 h of continuous illumination (extrapolated TPCE80 lifetime of 3900 h) and after 15 cycles of day&#8208;night fatigue tests. Additionally, BCM's dual protection effects (physical barrier and chemical chelation) reduced lead leakage of severely damaged TSMs by 90% under simulated heavy rainfall, demonstrating strong environmental resilience. This work offers a scalable molecular strategy for advancing perovskite photovoltaics from lab&#8208;scale innovation to industrial viability.

         <title>Superstructure Engineering Enables NASICON&#8208;Type Phosphate Cathodes with Increased Working Voltage and Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the calcination temperature during synthesis, the Fe3+ is preferentially migrated to Na+ vacancies to generate Fe/Na_v superstructure ordering in monoclinic Na3VFe(PO4)3 (NVFP&#8208;S), which can increase Fe&#9472;O ionic characters due to electronic structure arrangement, finally elevating the Fe2+/Fe3 redox potential from 2.37 to 2.82&#160;V, corresponding to the energy density increase from 325 to 350&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 versus the conventional Na3VFe(PO4)3 (NVFP).








Abstract
Na+ Super Ionic CONductor (NASICON)&#8208;type iron&#8208;based phosphate cathode has attained extensive research interest due to its green, low cost, and superior rate capability for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, owing to strong Fe&#9472;O covalent character in the NASICON frameworks, the low Fe2+/Fe3+ redox potential (&lt;2.5&#160;V vs Na+/Na) has led to an undesirable energy density of phosphate cathode. Herein, superstructure engineering is employed to increase the ionic characteristics of Fe&#9472;O bonds and the working voltage of Fe2+/Fe3 redox couples. The combined analysis of advanced structural characterization and theoretical calculation indicates that the Fe3+ ions can migrate to Na+ vacancies to generate Fe/Na_v superstructure ordering by manipulating calcination temperature during synthesis. The Fe delocalization and electronic structure rearrangement can enlarge the energy gap between antibonding orbital and the Fermi energy level. As a concept proof, the as&#8208;prepared Na3VFe(PO4)3 cathode with Fe/Na_v superlattice structure enables an increase in Fe2+/Fe3 redox couples from 2.37 to 2.82&#160;V, accompanied by the energy density increase from 325 to 350&#160;W h kg&#8722;1, compared with the conventional Na3VFe(PO4)3 electrode. This work paves the way for increasing the working voltage and energy density of NASICON type iron&#8208;based phosphate cathodes for SIBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Single&#8208;Atom Evaporator: Collaborative Omnibearing Light Trapping Stereo Structures for Efficient Water Transport Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D conical cone array evaporators is prepared based on high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom composite thermal management materials which only contain 3 wt.%. This design achieves a water evaporation rate of 2.86 kg&#160;m&#8722;2 along with an evaporation efficiency of 94.5% under 1.0 sunlight irradiation. The absorbed energy of cone array evaporators improved 18% and the evaporation rate is increased by 58.7% compared to the flat structure evaporator, offering significant insights for the progression of solar interface evaporation technology.








Abstract
Achieving efficient photothermal evaporation requires a synergistic integration of thermal management, water transport dynamics, and light trapping&#8212;key elements often challenging to harmonize. Herein, A high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atomic metal doped porous carbon (HESA) with ultra&#8208;low metal content of 1.77 wt.% is designed as a new type of photothermal material through a green and convenient routine, which displays tunable hierarchical nano/micro/macro&#8208;porous structure. By integrating molecular dynamics simulations with a 3D light capture structure, a HESA cone evaporator is prepared, utilizing only 3 wt.% of photothermal content. Under 1.0 sun illumination, the cone evaporator demonstrates an outstanding water evaporation rate of 2.86&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and photothermal evaporation efficiency of 94.5%. Compared to conventional flat evaporators, the cone increases absorbed energy by 18% and enhances the evaporation rate by 58.7%. Molecular dynamics analyses reveal that the evaporator significantly improves water transfer kinetics, achieving an intermediate water content nearly twice that of pure water. Complementary COMSOL simulations further validate that the conical array structure enhances light absorption and optimizes water evaporation and diffusion. This meticulously designed evaporator leverages adaptive thermal and light management strategies, offering an effective solution to longstanding challenges in solar interfacial evaporation.

         <title>A p&#8208;Type Liquid&#8208;Crystal Semiconductor with Synergistic Morphological and Charge&#8208;Dynamic Modulation Enables 20.3%&#8208;Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A classical p&#8208;type liquid crystalline organic semiconductor, 2&#8208;decyl&#8208;7&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzothienobenzothiophene (Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10), is incorporated into the organic photovoltaic active layer as a dual&#8208;functional additive. Its incorporation optimizes the blend morphology with favorable phase separation, extends exciton diffusion length, and significantly improves charge transport dynamics. The binary device based on D18:L8&#8208;BO processes using Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10 yields an impressive power conversion efficiency of 20.3%.








Abstract
Solid additives serve as an effective strategy for modulating the morphology of organic solar cell (OSC) active layers, which critically linked to devices performance. However, current solid additives primarily focus on morphological control, while their inherently weak electrical characteristics may limit improvements in carrier mobility and other electrical properties. This study innovatively introduces a p&#8208;type rod&#8208;like liquid crystalline (LC) organic&#8208;semiconductor, 2&#8208;decyl&#8208;7&#8208;phenylbenzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene (Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10), as a multifunctional additive in D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based binary OSCs. Benefiting from its strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and high intrinsic mobility, Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10 enables precise morphological control while simultaneously improving electrical properties. This dual effect synergistically extends exciton diffusion length, enhances charge separation, suppresses recombination, and significantly boosts hole mobility in blend films. Consequently, the optimized binary devices attained a competitive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.3%, alongside a short&#8208;circuit current density of 27.28&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and fill factor of 80.5%. To the best of knowledge, this performance ranks among the highest reported for binary systems exceeding the 20% PCE threshold. This work demonstrates that p&#8208;type LC semiconductors function as multifunctional additives capable of concurrently regulating morphology and boosting intrinsic electrical properties by establishing expanded charge&#8208;transport networks, presenting a promising new paradigm for advancing OSC performance.

         <title>Redefining PbS Quantum Dot Photovoltaics: p&#8208;i&#8208;n Devices with Superior Efficiency and Reproducibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>

Report a NiOx/SAM/PbS&#8208;SAM composite hole transporting layer (HTL) is reported for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PbS QD solar cells, achieving a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching 14% (certified 13.62%), surpassing the previous 9.70% p&#8208;i&#8208;n record and exceeding the certified PCE of n&#8208;i&#8208;p architecture in both efficiency and reproducibility.








Abstract
Developing diverse photovoltaic device architectures is essential not only for improving power conversion efficiency (PCE) but also for enabling seamless integration with other photovoltaic materials in high&#8208;performance tandem configurations. While n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectures have historically dominated the development of PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) solar cells, p&#8208;i&#8208;n counterparts have significantly lagged behind in efficiency, limiting their potential for further advancement. In this work, the advantage of the surface tunability of CQDs is taken by anchoring the classical self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) molecule MeO&#8208;2PACz onto PbS CQDs via ligand exchange, forming a PbS&#8208;SAM bridging&#8208;layer, which is inserted between NiOx/SAM and the CQD active layer, resulting in a NiOx/SAM/PbS&#8208;SAM composite hole transporting layer (HTL). This structure effectively passivates the buried interfacial traps and enhances hole extraction. As a result, a record PCE approaching 14% is achieved, with a certified value of 13.62%, which is not only largely surpassing the previous highest value of 9.70% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PbS QD solar cells, but also exceeds the current PCE record set by n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectures. Moreover, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n configuration exhibits excellent reproducibility, providing a robust and scalable platform for future applications, particularly as a narrow&#8208;bandgap subcell in monolithic tandem devices with wide&#8208;bandgap materials such as perovskites.

&lt;p&gt;Report a NiOx/SAM/PbS-SAM composite hole transporting layer (HTL) is reported for p-i-n PbS QD solar cells, achieving a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching 14% (certified 13.62%), surpassing the previous 9.70% p-i-n record and exceeding the certified PCE of n-i-p architecture in both efficiency and reproducibility.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing diverse photovoltaic device architectures is essential not only for improving power conversion efficiency (PCE) but also for enabling seamless integration with other photovoltaic materials in high-performance tandem configurations. While n-i-p architectures have historically dominated the development of PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) solar cells, p-i-n counterparts have significantly lagged behind in efficiency, limiting their potential for further advancement. In this work, the advantage of the surface tunability of CQDs is taken by anchoring the classical self-assembled monolayer (SAM) molecule MeO-2PACz onto PbS CQDs via ligand exchange, forming a PbS-SAM bridging-layer, which is inserted between NiOx/SAM and the CQD active layer, resulting in a NiOx/SAM/PbS-SAM composite hole transporting layer (HTL). This structure effectively passivates the buried interfacial traps and enhances hole extraction. As a result, a record PCE approaching 14% is achieved, with a certified value of 13.62%, which is not only largely surpassing the previous highest value of 9.70% for p-i-n PbS QD solar cells, but also exceeds the current PCE record set by n-i-p architectures. Moreover, the p-i-n configuration exhibits excellent reproducibility, providing a robust and scalable platform for future applications, particularly as a narrow-bandgap subcell in monolithic tandem devices with wide-bandgap materials such as perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An amorphous iron&#8208;based oxyhalide CAM breaks the conductivity&#8208;capacity trade&#8208;off associated with the MCl6 anionic framework, achieving both high ionic conductivity and high discharge capacity.








Abstract
Halide cathode active materials (CAMs) with high ionic conductivities have attracted significant attention. However, their capacity and energy density are limited by the large molar weight of the Li&#8314; transport&#8208;dependent MCl6 anionic framework. In this study, a low&#8208;cost amorphous iron&#8208;based oxyhalide LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM is introduced that overcomes the conductivity&#8208;capacity trade&#8208;off between high ionic conductivity and low discharge capacity associated with the MCl6 framework. LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM achieves dual breakthroughs, exhibiting an impressive ionic conductivity of 0.26 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, and a high specific capacity of 586 mAh g&#8722;1 via an intercalation&#8208;conversion reaction at 60&#160;&#176;C. Due to its superior ionic conductivity and capacity, LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM enables a catholyte&#8208;free electrode to achieve an exceptional energy density of &#8776;1100&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1cathode and a power density of 2185&#160;W kg&#8722;1cathode at 60&#160;&#176;C, surpassing reported halide&#8208; and oxide&#8208;based CAMs by 1.5 to 3 times. Additionally, LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM is highly cost&#8208;effective ($9.3 kg&#8722;1) and exhibits remarkable humidity stability, retaining 100% of its capacity after 12 h of exposure to 5 &#177; 1% humidity. The multifunctional iron&#8208;based oxyhalide CAMs open new avenues for advancing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Frequency Switching Neuristor for Realizing Intrinsic Plasticity and Enabling Robust Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A frequency switching (FS) neuristor is proposed, comprising a Mott memristor and a valence change mechanism (VCM) memristor. The FS neuristor exhibits a multi&#8208;level frequency&#8211;voltage (f&#8211;V) characteristics, enabling the implementation of neuronal intrinsic plasticity transfer functions. By leveraging the FS neuristor's intrinsic plasticity, a more reliable and robust sparse neural network can achieve, well&#8208;suited for edge neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The human brain's efficiency and adaptability in processing information is largely attributed to spatiotemporal spiking activities and intrinsic plasticity&#8212;the ability of neurons to autonomously modulate their excitability. Mott memristors, with their threshold switching characteristics, have been effectively utilized as artificial neurons, or neuristors, to generate spiking activities. However, the implementation of intrinsic plasticity and its significance in neuromorphic computing has yet to be systematically explored. Here, a frequency switching (FS) neuristor is presented that emulates neuron's intrinsic plasticity characteristics. By combining a volatile Mott memristor with a non&#8208;volatile valence change memory (VCM) memristor, the FS neuristor achieves programmable multi&#8208;level frequency&#8211;voltage (f&#8211;V) characteristics analogous to the transfer functions of neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Through device&#8208;based simulations of sparse neural networks, it is proposed that this intrinsic plasticity acts as memory and processor itself, enhancing network performance and reducing energy consumption. Additionally, intrinsic plasticity endows the network with structural plasticity, enabling full recovery of the network's performance after random neuron damage, suggesting a pathway toward more adaptive and resilient neuromorphic computing systems.

         <title>Biomimetic 3D&#8208;Printed Adaptive Hydrogel Bioadhesives Featuring Superior Infection Resistance for Challenging Tissue Adhesion, Hemostasis, and Healthcare</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel bioadhesives (PTLAs) are designed to address the limitations of existing bioadhesives, offering solutions for challenging tissue adhesion and enhanced healthcare. These PTLAs feature robust wet/underwater tissue adhesion/sealing, superior freeze/pressure and infection resistance, and adaptive self&#8208;healing/gelling capacity, presenting transformative potential as bio&#8208;tapes, bio&#8208;bandages, bio&#8208;sealants, bio&#8208;carriers, etc., and inspiring next&#8208;generation bioadhesives design.








Abstract
Conventional suturing and stapling cause additional trauma, pain, and cost for patients. As alternatives, existing bioadhesives suffer from imprecise fabrication, limited wet tissue adhesion, and insufficient biological functionalities for effective wound management. This work proposes biomimetic hydrogel bioadhesives composed of modified natural tannic acid (TA), hyperbranched polylysine (HPL), and acrylic acid (AA), abbreviated PTLAs, to offer solutions for tissue adhesion under challenging environments (underwater, body fluids, cold, pressure), and for enhanced healthcare. These PTLAs are fabricated via 3D printing, enabling the precise and controlled production of bioadhesives that are customized in a personalized manner with great reproducibility. Inspired by molluscs, developed PTLAs exhibit robust wet and underwater tissue adhesion, outperforming commercial and many recently reported bioadhesives. Ex vivo lamb and in vivo rat models demonstrate ultrafast (5&#160;s) and efficient sealing and hemostasis. Exceptional freeze resistance and pressure resistance further expand their applicability to extreme environments. Meanwhile, coupled with superior infection resistance, PTLAs ensure enhanced wound healthcare while sealing and hemostasis. Further, their self&#8208;gelling feature supports dry powder adhesion/sealing applications, practical packaging, and long&#8208;term storage. Overall, adaptive tissue&#8208;like PTLAs present transformative potential as bio&#8208;tapes, bio&#8208;bandages, bio&#8208;sealants, bio&#8208;carriers, etc., paving the way for next&#8208;generation bioadhesives design and enhanced healthcare solutions.

         <title>Steep&#8208;Slope CuInP2S6 Ferroionic Threshold Switching Field&#8208;Effect Transistor for Implementation of Artificial Spiking Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of an energy&#8208;efficient and biologically inspired spiking neuron device based on a CuInP2S6 (CIPS) ferroionic threshold switching field&#8208;effect transistor TS&#8208;FET is reported. The device demonstrates essential neuronal behaviors, such as leaky integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire dynamics, a tunable firing threshold, and spatiotemporal processing, all without requiring auxiliary reset circuitry. Furthermore, a spiking neural network (SNN) is implemented by integrating CIPS&#8208;based synaptic and neuron devices.








Abstract
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered considerable attention as energy&#8208;efficient and biologically inspired computing paradigms. However, despite the growing interest, the development of hardware&#8208;based SNNs has remained limited, primarily because of insufficient research on hardware&#8208;based spiking neuron devices. In this study, a CuInP2S6 (CIPS)&#8208;based threshold switching field&#8208;effect transistor (TS&#8208;FET) is presented, featuring steep switching characteristics, and demonstrate its potential as an energy&#8208;efficient spiking neuron device. The proposed device exhibits outstanding characteristics: ultra&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS &#8776;7.5 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), high on/off current ratio (&gt;107), and ultra&#8208;low off current (&#8776;0.3 pA) due to the ferroionic properties of CIPS. The tunable dynamics for Cu+ ion migration induce a phase transition, leading to sharp resistance switching and efficient spiking. This device successfully mimics key neuronal dynamics, including leaky integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire, threshold tuning, and spatiotemporal dynamics, without requiring auxiliary reset circuits. Furthermore, SNN is constructed by integrating CIPS&#8208;based synaptic and neuron devices and evaluate face classification performance using an unsupervised learning approach, achieving a recognition accuracy of 95.83% via the lateral inhibition function of the neuron device. The findings highlight the potential of CIPS TS&#8208;FET as energy&#8208;efficient spiking neuron device applications for next&#8208;generation SNN&#8208;based neuromorphic computing systems.

     alt="Steep-Slope CuInP2S6 Ferroionic Threshold Switching Field-Effect Transistor for Implementation of Artificial Spiking Neuron"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of an energy-efficient and biologically inspired spiking neuron device based on a CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (CIPS) ferroionic threshold switching field-effect transistor TS-FET is reported. The device demonstrates essential neuronal behaviors, such as leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics, a tunable firing threshold, and spatiotemporal processing, all without requiring auxiliary reset circuitry. Furthermore, a spiking neural network (SNN) is implemented by integrating CIPS-based synaptic and neuron devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered considerable attention as energy-efficient and biologically inspired computing paradigms. However, despite the growing interest, the development of hardware-based SNNs has remained limited, primarily because of insufficient research on hardware-based spiking neuron devices. In this study, a CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (CIPS)-based threshold switching field-effect transistor (TS-FET) is presented, featuring steep switching characteristics, and demonstrate its potential as an energy-efficient spiking neuron device. The proposed device exhibits outstanding characteristics: ultra-steep subthreshold swing (SS &#8776;7.5 mV&#160;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high on/off current ratio (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;), and ultra-low off current (&#8776;0.3 pA) due to the ferroionic properties of CIPS. The tunable dynamics for Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion migration induce a phase transition, leading to sharp resistance switching and efficient spiking. This device successfully mimics key neuronal dynamics, including leaky integrate-and-fire, threshold tuning, and spatiotemporal dynamics, without requiring auxiliary reset circuits. Furthermore, SNN is constructed by integrating CIPS-based synaptic and neuron devices and evaluate face classification performance using an unsupervised learning approach, achieving a recognition accuracy of 95.83% via the lateral inhibition function of the neuron device. The findings highlight the potential of CIPS TS-FET as energy-efficient spiking neuron device applications for next-generation SNN-based neuromorphic computing systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop and Sustainable 4D Printing of Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Sulfur&#8208;Rich Polymer Composites for Autonomous Task Execution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Closed&#8208;loop and sustainable 4D printing of sulfur&#8208;rich polymer composites is demonstrated for the first time using loosely crosslinked poly(phenylene polysulfide) networks (PSNs) and their magnetic composites (MPSNs). 3D&#8208;printed PSNs and MPSNs exhibit shape&#8208;morphing capabilities and can be directly reprinted into new form factors and magneto&#8208;responsive soft robots. 3D&#8208;printed MPSNs can serve as an on&#8208;demand catalyst&#8208;releasable stirring bar for chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;programmable polymer networks derived from waste elemental sulfur hold great potential for diverse applications such as 4D printing and soft robotics. However, their crosslinked nature makes it challenging to 3D print complex geometry for soft robots. Herein, a closed&#8208;loop 4D printing strategy is reported of poly(phenylene polysulfide) networks (PSNs) and their magnetic particle composites (MPSNs) to fabricate multi&#8208;functional soft robots with programmable shape&#8208;morphing capabilities. The dynamic S&#9472;S bonds within the loosely crosslinked PSNs impart shear&#8208;thinning behavior, enabling hot&#8208;melt extrusion of both PSNs and MPSNs into complex architectures. After shape&#8208;programming, 3D&#8208;printed PSN and MPSN structures exhibit heat&#8208; or light&#8208;triggered shape recovery and allow modular assembly for spatially selective shape&#8208;morphing governed by the distinct glass transition temperatures of the PSN series. These architectures can be readily reprinted into new form factors, demonstrating a closed&#8208;loop and sustainable 4D printing. With multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness and solvent resistance provided by the PSN composites, the MPSN capsule serves as an on&#8208;demand catalyst&#8208;releasing magnetic stirring bar in a reagent&#8208;containing solution, autonomously releasing catalysts at a preset temperature to facilitate carbamate synthesis. The 4D printable MPSNs offer a sustainable platform not only for adaptable shape&#8208;morphing and dynamic actuation but also for autonomous task execution in next&#8208;generation soft robotic applications.

         <title>Regular Tandem Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with over 51% External Quantum Efficiency for Next&#8208;Generation Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a regular tandem quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diode achieving over 51% external quantum efficiency through systematic optimization of both charge injection balance and light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Thanks to the fast response of this device, the obtained 8 &#215; 8 passive&#8208;matrix displays can present flicker&#8208;free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness.








Abstract
Despite excellent efficiency and stability achieved in regular single&#8208;unit quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), regular tandem QLEDs still suffer from limited device performance, lagging far behind the inverted tandem QLEDs. Here, novel regular tandem QLEDs are demonstrated with an ultrathin (&#8776;4 nm) indium tin oxide (ITO) charge generation layer (CGL). Through systematic optimization of charge injection balance and light out&#8208;coupling efficiency, the resulting tandem QLEDs can exhibit a record&#8208;breaking EQE of 51.2%, an exceptional T95 lifetime of &#8776;31383 h (at 1000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2), and an ultralow turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.8 V, which represent the highest performance metrics reported to date for regular tandem QLEDs. Thanks to the fast response of this tandem device (&#8776;4.8 &#181;s), the first&#8208;ever fabricated 8 &#215; 8 passive&#8208;matrix displays can present flicker&#8208;free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness, demonstrating that the achievable color display capability and driving scheme of QLED displays can be expanded by using the tandem architecture. It is believed the results will significantly promote the development of regular tandem QLEDs, which will lead to unprecedented improvements in device efficiency and stability, accelerating their application in next&#8208;generation displays and lighting.

         <title>Reducing Structural Distortion by Tailoring Orbital Interactions in High&#8208;Voltage Polyanionic Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main structural distortion of the KVPO4F cathode is attributed to the V5+ octahedral distortion. Low energy&#8208;level Mn is introduced into V site to enhance the matching of the central transition metal ion's 3d orbitals with the ligands&#8217; 2p orbitals in &#963; and &#960; symmetry. The strong orbital interactions suppress octahedron distortion and structure degradation to endure steady&#160;ion extraction.








Abstract
The structural distortion of electrode materials in battery systems usually results in the structure degradation and capacity fading upon cycling. However, the fundamental mechanism about the structural distortion remains elusive. A critical issue has emerged concerning the utilization of high&#8208;voltage potassium vanadium fluorophosphate compound (KVPO4F) as a competitive cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion battery applications. In this work, it is initially identified that the primary distortion in KVPO4F cathode is octahedra distortion. The weak orbital interactions among central transition metal ions with ligands in an octahedron play a pivotal role in the structural distortion, resulting in an accumulation of microstrain during the cycles. This cognition serves as the foundation for the introduction of low energy&#8208;level Mn into the V sites to suppress the structure distortion and lattice microstrain. The multi&#8208;electron 3d orbitals of Mn sites tend to interact with the &#963; and &#960; symmetry&#8208;matched 2p orbitals of ligands, thereby facilitating the formation of stable octahedrons to endure ion extraction steadily in high voltage. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of structure degradation based on the octahedral distortion, thereby facilitating the enhancement of stability in high&#8208;voltage cathodes.

         <title>Programmable Active Phase Reconstruction in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Toward High&#8208;Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study harnesses multimetallic synergy to program dynamic evolution of 2D nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks to architect high&#8208;activity oxyhydroxides phase for oxygen evolution. The cascade control of reconstruction dynamics, terminated structure state, and catalytic pathways deciphers &#8220;reconstruction&#8208;catalysis&#8221; programming principles. This paradigm shift enables on&#8208;demand design of efficient electrocatalysts through proactive reconstruction steering.








Abstract
Orchestrated manipulation of the dynamic structural evolution of catalytic materials in service represents an effective approach to rationally architect the active phase for highly efficient catalysis. Herein, this study reports a 2D ultrathin nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) pre&#8208;catalyst, where multimetallic electronic cooperativity enables on&#8208;demand hierarchical regulation of the structural evolution as well as the catalytic process of the reconstruction&#8208;derived active phase, delivering oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance superior to benchmark RuO2. Tailored cobalt&#8208;iron co&#8208;substitution in nickel&#8208;based MOF strategically engineers the overall structural flexibility, controllably promoting the reconstruction process in alkaline media into ligand&#8208;anchored nickel oxyhydroxide active phases. Crucially, the controlled modulation of the structural state of reconstructed phases induces targeted metal&#8208;oxygen electronic interplay, steering active oxygen intermediate reconfiguration and reducing the thermodynamic bottleneck of the rate&#8208;determining step, ultimately achieving optimized catalytic pathways. This work precisely constructs MOF&#8208;derived reconstructed active phases and elucidates a programmed optimization mechanism governed by multimetallic electronic interplay, which dynamically bridges structural transformation and catalytic activity enhancement. A promising approach is showcased to accurately design high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts through programming dynamic structural evolution.

Tailored cobalt-iron co-substitution in nickel-based MOF strategically engineers the overall structural flexibility, controllably promoting the reconstruction process in alkaline media into ligand-anchored nickel oxyhydroxide active phases. Crucially, the controlled modulation of the structural state of reconstructed phases induces targeted metal-oxygen electronic interplay, steering active oxygen intermediate reconfiguration and reducing the thermodynamic bottleneck of the rate-determining step, ultimately achieving optimized catalytic pathways. This work precisely constructs MOF-derived reconstructed active phases and elucidates a programmed optimization mechanism governed by multimetallic electronic interplay, which dynamically bridges structural transformation and catalytic activity enhancement. A promising approach is showcased to accurately design high-efficiency electrocatalysts through programming dynamic structural evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diamond&#8208;Inspired DNA Hydrogel Based on Tetrahedral Framework Nucleic Acids for Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by diamond, this study introduces a DNA hydrogel formulated with tetrahedral DNA nanostructure, which exhibits enhanced mechanical strength. It exhibits multiple functionalities, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, hemostatic performance, etc. Single&#8208;cell sequencing indicates this hydrogel disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cascade, promotes extracellular matrix formation and re&#8208;epithelialization, ultimately facilitating burn wound healing.








Abstract
Burn wounds frequently pose high risks of a prolonged healing process and even death due to the persistent reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated inflammatory cascade. There is an urgent requirement for advanced dressings modulating the immune microenvironment surrounding the wound. DNA hydrogels have been preliminarily investigated in tissue regeneration due to their excellent permeability, editability, and biocompatibility. However, their broader applications have been limited by poor mechanical properties, and their roles in tissue regeneration remain insufficiently explored. Inspired by diamond, this study introduces a DNA hydrogel formulated with tetrahedral framework DNA, which exhibits enhanced mechanical strength due to its stable structure. Additionally, it exhibits multiple functionalities, including ROS scavenging, hemostatic performance, adhesion, injectability, shear&#8208;thinning behavior, and self&#8208;healing capability. Single&#8208;cell sequencing analysis indicates that this hydrogel disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cascade and promotes the transformation of pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophages into an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. This effect promotes extracellular matrix formation and re&#8208;epithelialization with changes in the communication between macrophages, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes, ultimately facilitating burn wound healing on the skin of mice. In summary, this study not only presents a novel approach to bolstering the mechanical strength of pure DNA hydrogels but also marks a systematic evaluation of DNA hydrogels in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Density in Dielectric Polymers Near Glass Transition Temperature by Molecular Twisting Conformation Locking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel molecular twisting conformation locking strategy is proposed and demonstrated to simultaneously suppress intrachain and interchain electron migration pathways in high glass transition temperature (Tg) dielectric polymers, addressing their compromised electrical insulation at elevated operating temperatures near their Tg. A novel dielectric polymer featuring molecular twisting conformation locking maintains stable operation at 250&#160;&#176;C while achieving ultrahigh discharge energy density of 4.3 J cm&#8722;3.








Abstract
Dielectric polymers with high operating temperatures (To) for capacitive energy storage applications are urgently needed in new energy vehicles and power electronics. Polymers with high glass transition temperatures (Tg), such as Kapton polyimide (Tg&#8776;360&#160;&#176;C), suffer low To (&lt; 150&#160;&#176;C) due to electron delocalization between donor and acceptor units. Here, a molecular twisting conformation&#8208;locking strategy is proposed for high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers to block intrachain and interchain electron migration pathways. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the elevated leakage current in polyimides originates from enhanced electron delocalization induced by intrachain imide ring planarization and interchain donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking. The molecular twisting conformation&#8208;locking disrupts intrachain imide ring planarization and the face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking of interchain D&#8208;A units. As a result, the designed polymer exhibits an ultrahigh resistivity of 6.8 &#215; 1013 &#937; m&#8722;1 at 250&#160;&#176;C (close to its Tg), surpassing the 2.8 &#215; 1013 &#937; m&#8722;1 of PEI at 50&#160;&#176;C. Simultaneously, it achieves an ultrahigh discharge energy density of 4.3 J cm&#8722;3, outperforming existing high&#8208;Tg dielectric polymers. This study introduces a design paradigm to address the challenge of dielectric polymers that do not function properly as ambient temperatures approach their Tg.

         <title>Multispectrum Electromagnetic Response in FeNiHo/C Heterodimensional Structure for Microwave Absorption and Multimode Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a novel FeNiHo/C hierarchical heterodimensional structured with multispectrum&#8208;coupling electromagnetic response. Through multi&#8208;scale polar heterointerface engineering, the heterodimensional structure achieves ultra&#8208;broadband microwave absorption, in situ microwave frequency&#8208;agile property, and multimode photodetections. These results inspire the development of electromagnetic multifunctional materials.








Abstract
Multispectrum response technology is the key to developing multifunctional electromagnetic devices in cross&#8208;field applications. Traditional methods rely on integrating complex multi&#8208;material systems, leading to bulkier and costlier devices. Here, a hierarchical heterodimensional structure composed of FeNiHo alloy and carbon matrix achieves autonomous multispectrum&#8208;coupling electromagnetic response between microwave and ultraviolet through polar interface engineering. In the microwave band, the heterodimensional structure exhibits outstanding microwave absorption performance with high reflection loss of &#8722;46.87 dB and ultra&#8208;wide absorption bandwidth of 8.96 GHz. Furthermore, the antenna arrays based on the heterodimensional structure demonstrate in situ microwave frequency&#8208;agile property by a coupled ultraviolet stimulation, where the largest frequency modulation range reaches 5.05 GHz in Ku&#8208;band. In the ultraviolet band, multimode photodetectors constructed by the heterodimensional structure possess excellent responsivity and accurate decoding ability for anti&#8208;interference ultraviolet communication. Particularly, the metamaterial detector achieves analog signal communication for the first time by microwave&#8208;ultraviolet coupling response. This work pioneers a novel approach to developing multifunctional electromagnetic materials for multispectrum applications.

         <title>Sustainable Clay Electrolytes for Aqueous Batteries: All&#8208;Temperature Single&#8208;Ion Conductor with Nanoconfined Hydration Shell Reorganization Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A specifically designed clay&#8208;based single&#8208;ion conductor with unique hydration&#8208;shell reconfiguration mechanism is utilized as the all&#8208;temperature electrolyte to endow the working temperature range of the aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries from &#8722;60 to 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Ion transport property and water structure of electrolytes are two of the most important issues for aqueous batteries, especially when operated at extreme temperatures. To this end, a sepiolite&#8208;based clay electrolyte (SCYE) with nanoconfined channels as single&#8208;ion conductor is proposed. The inner Zn2+ and anions solvation shells exhibit fascinating hydration&#8208;shell reconfiguration behavior compared to the conventional Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous electrolytes. The bond&#8208;orientational order of the Zn2+ and anions is broken and highly developed, respectively, thus improving the Zn2+ transference number to 0.97. Moreover, free water molecules are dramatically reduced in the SCYE, contributing to improved anti&#8208;freezing ability and thermal stability. The single&#8208;ion transport property of the SCYE endows the PANI||Zn full cells with excellent rate performances, with an &#8776;84% capacity retention from 1 to 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Besides, full cells with the SCYE achieve 17,000 cycles under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C with a specific capacity of 130 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and considerable performances even at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, while they can operate over 3000 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C with 87% capacity retention. This attracting effect can be expanded to several other clay materials, all presenting improved ion transport capability, which paves a road for future aqueous batteries across extreme temperatures.

Besides, full cells with the SCYE achieve 17,000 cycles under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C with a specific capacity of 130 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and considerable performances even at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, while they can operate over 3000 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C with 87% capacity retention. This attracting effect can be expanded to several other clay materials, all presenting improved ion transport capability, which paves a road for future aqueous batteries across extreme temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Production Through Hierarchically Ordered Porous Carbon for Self&#8208;Sustaining Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green hydrogen production through a coupled self&#8208;sustaining solar&#8208;enabled system that couples atmospheric water harvesting with PEM water electrolysis (AWH&#8208;PEMWE), offering a novel pathway for clean water generation and green hydrogen production. The system operates without the need for carrier gases or external energy input accessories, enabling a fully solar&#8208;driven process with zero carbon emission throughout the hydrogen production cycle.








Abstract
Green hydrogen production by proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) powered by clean energy is a promising and environmentally friendly technology. However, it relies on a high&#8208;purity water source, which is limited in regions facing water scarcity. Here, a coupled self&#8208;sustaining solar&#8208;enabled system is reported that couples atmospheric water harvesting with PEM water electrolysis (AWH&#8208;PEMWE), offering a novel pathway for clean water generation and green hydrogen production. The atmospheric water harvester (AWH) component utilizes N and O co&#8208;doped hydrophilic ordered porous carbon, engineered with an interconnected hierarchical porous structure with prosperous channels for efficient mass transport. It enables effective interfacial solar evaporation for water release, achieving a record&#8208;high water harvesting capacity of 0.49 L kg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 40% relative humidity (RH). During outdoor tests, the AWH&#8208;PEMWE system reaches a peak green hydrogen production rate of 204 mL h&#8722;1 at midday using only atmospheric water as feedstock. Remarkably, the system remains operational under ultra&#8208;low humidity conditions down to 20% RH, addressing the challenge of water availability in arid environments. Importantly, the system operates without the need for carrier gases or external energy input accessories, enabling a fully solar&#8208;driven process with zero carbon emission throughout the hydrogen production cycle.

         <title>Decoupling of Carrier Pathways in Au/Cu&#8208;Zn3In2S6 Through Bulk Hole Trapping and Surface Hot Electron Accumulation Enhances Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and implement Au&#8208;Cu co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 catalyst with spatially decoupling charge carriers across bulk and surface sites, which effectively suppresses carrier recombination, drives surface hot electron accumulation and stabilizes intermediates for photocatalytic oxygen reduction. The optimized catalyst achieves an H2O2 evolution rate of 94.2 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 using pure water without any sacrificial agents, far exceeding most reported photocatalysts. 








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis offers a sustainable route to H2O2 production but is hindered by charge recombination and non&#8208;selective reactive species generation, resulting in parasitic reactions that reduce selectivity and yield. Here, Au&#8208;Cu co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 (Au/Cu&#8208;d/ZIS) is presented, a catalyst that spatially decouples charge carriers across bulk and surface sites, suppressing recombination and stabilizing intermediates for photocatalytic oxygen reduction. Cu doping introduces trap states that localize holes in the bulk and improve the separation and transportation of bulk photogenerated carriers. Plasmonic Au nanoparticles drive surface hot electron accumulation and further contribute to the oxygen reduction reaction. The optimized catalyst achieves an H2O2 evolution rate of 94.2 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 using pure water without any sacrificial agents, outperforming pristine Zn3In2S6 by nearly threefold. DRIFTS identifies stabilized oxygenated species on the catalyst surface, and DFT calculations demonstrate that Cu trap states lower energy barriers for &#8226;O2&#8722; formation, while Au NPs enhance the charge transfer and ORR reaction between ZIS and O2. The catalyst maintains stability and reusability, producing 2300 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 of H2O2 under natural sunlight over 4 h with consistent performance across multiple cycles. Furthermore, it is successfully applied for bacterial sterilization and pharmaceutical pollutant degradation, demonstrating its potential for environmental remediation.

         <title>Competitive Crystallization Modulated Phase&#8208;Homogeneous Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for Monolithic Perovskite&#8208;Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenyl phosphate is utilized to modulate Br/I competitive crystallization for improving compositional distribution, efficiency, and stability in wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) PSCs. The homogeneous WBG perovskite boosts the efficiencies up to record values of 21.39% (1.72&#160;eV) and 19.64% (1.84&#160;eV), and maintains 95% of its initial efficiency for 1100&#160;h. The resulting PO&#8208;TSCs achieve champion efficiencies of 26.11% (certified 25.07%).








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites with tunable bandgaps can be integrated into organic solar cells to construct tandem solar cells (TSCs), enabling the device to exceed the Shockley&#8208;Queisser efficiency limit. However, ionic mismatches and crystallization kinetics in WBG perovskites trigger inhomogeneous phase distribution and defects. In this work, a triphenyl phosphate (Tri&#8208;PyPA) is utilized to modulate Br/I competitive crystallization and compositional distribution. The preferential coordination of Tri&#8208;PyPA with PbBr2 reduces the effective charge on Pb2+ and changes the electrostatic interaction between Pb2+ and Br&#8722;/I&#8722; ions. It suppresses the rapid migration of highly diffusive (Br&#8208;rich) components during crystallization. Meanwhile, Tri&#8208;PyPA forms a six&#8208;membered hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring structure with formamidinium cations by H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O&#9552;P interaction to immobilize cations. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation allows Tri&#8208;PyPA to form a compact molecular coverage on the (100) facet, significantly reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination and elevating the ion migration energy barriers. The homogeneous WBG perovskites boost the efficiency up to record values of 21.39% and 19.64% for 1.72&#160;eV and 1.84&#160;eV devices, respectively. The unencapsulated device can maintain 95% of its initial efficiency after illumination for 1100&#160;h. The champion perovskite&#8208;organic TSC shows an efficiency of 26.11% (certified 25.07%) and retains 80% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation for 1000&#160;h.

         <title>Asymmetric Stress Engineering of Dense Dislocations in Brittle Superconductors for Strong Vortex Pinning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stress&#8208;engineering strategy enables the direct formation of ultra&#8208;dense dislocations in rigid crystals through extrusion&#8208;induced asymmetric stress fields. These tilted dislocation arrays act as efficient pinning centers for magnetic vortices, leading to a fivefold enhancement in the current&#8208;carrying capacity of iron&#8208;based superconductors under high magnetic fields. The method provides a general, scalable pathway for dislocation design in brittle materials.









Abstract

Large lossless currents in high&#8208;temperature superconductors (HTS) critically rely on dense defects with suitable size and dimensionality to pin vortices, with dislocations being particularly effective due to their 1D geometry to interact extensively with vortex lines. However, in non&#8208;metallic compounds such as HTS with rigid lattices, conventional deformation methods typically lead to catastrophic fracture rather than dislocation&#8208;mediated plasticity, making it a persistent challenge to introduce dislocations at high density. Here, an asymmetric stress field strategy is proposed using extrusion to directly nucleate a high density of dislocations in HTS by activating shear&#8208;driven lattice slip and twisting under superimposed hydrostatic compression. As demonstrated in iron&#8208;based superconductors (IBS), atomic displacements of &#8776;1 &#197; trigger the formation of tilted dislocation lines with a density approaching that of metals. With further structural refinement, these dislocations serve as strong pinning centers that lead to a fivefold enhancement in the current&#8208;carrying capacity of IBS at 33 tesla (T), along with low anisotropy and a large irreversibility field.

     alt="Asymmetric Stress Engineering of Dense Dislocations in Brittle Superconductors for Strong Vortex Pinning"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stress-engineering strategy enables the direct formation of ultra-dense dislocations in rigid crystals through extrusion-induced asymmetric stress fields. These tilted dislocation arrays act as efficient pinning centers for magnetic vortices, leading to a fivefold enhancement in the current-carrying capacity of iron-based superconductors under high magnetic fields. The method provides a general, scalable pathway for dislocation design in brittle materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Large lossless currents in high-temperature superconductors (HTS) critically rely on dense defects with suitable size and dimensionality to pin vortices, with dislocations being particularly effective due to their 1D geometry to interact extensively with vortex lines. However, in non-metallic compounds such as HTS with rigid lattices, conventional deformation methods typically lead to catastrophic fracture rather than dislocation-mediated plasticity, making it a persistent challenge to introduce dislocations at high density. Here, an asymmetric stress field strategy is proposed using extrusion to directly nucleate a high density of dislocations in HTS by activating shear-driven lattice slip and twisting under superimposed hydrostatic compression. As demonstrated in iron-based superconductors (IBS), atomic displacements of &#8776;1 &#197; trigger the formation of tilted dislocation lines with a density approaching that of metals. With further structural refinement, these dislocations serve as strong pinning centers that lead to a fivefold enhancement in the current-carrying capacity of IBS at 33 tesla (T), along with low anisotropy and a large irreversibility field. This work not only establishes a scalable route to engineer pinning landscapes in HTS but also offers a generalizable framework for manipulating dislocation structures in rigid crystalline systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Sustainable Interfacial Evaporators from Lignin for Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developes a series of sustainable metal&#8208;lignin composites via a one&#8208;pot reaction between lignin and heavy metal ion&#8208;containing wastewater. The resulting metal&#8208;lignin composites demonstrates significantly enhanced light absorption and photothermal conversion performances compared to unmodified lignin, which are originated from the synergistic effects of oxidation, coordination, and the formation of metal oxides. The metal&#8208;lignin composites are architecturally structured into evaporators, with the optimized evaporator demonstrating an elevated evaporation rate of 2.88&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, also with long&#8208;term stability, efficient wastewater and seawater purification capacities, and notable economic benefits.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation technology has emerged as a promising solution for heavy metal&#8208;containing wastewater treatment, owing to its environmentally friendly and sustainable energy input advantages. However, the development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;efficiency photothermal agents with enhanced heavy&#8208;metal ion tolerance remains a significant challenge for advancing practical solar&#8208;powered wastewater treatment. Herein, we developed a series of metal&#8208;lignin composites, through a one&#8208;pot reaction involving lignin and heavy metal&#8208;contained wastewater, which demonstrated outstanding light&#8208;harvesting efficiency and photothermal conversion properties. The resulting metal&#8208;lignin composites can be efficiently fabricated into evaporators via 3D printing technology for wastewater treatment. The optimized evaporator achieves an exceptional water evaporation rate of 2.88&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation while demonstrating outstanding performance in both seawater and heavy metal&#8208;containing wastewater systems. Moreover, the evaporator exhibits no significant decline in evaporation rate during continuous wastewater treatment over 7 days, highlighting its exceptional durability and long&#8208;term stability. Finally, techno&#8208;economic analysis estimates the production cost of clean water by the evaporator at 0.372&#160;$&#160;m&#8722;3, below the industry average and even approaching the globally reported lowest threshold for reverse osmosis desalination. This work is believed to offer valuable insights into achieving cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient solar&#8208;driven wastewater purification technologies from lignin.

         <title>Bioinspired Polyimide/Carbon Nanotube Aerogels With Core&#8208;Radiating and Omasum&#8208;Like Morphology toward Excellent Electromagnetic Shielding and Superior Elasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A morphogenetic approach is established to precisely coordinate the precursor thermodynamics by tuning the carbon nanotube (CNT) content and precursor concentration in the framework of the freeze&#8208;drying method. Consequently, polyimide/CNT aerogels with unprecedented triaxial hierarchical architectures (macroscopic core&#8208;radiating patterns, microscopic omasum&#8208;like folds, and nanoscopic CNT bridges) are obtained.








Abstract
Lightweight polymer&#8208;based electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials exhibiting good mechanical adaptability and thermal stability are pivotal for next&#8208;generation electronics. However, conventional approaches utilized to enhance the EMI shielding efficiency (SE) through porous architectures often compromise the structural integrity of the material or its EMI shielding performance under dynamic deformation. Herein, a morphogenetic approach is proposed to precisely coordinate the precursor thermodynamics by tuning the carbon nanotube (CNT) content and precursor concentration in the framework of the freeze&#8208;drying method. With this method, polyimide/CNT aerogels with unprecedented triaxial hierarchical architectures (macroscopic core&#8208;radiating patterns, microscopic omasum&#8208;like folds, and nanoscopic CNT bridges) are obtained. The synergy between these multiscale structures extends the dissipation pathways of electromagnetic waves by inducing multiple reflections, yielding an EMI SE of 71&#160;dB and an ultrahigh specific efficiency (6470&#160;dB cm2 g&#8722;1). Remarkably, the C67&#8208;5.0 aerogels also exhibit enhanced EMI shielding performance with temperature (5.0% improvement at 350&#160;&#176;C), a negative Poisson's ratio (around &#8722;0.28), and structural stability (&#8776;90% height retention after 500 compression cycles). This unique combination of a high EMI SE, outstanding mechanical properties, and excellent structural compressibility opens new avenues for designing adaptive EMI shielding systems for application to aerospace and electronics industries.

         <title>Optimizing the Electron Density of PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;Based Solid Polymer Electrolyte by Donor&#8211;Acceptor COF Toward High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

The Br&#8208;COF with D&#8208;A characteristic is incorporated into PVDF&#8208;HFP, which can optimize electron density to create electron&#8208;rich environments, further promoting Li+ migration and LiF&#8208;rich SEI formation. The D and A units of Br&#8208;COF are confined in particular locations to create independent electron&#8208;hole transference channels, achieving rapid electron transfer dynamics to optimize electron density around TFSI&#8722; to promote its decomposition for the formation of high LiF content SEI. Furthermore, the Br&#8208;groups as electron&#8208;rich sites can promote Li salt dissociation through electrostatic interaction, resulting in rapid Li+ transference.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries equipped with solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices due to their excellent safety and good interfacial contact. However, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and sluggish Li+ transport kinetics inhibit their practical application. Herein, a bromine&#8208;modified covalent organic framework (Br&#8208;COF) with donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) characteristics is designed and incorporated into PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;based SPEs to regulate electron density for promoting Li+ migration and high stability LiF&#8208;rich SEI formation to solve these problems. The D and A units of Br&#8208;COF are confined in particular locations to create independent electron&#8208;hole transference channels, achieving rapid electron transfer dynamics, thereby promoting TFSI&#8722; decomposition to obtain high LiF content SEI. Meanwhile, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing Br&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from tetra(p&#8208;amino&#8208;phenyl)porphyrin (TAPP) to create an electron&#8208;rich environment, resulting in the regulation of the Li+ local coordination environment to facilitate Li+ transference. Consequently, Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP exhibits high ionic conductivity (9.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.78). Li|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li cells achieve excellent cycling life (3000 h) at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2, and LFP|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li and NCM90|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li cells can cycle steadily over 2000 cycles and 250 cycles, respectively. This study provides a reference basis for regulating the electron density of PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;based SPEs to enhance the performance of solid&#8208;state LMBs.
