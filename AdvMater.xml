         <title>Strain Engineering: A Boosting Strategy for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Whilst the photocatalytic technique is considered to be one of the most significant routes to address the energy crisis and global environmental challenges, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency is still far from satisfying practical industrial requirements, which can be traced to the suboptimal bandgap and electronic structure of photocatalysts. Strain engineering is a universal scheme that can finely tailor the bandgap and electronic structure of materials, hence supplying a novel avenue to boost their photocatalytic performance. Accordingly, to explore promising directions for certain breakthroughs in strained photocatalysts, we provide an overview on the recent advances of strain engineering from the basics of strain effect, creations of strained materials, as well as characterizations and simulations of strain level. Besides, we further summarize the potential applications of strain engineering in photocatalysis, and a vision for the future controllable&#8208;electronic&#8208;structure photocatalysts by strain engineering is also given. Finally, the perspectives on challenges for future strain&#8208;promoted photocatalysis are chiefly discussed, placing emphasis on the creation and decoupling of strain effect, and the modification of theoretical frameworks.

         <title>Searching for an Optimal Multi&#8208;Metallic Alloy Catalyst by Active Learning Combined with Experiments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and simple methodology is suggested in order to search for the optimal components and composition of multi&#8208;metallic alloy catalysts regardless of the catalytic background by a combination of active learning and experiment. After conducting several iterations, the optimum ternary catalyst, which shows superior performance compared to unary or binary catalysts, is discovered.








Abstract
Searching for an optimal component and composition of multi&#8208;metallic alloy catalysts, comprising two or more elements, is one of the key issues in catalysis research. Due to the exhaustive data requirement of conventional machine&#8208;learning (ML) models and the high cost of experimental trials, current approaches rely mainly on the combination of density functional theory and ML techniques. In this study, a significant step is taken toward overcoming limitations by the interplay of experiment and active learning to effectively search for an optimal component and composition of multi&#8208;metallic alloy catalysts. The active&#8208;learning model is iteratively updated using by examining electrocatalytic performance of fabricated solid&#8208;solution nanoparticles for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). An optimal metal precursor composition of Pt0.65Ru0.30Ni0.05 exhibits an HER overpotential of 54.2&#160;mV, which is superior to that of the pure Pt catalyst. This result indicates the successful construction of the model by only utilizing the precursor mixture composition as input data, thereby improving the overpotential by searching for an optimal catalyst. This method appears to be widely applicable since it is able to determine an optimal component and composition of electrocatalyst without obvious restriction to the types of catalysts to which it can be applied.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Switch&#8208;Embedded Organic Photodiode for Capturing Images against Strong Backlight</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;switch&#8208;embedded organic photodiode exhibits an autonomous transition of the operation mode between photovoltaic&#8208; and photomultiplication&#8208;type photodiodes, resulting in the extension of the photoresponse linearity to 434 W cm&#8722;2. This mechanism is enabled by the light&#8208;intensity&#8208;adjusted cyclization&#8211;cycloreversion equilibrium of diarylethene&#8208;based molecular switches. Consequently, prototype image sensors with reliable sensitivity against strong backlight are demonstrated.








Abstract
When the intensity of the incident light increases, the photocurrents of organic photodiodes (OPDs) exhibit relatively early saturation, due to which OPDs cannot easily detect objects against strong backlights, such as sunlight. In this study, this problem is addressed by introducing a light&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent transition of the operation mode, such that the operation mode of the OPD autonomously changes to overcome early photocurrent saturation as the incident light intensity passes the threshold intensity. The photoactive layer is doped with a strategically designed and synthesized molecular switch, 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;cyanobiphenyl)&#8208;3&#8208;thienyl)tetrafluorobenzene (DAB). The proposed OPD exhibits a typical OPD performance with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &lt;100% and a photomultiplication behavior with an EQE of &gt;100% under low&#8208;intensity and high&#8208;intensity light illuminations, respectively, thereby resulting in an extension of the photoresponse linearity to a light intensity of 434&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This unique and reversible transition of the operation mode can be explained by the unbalanced quantum yield of photocyclization/photocycloreversion of the molecular switch. The details of the operation mechanism are discussed in conjunction with various photophysical analyses. Furthermore, they establish a prototype image sensor with an array of molecular&#8208;switch&#8208;embedded OPD pixels to demonstrate their extremely high sensitivity against strong light illumination.

         <title>Decoupling and Reprogramming the Wiggling Motion of Midge Larvae Using a Soft Robotic Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic soft robotic platform to decouple and reprogram complex wiggling motion adopted by invertebrates is presented. By using magnetic soft robot and programmed magnetic field inputs, it is unveiled that the synchronization of body curling and rotation, and the optimal rotation amplitude greatly enhance motility. The robotic platform offers a new toolbox to develop optimized soft&#8208;bodied swimmers with enhanced motility.








Abstract
The efficient motility of invertebrates helps them survive under evolutionary pressures. Reconstructing the locomotion of invertebrates and decoupling the influence of individual basic motion are crucial for understanding their underlying mechanisms, which, however, generally remain a challenge due to the complexity of locomotion gaits. Herein, a magnetic soft robot to reproduce midge larva's key natural swimming gaits is developed, and the coupling effect between body curling and rotation on motility is investigated. Through the authors&#8217; systematically decoupling studies using programmed magnetic field inputs, the soft robot (named LarvaBot) experiences various coupled gaits, including biomimetic side&#8208;to&#8208;side flexures, and unveils that the optimal rotation amplitude and the synchronization of curling and rotation greatly enhance its motility. The LarvaBot achieves fast locomotion and upstream capability at the moderate Reynolds number regime. The soft robotics&#8208;based platform provides new insight to decouple complex biological locomotion, and design programmed swimming gaits for the fast locomotion of soft&#8208;bodied swimmers.

         <title>Chemical Potential Diagram Guided Rational Tuning of Electrical Properties: A Case Study of CsPbBr3 for X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical results indicate that the electrical properties of CsPbBr3 can be tuned from weak n&#8208;type under the Pb&#8208;rich condition to moderate p&#8208;type under the Br&#8208;rich condition. Experimentally, a large Fermi level tunability of 1.0 eV is achieved for the CsPbBr3 films by posterior Br2 treatment. The intrinsic CsPbBr3 films are proven to lead to excellent X&#8208;ray detection performance.








Abstract
Controlling the carrier polarity and concentration underlies most electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, for the intensively studied lead halide perovskites, the doping tunability is inefficient. In this work, taking CsPbBr3 as an example, it is revealed that the coexistence of metallic Pb or CsBr3/Br2, rather than the precursor ratio, can provide Pb&#8208;rich/Br&#8208;poor or Br&#8208;rich/Pb&#8208;poor chemical conditions, enabling the tunability of electrical properties from weak n&#8208;type, intrinsic, to moderate p&#8208;type. Experimentally, under Br2&#8208;exposure treatment, a shift of the Fermi level as large as 1.00 eV is achieved, which is one of the highest value among all kinds of doping methods. The X&#8208;ray detector based on the intrinsic CsPbBr3 exhibits excellent performance, with a negligible dark&#8208;current drift of 7.1 &#215; 10&#8722;4 nA cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 V&#8722;1, a low detection limit of 103.6 nGyair s&#8722;1, and a high sensitivity of 9085 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. This work provides a critical understanding and guidance for tuning the electrical properties of lead halide perovskites, which establishes good foundations for achieving intrinsic perovskite semiconductors and also constructing potential homojunction devices.

&lt;p&gt;Theoretical results indicate that the electrical properties of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be tuned from weak n-type under the Pb-rich condition to moderate p-type under the Br-rich condition. Experimentally, a large Fermi level tunability of 1.0 eV is achieved for the CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films by posterior Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treatment. The intrinsic CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films are proven to lead to excellent X-ray detection performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling the carrier polarity and concentration underlies most electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, for the intensively studied lead halide perovskites, the doping tunability is inefficient. In this work, taking CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as an example, it is revealed that the coexistence of metallic Pb or CsBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, rather than the precursor ratio, can provide Pb-rich/Br-poor or Br-rich/Pb-poor chemical conditions, enabling the tunability of electrical properties from weak n-type, intrinsic, to moderate p-type. Experimentally, under Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-exposure treatment, a shift of the Fermi level as large as 1.00 eV is achieved, which is one of the highest value among all kinds of doping methods. The X-ray detector based on the intrinsic CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits excellent performance, with a negligible dark-current drift of 7.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; nA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a low detection limit of 103.6 nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a high sensitivity of 9085 &#956;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work provides a critical understanding and guidance for tuning the electrical properties of lead halide perovskites, which establishes good foundations for achieving intrinsic perovskite semiconductors and also constructing potential homojunction devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ion Migration in Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: Mechanism, Characterizations, and Material and Device Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental and engineering aspects of ion&#8208;related issues in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are reviewed, including the origins and driving mechanisms of ion migration, characterization approaches for probing ion distribution, impact of ion migration on device performance and stability, and strategies for ion management in PeLEDs. Perspectives on the remaining challenges and future opportunities are highlighted.








Abstract
In recent years, perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have emerged as a promising new lighting technology with high external quantum efficiency, color purity, and wavelength tunability, as well as, low&#8208;temperature processability. However, the operational stability of PeLEDs is still insufficient for their commercialization. The generation and migration of ionic species in metal halide perovskites has been widely acknowledged as the primary factor causing the performance degradation of PeLEDs. Herein, this topic is systematically discussed by considering the fundamental and engineering aspects of ion&#8208;related issues in PeLEDs, including the material and processing origins of ion generation, the mechanisms driving ion migration, characterization approaches for probing ion distributions, the effects of ion migration on device performance and stability, and strategies for ion management in PeLEDs. Finally, perspectives on remaining challenges and future opportunities are highlighted.

         <title>Revisiting the Roles of Natural Graphite in Ongoing Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of natural graphite&#8208;based materials in ongoing lithium&#8208;ion batteries is presented, covering fundamental mechanisms, detailed applications, and an outlook of natural graphite&#8208;based materials, from not only the aspects of structure and properties, modifications, derivatives, and composites, but also perspectives in terms of natural graphite in hybrid lithium&#8208;ion/lithium&#8208;metal cells and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.








Abstract
Graphite, commonly including artificial graphite and natural graphite (NG), possesses a relatively high theoretical capacity of 372&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8211;1 and appropriate lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation potential, and has been extensively used as the anode of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With the requirements of reducing CO2 emission to achieve carbon neutral, the market share of NG anode will continue to grow due to its excellent processability and low production energy consumption. NG, which is abundant in China, can be divided into flake graphite (FG) and microcrystalline graphite (MG). In the past 30 years, many researchers have focused on developing modified NG and its derivatives with superior electrochemical performance, promoting their wide applications in LIBs. Here, a comprehensive overview of the origin, roles, and research progress of NG&#8208;based materials in ongoing LIBs is provided, including their structure, properties, electrochemical performance, modification methods, derivatives, composites, and applications, especially the strategies to improve their high&#8208;rate and low&#8208;temperature charging performance. Prospects regarding the development orientation as well as future applications of NG&#8208;based materials are also considered, which will provide significant guidance for the current and future research of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.

         <title>Automotive Holographic Head&#8208;Up Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Automotive head&#8208;up displays (HUDs) projected on the windshield provide the driver with visual navigation and vehicle data within the comfort of the driver's personal eye box through a customizable extended display space. This article presents a review of technological advances and future perspectives in holographic HUDs by analyzing the optoelectronics devices and the user experience of the driver.








Abstract
Driver's access to information about navigation and vehicle data through in&#8208;car displays and personal devices distract the driver from safe vehicle management. The discrepancy between road safety and infotainment must be addressed to develop safely operated modern vehicles. Head&#8208;up displays (HUDs) aim to introduce a seamless uptake of visual information for the driver while securely operating a vehicle. HUDs projected on the windshield provide the driver with visual navigation and vehicle data within the comfort of the driver's personal eye box through a customizable extended display space. Windshield HUDs do not require the driver to shift the gaze away from the road to attain road information. This article presents a review of technological advances and future perspectives in holographic HUDs by analyzing the optoelectronics devices and the user experience of the driver. The review elucidates holographic displays and full augmented reality in 3D with depth perception when projecting the visual information on the road within the driver's gaze. Design factors, functionality, and the integration of personalized machine learning technologies into holographic HUDs are discussed. Application examples of the display technologies regarding road safety and security are presented. An outlook is provided to reflect on display trends and autonomous driving.

         <title>High precision micropatterning of polydopamine by Multiphoton Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mussel&#8208;inspired polydopamine (PDA) initiated a multifunctional modification route that leads to the generation of novel advanced materials and their applications. However, existing PDA deposition techniques still exhibit poor spatial control, have a very limited capability of micropatterning and do not allow to locally tune PDA topography. Herein, we demonstrate PDA deposition based on Multiphoton Lithography (MPL) that enables full spatial and temporal control with nearly total freedom of patterning design. Using MPL, we achieve 2D microstructures of complex design with pattern precision of 0.8&#160;&#956;m without the need of a photomask or stamp. Moreover, this approach permits adjusting the morphology and thickness of the fabricated microstructure within one deposition step, resulting in a unique tunability of materials properties. The chemical composition of PDA is confirmed and its ability for protein enzyme immobilization is demonstrated. This work presents a new methodology for high precision and complete control of PDA deposition, enabling PDA incorporation in applications where fine and precise local surface functionalization is required. Possible applications include multicomponent functional elements and devices in microfluidics or lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.

         <title>Twin&#8208;Structured Graphene Metamaterials with Anomalous Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D graphene metamaterial with twin&#8208;structured morphology is constructed by orientated icing growth under manipulation of the temperature gradient, which demonstrates the anomalous physical properties, such as programable Poisson's ratio, superelasticity, and high resilience. Experimental investigation and numerical simulation cooperatively validate the triggering mechanism including oriented evolution of the hierarchical microstructure and elastic buckling of the cell walls.








Abstract
Typically, solid materials exhibit transverse contraction in response to stretching in the orthogonal direction and transverse expansion under compression conditions. However, when flexible graphene nanosheets are assembled into a 3D porous architecture, the orientation&#8208;arrangement&#8208;delivered directional deformation of micro&#8211;nanosheets may induce anomalous mechanical properties. In this study, a 3D hierarchical graphene metamaterial (GTM) with twin&#8208;structured morphologies is assembled by manipulating the temperature gradient for ice growth during in situ freeze&#8208;casting procedures. GTM demonstrates anomalous anisotropic compression performance with programable Poisson's ratios (PRs) and improved mechanical properties (e.g., elasticity, strength, modulus, and fatigue resistance) along different directions. Owing to the designed three&#8208;phase deformation of 2D graphene sheets as basic microelements, the twin&#8208;structure GTM delivers distinctive characteristics of compressive curves with an apparent stress plateau, and follows a strengthening tendency. This multiscale deformation behavior facilitates the enhancement of energy loss coefficient. In addition, a finite element theory based numerical model is established to optimize the structural design, and validate the multiscale tunable PR mechanism and oriented structural evolution.

     alt="Twin-Structured Graphene Metamaterials with Anomalous Mechanical Properties"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 3D graphene metamaterial with twin-structured morphology is constructed by orientated icing growth under manipulation of the temperature gradient, which demonstrates the anomalous physical properties, such as programable Poisson's ratio, superelasticity, and high resilience. Experimental investigation and numerical simulation cooperatively validate the triggering mechanism including oriented evolution of the hierarchical microstructure and elastic buckling of the cell walls.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, solid materials exhibit transverse contraction in response to stretching in the orthogonal direction and transverse expansion under compression conditions. However, when flexible graphene nanosheets are assembled into a 3D porous architecture, the orientation-arrangement-delivered directional deformation of micro&#8211;nanosheets may induce anomalous mechanical properties. In this study, a 3D hierarchical graphene metamaterial (GTM) with twin-structured morphologies is assembled by manipulating the temperature gradient for ice growth during in situ freeze-casting procedures. GTM demonstrates anomalous anisotropic compression performance with programable Poisson's ratios (PRs) and improved mechanical properties (e.g., elasticity, strength, modulus, and fatigue resistance) along different directions. Owing to the designed three-phase deformation of 2D graphene sheets as basic microelements, the twin-structure GTM delivers distinctive characteristics of compressive curves with an apparent stress plateau, and follows a strengthening tendency. This multiscale deformation behavior facilitates the enhancement of energy loss coefficient. In addition, a finite element theory based numerical model is established to optimize the structural design, and validate the multiscale tunable PR mechanism and oriented structural evolution. The mechanical and thermal applications of GTM indicate that the rational manipulation-driven design of meta-structures paves the way for exploring graphene-based multifunctional materials with anomalous properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence with Simultaneous Narrowband Emission, High Efficiency, and Large Dissymmetry Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance circularly polarized electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of 33.2%, large electroluminescence dissymmetry factor of 2.8 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 42&#160;nm, are achieved by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from a newly developed chiral exciplex host to an achiral MR&#8208;TADF emitter.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that can simultaneously achieve narrowband emission, high efficiency, and circularly polarized luminescence remain a formidable challenge. In this study, a simple strategy is developed to address this challenge. A chiral exciplex&#8208;forming co&#8208;host is first designed by employing a chiral donor and an achiral acceptor molecule. The chiral exciplex host enables an achiral green multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter to achieve high&#8208;performance circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) with a high external quantum efficiency of 33.2%, large electroluminescence dissymmetry factor of 2.8 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 42&#160;nm. This work provides a general approach for realizing CP&#8208;EL using easily available achiral emitters and can significantly extend the scope of circularly polarized OLEDs.

         <title>Ultrahigh Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Efficiency and Selectivity Manipulation by Single&#8208;Tungsten&#8208;Atom Oxide at the Atomic Step of TiO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single metallic atom oxide at the surface step is a new structural strategy for heterogeneous catalysts to tune selective products. As a proof of concept, a high converage of single tungsten atom oxide on a TiO2 nanoparticle with numerous surface steps can achieve the main product of CH4 with 86.5% selectivity from mainly CO (88.2% selectivity) on bare TiO2 in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
The photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction is a sustainable route to the direct conversion of greenhouse gases into chemicals without additional energy consumption. Given the vast amount of greenhouse gas, numerous efforts have been devoted to developing inorganic photocatalysts, e.g., titanium dioxide (TiO2), due to their stability, low cost, and environmentally friendly properties. However, a more efficient TiO2 photocatalyst without noble metals is highly desirable for CO2 reduction, and it is both difficult and urgent to produce selectively valuable compounds. Here, a novel &#8220;single&#8208;atom site at the atomic step&#8221; strategy is developed by anchoring a single tungsten (W) atom site with oxygen&#8208;coordination at the intrinsic steps of classic TiO2 nanoparticles. The composition of active sites for CO2 reduction can be controlled by tuning the additional W5+ to form W5+&#8211;O&#8211;Ti3+ sites, resulting in both significant CO2 reduction efficiency with 60.6 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity for methane (CH4) over carbon monoxide (CO), which exceeds those of pristine TiO2 by more than one order of magnitude. The mechanism relies on the accurate control of the single&#8208;atom sites at step with 22.8% coverage of surface sites and the subsequent excellent electron&#8211;hole separation along with the favorable adsorption&#8211;desorption of intermediates at the sites.

         <title>Deep ultraviolet micro&#8208;LEDs exhibiting high output power and high modulation bandwidth simultaneously</title>

Abstract
Deep ultraviolet (DUV) solar&#8208;blind communication (SBC) shows distinct advantages of non&#8208;light&#8208;of&#8208;sight propagation and background noise negligibility over conventional visible light communication. AlGaN based DUV micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#956;&#8208;LEDs) are an excellent candidate for a DUV&#8208;SBC light source due to their small size, low power consumption, and high modulation bandwidth. A long&#8208;haul DUV&#8208;SBC system requires the light source exhibiting high output power, high modulation bandwidth, and high rate simultaneously. Such a device has rarely been reported. We here propose a parallel&#8208;arrayed planar (PAP) approach to satisfy those requirements. By reducing the dimensions of an active emission mesa to a micrometer scale, DUV &#956;&#8208;LEDs with ultra&#8208;high&#8208;power density have been created due to their homogenous injection current and enhanced planar isotropic light emission. We have produced interconnected PAP &#956;&#8208;LEDs with a diameter of 25&#160;&#956;m. This device has an output power of 83.5&#160;mW with a density of 405 W/cm2 at 230&#160;mA, a wall&#8208;plug efficiency (WPE) of 4.7% at 155&#160;mA, and a high &#8208;3&#160;dB modulation bandwidth of 380&#160;MHz. The remarkable high output power and efficiency make those devices a reliable platform to develop high modulation bandwidth wireless communication and to meet the requirements for bio&#8208;elimination.

         <title>Monolithic All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells with Minimized Optical and Energetic Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic metal&#8208;halide perovskite tandem solar cells reach a power conversion efficiency of 23% after passivating the interfaces of the wide&#8208; and narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites with the C60 electron transport layer and minimizing the optical losses in the cell by using a hydrogenated indium oxide front contact and a thin hole transporting layers.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;based multijunction solar cells are a potentially cost&#8208;effective technology that can help surpass the efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction devices. However, both mixed&#8208;halide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites and lead&#8208;tin narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites suffer from non&#8208;radiative recombination due to the formation of bulk traps and interfacial recombination centers which limit the open&#8208;circuit voltage of sub&#8208;cells and consequently of the integrated tandem. Additionally, the complex optical stack in a multijunction solar cell can lead to losses stemming from parasitic absorption and reflection of incident light which aggravates the current mismatch between sub&#8208;cells, thereby limiting the short&#8208;circuit current density of the tandem. Here, an integrated all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell is presented that uses surface passivation strategies to reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination at the perovskite&#8208;fullerene interfaces, yielding a high open&#8208;circuit voltage. By using optically benign transparent electrode and charge&#8208;transport layers, absorption in the narrow&#8208;bandgap sub&#8208;cell is improved, leading to an improvement in current&#8208;matching between sub&#8208;cells. Collectively, these strategies allow the development of a monolithic tandem solar cell exhibiting a power&#8208;conversion efficiency of over 23%.

         <title>P&#8208;Doped NiTe2 with Te&#8208;Vacancies in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries Prevents Shuttling and Promotes Polysulfide Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;doped NiTe2 electrocatalysts with Te&#8208;vacancies are fabricated on maize&#8208;straw carbon nanosheets to act as separators in Li&#8211;S batteries. They exhibit high conductivities and strong polysulfide adsorption, which increase redox conversions and sulfur electrochemistry.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have been hindered by the shuttle effect and sluggish polysulfide conversion kinetics. Here, a P&#8208;doped nickel tellurium electrocatalyst with Te&#8208;vacancies (P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x) anchored on maize&#8208;straw carbon (MSC) nanosheets, served as a functional layer (MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x) on the separator of high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries. The P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x electrocatalyst enhanced the intrinsic conductivity, strengthened the chemical affinity for polysulfides, and accelerated sulfur redox conversion. The MSC nanosheets enabled NiTe2 nanoparticle dispersion and Li+ diffusion. In situ Raman and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectra confirmed that the MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x restrained the shuttle effect and accelerated the redox conversion. The MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8722;x&#8208;based cell has a cyclability of 637 mAh g&#8208;1 at 4 C over 1800 cycles with a degradation rate of 0.0139% per cycle, high rate performance of 726 mAh g&#8208;1 at 6 C, and a high areal capacity of 8.47 mAh cm&#8208;2 under a sulfur configuration of 10.2&#160;mg cm&#8208;2, and a low electrolyte/sulfur usage ratio of 3.9. This work demonstrates that vacancy&#8208;induced doping of heterogeneous atoms enables durable sulfur electrochemistry and can impact future electrocatalytic designs related to various energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Doping Control of Magnetic Anisotropy for Stable Antiskyrmion Formation in Schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic anisotropy of schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry is controlled by doping and its impact on the stability of antiskyrmions is investigated. It is demonstrated that the variation of the Ni content and slight doping with 4d transition metals considerably change the magnetic anisotropy, and subtle balance between uniaxial anisotropy and demagnetization energy is necessary to stabilize the antiskyrmions.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions, vortex&#8208;like topological spin textures, have attracted much interest in a wide range of research fields from fundamental physics to spintronics applications. Recently, growing attention is also paid to antiskyrmions emerging with opposite topological charge in non&#8208;centrosymmetric magnets with D2d or S4 symmetry. In these magnets, complex interplay among anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction, uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and magnetic dipolar interactions generates various magnetic textures. However, the precise role of these magnetic interactions in stabilizing antiskyrmions remains to be elucidated. In this work, the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry is controlled by doping and its impact on the stability of antiskyrmions is investigated. The authors&#8217; magnetometry study, supported by ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, shows that the variation of the Ni content and slight doping with 4d transition metals considerably change the magnetic anisotropy. In particular, doping with Pd induces easy&#8208;axis anisotropy, giving rise to formation of antiskyrmions, while a temperature&#8208;induced spin reorientation is observed in an Rh&#8208;doped compound. In combination with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, the stability of antiskyrmion as functions of uniaxial anisotropy and demagnetization energy is quantitatively analyzed, and demonstrated that subtle balance between them is necessary to stabilize the antiskyrmions.

         <title>Sulfuration of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathode Materials for Multianionic Redox and Stabilized Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfurization of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLOs) can be achieved by ion&#8208;exchange reaction to incorporate sulfur atoms in the lattice structure of LLOs, while the surface polyanions&#8208;formation leads to the protecting layer. This facile and economical way to sulfurize LLO materials can provide multianionic redox and stabilized coordination environment thus for outstanding battery performance.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich transition metal oxides (LLOs) can deliver high specific capacity over 250 mAh g&#8722;1, stemming from additional contribution of oxygen redox. However, the formation of O(2&#8722;n)&#8722; (0 &lt; n&#160;&lt; 2) species and even oxygen gas during the deep oxidation stage leads to progressive structural transformation that cause voltage decay/hysteresis, sluggish kinetics, and poor thermostability, preventing real&#8208;world application of LLOs. Therefore, the substantive key relies on enhancing the anionic redox stability in LLOs. Here, a sulfuration procedure of LLOs (S&#8208;LLOs) is proposed, in which sulfur anions are incorporated into oxygen sites in the lattice structure and form polyanions on the surface. Proved by structural characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, sulfur anions in the interior lattice can reversibly participate in the redox process and enhance the integral coordination stability by mitigating undesired oxygen redox. Moreover, S polyanions at the surface form a protecting layer for interfacial stability. The electrochemical measurements indicate that S&#8208;LLO demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 307.8 mAh g&#8722;1, an outstanding capacity retention rate of 91.5% after 200 cycles, along with excellent voltage maintenance, rate capability, and thermostability. The sulfuration process of LLOs with multianionic redox mechanism highlights a promising strategy to design novel high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials with superior cycling performance.

         <title>A Logic&#8208;Based Diagnostic and Therapeutic Hydrogel with Multistimuli Responsiveness to Orchestrate Diabetic Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual logic&#8208;based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is developed through the design of a double&#8208;network hydrogel responsive to diabetic microenvironmental cues combined with the controlled delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory and osteogenic protein drugs. The logic&#8208;based drug release enables the regulation of macrophage polarization by remodeling the mitochondria&#8208;related antioxidative system, resulting in enhanced osteogenesis in diabetic bone defects.








Abstract
The regeneration of diabetic bone defects remains challenging as the innate healing process is impaired by glucose fluctuation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and overexpression of proteinases (such as matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs). A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual&#8208;logic&#8208;based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is therefore developed through the design of a double&#8208;network hydrogel consisting of phenylboronic&#8208;acid&#8208;crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) and gelatin colloids. It exhibits a &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; logic to interpret pathological cues (glucose fluctuation, ROS, MMPs) and determines when to release drug in a diabetic microenvironment and a therapeutic logic to program different cargo release to match immune&#8208;osteo cascade for better tissue regeneration. The hydrogel is also shown to be mechanically adaptable to the local complexity at the bone defect. Furthermore, the underlying therapeutic mechanism is elucidated, whereby the logic&#8208;based cargo release enables the regulation of macrophage polarization by remodeling the mitochondria&#8208;related antioxidative system, resulting in enhanced osteogenesis in diabetic bone defects. This study provides critical insight into the design and biological mechanism of dual&#8208;logic&#8208;based tissue&#8208;engineering strategies for diabetic bone regeneration.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale and Wide&#8208;Gamut Coloration at the Diffraction Limit in Flexible, Self&#8208;Assembled Hierarchical Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dielectric structural coloration platform that simultaneously addresses all areas required for real&#8208;world commercial applications is implemented: wide colors gamut, also exceeding the red, green, and blue (RGB) spectrum, low manufacturing costs, large&#8208;scale printing demonstrated on entire wafers and 4 in. flexible substrates, and high printing resolutions at a constant 101&#8201;600 dots per inch.








Abstract
Unveiling physical phenomena that generate controllable structural coloration is at the center of significant research efforts due to the platform potential for the next generation of printing, sensing, displays, wearable optoelectronics components, and smart fabrics. Colors based on e&#8208;beam facilities possess high resolutions above 100k dots per inch (DPI), but limit manufacturing scales up to 4.37&#160;cm2, while requiring rigid substrates that are not flexible. State&#8208;of&#8208;art scalable techniques, on the contrary, provide either narrow gamuts or small resolutions. A common issue of current methods is also a heterogeneous resolution, which typically changes with the color printed. Here, a structural coloration platform with broad gamuts exceeding the red, green, and blue (RGB) spectrum in inexpensive, thermally resistant, flexible, and metallic&#8208;free structures at constant 101&#8201;600&#160;DPI (at the diffraction limit), obtained via mass&#8208;production manufacturing is demonstrated. This platform exploits a previously unexplored physical mechanism, which leverages the interplay between strong scattering modes and optical resonances excited in fully 3D dielectric nanostructures with suitably engineered longitudinal profiles. The colors obtained with this technology are scalable to any area, demonstrated up to the single wafer (4 in.). These results open real&#8208;world applications of inexpensive, high&#8208;resolution, large&#8208;scale structural colors with broad chromatic spectra.

         <title>A New Strategy for Microbial Taxonomic Identification through Micro&#8208;Biosynthetic Gold Nanoparticles and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is developed for the identification of multiple classifications of microorganisms including bacteria and fungi, from kingdom to species. The features of gold nanoparticles biosynthesized by different microorganisms are analyzed by machine&#8208;learning algorithms. The levels of glucose, glutathione, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate&#8208;dependent reductase are related to the underlying mechanism of micro&#8208;biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles.








Abstract
Microorganisms can serve as biological factories for the synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials that can become useful as nanocatalysts, energy&#8208;harvesting&#8211;storage components, antibacterial agents, and biomedical materials. Herein, the development of biosynthesis of inorganic nanomaterials into a simple, stable, and accurate strategy for distinguishing microorganisms from multiple classification levels (i.e., kingdom, order, genus, and species) without gene amplification, biochemical testing, or target recognition is reported. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) biosynthesized by different microorganisms differ in color of the solution, and their features can be characterized, including the particle size, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrum, and the surface potential. The inter&#8208;relation between the features of micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs and the classification of microorganisms are exploited at different levels through machine learning to establish a taxonomic model. This model agrees well with traditional classification methods that offers a new strategy for microbial taxonomic identification. The underlying mechanism of this strategy is related to the biomolecules produced by different microorganisms including glucose, glutathione, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate&#8208;dependent reductase that regulate the features of micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs. This work broadens the application of biosynthesis of inorganic materials through micro&#8208;biosynthetic AuNPs and machine learning, which holds great promise as a tool for biomedical research.

         <title>Creating a Ferromagnetic Ground State with Tc Above Room Temperature in a Paramagnetic Alloy through Non&#8208;Equilibrium Nanostructuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hitherto&#8208;unknown ferromagnetic ground state with Curie temperature above room temperature can be created in an initially paramagnetic alloy by non&#8208;equilibrium nanostructuring. The ferromagnetic ground state originates from surface stress&#8208;induced tetragonal distortion in the ligaments of the nanoporous network. The study demonstrates a route for reaching conventionally inaccessible magneto&#8208;electronic states and achieving an on/off ferromagnetic&#8211;paramagnetic switching for potential applications.








Abstract
Materials with strong magnetostructural coupling have complex energy landscapes featuring multiple local ground states, thus making it possible to switch among distinct magnetic&#8208;electronic properties. However, these energy minima are rarely accessible by a mere application of an external stimuli to the system in equilibrium state. A ferromagnetic ground state, with Tc above room temperature, can be created in an initially paramagnetic alloy by nonequilibrium nanostructuring. By a dealloying process, bulk chemically disordered FeRh alloys are transformed into a nanoporous structure with the topology of a few nanometer&#8208;sized ligaments and nodes. Magnetometry and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy reveal the coexistence of two magnetic ground states, a conventional low&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;glass and a hitherto&#8208;unknown robust ferromagnetic phase. The emergence of the ferromagnetic phase is validated by density functional theory calculations showing that local tetragonal distortion induced by surface stress favors ferromagnetic ordering. The study provides a means for reaching conventionally inaccessible magnetic states, resulting in a complete on/off ferromagnetic&#8211;paramagnetic switching over a broad temperature range.

         <title>Magnetic Domain Confined Printing of Programmable Organic Microcrystal Assemblies for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable organic microcrystal assemblies with dynamic tunable shapes and orientations are manufactured using a virtual, dynamic, noncontact template created by magnetic domain confined printing method. The highly reproducible shape switching enables it to be encoded into a multilevel QR code that encrypts, decrypts, and erases security information by applying a magnetic field.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale assembly of organic micro/nanocrystals into well&#8208;defined patterns with programmable structures is essential for applications such as information encryption at both high data density and high security level. Here, a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted approach that produces programmable assemblies of organic microcrystals with various shapes and orientations, using the magnetic domains of the underlying ferromagnetic metal microarrays as the printing templates, is developed. The diamagnetic microcrystals tend to aggregate in the regions of minimal field strength, and thus their assembly behavior is precisely controlled by the local field distribution on top of magnetic domains on substrate. The dynamic assembly process of microcrystal assemblies can be programmed upon the sequence of applied field, and their shape changes are &#8776;100% reproducible on a large scale (&gt;20&#8201;000 sites over 1 cm2). These features of magnetically programmable assemblies are ideally suited for information encryption, for which the encryption&#8211;decryption&#8211;erasing of multilevel information from a QR&#8208;code pattern based on the microcrystal assemblies under magnetic field is demonstrated.

Through changing mixed stacking into segregated stacking mode, triphenylene (TP)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex demonstrates a low CT degree and a small counter pitch angle between TP and F4TCNQ molecules, benefiting for breaking the forbidden electronic transitions of CT state for realizing the near&#8208;infrared emission with a maximum peak of 770 nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 5.4%.








Abstract
Harvesting the narrow bandgap excitons of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes for the achievement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission has attracted intensive attention for its fundamental importance and practical application. Herein, the triphenylene (TP)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) CT organic complex is designed and fabricated via the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly process, which demonstrates the NIR emission with a maximum peak of 770&#160;nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 5.4%. The segregated stacking mode of TP&#8208;F4TCNQ CT complex based on the multiple types of intermolecular interaction has a low CT degree of 0.00103 and a small counter pitch angle of 40&#176; between F4TCNQ and TP molecules, which breaks the forbidden electronic transitions of CT state, resulting in the effective NIR emission. Acting as the promising candidates for the active optical waveguide in the NIR region beyond 760&#160;nm, the self&#8208;assembled TP&#8208;F4TCNQ single&#8208;crystalline organic microwires display an ultralow optical&#8208;loss coefficient of 0.060&#160;dB&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1. This work holds considerable insights for the exploration of novel NIR&#8208;emissive organic materials via an universal &#8220;cocrystal engineering&#8221; strategy.

         <title>Controlled Activation of TRPV1 Channels on Microglia to Boost Their Autophagy for Clearance of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein and Enhance Therapy of Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugates of ultra&#8208;small Cu2&#8211;xSe nanoparticles and TRPV1 antibody can efficiently target microglia and photothermally activate their TRPV1 channels under the second near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, which promotes the efficient influx of Ca2+ to boost their autophagy. The enhanced autophagy of microglia improves the phagocytosis and degradation of &#945;&#8208;syn and boosts the therapeutic efficacy of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized with accumulation of Lewy bodies with a major component of fibrillar alpha&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn). Herein, boosting PD therapeutic efficacy by enhancing the autophagy of microglia to phagocytose and degrade &#945;&#8208;syn via controlled opening of their surface TRPV1 channels with rationally designed photothermal nanoagent is reported. The Cu2&#8722;xSe&#8208;anti&#8208;TRPV1 nanoparticles (CS&#8208;AT NPs) are fabricated to target the microglia and open their surface TRPV1 channels under the second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) laser irradiation to cause influx of Ca2+ to activate ATG5 and Ca2+/CaMKK2/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, which promote phagocytosis and degradation of &#945;&#8208;syn. The CS&#8208;AT NPs are efficiently delivered by focused ultrasound into striatum of PD mice with high expression of TRPV1 receptors. The athletic ability of PD mice treated by CS&#8208;AT NPs and NIR&#8208;II irradiation is significantly improved due to the phagocytotic clearance of &#945;&#8208;syn by microglia with enhanced autophagy. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, ionized calcium binding adapter protein 1, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and pSer129&#8208;&#945;&#8208;syn (p&#8208;&#945;&#8208;syn) of treated PD mice are almost recovered to the normal levels of healthy mice. This study provides insights into the activation of microglial autophagy by targeting surface ion channels to improve the treatment of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>3D Microvascularized Tissue Models by Laser&#8208;Based Cavitation Molding of Collagen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel method to generate channels in collagen hydrogels with sub&#8208;100&#8208;&#181;m resolution using non&#8208;ablative cavitation&#8208;based laser patterning. These channels can be used for the direct seeding of endothelial cells to form an artificial microvasculature. Cavitation&#8208;based patterning preserves the viability of cells in the hydrogels arranged either as single cells or spheroids, enabling complex microvascularized tissue models.








Abstract
3D tissue models recapitulating human physiology are important for fundamental biomedical research, and they hold promise to become a new tool in drug development. An integrated and defined microvasculature in 3D tissue models is necessary for optimal cell functions. However, conventional bioprinting only allows the fabrication of hydrogel scaffolds containing vessel&#8208;like structures with large diameters (&gt;100&#160;&#181;m) and simple geometries. Recent developments in laser photoablation enable the generation of this type of structure with higher resolution and complexity, but the photo&#8208;thermal process can compromise cell viability and hydrogel integrity. To address these limitations, the present work reports in situ 3D patterning of collagen hydrogels by femtosecond laser irradiation to create channels and cavities with diameters ranging from 20 to 60&#160;&#181;m. In this process, laser irradiation of the hydrogel generates cavitation gas bubbles that rearrange the collagen fibers, thereby creating stable microchannels. Such 3D channels can be formed in cell&#8208; and organoid&#8208;laden hydrogel without affecting the viability outside the lumen and can enable the formation of artificial microvasculature by the culture of endothelial cells and cell media perfusion. Thus, this method enables organs&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and 3D tissue models featuring complex microvasculature.

         <title>Preconstructing Asymmetric Interface in Air Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy to fabricate asymmetric air cathodes for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries is proposed. Precise loading of the electrocatalysts at the asymmetric interface is achieved to obtain zinc&#8211;air batteries cycling at 25 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy is universal to various electrocatalytic systems and can be easily scaled up.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries afford great potential toward next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage. Nevertheless, the oxygen redox reactions at the air cathode are highly sluggish in kinetics to induce poor energy efficiency and limited cycling lifespan. Air cathodes with asymmetric configurations significantly promote the electrocatalytic efficiency of the loaded electrocatalysts, whereas rational synthetic methodology to effectively fabricate asymmetric air cathodes remains insufficient. Herein, a strategy of asymmetric interface preconstruction is proposed to fabricate asymmetric air cathodes for high&#8208;performance rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. Concretely, the asymmetric interface is preconstructed by introducing immiscible organic&#8211;water diphases within the air cathode, at which the electrocatalysts are in situ formed to achieve an asymmetric configuration. The as&#8208;fabricated asymmetric air cathodes realize high working rates of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, long cycling stability of 3400 cycles at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and over 100 cycles under harsh conditions of 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 25 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy is universal to many electrocatalytic systems and can be easily scaled up. This work provides an effective strategy toward advanced asymmetric air cathodes with high electrocatalytic efficiency and significantly promotes the performance of rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions in a Thickness Tunable 2D Ferromagnet from a Defect Driven Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The observation of skyrmions in 2D materials has opened a door to novel tunability of their magnetic structure. Here, it is shown that the chiral N&#233;el skyrmions are stabilized in the metallic 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2, as a result of breaking of the inversion symmetry of its crystal structure that is derived from an asymmetric distribution of Fe atoms in alternate layers in the compound. It is found that the skyrmion size in this compound is strongly influenced by the sample thickness and changes from &#8776;100 to &#8776;700&#160;nm as the sample thickness is increased from &#8776;90&#160;nm to &#8776;2 &#181;m.








Abstract
There is considerable interest in van der Waals (vdW) materials as potential hosts for chiral skyrmionic spin textures. Of particular interest is the ferromagnetic, metallic compound Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), which has a comparatively high Curie temperature (150&#8211;220 K). Several recent studies have reported the observation of chiral N&#233;el skyrmions in this compound, which is inconsistent with its presumed centrosymmetric structure. Here the observation of N&#233;el type skyrmions in single crystals of FGT via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) is reported. It is shown from detailed X&#8208;ray diffraction structure analysis that FGT lacks an inversion symmetry as a result of an asymmetric distribution of Fe vacancies. This vacancy&#8208;induced breaking of the inversion symmetry of this compound is a surprising and novel observation and is a prerequisite for a Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya vector exchange interaction which accounts for the chiral N&#233;el skyrmion phase. This phenomenon is likely to be common to many 2D vdW materials and suggests a path to the preparation of many such acentric compounds. Furthermore, it is found that the skyrmion size in FGT is strongly dependent on its thickness: the skyrmion size increases from &#8776;100 to &#8776;750&#160;nm as the thickness of the lamella is increased from &#8776;90&#160;nm to &#8776;2&#160;&#181;m. This extreme size tunability is a feature common to many low symmetry ferro&#8208; and ferri&#8208;magnetic compounds.

         <title>Andreev Interference in the Surface Accumulation Layer of Half&#8208;Shell InAsSb/Al Hybrid Nanowires</title>

Understanding the spatial distribution of charge carriers in III&#8211;V nanowires proximity coupled to superconductors is important for the design and interpretation of experiments based on hybrid quantum devices.

Abstract
Understanding the spatial distribution of charge carriers in III&#8211;V nanowires proximity coupled to superconductors is important for the design and interpretation of experiments based on hybrid quantum devices. In this letter, the gate&#8208;dependent surface accumulation layer of half&#8208;shell InAsSb/Al nanowires is studied by means of Andreev interference in a parallel magnetic field. Both uniform hybrid nanowires and devices featuring a short Josephson junction fabricated by shadow lithography, exhibit periodic modulation of the switching current. The period corresponds to a flux quantum through the nanowire diameter and is consistent with Andreev bound states occupying a cylindrical surface accumulation layer. The spatial distribution is tunable by a gate potential as expected from electrostatic models.

         <title>Electronic Properties and Carrier Dynamics at the Alloy Interfaces of WS2xSe2&#8722;2x Spiral Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
WS2xSe2&#8722;2x spiral nanosheets demonstrate quadratically enhanced strong layer&#8208;dependent second&#8208;harmonic generation effects. The atomic scanning tunneling microscopy images and scanning tunneling spectroscopy maps at the WS/WSe interfaces demonstrate electron scattering at the alloy interfaces at deeper energy levels, providing a detailed nanoscale interpretation of the S/Se&#8208;ratio&#8208;dependent lifetimes inferred from pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy measurements.








Abstract
Electronic properties at the interfaces between different&#8208;composition domains of 2D&#8208;alloys are key for their optical, electronic, and optoelectronic applications. Understanding the interfacial electronic structures and carrier dynamics is essential for designing and fabricating devices that use these alloys. Here, WS2xSe2&#8722;2x spiral nanosheets are prepared using the physical vapor deposition method, and the nonlinear optical and electronic properties, as well as the carrier dynamics at the interfaces between the WS and WSe domains, are studied. Second&#8208;harmonic generation tests demonstrate that these nanosheets exhibit a very strong layer&#8208;dependent nonlinear optical effect. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) measurements reveal that S and Se atoms are non&#8208;uniformly distributed, forming WS domains, WSe domains, and defect&#8208;related areas. Atomic STM images and STS maps reveal enhanced local density of states by electron scattering at the WS/WSe interfaces, providing a detailed nanoscale interpretation of the S/Se&#8208;ratio&#8208;dependent lifetimes observed in pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy measurements. This work provides valuable interfacial characterization of 2D&#8208;alloy materials, using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods with high temporal and spatial resolutions. The obtained insights are likely to be useful for prospective applications.

         <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Flux Nanoporous Graphene Membrane for Sustainable Seawater Desalination using Low&#8208;Grade Heat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin nanoporous graphene membrane is developed, which creates short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The fabrication process avoids the challenging pore&#8208;generation and substrate&#8208;transfer processes generally required for graphene membranes. In direct&#8208;contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature gradient, the membrane shows outstanding performance and holds great potential for water desalination toward a low&#8208;carbon future.








Abstract
Membrane distillation has attracted great attention in the development of sustainable desalination and zero&#8208;discharge processes because of its possibility of recovering 100% water and the potential for integration with low&#8208;grade heat, such as solar energy. However, the conventional membrane structures and materials afford limited flux thus obstructing its practical application. Here, ultrathin nanoporous graphene membranes are reported by selectively forming thin graphene layers on the top edges of a highly porous anodic alumina oxide support, which creates short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The process avoids the challenging pore&#8208;generation and substrate&#8208;transfer processes required to prepare regular graphene membranes. In the direct&#8208;contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature pair of 65/25&#160;&#176;C,&#160;the nanoporous graphene membranes show an average water flux of 421.7 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with over 99.8% salt rejection, which is an order of magnitude higher than any reported polymeric membranes. The mechanism for high water flux is revealed by detailed characterizations and theoretical modeling. Outdoor field tests using water from the Red Sea heated under direct sunlight radiation show that the membranes have an average water flux of 86.3 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 from 8 am to 8 pm, showing a great potential for real applications in seawater desalination.

         <title>Deep Learning Unlocks X&#8208;ray Microtomography Segmentation of Multiclass Microdamage in Heterogeneous Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep&#8208;learning machine is created to segment sparse, multiclass microdamage in advanced composite laminates that feature complex microstructures and failure behavior, with &#8776;99.99% binary accuracy using 65&#160;000 tomograms in 3D X&#8208;ray datasets. The deep&#8208;learning approach accelerates heterogeneous materials knowledge creation by two orders of magnitude in a generalizable way, breaking a longstanding bottleneck while additionally introducing objectivity.








Abstract
Four&#8208;dimensional quantitative characterization of heterogeneous materials using in situ synchrotron radiation computed tomography can reveal 3D sub&#8208;micrometer features, particularly damage, evolving under load, leading to improved materials. However, dataset size and complexity increasingly require time&#8208;intensive and subjective semi&#8208;automatic segmentations. Here, the first deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation of multiclass microscale damage in heterogeneous bulk materials is presented, teaching on advanced aerospace&#8208;grade composite damage using &#8776;65&#160;000 (trained) human&#8208;segmented tomograms. The trained CNN machine segments complex and sparse (&lt;&lt;1% of volume) composite damage classes to &#8776;99.99% agreement, unlocking both objectivity and efficiency, with nearly 100% of the human time eliminated, which traditional rule&#8208;based algorithms do not approach. The trained machine is found to perform as well or better than the human due to &#8220;machine&#8208;discovered&#8221; human segmentation error, with machine improvements manifesting primarily as new damage discovery and segmentation augmentation/extension in artifact&#8208;rich tomograms. Interrogating a high&#8208;level network hyperparametric space on two material configurations, DL is found to be a disruptive approach to quantitative structure&#8211;property characterization, enabling high&#8208;throughput knowledge creation (accelerated by two orders of magnitude) via generalizable, ultrahigh&#8208;resolution feature segmentation.

     alt="Deep Learning Unlocks X-ray Microtomography Segmentation of Multiclass Microdamage in Heterogeneous Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deep-learning machine is created to segment sparse, multiclass microdamage in advanced composite laminates that feature complex microstructures and failure behavior, with &#8776;99.99% binary accuracy using 65&#160;000 tomograms in 3D X-ray datasets. The deep-learning approach accelerates heterogeneous materials knowledge creation by two orders of magnitude in a generalizable way, breaking a longstanding bottleneck while additionally introducing objectivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four-dimensional quantitative characterization of heterogeneous materials using in situ synchrotron radiation computed tomography can reveal 3D sub-micrometer features, particularly damage, evolving under load, leading to improved materials. However, dataset size and complexity increasingly require time-intensive and subjective semi-automatic segmentations. Here, the first deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation of multiclass microscale damage in heterogeneous bulk materials is presented, teaching on advanced aerospace-grade composite damage using &#8776;65&#160;000 (trained) human-segmented tomograms. The trained CNN machine segments complex and sparse (&amp;lt;&amp;lt;1% of volume) composite damage classes to &#8776;99.99% agreement, unlocking both objectivity and efficiency, with nearly 100% of the human time eliminated, which traditional rule-based algorithms do not approach. The trained machine is found to perform as well or better than the human due to &#8220;machine-discovered&#8221; human segmentation error, with machine improvements manifesting primarily as new damage discovery and segmentation augmentation/extension in artifact-rich tomograms. Interrogating a high-level network hyperparametric space on two material configurations, DL is found to be a disruptive approach to quantitative structure&#8211;property characterization, enabling high-throughput knowledge creation (accelerated by two orders of magnitude) via generalizable, ultrahigh-resolution feature segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cell with Efficiency of 22.0% via Reduced Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss and Broadened Absorption Spectra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing ClFA+ cation to reduce the voltage loss of perovskite front subcell and using chloride substitution to broaden the absorption spectra of organic rear subcell, a monolithic perovskite/organic tandem solar cell is constructed, and the power conversion efficiency reaches 22.0%.








Abstract
Combining the high stability under UV light of the wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) and the broad near&#8208;infrared absorption spectra of the narrow bandgap (NBG) organic solar cells (OSCs), the perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) with the WBG pero&#8208;SC as front cell and the NBG OSC as rear cell have attracted attention . However, the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite/organic TSCs needs to be further improved. Herein, nonradiative charge recombination loss is reduced through bulk defect passivation in the WBG pero&#8208;SC front subcell and broadening the range of absorption spectra of the NBG OSC rear cell. For the WBG pero&#8208;SCs, an organic cation chloro&#8208;formamidinium is introduced into FA0.6MA0.4Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 to passivate the bulk defects in the perovskite film and the WBG pero&#8208;SC displays high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.25&#160;V and high fill factor of 83.0%. For the NBG OSCs, a new infrared&#8208;absorbing organic small molecule acceptor BTPV&#8208;4Cl&#8208;eC9 is designed and synthesized. Then, a monolithic perovskite/organic TSC is fabricated with the WBG pero&#8208;SC as the front cell and the NBG OSC as the rear cell, and the TSC demonstrates high power conversion efficiency up to 22.0%. The results indicate that the perovskite/organic TSC is promising for future commercialization.

         <title>Stretchable Mesh Nanoelectronics for 3D Single&#8208;Cell Chronic Electrophysiology from Developing Brain Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building cyborg brain organoids through the integration of stretchable mesh nanoelectronics with human induced pluripotent stem cell derived progenitors and neurons through organogenesis is reported. The stretchable mesh nanoelectronics can adapt the morphogenesis of organoids and record organoid&#8208;wide electrophysiology at single&#8208;cell, millisecond resolution, chronically and noninvasively. Emergence and evolution of single&#8208;unit action potentials over the time course of brain organoid development are measured.








Abstract
Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived brain organoids have shown great potential for studies of human brain development and neurological disorders. However, quantifying the evolution of the electrical properties of brain organoids during development is currently limited by the measurement techniques, which cannot provide long&#8208;term stable 3D bioelectrical interfaces with developing brain organoids. Here, a cyborg brain organoid platform is reported, in which &#8220;tissue&#8208;like&#8221; stretchable mesh nanoelectronics are designed to match the mechanical properties of brain organoids and to be folded by the organogenetic process of progenitor or stem cells, distributing stretchable electrode arrays across the 3D organoids. The tissue&#8208;wide integrated stretchable electrode arrays show no interruption to brain organoid development, adapt to the volume and morphological changes during brain organoid organogenesis, and provide long&#8208;term stable electrical contacts with neurons within brain organoids during development. The seamless and noninvasive coupling of electrodes to neurons enables long&#8208;term stable, continuous recording and captures the emergence of single&#8208;cell action potentials from early&#8208;stage brain organoid development.

         <title>Reshaping the Tumor Immune Microenvironment Based on a Light&#8208;Activated Nanoplatform for Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#160;self&#8208;supplying&#160;nanoplatform&#160;for&#160;enhancing PDT/RT and reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment exhibits effective inhibition of the growth of both primary, metastatic, and recurrent tumors. Light activation of hole generation can trigger the decomposition of H2O2 to produce oxygen for alleviating tumor hypoxia, which not only sensitizes radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy, but also promotes the TAMs&#8217; polarization to M1 phenotype, and decreases the expression of HIF&#8208;1&#945;.








Abstract
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) always causes poor antitumor immune efficacy, prone to relapse and metastasis. Herein, novel poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) modified BiFeO3/Bi2WO6 (BFO/BWO) with a p&#8211;n type heterojunction is constructed for reshaping the immunosuppressive TME. Reactive oxygen species can be generated under light activation by the well&#8208;separated hole (h+)&#8211;electron (e&#8722;) pairs owing to the heterojunction in BFO/BWO&#8208;PVP NPs. Interestingly, h+ can trigger the decomposition of H2O2 to generate O2 for alleviating tumor hypoxia, which not only sensitizes photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiotherapy (RT), but also promotes tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization from M2 to M1 phenotype, which is beneficial to decrease the expression of HIF&#8208;1&#945;. Importantly, such a light&#8208;activated nanoplatform, combining with RT can efficiently activate and recruit cytotoxic T lymphocytes to infiltrate in tumor tissues, as well as stimulate TAMs to M1 phenotype, dramatically reverse the immunosuppressive TME into an immunoactive one, and further boost immune memory responses. Moreover, BFO/BWO&#8208;PVP NPs also present high performance for computed tomography imaging contrast. Taken together, this work offers a novel paradigm for achieving O2 self&#8208;supply of inorganic nanoagents and reshaping of the tumor immune microenvironment for effective inhibition of cancer as well as metastasis and recurrence.

         <title>Strain Switching in van der Waals Heterostructures Triggered by a Spin&#8208;Crossover Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered spin&#8208;crossover metal&#8211;organic frameworks are deterministically assembled with other 2D materials, such as graphene or WSe2, forming van der Waals heterostructures. The strain concomitant to the spin transition clearly switches the electrical and optical properties of the 2D material. Thus, spin&#8208;crossover van der Waals heterostructures represent a new route for band engineering in low&#8208;dimensional materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) provide the possibility of engineering new materials with emergent functionalities that are not accessible in another way. These heterostructures are formed by assembling layers of different materials used as building blocks. Beyond inorganic 2D crystals, layered molecular materials remain still rather unexplored, with only few examples regarding their isolation as atomically thin layers. Here, the family of van der Waals heterostructures is enlarged by introducing a molecular building block able to produce strain: the so&#8208;called spin&#8208;crossover (SCO). In these metal&#8211;organic materials, a spin transition can be induced by applying external stimuli like light, temperature, pressure, or an electric field. In particular, smart vdWHs are prepared in which the electronic and optical properties of the 2D material (graphene and WSe2) are clearly switched by the strain concomitant to the spin transition. These molecular/inorganic vdWHs represent the deterministic incorporation of bistable molecular layers with other 2D crystals of interest in the emergent fields of straintronics and band engineering in low&#8208;dimensional materials.

In particular, smart vdWHs are prepared in which the electronic and optical properties of the 2D material (graphene and WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are clearly switched by the strain concomitant to the spin transition. These molecular/inorganic vdWHs represent the deterministic incorporation of bistable molecular layers with other 2D crystals of interest in the emergent fields of straintronics and band engineering in low-dimensional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple Responsive CPL Switches in an Enantiomeric Pair of Perovskite Confined in Lanthanide MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achiral perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are embedded in homochiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) without any ligand passivation. Experimental results indicate that MAPbBr3 NCs adopted a chiral packing in enantiomeric MOFs by Eu&#63743;Br and Pb&#63743;O bonds. The CPL of composites possesses the multiple external&#8208;stimulate responsive reversibility. 








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches have attracted widespread attention due to their potential applications in advanced information technologies. However, the design and fabrication of solid&#8208;state multiple&#8208;responsive CPL switches remain challenging. Here, through self&#8208;assembly of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), a pair of crystalline enantiomeric (P)&#8208;(+)/(M)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;EuMOF&#8835;MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3+, X = Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;) adducts is prepared, where the achiral MAPbBr3 perovskite NCs embedded into chiral MOFs inherit the chirality of host MOFs by host&#8208;guest Eu&#63743;Br and Pb&#63743;O coordination bonds, which is demonstrated by synchrotron&#8208;radiation&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The chiral adducts show enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), good thermal stability of CPL in air, and photoswitchable CPL properties upon altering different UV irradiation. Based on two chiral emission centers and their different characteristics, reversible CPL switches are realized upon a diversity of external stimuli, for example, chemicals (water /CH3NH3Br solution) or temperatures (room temperature/high temperature). Benefiting from the extraordinary stimuli&#8208;responsive and highly reversible switchable CPL, multiple information encryptions and decryptions integrated with CPL, together with a chiroptical logic gate are successfully designed. This work opens a new avenue to generally fabricate solid&#8208;state CPL composite materials and develops new applications based on switchable CPL.

         <title>A Facile, Protein&#8208;Derived Supramolecular Theranostic Strategy for Multimodal&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic and Photothermal Immunotherapy In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature's ability to achieve molecular self&#8208;assembly, a facile, protein&#8208;derived supramolecular theranostic strategy for multimodal&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic and photothermal immunotherapy in vivo is demonstrated.








Abstract
Theranostic systems that permit both diagnosis and treatment in vivo are highly appealing means by which to meet the demands of precision medicine. However, most such systems remain subject to issues related to complex molecular design and synthesis, potential toxicity, and possible photoactivity changes. Herein, a novel supramolecular theranostic strategy involving biomarker protein activation (BPA) and a host&#8211;guest strategy is proposed. To exemplify BPA, a facile &#8220;one&#8208;for&#8208;all&#8221; nanotheranostic agent for both albumin detection and cancer treatment is demonstrated, which utilizes a nanoparticulate heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPY dye derivative (B4&#160;NPs). The fluorescence and photoactivity of BODIPY dyes are completely suppressed by aggregation&#8208;induced self&#8208;quenching in the nanoparticulate state. However, a Balb/c nude mouse model is used to confirm that following the disassembly of injected B4&#160;NPs, BODIPY specifically binds albumin in vivo, accompanied by significantly enhanced biocompatibility and photothermal conversion efficiency. More importantly, this supramolecular host&#8211;guest BPA strategy enables the resultant nanoplatform to act as a facile and efficient strategy for photodynamic and photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Fabrication of Efficient Single&#8208;Emitter Plasmonic Patch Antennas by Deterministic In Situ Optical Lithography using Spatially Modulated Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new technique of direct laser etching using spatially modulated light permits deterministic and controlled positioning of single&#8208;emitters inside photonic structures, such as patch nanoantennas, while preventing any emitter photodegradation. The optical properties of the fabricated antennas are investigated; high brightness and very large increase of absorption cross&#8208;section are demonstrated.








Abstract
Single&#8208;emitter plasmonic patch antennas are room&#8208;temperature deterministic single&#8208;photon sources, which exhibit highly accelerated and directed single&#8208;photon emission. However, for efficient operation these structures require 3D nanoscale deterministic control of emitter positioning within the device, which is a demanding task, especially when emitter damage during fabrication is a major concern. To overcome this limitation, the deterministic room&#8208;temperature in situ optical lithography protocol uses spatially modulated light to position a plasmonic structure nondestructively on any selected single&#8208;emitter with 3D nanoscale control. Herein, the emission statistics of such plasmonic antennas that embed a deterministically positioned single colloidal CdSe/CdS quantum dot, which highlight acceleration and brightness of emission, are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the presented antenna induces a 1000&#8208;fold effective increase in the absorption cross&#8208;section, and, under high pumping, these antennas show nonlinearly enhanced emission.

         <title>Tough, Transparent, 3D&#8208;Printable, and Self&#8208;Healing Poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;Gel (PEGgel)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient solvent strategy is proposed to enhance and refine the performance of polymer gel with a large range via using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as solvent. Due to this unique solvent system, the obtained gel exhibits long&#8208;lasting performance (&gt;1 month), high stretchability (6000%), rapid self&#8208;healing (1&#160;min), suitable for self&#8208;healing pneumatic actuators.








Abstract
Polymer gels, such as hydrogels, have been widely used in biomedical applications, flexible electronics, and soft machines. Polymer network design and its contribution to the performance of gels has been extensively studied. In this study, the critical influence of the solvent nature on the mechanical properties and performance of soft polymer gels is demonstrated. A polymer gel platform based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as solvent is reported (PEGgel). Compared to the corresponding hydrogel or ethylene glycol gel, the PEGgel with physically cross&#8208;linked poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylic acid) demonstrates high stretchability and toughness, rapid self&#8208;healing, and long&#8208;term stability. Depending on the molecular weight and fraction of PEG, the tensile strength of the PEGgels varies from 0.22 to 41.3 MPa, fracture strain from 12% to 4336%, modulus from 0.08 to 352 MPa, and toughness from 2.89 to 56.23 MJ m&#8211;3. Finally, rapid self&#8208;healing of the PEGgel is demonstrated and a self&#8208;healing pneumatic actuator is fabricated by 3D&#8208;printing. The enhanced mechanical properties of the PEGgel system may be extended to other polymer networks (both chemically and physically cross&#8208;linked). Such a simple 3D&#8208;printable, self&#8208;healing, and tough soft material holds promise for broad applications in wearable electronics, soft actuators and robotics.

         <dc:description>
The authors create the photonic&#8208;crystal&#8208;directed molecular design platform through covalent gridization of wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymers. Via solvent&#8208;casting method, conjugated nanopolymers perform the in situ mesoscale self&#8208;assembly into 1D photonic crystals with multilayer microstructures. These photonic crystals show a high mechanical toughness, a high optical transmittance, an angle&#8208;dependent photoluminescence switching, and an ultralow waveguide loss, potential for bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Organic semiconducting emitters integrated with butterfly&#8208;mimetic photonic crystals (PhCs) are fascinating for dramatic advantages over light outcoupling efficiency and multifunctional strain sensors, as well as the key step toward electrically pumped lasers. Herein, an unprecedentedly direct mesoscale self&#8208;assembly into 1D PhCs is reported through a covalently gridization&#8208;driven approach of wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymers. A simple solvent&#8208;casting procedure allows for in situ self&#8208;assembly of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conjugated nanopolymer, poly{[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]grid}&#8208;co&#8208;{[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]grid} (PODPFG), into well&#8208;defined multilayer architectures with an excellent toughness (30&#8211;40 J m&#8211;3). This ordered meso&#8208;architecture shows a typical Bragg&#8211;Snell diffraction behavior to testify the PhC nature, along with a high effective refractive index (1.80&#8211;1.88) and optical transmittance (85&#8211;87%). The PhC films also exhibit an angle&#8208;dependent blue/green photoluminescence switching, an electroluminescence efficiency enhancement by 150&#8211;250%, and an amplified spontaneous emission enhancement with ultralow waveguide loss coefficient (2.60 cm&#8211;1). Gridization of organic semiconductors offers promising opportunities for cross&#8208;scale morphology&#8208;directed molecular design in multifunctional organic mechatronics and intelligences.

         <title>Unraveling Crystallization Mechanisms and Electronic Structure of Phase&#8208;Change Materials by Large&#8208;Scale Ab Initio Simulations</title>

         <dc:description>
The crystallization mechanism of GeSb2Te4 is described via ab initio computer simulations with system sizes of more than 1000 atoms. The smooth overlap of atomic positions kernel is utilized to reveal the evolution of both geometrical and chemical order during crystallization. The connection between structural and electronic properties of the recrystallized models is studied.








Abstract
Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te (&#8220;GST&#8221;) alloys are leading phase&#8208;change materials for digital memories and neuro&#8208;inspired computing. Upon fast crystallization, these materials form rocksalt&#8208;like phases with large structural and vacancy disorder, leading to an insulating phase at low temperature. Here, a comprehensive description of crystallization, structural disorder, and electronic properties of GeSb2Te4 based on realistic, quantum&#8208;mechanically based (&#8220;ab initio&#8221;) computer simulations with system sizes of more than 1000 atoms is provided. It is shown how an analysis of the crystallization mechanism based on the smooth overlap of atomic positions kernel reveals the evolution of both geometrical and chemical order. The connection between structural and electronic properties of the disordered, as&#8208;crystallized models, which are relevant to the transport properties of GST, is then studied. Furthermore, it is shown how antisite defects and extended Sb&#8208;rich motifs can lead to Anderson localization in the conduction band. Beyond memory applications, these findings are therefore more generally relevant to disordered rocksalt&#8208;like chalcogenides that exhibit self&#8208;doping, since they can explain the origin of Anderson insulating behavior in both p&#8208; and n&#8208;doped chalcogenide materials.

         <title>Molecular Self&#8208;Assembly Enables Tuning of Nanopores in Atomically Thin Graphene Membranes for Highly Selective Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membranes with precise pore size distributions are needed for efficient and selective separations for a sustainable future. Self&#8208;assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes across nanopores in atomically thin graphene membranes is shown to enable controllable size&#8208;dependent sealing of nanopores to tighten their size distribution and attenuate leakage. The enhanced membrane selectivity, without compromising water permeance, allows for desalination under forward osmosis.








Abstract
Atomically thin membranes comprising nanopores in a 2D material promise to surpass the performance of polymeric membranes in several critical applications, including water purification, chemical and gas separations, and energy harvesting. However, fabrication of membranes with precise pore size distributions that provide exceptionally high selectivity and permeance in a scalable framework remains an outstanding challenge. Circumventing these constraints, here, a platform technology is developed that harnesses the ability of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to self&#8208;assemble preferentially across larger, relatively leaky atomically thin nanopores by exploiting the lower steric hindrance of such larger pores to molecular interactions across the pores. By selectively tightening the pore size distribution in this manner, self&#8208;assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes simultaneously introduced on opposite sides of nanoporous graphene membranes is demonstrated to discriminate between nanopores to seal non&#8208;selective transport channels, while minimally compromising smaller, water&#8208;selective pores, thereby remarkably attenuating solute leakage. This improved membrane selectivity enables desalination across centimeter&#8208;scale nanoporous graphene with 99.7% and &gt;90%&#160;rejection of MgSO4 and NaCl, respectively, under forward osmosis. These findings provide a versatile strategy to augment the performance of nanoporous atomically thin membranes and present intriguing possibilities of controlling reactions across 2D materials via exclusive exploitation of pore size&#8208;dependent intermolecular interactions.

         <title>Electronegativity&#8208;Induced Charge Balancing to Boost Stability and Activity of Amorphous Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and stability of amorphous MoSxOy via a charge&#8208;balancing strategy is reported. Co&#8208;doping of Rh and Sn with different electronegativities induces local charge redistribution, which shifts the H attacking site and HER&#8208;active sites. As a result, the co&#8208;doped amorphous catalysts outperform undoped and single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped MoSxOy.








Abstract
Amorphization is an efficient strategy to activate intrinsically inert catalysts. However, the low crystallinity of amorphous catalysts often causes high solubility and poor electrochemical stability in aqueous solution. Here, a different mechanism is developed to simultaneously stabilize and activate the water&#8208;soluble amorphous MoSxOy via a charge&#8208;balancing strategy, which is induced by different electronegativity between the co&#8208;dopants Rh (2.28) and Sn (1.96). The electron&#8208;rich Sn prefers to stabilize the unstable apical O sites in MoSxOy through charge transfer, which can prevent the H from attacking. Meanwhile, the Rh, as the charge regulator, shifts the main active sites on the basal plane from inert Sn to active apical Rh sites. As a result, the amorphous RhSn&#8208;MoSxOy exhibits drastic enhancement in electrochemical stability (&#951;10 increases only by 12&#160;mV) after 1000 cycles and a distinct activity (&#951;10: 26&#160;mV and Tafel: 30.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) for the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic solution. This work paves a route for turning impracticably water&#8208;soluble catalysts into treasure and inspires new ideas to design high&#8208;performance amorphous electrocatalysts.

         <title>Tunable Nanoscale Evolution and Topological Phase Transitions of a Polar Vortex Supercrystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical simulation and X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal that the stability and nanoscale evolution of the polar vortex supercrystal with 3D periodicity in the PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattice under optical, thermal, and electrical stimuli, which includes the erase process of the supercrystal, the new stripe supercrystal, as well as the vortex&#8211;skyrmion topological phase transition.








Abstract
Understanding the phase transitions and domain evolutions of mesoscale topological structures in ferroic materials is critical to realizing their potential applications in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance storage devices. Here, the behaviors of a mesoscale supercrystal are studied with 3D nanoscale periodicity and rotational topology phases in a PbTiO3/SrTiO3 (PTO/STO) superlattice under thermal and electrical stimuli using a combination of phase&#8208;field simulations and X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. A phase diagram of temperature versus polar state is constructed, showing the formation of the supercrystal from a mixed vortex and a&#8208;twin state and a temperature&#8208;dependent erasing process of a supercrystal returning to a classical a&#8208;twin structure. Under an in&#8208;plane electric field bias at room temperature, the vortex topology of the supercrystal irreversibly transforms to a new type of stripe&#8208;like supercrystal. Under an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric field, the vortices inside the supercrystal undergo a topological phase transition to polar skyrmions. These results demonstrate the potential for the on&#8208;demand manipulation of polar topology and transformations in supercrystals using electric fields. The findings provide a theoretical understanding that may be utilized to guide the design and control of mesoscale polar structures and to explore novel polar structures in other systems and their topological nature.

         <title>Boosting Continuous&#8208;Wave Laser&#8208;Driven Nonlinear Photothermal White Light Generation by Nanoscale Porosity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;laser&#8208;driven white light emission intensity can be enhanced up to 100 folds by introducing nanoscale porosity to a silica medium doped with rare&#8208;earth ions. The process involves strong nonlinear photothermal emission, and it is promising to be used as a broadband NIR light source, which could be exploited for applications including NIR spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing.








Abstract
The irradiation of an optically absorptive medium by a continuous&#8208;wave (CW) near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser can result in a spectral continuum emission covering both the visible and NIR regions, which is attractive for applications as continuum light sources in diverse fields. It is shown here that this NIR&#8208;laser&#8208;driven light emission can be effectively modulated with nanoscale architecture in the medium. By using porous silica as the model matrix and Yb3+ ions as the photothermally active centers, up to 100 folds increment in NIR&#8208;laser&#8208;induced emission intensity and dramatic decrease in threshold excitation density are demonstrated. It is observed that the emission intensity exhibits a strong nonlinear dependence on the power of the NIR excitation laser, featuring clear excitation power thresholds. Based on combined numerical simulation and spectral and temperature measurements, the improved broadband emission and photothermal nonlinearity are interpreted by enhanced optical energy localization around the laser spot that results in boosting the photon&#8208;to&#8208;photon conversion efficiency. The use of the nonlinear photothermal emission process as a broadband NIR light source, which could be exploited for applications including NIR spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing, is further demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept.

         <title>Photoresponsive Vaccine&#8208;Like CAR&#8208;M System with High&#8208;Efficiency Central Immune Regulation for Inflammation&#8208;Related Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed concept of the CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM system makes a breakthrough in the treatment of inflammation&#8208;related depression. By precisely regulating inflammation in the central nervous system, this drug delivery system can exert a light&#8208;response immune regulation effect, inhibit the polarization of M1 type microglia, and produce a vaccine&#8208;like effect to prevent inflammation&#8208;related depression.








Abstract
Increasing evidence suggests that activation of microglia&#8208;induced neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of depression. Consequently, targeting the central nervous system to reduce neuroinflammation holds great promise for the treatment of depression. However, few drugs can enter the brain via a circulatory route through the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) to reach the central nervous system efficiently, which limits the pharmacological treatment for neuropsychiatric diseases. Herein, a light&#8208;responsive system named UZPM, consisting of blue&#8208;emitting NaYF4:Yb, Tm@zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate framework (UCNP@ZIF&#8208;8), photoacid (PA), and melatonin (MT) is developed to address the above issues. Meanwhile, UZPM is introduced into macrophages by functional liposomes fusion and modified with hydroxylamine groups on the cell surface. Aldehyde&#8208;modified cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein&#8208;4 (CTLA&#8208;4) is used as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting group to modify the surface of macrophages by aldehyde/hydroxylamine condensation to precisely target central M1&#8208;type microglia (CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the CAR&#8208;M&#8208;UZPM drug delivery system can efficiently penetrate the BBB, targeting centrally activated microglia, and thus, inhibiting the M1&#8208;type polarization of microglia, producing continuous vaccine&#8208;like anti&#8208;inflammatory effects that prevent the occurrence and development of inflammation&#8208;related depression.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Growing a Tenacious Hydrogel Coating from a Sticky Initiation Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative modification method, namely ultraviolet&#8208;triggered surface catalytically initiated radical polymerization from a sticky initiation layer, based on in situ interface redox mechanism, is proposed for mildly/controllably growing hydrogel coatings on practically any substrate's (natural or artificial materials)/medical device's surface regardless of surface topology and material category.








Abstract
Controllably coating the surfaces of substrates/medical devices with hydrogels exhibits great application potential, but lacks universal techniques. Herein, a new method, namely ultraviolet&#8208;triggered surface catalytically initiated radical polymerization (UV&#8208;SCIRP) from a sticky initiation layer (SIL) (SIL@UV&#8208;SCIRP), is proposed for growing hydrogel coatings. The method involves three key steps: 1) depositing a sticky polydopamine/Fe3+ coating on the surface of the substrates&#8208;SIL, 2) reducing Fe3+ ions to Fe2+ ions as active catalysts by UV illumination with the assistance of citric acid, and 3) conducting SCIRP in a monomer solution at room temperature for growing hydrogel coatings. In this manner, practically any substrate's surface (natural or artificial materials) can be modified by hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness and diverse compositions. The hydrogel coatings exhibit good interface bonding with the substrates and enable easy changes in their wettability and lubrication performances. Importantly, this novel method facilitates the smooth growth of uniform hydrogel lubrication coatings on the surface of a range of medical devices with complex geometries. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the slippery balls coated with hydrogel exhibited smooth movement within the catheter and esophagus. Hence, this method can prove to be a pioneering universal modification tool, especially in surface/interface science and engineering.

         <title>Controlled Switching of the Number of Skyrmions in a Magnetic Nanodot by Electric Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven cascading transition of skyrmion clusters in nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructure is realized, which allows a continuous multilevel transition of the number of skyrmions in a one&#8208;by&#8208;one manner. Most notably, the transition is non&#8208;volatile and reversible. The results open up a new direction for constructing low&#8208;power&#8208;consuming, non&#8208;volatile, and multi&#8208;bit skyrmionic devices.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are topological swirling spin configurations that hold promise for building future magnetic memories and logic circuits. Skyrmionic devices typically rely on the electrical manipulation of a single skyrmion, but controllably manipulating a group of skyrmions can lead to more compact and memory&#8208;efficient devices. Here, an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven cascading transition of skyrmion clusters in a nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructure is reported, which allows a continuous multilevel transition of the number of skyrmions in a one&#8208;by&#8208;one manner.

&lt;p&gt;An electric-field-driven cascading transition of skyrmion clusters in nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructure is realized, which allows a continuous multilevel transition of the number of skyrmions in a one-by-one manner. Most notably, the transition is non-volatile and reversible. The results open up a new direction for constructing low-power-consuming, non-volatile, and multi-bit skyrmionic devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic skyrmions are topological swirling spin configurations that hold promise for building future magnetic memories and logic circuits. Skyrmionic devices typically rely on the electrical manipulation of a single skyrmion, but controllably manipulating a group of skyrmions can lead to more compact and memory-efficient devices. Here, an electric-field-driven cascading transition of skyrmion clusters in a nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructure is reported, which allows a continuous multilevel transition of the number of skyrmions in a one-by-one manner. Most notably, the transition is non-volatile and reversible, which is crucial for multi-bit memory applications. Combined experiments and theoretical simulations reveal that the switching of skyrmion clusters is induced by the strain-mediated modification of both the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and effective uniaxial anisotropy. The results not only open up a new direction for constructing low-power-consuming, non-volatile, and multi-bit skyrmionic devices, but also offer valuable insights into the fundamental physics underlying the voltage manipulation of skyrmion clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Resolving the Spatial Variation and Correlation of Hyperfine Spin Properties in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hyperfine interaction is an important spin quantum property in organic semiconductors. Exploiting the electroluminescence response of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes to magnetic fields, large intra&#8208;device variations of this property exceeding &#8776;30% are resolved which are spatially correlated over characteristic lengths of 7 &#181;m. This has implications for the reproducibility and integration of organic devices which rely on spin for their functionality.








Abstract
Devices that exploit the quantum properties of materials are widespread, with quantum information processors and quantum sensors showing significant progress. Organic materials offer interesting opportunities for quantum technologies owing to their engineerable spin properties, with spintronic operation and spin resonance magnetic&#8208;field sensing demonstrated in research grade devices, as well as proven compatibility with large&#8208;scale fabrication techniques. Yet several important challenges remain as moving toward scaling these proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle quantum devices to larger integrated logic systems or spatially smaller sensing elements, particularly those associated with the variation of quantum properties both within and between devices. Here, spatially resolved magnetoluminescence is used to provide the first 2D map of a hyperfine spin property&#8212;the Overhauser field&#8212;in traditional organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Intra&#8208;device variabilities are found to exceed &#8776;30% while spatially correlated behavior is exhibited on lengths beyond 7&#160;&#181;m, similar in size to pixels in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art active&#8208;matrix OLED arrays, which has implications for the reproducibility and integration of organic quantum devices.

Bioelectronics
The cyborg brain organoid platform reported by Jia Liu and co&#8208;workers in article number 2106829 features &#8220;tissue&#8208;like&#8221; stretchable mesh nanoelectronics designed to match the mechanical properties of brain organoids and to be folded by the organogenetic process of progenitor or stem cells. Long&#8208;term stable, continuous recording is enabled and the emergence of single&#8208;cell action potentials from early&#8208;stage brain organoid development can be captured. A 3D reconstructed fluorescence image of cyborg brain organoid tissue is shown. The red represents neural stem cells, the green neurons, the blue cell nuclei, and the yellow soft nanoelectronic interconnects and sensors.

All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Photovoltaics
Monolithic multijunction solar cells using lead&#8208;halide perovskite materials can deliver high performance at low material and processing costs. In article number 2110053, Ren&#233; A. J. Janssen and co&#8208;workers report surface&#8208;treatment and light&#8208;management strategies to reduce performance losses arising from nonradiative recombination and optical losses. The cover artwork shows the interaction of photogenerated electrons and holes at the interface between wide&#8208; and narrow&#8208;bandgap sub&#8208;cells of the tandem device.

An electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven cascading transition of skyrmion clusters in a nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructure is realized by Zhipeng Hou, Yangfan Hu, and co&#8208;workers, as described in article number 2107908, allowing a continuous multilevel transition of the number of skyrmions in a one&#8208;by&#8208;one manner. Most notably, the transition is nonvolatile and reversible. These results open up a new direction for constructing low&#8208;power&#8208;consuming, nonvolatile, and multibit skyrmionic devices.

Structural Color
A view of the large&#8208;scale assembly of structural colors by different nanoresonators is shown, as described by Andrea Fratalocchi and co&#8208;workers in article number 2108013. Each nanoresonator is deformed in all dimensions, including the vertical axis, and supports competing mechanisms of scattering and resonant light&#8211;matter interactions that yield in high&#8208;resolution, a complete gamut of colors even exceeding the red, green, and blue spectrum.

Phase&#8208;Change Memory Materials
In article number 2109139, Wei Zhang, Riccardo Mazzarello, and co&#8208;workers study the crystallization and electronic properties of the GeSb2Te4 phase&#8208;change memory material, based on ab initio simulations with more than 1000 atoms. The smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) similarity measure reveals the evolution of the crystallization process, and as&#8208;crystallized models are used to study the connection between structural and electronic properties, which is relevant to the transport behavior of Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te alloys.

Nanomedicine
The liver is the primary accumulation site for intravenously administered nanocarriers or incidental nanoparticles that gain access to the systemic circulation. Liver distribution and cellular uptake of nanoparticles by various liver cells could influence the therapeutic efficacy. Understanding nano&#8211;liver interactions is critical for the design of much safer and more effective nano&#8208;theranostics to treat diverse diseases, as discussed by Chunying Chen, Tian Xia, and Jiulong Li in article number 2106456.

The widespread exposure of nanomaterials to the body and gaining access to systemic circulation lead to nanomaterial liver accumulation. This induces cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific uptake and responses to NMs with various physicochemical properties. Understanding nano&#8208;liver interactions helps to develop safer nanoproducts and more effective nanomedicine.








Abstract
Nanomaterials (NMs) are widely used in commercial and medical products, such as cosmetics, vaccines, and drug carriers. Exposure to NMs via various routes such as dermal, inhalation, and ingestion has been shown to gain access to the systemic circulation, resulting in the accumulation of NMs in the liver. The unique organ structures and blood flow features facilitate the liver sequestration of NMs, which may cause adverse effects in the liver. Currently, most in vivo studies are focused on NMs accumulation at the organ level and evaluation of the gross changes in liver structure and functions, however, cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific uptake and responses, as well as the molecular mechanisms at cellular levels leading to effects at organ levels are lagging. Herein, the authors systematically review diverse interactions of NMs with the liver, specifically on major liver cell types including Kupffer cells (KCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and hepatocytes as well as the detailed molecular mechanisms involved. In addition, the knowledge gained on nano&#8208;liver interactions that can facilitate the development of safer nanoproducts and nanomedicine is also reviewed.

Emerging S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has demonstrated its superiority in photocatalysis. This article covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. Design principles for S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are proposed and four types of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are suggested. Direct characterization methods for electron transfer in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are presented. Different photocatalytic applications are summarized. Especially, the curved Fermi level in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction interface is discussed.








Abstract
Photocatalysis is a green technology to use ubiquitous and intermittent sunlight. The emerging S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has demonstrated its superiority in photocatalysis. This article covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress and provides new insights into its general designing criteria. It starts with the challenges confronted by single photocatalyst from the perspective of energy dissipation by borrowing the common behaviors in the dye molecule. Subsequently, other problems faced by single photocatalyst are summarized. Then a viable solution for these problems is the construction of heterojunctions. To overcome the problems and mistakes of type&#8208;II and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is proposed and the underlying reaction mechanism is summarized. Afterward, the design principles for S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are proposed and four types of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are suggested. Following this, direct characterization techniques for testifying the charge transfer in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are presented. Finally, different photocatalytic applications of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are summarized. Specifically, this work endeavors to clarify the critical understanding on curved Fermi level in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction interface, which can help strengthen and advance the fundamental theories of photocatalysis. Moreover, the current challenges and prospects of the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst are critically discussed.

         <title>Dimensional Design and Core&#8211;Shell Engineering of Nanomaterials for Electromagnetic Wave Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 11, March 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the coordination between the components and microstructures of low&#8208;dimensional core&#8211;shell structure materials represents a paradigm shift in the design of electromagnetic wave absorbents with radiation prevention and antiradar stealth functions.








Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption materials possess exceptionally high EM energy loss efficiency. With vigorous developments in nanotechnology, such materials have exhibited numerous advanced EM functions, including radiation prevention and antiradar stealth. To achieve improved EM performance and multifunctionality, the elaborate control of microstructures has become an attractive research direction. By designing them as core&#8211;shell structures with different dimensions, the combined effects, such as interfacial polarization, conduction networks, magnetic coupling, and magnetic&#8211;dielectric synergy, can significantly enhance the EM wave absorption performance. Herein, the advances in low&#8208;dimensional core&#8211;shell EM wave absorption materials are outlined and a selection of the most remarkable examples is discussed. The derived key information regarding dimensional design, structural engineering, performance, and structure&#8211;function relationship are comprehensively summarized. Moreover, the investigation of the cutting&#8208;edge mechanisms is given particular attention. Additional applications, such as oxidation resistance and self&#8208;cleaning functions, are also introduced. Finally, insight into what may be expected from this rapidly expanding field and future challenges are presented.

         <dc:description>
MOF&#8208;derived electrocatalysts/electrodes have excellent prospects in energy storage and conversion systems. This paper presents an in&#8208;depth review of the application of ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived electrocatalysts for OER, HER, and overall water splitting, highlighting experimental and computational results demonstrated in the literature. Recent progress in synthesis routes and strategies used to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of ZIF&#8208;67 derived electrocatalysts is explicitly discussed.








Abstract
Design and construction of low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability is a challenging task in the field of catalysis. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) are promising candidates as precursor materials in the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications. This review starts with a summary of basic concepts and key evaluation parameters involved in the electrochemical water&#8208;splitting reaction. Then, different synthesis approaches reported for the cobalt&#8208;based Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;67) and its derivatives are critically reviewed. Additionally, several strategies employed to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability of ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail. The present review provides a succinct insight into the ZIF&#8208;67 and its derivatives (oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphide, nitrides, telluride, heteroatom/metal&#8208;doped carbon, noble metal&#8208;supported ZIF&#8208;67 derivatives) reported for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting applications. Finally, this review concludes with the associated challenges and the perspectives on developing the best economic, durable electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>In&#8208;situ inorganic ligand replenishment enables bandgap stability in mixed&#8208;halide perovskite quantum dot solids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Instability in mixed halide perovskites (MHPs) is a key issue limiting perovskite solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). One form of instability arises during the processing of MHP quantum dots using an antisolvent to precipitate and purify the dots forming surface traps which lead to decreased luminescence, compromised colloidal stability, and emission broadening. Here we report the introduction of inorganic ligands in the antisolvents used in dot purification in order to overcome this problem. We demonstrate MHPs that are colloidally stable for over 1 year at 25&#176;C&#160;and 40% humidity and report films that are stable under 100 W cm&#8211;2 photoirradiation, 4x longer than the best previously&#8208;reported MHPs. In LEDs, the materials enable an EQE of 24.4% (average 22.5&#160;&#177; 1.3%) and narrow emission (full&#8208;width at half maximum of 30&#160;nm). We report sixfold&#8208;enhanced operating stability relative to the most stable prior red perovskite LEDs having EQEs &gt;&#160;20%.

         <title>Raising the intrinsic safety of layered oxide cathodes by surface re&#8208;lithiation with LLZTO garnet&#8208;type solid electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Battery safety concerns are becoming more and more prominent with the increasing demands of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with higher energy density. The greatest threat to battery safety derives from the easy release of oxygen from the high&#8208;capacity layered oxide cathodes at highly delithiated states and subsequent exothermic reactions with reductive agents in batteries. Herein, we demonstrate that solid electrolyte Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) can supply lithium ions to re&#8208;lithiate the charged LiCoO2 at elevated temperatures. Such a re&#8208;lithiation process can lower the state&#8208;of&#8208;charge of LiCoO2, and thus, inherently postpones its structural decomposition and the associated release of oxygen during the heating process. The LiCoO2/graphite full cell with 1&#160;wt.% addition of LLZTO demonstrates remarkably enhanced safety performances. Our work proposes a strategy that through the adoption of solid electrolytes to solve safety issues raised from both flammable liquid electrolytes and high capacity cathodes, to achieve intrinsically safe LIBs or solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Crystal Growth Regulation of 2D/3D Perovskite Films for Solar Cells with Both High Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal growth in 2D/3D perovskite films is regulated by introducing a 2D (NpMA)2PbI4 perovskite or NpMAI into the PbI2 precursor solutions using a two&#8208;step deposition method. The optimized film shows much enlarged grain size and significantly reduced trap density, which enables a champion efficiency of 24.37% for a 0.10 cm&#8722;2 device and 22.26% for a 1.01 cm&#8722;2 device.








Abstract
Reducing the electronic defects in perovskite films has become a substantial challenge to further boost the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells. Here, 2D (NpMA)2PbI4 perovskite and 1&#8208;naphthalenemethylammonium iodide (NpMAI) are separately introduced into the PbI2 precursor solutions to regulate the crystal growth in a 2D/3D perovskite film using a two&#8208;step deposition method. The (NpMA)2PbI4 modulated perovskite film shows a significantly improved film quality with enlarged grain size from &#8776;500&#160;nm to over 1000&#160;nm, which greatly reduces the grain&#8208;boundary defects, improves the charge carrier lifetime, and hinders ionic diffusion. As a result, the best&#8208;performing device shows a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.37% for a small&#8208;area (0.10 cm&#8722;2) device and a superior PCE of 22.26% for a large&#8208;area (1.01 cm&#8722;2) device. Importantly, the unencapsulated device shows a dramatically improved operational stability with maintains over 98% of its initial efficiency after 1500 h by maximum power point (MPP) tracking under continuous light irradiation.

The (NpMA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; modulated perovskite film shows a significantly improved film quality with enlarged grain size from &#8776;500&#160;nm to over 1000&#160;nm, which greatly reduces the grain-boundary defects, improves the charge carrier lifetime, and hinders ionic diffusion. As a result, the best-performing device shows a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.37% for a small-area (0.10 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) device and a superior PCE of 22.26% for a large-area (1.01 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) device. Importantly, the unencapsulated device shows a dramatically improved operational stability with maintains over 98% of its initial efficiency after 1500 h by maximum power point (MPP) tracking under continuous light irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Low&#8208;Temperature Annealing Method for Alloy Nanostructures and Metasurfaces: Unlocking a Novel Degree of Freedom</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In principle, alloying metals requires high temperatures. In this work, it is shown that it is possible to fully alloy gold and silver at low temperature to produce nanostructures with controlled, arbitrary, shapes, and stoichiometries. Furthermore, a combination of nanostructures with different stoichiometries on the same substrate enables the realization of optical elements and metasurfaces with useful optical responses.








Abstract
The material and exact shape of a nanostructure determine its optical response, which is especially strong for plasmonic metals. Unfortunately, only a few plasmonic metals are available, which limits the spectral range where these strong optical effects can be utilized. Alloying different plasmonic metals can overcome this limitation, at the expense of using a high&#8208;temperature alloying process, which adversely destroys the nanostructure shape. Here, a low&#8208;temperature alloying process is developed where the sample is heated at only 300&#160;&#176;C for 8 h followed by 30&#160;min at 450&#160;&#176;C and Au&#8211;Ag nanostructures with a broad diversity of shapes, aspect ratios, and stoichiometries are fabricated. Energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirm the homogeneous alloying through the entire sample. Varying the alloy stoichiometry tunes the optical response and controls spectral features, such as Fano resonances. Binary metasurfaces that combine nanostructures with different stoichiometries are fabricated using multiple&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam lithography, and their optical function as a hologram or a Fresnel zone plate is demonstrated at the visible wavelength of &#955;&#160;= 532&#160;nm. This low&#8208;temperature annealing technique provides a versatile and cost&#8208;effective way of fabricating complex Au&#8211;Ag nanostructures with arbitrary stoichiometry.

         <title>Atomic Short&#8208;Range Order in a Cation&#8208;Deficient Perovskite Anode for Fast&#8208;Charging and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A cation&#8208;deficient perovskite oxide CeNb3O9 is designed as the anode for high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;life Li+ storage, delivering excellent rate performance and long&#8208;term cycling performance. Wheras the excellent cycling stability is attributed to the formation of atomic short&#8208;range order, the outstanding rate performance is explained by cation&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enhanced 3D&#8208;conduction networks.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;type oxides are widely used for energy conversion and storage, but their rate&#8208;inhibiting phase transition and large volume change hinder the applications of most perovskite&#8208;type oxides for high&#8208;rate electrochemical energy storage. Here, it is shown that a cation&#8208;deficient perovskite CeNb3O9 (CNO) can store a sufficient amount of lithium at a high charge/discharge rate, even when the sizes of the synthesized particles are on the order of micrometers. At 60 C (15 A g&#8722;1), corresponding to a 1 min charge, the CNO anode delivers over 52.8% of its capacity. In addition, the CNO anode material exhibits 96.6% capacity retention after 2000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 50 C (12.5 A g&#8722;1), indicating exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability at high rates. The excellent cycling performance is attributed to the formation of atomic short&#8208;range order, which significantly prevents local and long&#8208;range structural rearrangements, stabilizing the host structure and being responsible for the small volume evolution. Moreover, the extremely high rate capacity can be explained by the intrinsically large interstitial sites in multiple directions, intercalation pseudocapacitance, atomic short&#8208;range order, and cation&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enhanced 3D&#8208;conduction networks for lithium ions. These structural characteristics and mechanisms can be used to design advanced perovskite electrode materials for fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Optimally&#8208;Tailored Spinodal Architected Materials for Multiscale Design and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy unify optimal design and manufacturing of multiscale structures. By locally varying the spinodal class, orientation, and porosity during topology optimization, a large portion of the anisotropic material space is exploited such that material is efficiently placed along principal stress trajectories at the microscale. Additionally, the bicontinuous, nonperiodic, unstructured, and stochastic nature of spinodal architected materials promotes mechanical and biological functions not explicitly considered during optimization (e.g., insensitivity to imperfections, fluid transport conduits). Furthermore, in contrast to laminated composites or periodic, structured architected materials (e.g., lattices), the functional representation of spinodal architected materials leads to multiscale, optimized designs with clear physical interpretation that can be manufactured directly, without special treatment at spinodal transitions. Physical models of the optimized, spinodal&#8208;embedded parts are manufactured using a scalable, voxel&#8208;based strategy to communicate with a masked stereolithography 3D&#160;printer.

         <title>Carbon Dots as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for the Treatment of cancer&#8208;related Anemia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to the adverse effects of erythropoietin (EPO) on cancer patient survival, it is necessary to develop new agents that can be used to efficiently manage and treat cancer&#8208;related anemia. In this study, novel distinctive carbon dots, J&#8208;CDs, derived from jujube are designed, synthesized, and characterized. Based on the obtained results, this material comprises sp2 and sp3 carbon atoms, as well as oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;based groups, and it specifically promotes the proliferation of erythroid cells by stimulating the self&#8208;renewal of erythroid progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, J&#8208;CDs have no discernible effects on tumor proliferation and metastasis, unlike EPO. Transcriptome profiling suggests that J&#8208;CDs upregulate the molecules involved in hypoxia response, and they also significantly increase the phosphorylation levels of STAT5, the major transducer of signals for erythroid progenitor cell proliferation. Overall, our study demonstrates that J&#8208;CDs effectively promote erythrocyte production without affecting tumor proliferation and metastasis; thus, they may be promising agents for the treatment of cancer&#8208;related anemia.

         <title>Structural Modularization of Cu2Te Leading to High Thermoelectric Performance near the Mott&#8208;Ioffe&#8208;Regel Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To date, thermoelectric materials research stays focused on optimizing the material's band edge details and disfavors low mobility. Here, we shift the paradigm from the band edge to the mobility edge, exploring high thermoelectricity near the border of band conduction and hopping. Through co&#8208;alloying iodine and sulfur, we modularize the plain crystal structure of liquid&#8208;like thermoelectric material Cu2Te with mosaic nanograins and the highly size mismatched S/Te sublattice that chemically quenches the Cu sublattice and drives the electronic states from itinerant to localized. A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art figure of merit of 1.4 is obtained at 850 K for Cu2(S0.4I0.1Te0.5); and remarkably, it is achieved near the Mott&#8208;Ioffe&#8208;Regel limit unlike mainstream thermoelectric materials that are band conductors. Broadly, pairing structural modularization with the high performance near the Mott&#8208;Ioffe&#8208;Regel limit paves an important new path towards the rational design of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials.

A state-of-the-art figure of merit of 1.4 is obtained at 850 K for Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;); and remarkably, it is achieved near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit unlike mainstream thermoelectric materials that are band conductors. Broadly, pairing structural modularization with the high performance near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit paves an important new path towards the rational design of high-performance thermoelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Are Liquid Metals Bulk Conductors?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretchable electronics have potential in wide&#8208;reaching applications including wearables, personal health monitoring, and soft robotics. Many recent advances in stretchable electronics leverage liquid metals, particularly eutectic gallium&#8208;indium (EGaIn). A variety of EGaIn electromechanical behaviors have been reported, ranging from bulk conductor responses to effectively strain&#8208;insensitive responses. However, numerous measurement techniques have been used throughout the literature, making it difficult to directly compare the various proposed formulations. Here, we&#160;review the electromechanical responses of EGaIn found in the literature and investigate pure EGaIn using three electrical resistance measurement techniques: four point probe, two point probe, and Wheatstone bridge. Our&#160;results indicate substantial differences in measured electromechanical behavior between the three methods, which can largely be accounted for by correcting for a fixed offset corresponding to the resistances of various parts of the measurement circuits. Yet, even accounting for several of these sources of experimental error, we&#160;find the average relative change in resistance of EGaIn to be lower than that predicted by the commonly used bulk conductor assumption, referred to as Pouillet's law. Building upon recent theories proposed in the literature, we&#160;discuss possible explanations for the discrepancies. Finally, we&#160;provide suggestions on experimental design to enable reproducible and interpretable&#160;research.&#160;

         <title>A Hierarchically Encoded Data Storage Device with Controlled Transiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In the era of information explosion, high&#8208;security and high&#8208;capacity data storage technology attracts more and more attention. Physically transient electronics, a form of electronics that can physically disappear with precisely controlled degradation behaviors, paves the way for secure data storage. Herein, we report a silk&#8208;based hierarchically encoded data storage device (HEDSD) with controlled transiency. The HEDSD can store electronic, photonic and optical information simultaneously by synergistically integrating a resistive switching memory (ReRAM), a terahertz metamaterial device (THz MM), and a diffractive optical element (DOE), respectively. These three data storage units have shared materials and structures but diverse encoding mechanisms, which simplifies the fabrication process while increases the degree of complexity and capacity of stored information. Silk plays an important role as a building material in the HEDSD thanks to its excellent mechanical, optical and electrical properties and controlled transiency as a naturally extracted protein. By controlling the degradation rate of storage units of the silk&#8208;based HEDSD, different degradation modes of the HEDSD and multi&#8208;level information encryption/decryption have been realized. Compared with the conventional memory devices, as&#8208;reported silk&#8208;based HEDSD can store multi&#8208;level complex information and realize multi&#8208;level information encryption and decryption, which is highly desirable to fulfill the future demands of secure memory systems and implantable storage devices.

         <title>Semiconductor Contact&#8208;electrification Dominated Tribovoltaic Effect for Ultrahigh Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The semiconductor direct&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerator (SDC&#8208;TENG) based on the tribovoltaic effect is promising for developing a new semiconductor energy technology with high&#8208;power density. Here, we report the first SDC&#8208;TENG built using gallium nitride (GaN) and bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) for ultrahigh&#8208;power generation. During the friction process, an additional interfacial electric field is formed by continuous contact electrification (CE), and abundant electron&#8208;hole pairs are excited and move directionally to form a junction current that is always internally from Bi2Te3 to GaN, regardless of the semiconductor type. The peak open&#8208;circuit voltage can reach up to 40&#160;V and the power density is 11.85 Wm&#8722;2 (average value is 9.23 Wm&#8722;2), which is approximately 200 times higher than that of previous centimeter&#8208;level SDC&#8208;TENGs. Moreover, compared to traditional polymer TENGs under the same conditions, the average power density is remarkably improved by over 40 times. This study provides the first evidence of CE on the tribovoltaic effect and sets the normalized power density record of TENG, which demonstrates a great potential of the tribovoltaic effect for energy harvesting and sensing.

         <title>Roles of MXenes in Pressure Sensing: Preparation, Composite Structure Design and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible pressure sensors are one of the most important components in the fields of electronic skin, robotics and health monitoring. However, the application of pressure sensors in practice is still difficult and expensive due to the limited sensing properties and complex manufacturing process. The emergence of MXenes, a red&#8208;hot member of two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, has brought a brand&#8208;new breakthrough for pressure sensing. Ti3C2Tx is the most popular studied MXene in pressure sensing fields, and shows good mechanical, electrical properties, excellent hydrophilicity and extensive modifiability. It will ameliorate the properties of the sensitive layer and electrode layer of the pressure sensor, and further apply the pressure sensing to many fields such as electronic skin flexibly. Herein, the preparing technologies, antioxidant methods and properties of MXene are summarized. The design of MXene&#8208;based microstructures is mainly introduced, including hydrogels, aerogels, foam, fabrics, composite nanofibers. The mechanisms of MXene pressure sensor are further broached, including piezoresistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, triboelectric and potentiometric transduction mechanism. Moreover, the integration of multiple devices is reviewed. Finally, the chance and challenge of pressure sensors improved by MXene smart materials in the future electronic skin and the Internet of Things are prospected.

         <title>A sulfur&#8208;tolerant MOF&#8208;based single&#8208;atom Fe Catalyst for Efficient Oxidation of NO and Hg0</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Catalytic oxidation of NO and Hg0 is a crucial step to eliminate multiple pollutants from emissions from coal&#8208;fired power plants. However, traditional catalysts exhibit low catalytic activity and poor sulfur resistance due to low activation ability and poor adsorption selectivity. Herein, a single&#8208;atom Fe decorated N&#8208;doped carbon catalyst (Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C), with abundant Fe1&#8208;N4 sites, based on a Fe&#8208;doped metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) has been developed to oxidize NO and Hg0. The results demonstrate that the Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C has ultrahigh catalytic activity for oxidizing NO and Hg0 at low and room temperature.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic oxidation of NO and Hg&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is a crucial step to eliminate multiple pollutants from emissions from coal-fired power plants. However, traditional catalysts exhibit low catalytic activity and poor sulfur resistance due to low activation ability and poor adsorption selectivity. Herein, a single-atom Fe decorated N-doped carbon catalyst (Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-C), with abundant Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites, based on a Fe-doped metal-organic framework (MOF) has been developed to oxidize NO and Hg&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. The results demonstrate that the Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-C has ultrahigh catalytic activity for oxidizing NO and Hg&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; at low and room temperature. More importantly, Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-C exhibits robust sulfur resistance as it preferably adsorbs reactants over sulfur oxides, which has never been achieved before with traditional catalysts. Furthermore, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; boosts the catalytic oxidation of NO over Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-C through accelerating the circulation of active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; active sites result in a low energy barrier, high adsorption selectivity, and enhanced stability of Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-C, providing detailed molecular-level understanding for its excellent catalytic performance. This is the first report on NO and Hg&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation over single-atom catalysts with strong sulfur tolerance. The outcomes demonstrate that single-atom catalysts are promising candidates for catalytic oxidation of NO and Hg&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; enabling cleaner coal-fired power plant operations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>16.52% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with High Tolerance of the Photoactive Layer Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have drawn growing attentions and achieved tremendous progresses recently, but its power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags behind the small molecule acceptor (SMA)&#8208;based PSCs due to the relative difficulty on morphology control of the polymer photoactive blends. Here, we introduce our low&#8208;cost PTQ10 as the second polymer donor (the third component) into the PM6:PY&#8208;IT blend to finely tune energy level matching and microscopic morphology of the polymer blend photoactive layer. The addition of PTQ10 decreases the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance, and increases the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking coherence length and the ordered face&#8208;on molecular packing orientation, which improves charge separation and transport in the photoactive layer. Moreover, deeper highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of the polymer donor PTQ10 than PM6 leads to higher open&#8208;circuit voltage of the ternary all&#8208;PSCs. As a result, a PCE of 16.52% is achieved for the ternary all&#8208;PSCs, which is one of the highest PCEs for all&#8208;PSCs. In addition, the ternary devices exhibit high tolerance of the photoactive layer thickness with high PCEs of 15.27% and 13.91% at photoactive layer thickness of &#8764; 205&#160;nm and &#8764; 306&#160;nm respectively, which are the highest PCEs so far for the all&#8208;PSCs with thick photoactive layer.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironments&#8208;Adapted Polypeptide Hydrogel/Nanogel Composite Boosts Antitumor Molecular Targeted Inhibition and Immunoactivation</title>

Abstract
Various macro/microscopic biomaterials have been developed for controlled drug delivery in the combination therapy of malignancies. However, uncertain loading ratio, release sequence, and spatiotemporal distribution of drugs hinder their synergistic therapeutic effects and clinical applications. Herein, a tumor microenvironments&#8208;adapted composite consisting of thermo&#8208;sensitive hydrogel and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanogel was developed for precisely sequential drug release to enhance molecular targeted therapy and amplify immune activation. LY3200882 (LY), a selective transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) inhibitor, was encapsulated in the ROS&#8208;responsive nanogel and dispersed uniformly with regorafenib (REG) in a thermo&#8208;sensitive hydrogel (Gel/(REG+NG/LY)). After in situ administration, REG was preferentially released from the hydrogel to inhibit tumor growth and promote ROS generation, which triggered the subsequent on&#8208;demand release of LY from the nanogel. LY contributed to preventing the epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition and immune escape of tumor cells induced by elevated TGF&#8208;&#946;. In subcutaneous and orthotopic colorectal tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models, Gel/(REG+NG/LY) effectively inhibited tumor growth and liver metastasis by increasing the tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells, reducing the recruitment of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and promoting the polarization of macrophages from M2 to M1 type, indicating the significant potential in improving the prognosis of advanced cancer patients.

         <title>A dendritic polymer&#8208;based nanosystem mediates drug penetration and irreversible endoplasmic reticulum stresses in tumor via neighboring effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;based cancer therapeutics is generally impeded by poor drug penetration into solid tumors due to their dense tumor extracellular matrix (ECM). Herein, we develop pH/redox&#8208;responsive dendritic polymer&#8208;based NPs to amplify the neighboring effect for improving drug penetration and driving cell apoptosis via combination therapy. Pyropheophorbide a (Ppa) is conjugated with PEGylated dendritic peptides via disulfide bonds and doxorubicin (DOX) encapsulated in the conjugate to construct dual&#8208;responsive NPs, PDPP@D. Delayed released DOX and Ppa from PDPP@D exert their combination therapeutic effect to induce cell apoptosis, and then they are liberated out of dying cells to amplify the neighboring effect, resulting in their diffusion through the dense ECM and penetration into solid tumors. Transcriptome studies reveal that PDPP@D leads to irreversible stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and inhibits cell protection through blocking the IRE1&#8208;dependent survival pathway and unleashing the DR5&#8208;mediated caspase activity to promote cell death. The strategy of amplifying the neighboring effect of NPs through combination therapy may offer great potential in enhancing drug penetration and eradicating solid tumors.

         <title>Terahertz Chiral Metamaterials Enabled by Textile Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the polarization state of terahertz (THz) waves provides the basis for numerous THz applications but is challenging to realize. Leveraging a two&#8208;step textile manufacturing approach, a textile&#8208;based large&#8208;area and inexpensive chiral metamaterial is demonstrated for strong chiroptical responses at THz frequencies.








Abstract
Easy&#8208;to&#8208;fabricate, large&#8208;area, and inexpensive microstructures that realize control of the polarization of terahertz (THz) radiation are of fundamental importance to the development of the field of THz wave photonics. However, due to the lack of natural materials that can facilitate strong THz radiation&#8211;matter interactions, THz polarization components remain an undeveloped technology. Strong resonance&#8208;based responses offered by THz metamaterials have led to the recent development of THz metadevices, whereas, for polarization control devices, micrometer&#8208;scale fabrication techniques including aligned photolithography are generally required to create multilayer microstructures. In this work, leveraging a two&#8208;step textile manufacturing approach, a chiral metamaterial capable of exhibiting strong chiroptical responses at THz frequencies is demonstrated. Chiral&#8208;selective transmission and pronounced optical activity are experimentally observed. In sharp contrast to smart&#8208;clothing&#8208;related devices (e.g., textile antennas), the investigated chiral metamaterials gain their THz properties directly from the yarn&#8208;twisting enabled microhelical strings. It is envisioned that the interplay between meta&#8208;atom designs and textile manufacturing technology will lead to a new family of metadevices for complete control over the phase, amplitude, and polarization of THz radiation.

         <title>A Nanostructured Moisture&#8208;Absorbing Gel for Fast and Large&#8208;Scale Passive Dehumidification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanostructured moisture&#8208;absorbing gel is constructed by integrating hygroscopic lithium salt and hydrophilic nanocellulose. The gel maintains a large hygroscopic active area for capturing water from air, and thus exhibits super&#8208;moisture&#8208;absorption ability. Even in a space with a volume over 2 &#215; 104 times its own, the gel demonstrates fast dehumidification without energy input and environment pollution.








Abstract
Dehumidification is significant for environmental sustainability and human health. Traditional dehumidification methods involve significant energy consumption and have negative impact on the environment. The core challenge is to expose hygroscopic surfaces to the air, and appropriately store the captured water and avoid surface inactivation.

&lt;p&gt;A nanostructured moisture-absorbing gel is constructed by integrating hygroscopic lithium salt and hydrophilic nanocellulose. The gel maintains a large hygroscopic active area for capturing water from air, and thus exhibits super-moisture-absorption ability. Even in a space with a volume over 2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; times its own, the gel demonstrates fast dehumidification without energy input and environment pollution.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dehumidification is significant for environmental sustainability and human health. Traditional dehumidification methods involve significant energy consumption and have negative impact on the environment. The core challenge is to expose hygroscopic surfaces to the air, and appropriately store the captured water and avoid surface inactivation. Here, a nanostructured moisture-absorbing gel (N-MAG) for passive dehumidification, which consists of a hydrophilic nanocellulose network functionalized by hygroscopic lithium chloride, is reported. The interconnected nanocellulose can transfer the captured water to the internal space of the bulky N-MAG, eliminating water accumulation near the surfaces and hence enabling high-rate moisture absorption. The N-MAG can reduce the relative humidity from 96.7% to 28.7% in 6 h, even if the space is over 2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; times of its own volume. The condensed water can be completely confined in the N-MAG, overcoming the problem of environmental pollution. This research brings a new perspective for sustainable humidity management without energy consumption and with positive environmental footprint.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesoporous single crystals with Fe&#8208;rich skin for ultra&#8208;low overpotential in oxygen evolution catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key reaction in water splitting and metal&#8208;air batteries, and transition metal hydroxides have demonstrated the most electrocatalytic efficiency. Making the hydroxides thinner for more surface commonly fails to increase the active site number, because the real active sites are the edges. To now, the overpotentials of most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OER electrocatalysts at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (&#951;10) are still larger than 200&#160;mV. Herein, we show a novel design of mesoporous single crystal (MSC) with a Fe&#8208;rich skin to boost OER. The edges around the mesopores provide lots of real active sites and the Fe modification on these sites further improves the intrinsic activity. As a result, an ultra&#8208;low &#951;10 of 185&#160;mV is achieved, and the turnover frequency (TOF) based on Fe atoms is as high as 16.9 s&#8211;1 at an overpotential of 350&#160;mV. Moreover, the catalyst has an excellent catalytic stability, indicated by a negligible current drop after 10000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. The catalyst enables Zn&#8211;air batteries to run stably over 270 h with a low charge voltage of 1.89&#160;V. Our work shows that MSC materials can provide new opportunities for the design of electrocatalysts.

         <title>The Molecular Ordering and Double&#8208;Channel Carrier Generation of Nonfullerene Photovoltaics within Multi&#8208;Length&#8208;Scale Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double carrier&#8208;generation channels are observed: one is the direct photogeneration in the nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) crystal region and the other is the traditional charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state channel in the mixing region. The channel from the NFA crystal provides a new avenue of zero energy loss carrier formation. The NFA molecular packing and geometry is key in influencing the photophysics of NFA solar cells.








Abstract
The success of nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) solar cells lies in their unique physical properties beyond the extended absorption and suitable energy levels. The current study investigates the morphology and photophysical behavior of PBDB&#8208;T donor blending with ITIC, 4TIC, and 6TIC acceptors. Single&#8208;crystal study shows that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and side&#8208;chain interaction dictate molecular assembly, which can be carried to blended films, forming a multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale morphology. Spontaneous carrier generation is seen in ITIC, 4TIC, and 6TIC neat films and their blended thin films using the PBDB&#8208;T donor, providing a new avenue of zero&#8208;energy&#8208;loss carrier formation. The molecular packing associated with specific contacts and geometry is key in influencing the photophysics, as demonstrated by the charge transfer and carrier lifetime results. The 2D layer of 6TIC facilitates the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;polaron conversion, and the largest photogenerated polaron yield is obtained. The new mechanism, together with the highly efficient blending region carrier generation, has the prospect of the fundamental advantage for NFA solar cells, from molecular assembly to thin&#8208;film morphology.

         <title>Mulberry&#8208;Leaves&#8208;Derived Red&#8208;Emissive Carbon Dots for Feeding Silkworms to Produce Brightly Fluorescent Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots made from mulberry leaves have a strong near&#8208;infrared fluorescence with an absolute quantum yield of 73% and a full width at half maximum of 20 nm, and they exhibit excellent biocompatibility and biosafety for feeding silkworms. These silkworms grow healthily, cocoon, become moths, mate, lay eggs, and reproduce normally. Both the silkworms and the cocoons show bright red fluorescence.








Abstract
Fluorescent silk has promising applications in dazzling textiles, biological engineering, and medical products, but the natural Bombyx mori silk has almost no fluorescence. Here carbon dots (CDs) made from mulberry leaves are reported, which have a strong near&#8208;infrared fluorescence with absolute quantum yield of 73% and a full width at half maximum of 20&#160;nm. After feeding with such CDs, silkworms exhibit bright red fluorescence, grow healthily, cocoon normally, and turn to moths finally. The cocoons are pink in daylight and show bright red fluorescence under ultraviolet light. After breaking out of such cocoons, the red&#8208;emissive moths can mate and lay fluorescent eggs which would hatch normally. The growth cycle of the second generation of the test silkworm is the same as that of the control group, which means such CDs have excellent biocompatiblility. Dissection and analyses on both the test silkworms and cocoons disclose the metabolic route of the CDs, that is, the fluorescent CDs are absorbed by silkworms from alimentary canals, then transferred to silk glands, and finally to cocoons, while those unabsorbed CDs are excreted with the feces. All experimental results confirm the excellent biocompatibility and fluorescence stability of such CDs.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Diffusion Induced Capacity Losses in Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the novel and largely overlooked Li&#8208;trapping mechanism is introduced and compared to other known capacity loss mechanisms affecting lithium&#8208;based batteries. The diffusion&#8208;based trapping of active Li inside both positive and negative electrode materials, leads to continuous albeit reversible capacity losses.








Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8208;based batteries generally exhibit gradual capacity losses resulting in decreasing energy and power densities. For negative electrode materials, the capacity losses are largely attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase layer and volume expansion effects. For positive electrode materials, the capacity losses are, instead, mainly ascribed to structural changes and metal ion dissolution. This review focuses on another, so far largely unrecognized, type of capacity loss stemming from diffusion of lithium atoms or ions as a result of concentration gradients present in the electrode. An incomplete delithiation step is then seen for a negative electrode material while an incomplete lithiation step is obtained for a positive electrode material. Evidence for diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity losses is presented based on published experimental data and results obtained in recent studies focusing on this trapping effect. The implications of the diffusion&#8208;controlled Li&#8208;trapping induced capacity losses, which are discussed using a straightforward diffusion&#8208;based model, are compared with those of other phenomena expected to give capacity losses. Approaches that can be used to identify and circumvent the diffusion&#8208;controlled Li&#8208;trapping problem (e.g., regeneration of cycled batteries) are discussed, in addition to remaining challenges and proposed future research directions within this important research area.

         <title>Bistable and Multistable Actuators for Soft Robots: Structures, Materials, and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing bistability and multistability for creating varieties of high&#8208;performance soft robots has attracted increasing interest in soft robotics. This paper presents a comprehensive review of integrating representative bistable and multistable structures with soft materials under different actuations in soft actuators for diverse robotic functionalities, as well as, theoretical guidance on structural designs and materials selection for target robotic tasks.








Abstract
Snap&#8208;through bistability is often observed in nature (e.g., fast snapping to closure of Venus flytrap) and the life (e.g., bottle caps and hair clippers). Recently, harnessing bistability and multistability in different structures and soft materials has attracted growing interest for high&#8208;performance soft actuators and soft robots. They have demonstrated broad and unique applications in high&#8208;speed locomotion on land and under water, adaptive sensing and fast grasping, shape reconfiguration, electronics&#8208;free controls with a single input, and logic computation. Here, an overview of integrating bistable and multistable structures with soft actuating materials for diverse soft actuators and soft/flexible robots is given. The mechanics&#8208;guided structural design principles for five categories of basic bistable elements from 1D to 3D (i.e., constrained beams, curved plates, dome shells, compliant mechanisms of linkages with flexible hinges and deformable origami, and balloon structures) are first presented, alongside brief discussions of typical soft actuating materials (i.e., fluidic elastomers and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials such as electro&#8208;, photo&#8208;, thermo&#8208;, magnetic&#8208;, and hydro&#8208;responsive polymers). Following that, integrating these soft materials with each category of bistable elements for soft bistable and multistable actuators and their diverse robotic applications are discussed. To conclude, perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field are considered.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Enriched Nickel Phosphide for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic vacancy strategy is proposed for designing nickel&#8208;phosphide&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR). The fabricated Ni2&#8722;xP&#8208;VNi exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance in 0.1&#160;m KOH and high Faradaic efficiency in all pH solutions.&#160;Computational analysis and operando characterizations suggest that the oxygen adsorption on Ni2&#8722;xP&#8208;VNi prefers to via an &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; configuration, which facilitates the formation of the *OOH intermediate during the 2e ORR process.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR) pathway is becoming increasingly important due to the green production process. Here, cationic vacancies on nickel phosphide, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to regulate the catalyst's physicochemical properties, are introduced for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis. The as&#8208;fabricated Ni cationic vacancies (VNi)&#8208;enriched Ni2&#8722;xP&#8208;VNi electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable 2e ORR performance with H2O2 molar fraction of &gt;95% and Faradaic efficiencies of &gt;90% in all pH conditions under a wide range of applied potentials. Impressively, the as&#8208;created VNi possesses superb long&#8208;term durability for over 50 h, suppassing all the recently reported catalysts for H2O2 electrosynthesis. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy (XANES) and synchrotron Fourier transform infrared (SR&#8208;FTIR) combining theoretical calculations reveal that the excellent catalytic performance originates from the VNi&#8208;induced geometric and electronic structural optimization, thus promoting oxygen adsorption to the 2e ORR favored &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; configuration. It is believed that the demonstrated cation vacancy engineering is an effective strategy toward creating active heterogeneous catalysts with atomic precision.

Abstract
With the exploration of ferroelectric materials, researchers have a strong desire to explore the next generation of non&#8208;volatile ferroelectric memory with silicon (Si)&#8208;based epitaxy, high density storage and algebraic operations. Here, we report a silicon&#8208;based epitaxial memristor in vertically aligned nanostructures BaTiO3&#8208;CeO2 based on La0.67Sr0.33MnO3(LSMO)/ SrTiO3(STO)/Si substrate. The ferroelectric polarization reversal is optimized through continued exploring growth temperature, and the epitaxial structure is obtained, thus it improves the resistance characteristic the multi&#8208;value storage function of five states is achieved, and the robust endurance&#160;characteristic can reach 109 cycles. In the synapse plasticity process by pulse modulation, and the neural modulation function of spiking&#8208;time&#8208;dependent plasticity (STDP) and paired&#8208;pulse facilitation (PPF) is simulated successfully. More importantly, the algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are realized by using fast speed pulse of the width &#8764; 50&#160;ns. Subsequently, we constructed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for identifying the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset to simulate the performance of our device, the online and offline learning recognition rate reached 90.03% and 92.55%, repectively. This study pave the way for silicon&#8208;based epitaxy ferroelectric memristors to realize multi&#8208;value storage, algebraic operations and neural computing chips application.

         <title>Recyclable and reusable natural plant&#8208;based paper for repeated digital printing and unprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Paperless technologies are becoming ubiquitous because of the accelerating digitization of consumer and commercial services worldwide. Nonetheless, paper and paper&#8208;based materials remain one of the most widely used resources, with their global consumption expected to increase by approximately 1.5% per year, exceeding an annual total of 460 million metric tons by 2030. Given the environmental challenges, deleterious impact on natural resources, and waste associated with conventional wood&#8208;based paper manufacturing, developing more sustainable strategies to source, produce, and recycle paper from natural materials is essential. Here, we report the development and production of reusable and recyclable paper based on natural plant&#8208;based materials. This approach offers a pathway for easily producing non&#8208;allergenic natural pollen grains via ecofriendly, economical, scalable, and low energy fabrication routes. We demonstrate that the pollen&#8208;based paper exhibits high&#8208;quality printability, readability, and erasability, enabling its reuse. Based on the pH&#8208;responsive morphological responses of engineered pollen materials, we present a method for hygro&#8208;stable printing (long&#8208;term protection of printed information) and on&#8208;demand unprinting (complete erasure of all printed content) that demonstrates the unique capabilities of the pollen paper. The reusability of the pollen paper renders it more advantageous than conventional single&#8208;print wood&#8208;based paper, where erasure of content is much more challenging for both reuse of the paper and for ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of printed information. This study thus provides possible pathways to utilize non&#8208;allergenic pollen, which is renewable and naturally abundant, as a sustainable source of reusable paper. While this work primarily deals with natural plant&#8208;based paper, the methods described here can easily be extended to produce at scale other products such as cartons and containers for the storage and transport of liquid and solid materials

Abstract
The development of floating gate nonvolatile memory is limited by the charge storage, retention and transfer ability of the charge&#8208;trapping layer. Here we demonstrate that due to the unique alternate inorganic/organic chain structure and superior optical sensitivity, the insulating 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite (2D&#8208;RPP) layer can function both as excellent charge storge layer and photosensitive layer. The optoelectronic memory composed of a MoS2/hBN/2D&#8208;RPP (MBR) van der Waals heterostructure was demonstrated for the first time. The MBR device exhibits unique light&#8208;controlled charge storage characteristics, with maximum memory window up to 92&#160;V, high on/off ratio of 104, negligible degeneration over 103 s, &gt;1000&#160;program/erase cycles and write speed of 500 &#956;s. Dependent on the initial states, the MBR optoelectronic memory can be programmed in both positive photoconductivity (PPC) and negative photoconductivity (NPC) modes, with up to 11 and 22 distinct resistance states, respectively. The optical program power for each bit was as low as 36/10 pJ for PPC/NPC. The results not only reveal the potential of 2D&#8208;RPP as a superior charge storage medium in floating gate memory, but also provides an effect strategy towards fast, low&#8208;power and stable optical multi&#8208;bit storage and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Optimal Physicochemical Properties of Antibody&#8211;Nanoparticle Conjugates for Improved Tumor Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor&#8208;targeted nanoparticles represent an innovative strategy for improving the local delivery of small molecules. This meta&#8208;analysis describes the biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles of antibody&#8208;/fragment&#8208;targeted nanoparticles. The impact of the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles and the optimal conjugation strategy to optimize the tumor targeting efficiencies is discussed.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;targeted antibody (mAb)/fragment&#8208;conjugated nanoparticles (NPs) represent an innovative strategy for improving the local delivery of small molecules. However, the physicochemical properties of full mAb&#8211;NPs and fragment&#8211;NPs&#8212;that is, NP material, size, charge, as well as the targeting antibody moiety, and the linker conjugation strategies&#8212;remain to be optimized to achieve an efficient tumor targeting. A meta&#8208;analysis of 161 peer&#8208;reviewed studies is presented, which describes the use of tumor&#8208;targeted mAb&#8211;NPs and fragment&#8722;NPs from 2009 to 2021. The use of these targeted NPs is confirmed to result in significantly greater tumor uptake of NPs than that of naked NPs (7.9 &#177; 1.9% ID g&#8722;1 versus 3.2 &#177; 0.6% ID g&#8722;1, respectively). The study further demonstrates that for lipidic NPs, fragment&#8211;NPs provide a significantly higher tumor uptake than full mAb&#8211;NPs. In parallel, for both polymeric and organic/inorganic NPs, full mAb&#8211;NPs yield a significant higher tumor uptake than fragment&#8211;NPs. In addition, for both lipidic and polymeric NPs, the tumor uptake is improved with the smallest sizes of the conjugates. Finally, the pharmacokinetics of the conjugates are demonstrated to be driven by the NPs and not by the antibody moieties, independently of using full mAb&#8211;NPs or fragment&#8211;NPs, confirming the importance of optimizing the NP design to improve the tumor uptake.

         <title>A Binary Hydrate&#8208;Melt Electrolyte with Acetate&#8208;Oriented Cross&#8208;Linking Solvation Shells for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety are promising energy storage devices. However, the ZIBs with metal Zn anodes usually suffer from low coulombic efficiency and poor cycling performance due to the occurence of side reactions on Zn anodes. Here, a binary hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte was designed to suppress hydrogen evolution reaction and byproduct formation on Zn anodes by adjusting Zn2+ solvation structure. In the solvation structure of hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte, carboxylate group in OAc&#8211; will coordinate with the Zn2+, which will weaken the interaction between Zn2+ and H2O molecules to achieve higher ionization energy of H2O molecules. Simultaneously, these carboxylate groups of OAc&#8211; can serve as H&#8208;bond acceptor to construct H&#8208;bonds with H2O molecules in their neighbouring solvation structures, forming cross&#8208;linking H&#8208;bond network. Such cross&#8208;linking H&#8208;bond network further suppresses the water activity in ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte. As a result, in such electrolyte, the side reactions are effectively restricted on Zn anodes and thus Zn anodes could achieve a high coulombic efficiency of 99.59% even after cycling. To illustrate the feasibility of the ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte in aqueous ZIBs, Zn||p&#8208;chloranil cells were assembled based on ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte. The resultant Zn||p&#8208;chloranil cells exhibit enhanced cycling performance compared with the cases with conventional ZnSO4 electrolyte.

         <title>The Intrinsic Thermodynamic Difficulty and a Step&#8208;Guided Mechanism for the Epitaxial Growth of Uniform Multilayer MoS2 with Controllable Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multilayer MoS2 shows superior performance over the monolayer for electronics devices while the growth of multilayer MoS2 with controllable and uniform thickness is still very challenging. This is revealed by our calculations that the monolayer MoS2 domain is thermodynamically much more favorable than the multilayer ones on epitaxial substrate due to the competition between surface interaction and edge formation, leading accordingly to a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth pattern and non&#8208;continuously distributed multilayer domains with uncontrollable thickness uniformity. Our thermodynamics model also suggests that multilayer MoS2 domain with aligned edges can significantly reduce its free energy and represent a local minimum with very prominent energy advantage on potential energy surface. However, the nucleation probability of multilayer MoS2 domain with aligned edges is, if not impossible, extremely rare on flat substrate. Herein, we theoretically propose a step&#8208;guided mechanism for the growth of uniform multilayer MoS2 on epitaxial substrate. The steps with proper height on sapphire surface are able to guide the simultaneous nucleation of multilayer MoS2 with aligned edges and uniform thickness and promote the continuous growth of multilayer MoS2 film. The proposed mechanism can be reasonably extended to grow multilayer two&#8208;dimensional materials with uniform thickness on epitaxial substrates.

Abstract
The pursuit of a universal device that combines nonvolatile multilevel storage, ultrafast writing/erasing speed, non&#8208;destructive readout, and embedded processing with low power consumption demands to develop innovative architectures. Although thin film transistors and redox&#8208;based resistive switching devices have independently been proven to be ideal building blocks for data processing and storage, it is still difficult to achieve both well&#8208;controlled multilevel memory and high precision ultrafast processing in a single unit, even though this is essential for the large&#8208;scale hardware implementation of in&#8208;memory computing. In this work, we developed an ultrafast (&#8764;42&#160;ns) and programable redox thin film transistor (ReTFT) memory made of proximity oxidation grown TiO2 layer with on/off ratio of 105, nonvolatile multilevel analog storage with a long retention time, strong durability, and high reliability. Utilizing our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept ReTFTs, circuits capable of performing fundamental NOT, AND, and OR operations with reconfigurable logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory processing were developed. Further, on&#8208;demand signal memory&#8208;processing operational, like multiterminal addressable memory, learning, pattern recognition, and classification were explored for prospective application in neuromorphic hardware. Our device, which operates on a fundamentally different mechanism, presents an alternate solution to the problems associated with the creation of high&#8208;performing in&#8208;memory processing technology.

         <title>Advanced Materials and Sensors for Microphysiological Systems: Focus on Electronic and Electrooptical Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced in vitro cell culture or microphysiological&#160;systems (MPSs) recapitulate features of human tissues&#8239;and are increasingly being used for drug development and disease modeling. Still, they are commonly based on standard polymers with minimal real&#8208;time stimuli and read&#8208;out capacity. This review describes how advanced materials and devices could enable a technology leap in reproducing in vivo&#8208;like functionality and real&#8208;time tissue monitoring.








Abstract
Advanced in vitro cell culture systems or microphysiological systems (MPSs), including microfluidic organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OoC), are breakthrough technologies in biomedicine. These systems recapitulate features of human tissues&#160;outside of the body. They are increasingly being used to study the functionality of different organs for applications such as drug evolutions, disease modeling, and precision medicine. Currently, developers and endpoint users of these in vitro&#160;models promote how they can replace animal models or even be a better ethically neutral and humanized alternative to study pathology, physiology, and pharmacology. Although reported models show a remarkable physiological structure and function compared to the conventional 2D cell culture, they are almost exclusively based on standard passive polymers or glass with none or minimal real&#8208;time stimuli and readout capacity. The next technology leap in reproducing in vivo&#8208;like functionality and real&#8208;time monitoring of tissue function could be realized with advanced functional materials and devices. This review describes the currently reported electronic and optical advanced materials for sensing and stimulation of MPS models. In addition, an overview of multi&#8208;sensing for Body&#8208;on&#8208;Chip platforms is given. Finally, one gives the perspective on how advanced functional materials could be integrated into in vitro systems to precisely mimic human physiology.

         <title>Open&#8208;Ended Ni3S2&#8208;Co9S8 Heterostructures Nanocage Anode with Enhanced Reaction Kinetics for Superior Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Sulfides are perceived as promising anode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and structural diversity. Nonetheless, the poor structural stability and sluggish kinetics of sulfides lead to unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. Herein, the Ni3S2&#8208;Co9S8 heterostructures with open&#8208;ended nanocage structure wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO cages) are well designed as the anode for PIBs via the selective etching and one&#8208;step sulfuration approach. The hollow Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO nanocages with large surface area, abundant heterointerfaces and unique open&#8208;ended nanocage structure can reduce the K+ diffusion length and promote reaction kinetics. When used as the anode for PIBs, the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO exhibits high reversible capacity (765 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.2 A g&#8211;1) and low capacity degradation (0.0089% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 10 A g&#8211;1). The potassium ion full battery with the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO anode and Prussian blue cathode can display a superior reversible capacity of 400 mAh g&#8211;1 after 300 cycles at 2 A g&#8211;1. The unique structural advantages and electrochemical reaction mechanisms of the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO are revealed by the finite element simulation in&#8208;situ characterizations. The universal synthesis technology of bimetallic sulfide anodes for advanced PIBs may provide vital guidance to design high performance energy storage material.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Ferromagnetic Monolayer Chromium Tribromide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) magnets exhibit intrinsic electrically tunable magnetism down to the monolayer limit, which has significant value for nonvolatile memory and emerging computing device applications. In these compounds, spin&#8208;phonon coupling (SPC) typically plays a crucial role in magnetic fluctuations, magnon dissipation, and ultimately establishing long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order. However, a systematic understanding of SPC in 2D magnets that combines theory and experiment is still lacking. We studied monolayer chromium tribromide to investigate SPC in 2D magnets via Raman spectroscopy and first principle calculations. We found that the experimental Curie temperature and phonon shifts are in good agreement with the numerical simulations. Specifically, we demonstrated how magnetic exchange interactions affect phonon vibrations, which helps establish design fundamentals for 2D magnetic materials and other related devices.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Tuned Multi&#8208;photon Emitting InP Nanotetrapod</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As the properties of a semiconductor material depend on the fate of the excitons, manipulating exciton behavior is the primary objective of nanomaterials. Although nanocrystals exhibit unusual excitonic characteristics owing to strong spatial confinement, studying the interactions between excitons in a single nanoparticle remained challenging due to the rapidly vanishing multiexciton species. Here we present a platform for exciton tailoring using a straightforward strategy of shape&#8208;tuning of single&#8208;crystalline nanocrystals. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal a systematic transition of exciton confinement orientation from three&#8208;dimensional to two&#8208;dimensional, which is solely tuned by the geometric shape of material. Such precise shape&#8208;effect trigger a multi&#8208;photon emission in single nanotetrapods with arms longer than the exciton bohr radius of material. In consequence, unique interplay between multiple quantum states allow a geometric modulation of quantum&#8208;confined Stark effect and nanocrystal memory effect in single nanotetrapods. These results provide a useful metric in designing nanomaterials for future photonic applications.

         <title>Piezoelectric Dynamics of Arterial Pulse for Wearable Continuous Blood Pressure Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric dynamics of arterial pulse first elucidate the correlation between piezoelectric pulse waves and blood pressure waves. It is feasible to achieve wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring without motion artifacts, using a single piezoelectric sensor. This strategy may provide new insights on the development for wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring.








Abstract
Piezoelectric arterial pulse wave dynamics are traditionally considered to be similar to those of typical blood pressure waves. However, achieving accurate continuous blood pressure wave monitoring based on arterial pulse waves remains challenging, because the correlation between piezoelectric pulse waves and their related blood pressure waves is unclear. To address this, the correlation between piezoelectric pulse waves and blood pressure waves is first elucidated via theoretical, simulation, and experimental analysis of these dynamics. Based on this correlation, the authors develop a wireless wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring system, with better portability than conventional systems that are based on the pulse wave velocity between multiple sensors. They explore the feasibility of achieving wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring without motion artifacts, using a single piezoelectric sensor. These findings eliminate the controversy over the arterial pulse wave piezoelectric response, and can potentially be used to develop a portable wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring device for the early prevention and daily control of hypertension.

Flexible mesoporous black Nb2O5&#8722;x nanofibers that contain abundant oxygen&#8208;vacancies are fabricated with an electrospinning technique followed by a room&#8208;temperature defect control strategy. The Nb2O5&#8722;x catalyst has a low bandgap width of 2.25 eV that broadens the&#160;light&#8208;absorption range from the ultraviolet to visible&#8208;light, and shows a unique reaction router for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 with a selectivity of 64.8%.








Abstract
Achieving high selectivity and conversion efficiency simultaneously is a challenge for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction into CH4. Here, a facile nanofiber synthesis method and a new defect control strategy at room&#8208;temperature are reported for the fabrication of flexible mesoporous black Nb2O5 nanofiber catalysts that contain abundant oxygen&#8208;vacancies and unsaturated Nb dual&#8208;sites, which are efficient towards photocatalytic production of CH4. The oxygen&#8208;vacancy decreases the bandgap width of Nb2O5 from 3.01&#8211;2.25&#160;eV, which broadens the&#160;light&#8208;absorption range from ultraviolet to visible&#8208;light, and the dual sites in the mesopores can easily adsorb CO2, so that the intermediate product of CO* can be spontaneously changed into *CHO. The formation of a highly stable Nb&#63743;CHO* intermediate at the dual sites is proposed to be the key feature determining selectivity. The preliminary results show that without using sacrificial agents and photosensitizers, the nanofiber catalyst achieves 64.8% selectivity for CH4 production with a high evolution rate of 19.5 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light. Furthermore, the flexible catalyst film can be directly used in devices, showing appealing and broadly commercial applications.

         <title>Manipulating Crystallization Kinetics in High&#8208;Performance Blade&#8208;Coated Perovskite Solar Cells via Cosolvent&#8208;Assisted Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ethyl alcohol cosolvent strategy is applied for room&#8208;temperature blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells and minimodules. This approach delicately manipulates the balance between nucleation and crystal growth rate to guarantee high&#8208;quality perovskite films, thus achieving remarkable device performance both in small&#8208;area cells and minimodules with excellent VOC deficit and suppressed nonradiative recombination loss.








Abstract
Manipulating the perovskite solidification process, including nucleation and crystal growth, plays a critical role in controlling film morphology and thus affects the resultant device performance. In this work, a facile and effective ethyl alcohol (EtOH) cosolvent strategy is demonstrated with the incorporation of EtOH into perovskite ink for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules. Systematic real&#8208;time perovskite crystallization studies uncover the delicate perovskite structural evolutions and phase&#8208;transition pathway. Time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations both demonstrate that EtOH in the mixed&#8208;solvent system significantly promotes the formation of an FA&#8208;based precursor solvate (FA2PbBr4&#183;DMSO) during the trace&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted transition process, which finely regulates the balance between nucleation and crystal growth to guarantee high&#8208;quality perovskite films. This strategy efficiently suppresses nonradiative recombination and improves efficiencies in both 1.54 (23.19%) and 1.60&#160;eV (22.51%) perovskite systems, which represents one of the highest records for blade&#8208;coated PSCs in both small&#8208;area devices and minimodules. An excellent VOC deficit as low as 335&#160;mV in the 1.54&#160;eV perovskite system, coincident with the measured nonradiative recombination loss of only 77&#160;mV, is achieved. More importantly, significantly enhanced device stability is another signature of this approach.

         <title>A Fibrin Site&#8208;Specific Nanoprobe for Imaging Fibrin&#8208;Rich Thrombi and Preventing Thrombus Formation in Venous Vessels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanoprobe loaded with Cys&#8722;Arg&#8722;Glu&#8722;Lys&#8722;Ala, Fe3O4, NIR fluorochrome, and Ketotifen fumarate is prepared, which can target fibrin&#8208;rich venous thrombi and assemble in it to help with the detection of fibrin&#8208;rich venous thromboembolism precisely through imaging. In addition, by inhabiting mast cell degranulation, this can prevent thrombosis without the risk of excessive bleeding.








Abstract
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a prevalent public health issue worldwide. Before treatment, spatiotemporally accurate thrombus detection is essential. However, with the currently available imaging technologies, this is challenging. Herein, the development of a novel fibrin&#8208;specific nanoprobe (NP) based on the conjugation of poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) with the pentapeptide Cys&#8722;Arg&#8722;Glu&#8722;Lys&#8722;Ala (CREKA) for selective and semiquantitative imaging in vivo is presented. By integrating Fe3O4 and NIR fluorochrome (IR780), the NP can function as a highly sensitive sensor for the direct analysis of thrombi in vivo. The fibrin&#8208;specific NP distinguishes fibrin&#8208;rich thrombi from collagen&#8208;rich or erythrocyte&#8208;rich thrombi, which can be beneficial for future individually tailored therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, loading NPs with the ketotifen fumarate results in mast cell degranulation inhibition, and hence, NPs can prevent thrombosis without the risk of excessive bleeding. Thus, the use of fibrin&#8208;specific NPs may serve as a safe alternative approach for the detection and prevention of VTEs in susceptible populations in the future.

Blade&#8208;coating supersaturated CsPb(Br1&#8722;xClx)3 perovskite precursor leads to uniform films with small grains and strong photoluminescence emission. After incorporating the films as an emissive layer in the device, efficient sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with a peak external quantum efficiency reaching 10.3% can be a acheived, along with large&#8208;area sky&#8208;blue LEDs up to 28 cm2 with uniform emission.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area fabrication of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) through mass&#8208;production techniques has attracted growing attention due to their potential applications in lighting. Several breakthroughs are made for red/infrared and green emissions. Nevertheless, large&#8208;area blue/sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs, a requisite color for lighting, have not yet been reported. Here, efficient and large&#8208;area sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs are fabricated through blade&#8208;coating supersaturated precursors. The volume ratio of dimethyl sulfoxide to dimethylformamide is tuned to obtain a supersaturated CsPb(Br0.84Cl0.16)3 solution. Blade&#8208;coating this supersaturated precursor results in nucleation in the solution phase with much higher nucleation sites, and a faster crystallization rate. The uniform films formed by this approach exhibit smaller grain size, lower trap density, and higher radiative recombination rate. The peak external quantum efficiency of the blade&#8208;coated PeLEDs reaches 10.3% with sky&#8208;blue emission (489&#160;nm). Benefitting from the robustness of this blade&#8208;coating technique, large&#8208;area sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs with a device area of 28 cm2 are also achieved with uniform emission. This work represents a significant step forward toward flat&#8208;panel lighting and full&#8208;color display for the PeLEDs.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Microsized Si Anodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Insights into the Polymer Configuration Conversion Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(hexaazatrinaphthalene) (PHATN) coating is constructed at the surface of a Si/C anode to design a high&#8208;performance microsized Si composite anode for Li&#8208;ion batteries. The Li&#8208;rich PHATN coating can form during the initial lithiation, promote interfacial diffusion kinetics for Li&#8208;ions, generate free space to accommodate the volume expansion of microsized Si, and mitigate possible side reactions.








Abstract
Microsized silicon particles are desirable Si anodes because of their low price and abundant sources. However, it is challenging to achieve stable electrochemical performances using a traditional microsized silicon anode due to the poor electrical conductivity, serious volume expansion, and unstable solid electrolyte interface. Herein, a composite microsized Si anode is designed and synthesized by constructing a unique polymer, poly(hexaazatrinaphthalene) (PHATN), at a Si/C surface (PCSi). The Li+ transport mechanism of the PCSi is elucidated by using in situ characterization and theoretical simulation. During the lithiation of the PCSi anode, &#63743;C&#63742;N&#63743; groups with high electron density in the PHATN first coordinate Li+ to form &#63743;C&#63743;N&#63743;Li bonds on both sides of the PHATN molecule plane. Consequently, the original benzene rings in the PHATN become active centers to accept lithium and form stable Li&#8208;rich PHATN coatings. PHATN molecules expand due to the change of molecular configuration during the consecutive lithiation process, which provides controllable space for the volume expansion of the Si particles. The PCSi composite anode exhibits a specific capacity of 1129.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, and exhibits compelling rate performance, maintaining 417.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 16.5 A g&#8722;1.

         <title>Highly Anisotropic Organometal Halide Perovskite Nanowalls Grown by Glancing&#8208;Angle Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel vacuum&#8208;based approach, compatible with most substrates, for the fabrication of aligned organometal halide perovskite vertical nanowalls by glancing&#8208;angle deposition, is presented. Their alignment provides the samples with strong anisotropic properties, such as photoluminescence. Furthermore, their implementation in photovoltaic devices provides them with a polarization&#8208;sensitive response, a milestone for the development of self&#8208;powered photodetectors.








Abstract
Polarizers are ubiquitous components in current optoelectronic devices as displays or photographic cameras. Yet, control over light polarization is an unsolved challenge, since the main drawback of the existing display technologies is the significant optical losses. In such a context, organometal halide perovskites (OMHP) can play a decisive role given their flexible synthesis with tunable optical properties such as bandgap and photoluminescence, and excellent light emission with a low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate. Therefore, along with their outstanding electrical properties have elevated hybrid perovskites as the material of choice in photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Among the different OMHP nanostructures, nanowires and nanorods have lately arisen as key players in the control of light polarization for lighting or detector applications. Herein, the fabrication of highly aligned and anisotropic methylammonium lead iodide perovskite nanowalls by glancing&#8208;angle deposition, which is compatible with most substrates, is presented. Their high alignment degree provides the samples with anisotropic optical properties such as light absorption and photoluminescence. Furthermore, their implementation in photovoltaic devices provides them with a polarization&#8208;sensitive response. This facile vacuum&#8208;based approach embodies a milestone in the development of last&#8208;generation polarization&#8208;sensitive perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices such as lighting appliances or self&#8208;powered photodetectors.

         <title>Hydrogel Transformed from Nanoparticles for Prevention of Tissue Injury and Treatment of Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel&#8208;transformable nanoparticles responsive to physiologically/pathologically acidic microenvironments are engineered by self&#8208;assembly of a pH&#8208;sensitive multivalent host material and a multivalent guest polymer. Driven by protons, the pH&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest nanoparticles can transform into hydrogel. The transformable nanoparticles protect mice from induced gastric injury by in situ forming a hydrogel barrier. These nanoparticles can serve as transformable nanovehicles for treating inflammatory diseases.








Abstract
Functional hydrogels responsive to physiological and pathological signals have extensive biomedical applications owing to their multiple advanced attributes. Herein, engineering of functional hydrogels is reported via transformable nanoparticles in response to the physiologically and pathologically acidic microenvironment. These nanoparticles are assembled by a multivalent hydrophobic, pH&#8208;responsive cyclodextrin host material and a multivalent hydrophilic guest macromolecule. Driven by protons, the pH&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest nanoparticles can be transformed into hydrogel, resulting from proton&#8208;triggered hydrolysis of the host material, generation of a hydrophilic multivalent host compound, and simultaneously enhanced inclusion interactions between host and guest molecules. By in situ forming a hydrogel barrier, the orally delivered transformable nanoparticles protect mice from ethanol&#8208; or drug&#8208;induced gastric injury. In addition, this type of nanoparticles can serve as responsive and transformable nanovehicles for therapeutic agents to achieve triggerable and sustained drug delivery, thereby effectively treating typical inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis and arthritis in rats. With combined advantages of nanoparticles and hydrogels, together with their good in vivo safety, the engineered transformable nanoparticles hold great promise in tissue injury protection and site&#8208;specific/local delivery of molecular and cellular therapeutic agents.

         <title>Creating Composite Vortex Beams with a Single Geometric Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Composite vortex beams (CVBs) have attracted considerable interest recently due to the unique optical properties and potential applications. However, these beams are mainly generated using spatial light modulators, which suffer from large volume, high cost and limited resolution. Benefiting from the ultrathin nature and unprecedented capability in light manipulation, optical metasurfaces provide a compact platform to perform this task. We propose and experimentally demonstrate a metasurface approach to creating these CVBs. The design is based on the superposition of multiple circularly polarized vortex beams with different topological charges, which is realized based on a geometric metasurface consisting of metallic nanorods with spatially variant orientations. We experimentally analyze the effects of initial phases, amplitude coefficients, incident polarization state and propagation distance on the generated CVBs, which are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction. Our work has opened a new avenue for engineering CVBs with a minimal footprint, which has promising applications ranging from multiple optical traps to quantum science.

         <title>Unveiling the interaction mechanisms of electron and X&#8208;ray radiation with halide perovskite semiconductors using scanning nano&#8208;probe diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The interaction of high&#8208;energy electrons and X&#8208;ray photons with beam&#8208;sensitive semiconductors such as halide perovskites is essential for the characterisation and understanding of these optoelectronic materials. Using nano&#8208;probe diffraction techniques, which can investigate physical properties on the nanoscale, we perform studies of the interaction of electron and X&#8208;ray radiation with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art (FA0.79MA0.16Cs0.05)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 hybrid halide perovskite films (FA, formamidinium; MA, methylammonium). We track the changes in the local crystal structure as a function of fluence using scanning electron diffraction and synchrotron nano X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. We identify perovskite grains from which additional reflections, corresponding to PbBr2, appear as a crystalline degradation phase after fluences of &#8764;200 e&#8211;&#197;&#8211;2. These changes are concomitant with the formation of small PbI2 crystallites at the adjacent high&#8208;angle grain boundaries, with the formation of pinholes, and with a phase transition from tetragonal to cubic. A similar degradation pathway is caused by photon irradiation in nano&#8208;X&#8208;ray diffraction, suggesting common underlying mechanisms. Our approach explores the radiation limits of these materials and provides a description of the degradation pathways on the nanoscale. Addressing high&#8208;angle grain boundaries will be critical for the further improvement of halide polycrystalline film stability, especially for applications vulnerable to high&#8208;energy radiation such as space photovoltaics.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Several viral infectious diseases have appeared limitless since the beginning of the 21st century, expanding into pandemic lengths. Thus, there are extensive efforts to provide more efficient means of diagnosis, a better understanding of acquired immunity, and improved monitoring of inflammatory biomarkers, as these are all crucial for controlling the spread of infection while aiding in vaccine development and improving patient outcomes. In this regard, various biosensors have been developed over the last years to streamline pathogen and immune response detection by addressing the limitations of traditional methods, including isothermal amplification&#8208;based systems and lateral flow assays. This review explores state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biosensors for detecting viral pathogens, serological assays, and inflammatory biomarkers from the material perspective, by discussing their advantages, limitations, and further potential regarding their analytical performance, clinical utility, and point&#8208;of&#8208;care adaptability. Additionally, next&#8208;generation biosensing technologies that offer better sensitivity and selectivity, and easy handling for end&#8208;users are highlighted. An emerging example of these next&#8208;generation biosensors are those powered by novel synthetic biology tools, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with CRISPR&#8208;associated proteins (Cas), in combination with integrated point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices. Lastly, we discuss the current challenges and provide a roadmap for furthering these advanced biosensing technologies to manage future pandemics.

         <title>A Wearable All&#8208;Gel Multimodal Cutaneous Sensor Enabling Simultaneous Single&#8208;Site Monitoring of Cardiac&#8208;Related Biophysical Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acquisition of biophysical signals is demonstrated at one point on the body using a wearable all&#8208;gel&#8208;integrated multimodal sensor. The wearable all&#8208;gel multimodal sensor is easily attached to the wrist and simultaneously gathers blood pressure, electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and mechanomyogram signals related to cardiac and muscle health.








Abstract
The human cutaneous sensory organ is a highly evolved biosensor that is efficient, sensitive, selective, and adaptable. Recently, with the development of various materials and structures inspired by sensory organs, artificial cutaneous sensors have been widely studied. In this study, the acquisition of biophysical signals is demonstrated at one point on the body using a wearable all&#8208;gel&#8208;integrated multimodal sensor composed of four element sensors, inspired by the slow/rapid adapting functions of the skin sensory receptors. The gel&#8208;type sensors ensure flexibility, compactness, portability, adherence, and integrity. The wearable all&#8208;gel multimodal sensor is easily attached to the wrist and simultaneously gathers blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), and mechanomyogram (MMG) signals related to cardiac and muscle health. Human activity causes muscle contraction, which affects blood flow; therefore, the relationship between the muscle and heart is crucial for screening and predicting heart health. Cardiac health is monitored by obtaining the two types of phase time differences (i.e., &#916;tbe: BP and ECG, &#916;tem: ECG and MMG) generated during muscle movement. The suggested multimodal sensor has potential applicability in monitoring biophysical conditions and diagnosing cardiac&#8208;related health problems.

         <title>Optical Modification of 2D Materials: Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials have spectacular electrical and optical properties but their device fabrication and integration are arduous and expensive. Optical modification methods offer less detrimental processes that can often be done in one optical setup, sometimes even simultaneously with one another, saving time and money. Additionally, the extreme locality of lasers can be utilized in designable laser direct writing processes.








Abstract
2D materials are under extensive research due to their remarkable properties suitable for various optoelectronic, photonic, and biological applications, yet their conventional fabrication methods are typically harsh and cost&#8208;ineffective. Optical modification is demonstrated as an effective and scalable method for accurate and local in situ engineering and patterning of 2D materials in ambient conditions. This review focuses on the state of the art of optical modification of 2D materials and their applications. Perspectives for future developments in this field are also discussed, including novel laser tools, new optical modification strategies, and their emerging applications in quantum technologies and biotechnologies.

         <title>Universal Solution Synthesis of Sulfide Solid Electrolytes Using Alkahest for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The universal solution synthesis of sulfide solid electrolytes is first demonstrated. The alkahest solvent, 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine&#8211;1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol, fully dissolves not only Li2S (or Na2S), P2S5, and LiCl, but also metal sulfides (e.g., GeS2 and SnS2), forming homogeneous solid electrolyte solutions. Solution&#8208;synthesized Li10GeP2S12, Li6PS5Cl, and Na11Sn2PS12 exhibit high ionic conductivities, and their applicability to all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
The wet&#8208;chemical processability of sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) provides intriguing opportunities for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Thus far, sulfide SEs are wet&#8208;prepared either from solid precursors suspended in solvents (suspension synthesis) or from homogeneous solutions using SEs (solution process) with restricted composition spaces. Here, a universal solution synthesis method for preparing sulfide SEs from precursors, not only Li2S, P2S5, LiCl, and Na2S, but also metal sulfides (e.g., GeS2 and SnS2), fully dissolved in an alkahest: a mixture solvent of 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine (EDA) and 1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol (EDT) (or ethanethiol). Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional dissolving power of EDA&#8211;EDT toward GeS2 is due to the nucleophilicity of the thiolate anions that is strong enough to dissociate the Ge&#63743;S bonds. Solution&#8208;synthesized Li10GeP2S12, Li6PS5Cl, and Na11Sn2PS12 exhibit high ionic conductivities (0.74, 1.3, and 0.10 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C, respectively), and their application for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Bimetallic Nanocatalysts Immobilized in Nanoporous Hydrogels for Long&#8208;Term Robust Continuous Glucose Monitoring of Smart Contact Lens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart contact lenses containing bimetallic nanocatalysts immobilized in nanoporous hydrogels are developed for long&#8208;term and robust continuous glucose monitoring. The smart contact lenses can accurately monitor increasing and decreasing blood glucose levels with 92.2% acceptable data in diabetic and normal rabbits. Finally, the clinical feasibility and safety of smart contact lenses are evaluated on the eyes of a human patient.








Abstract
Smart contact lenses for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) have great potential for huge clinical impact. To date, their development has been limited by challenges in accurate detection of glucose without hysteresis for tear glucose monitoring to track the blood glucose levels. Here, long&#8208;term robust CGM in diabetic rabbits is demonstrated by using bimetallic nanocatalysts immobilized in nanoporous hydrogels in smart contact lenses. After redox reaction of glucose oxidase, the nanocatalysts facilitate rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and nanoparticle&#8208;mediated charge transfer with drastically improved diffusion via rapid swelling of nanoporous hydrogels. The ocular glucose sensors result in high sensitivity, fast response time, low detection limit, low hysteresis, and rapid sensor warming&#8208;up time. In diabetic rabbits, smart contact lens can detect tear glucose levels consistent with blood glucose levels measured by a glucometer and a CGM device, reflecting rapid concentration changes without hysteresis. The CGM in a human demonstrates the feasibility of smart contact lenses for further clinical applications.

After redox reaction of glucose oxidase, the nanocatalysts facilitate rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and nanoparticle-mediated charge transfer with drastically improved diffusion via rapid swelling of nanoporous hydrogels. The ocular glucose sensors result in high sensitivity, fast response time, low detection limit, low hysteresis, and rapid sensor warming-up time. In diabetic rabbits, smart contact lens can detect tear glucose levels consistent with blood glucose levels measured by a glucometer and a CGM device, reflecting rapid concentration changes without hysteresis. The CGM in a human demonstrates the feasibility of smart contact lenses for further clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Encoded Supramolecular Photothermal Nanomedicine for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acid encoding can be a facile and potent means to design and construct supramolecular photothermal nanoagents with controlled therapeutic activities, offering an unprecedented opportunity for customized nanomedicine toward precision cancer therapy.








Abstract
Photothermal nanomedicine based on self&#8208;assembly of biological components, with excellent biosafety and customized performance, is vital significance for precision cancer therapy. However, the programmable design of photothermal nanomedicine remains extremely challenging due to the vulnerability and variability of noncovalent interactions governing supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. Herein, it is reported that amino acid encoding is a facile and potent means to design and construct supramolecular photothermal nanodrugs with controlled therapeutic activities. It is found that the amount and type of amino acid dominates the assembled nanostructures, structural stability, energy&#8208;conversion pathway, and therapeutic mechanism of the resulting nanodrugs. Two optimized nanodrugs are endowed with robust structural integrity against disassembly along with high photothermal conversion efficiency, efficient cellular internalization, and enhanced tumor accumulation, which result in more efficient tumor ablation. This work demonstrates that design based on amino acid encoding offers an unprecedented opportunity for the construction of remarkable photoactive nanomedicines toward cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>Data Mining for Terahertz Generation Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work combines data, mined from a structural database of known materials,&#160;with first&#8208;principles calculations of molecular properties to predict high&#8208;performing organic nonlinear optical materials useful for the generation of terahertz frequency light. Four new terahertz generation crystals are discovered, synthesized, and tested, all of which show favorable terahertz generation properties.








Abstract
A data mining approach to discover and develop new organic nonlinear optical crystals that produce intense pulses of terahertz radiation is demonstrated. The Cambridge Structural Database is mined for non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials and these structural data are used in tandem with density functional theory calculations to predict new materials that efficiently generate terahertz radiation. This enables us to (in a relatively short time) discover, synthesize, and grow large, high&#8208;quality crystals of four promising materials and characterize them for intense terahertz generation. In a direct comparison to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic terahertz generation crystals, these new materials excel. The discovery and characterization of these novel terahertz generators validate the approach of combining data mining with density functional theory calculations to predict properties of high&#8208;performance organic materials, potentially for a host of exciting applications.

         <title>Mucus Penetrating and Cell&#8208;Binding Polyzwitterionic Micelles as Potent Oral Nanomedicine for Cancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mucus penetrating and cell&#8208;binding polyzwitterionic micelles are developed as potent oral nanomedicine for cancer drug delivery.








Abstract
Orally administrable anticancer nanomedicines are highly desirable due to their easy and repeatable administration, but are not yet feasible because the current nanomedicine cannot simultaneously overcome the strong mucus and villi barriers and thus have very low bioavailability (BA). Herein, this work presents the first polymeric micelle capable of fast mucus permeation and villi absorption and delivering paclitaxel (PTX) efficiently to tumors with therapeutic efficacy even better than intravenously administered polyethylene glycol based counterpart or free PTX. Poly[2&#8208;(N&#8208;oxide&#8208;N,N&#8208;diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OPDEA), a water&#8208;soluble polyzwitterion, is highly nonfouling to proteins and other biomacromolecules such as mucin but can weakly bind to phospholipids. Therefore, the micelle of its block copolymer with poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (OPDEA&#8208;PCL) can efficiently permeate through the viscous mucus and bind to villi, which triggers transcytosis&#8208;mediated transepithelial transport into blood circulation for tumor accumulation. The orally administered micelles deliver PTX to tumors, efficiently inhibiting the growth of HepG2 and patient&#8208;derived hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts and triple&#8208;negative breast tumors. These results demonstrate that OPDEA&#8208;based micelles may serve as an efficient oral nanomedicine for delivering other small molecules or even large molecules.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kirigami patterns, inspired by arts of paper&#8208;cutting, provide innovative opportunities for precise structural engineering via material removal. In this report, the design of kirigami&#8208;based conformable systems for biomedical applications is discussed. Factors including cut geometry, materials, and fabrication are covered. Then, applications in healthcare, including sensors, implantable devices, therapeutics, surgical tools, and regenerative medicine are explored.








Abstract
Mechanically flexible and conformable materials and integrated devices have found diverse applications in personalized healthcare as diagnostics and therapeutics, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine constructs, surgical tools, secure systems, and assistive technologies. In order to impart optimal mechanical properties to the (bio)materials used in these applications, various strategies have been explored&#8212;from composites to structural engineering. In recent years, geometric cuts inspired by the art of paper&#8208;cutting, referred to as kirigami, have provided innovative opportunities for conferring precise mechanical properties via material removal. Kirigami&#8208;based approaches have been used for device design in areas ranging from soft bioelectronics to energy storage. In this review, the principles of kirigami&#8208;inspired engineering specifically for biomedical applications are discussed. Factors pertinent to their design, including cut geometry, materials, and fabrication, and the effect these parameters have on their properties and configurations are covered. Examples of kirigami designs in healthcare are presented, such as, various form factors of sensors (on skin, wearable), implantable devices, therapeutics, surgical procedures, and cellular scaffolds for regenerative medicine. Finally, the challenges and future scope for the successful translation of these biodesign concepts to broader deployment are discussed.

         <title>WET&#8208;Induced Layered Organohydrogel as Bioinspired &#8220;Sticky&#8722;Slippy Skin&#8221; for Robust Underwater Oil&#8208;Repellency</title>

         <dc:description>
A moss&#8208;inspired &#8220;sticky&#8722;slippy skin&#8221; composed of layered organohydrogel is reported, demonstrating an intriguing example of an easy&#8208;pasting anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling material through a one&#8208;step wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (WET) process. Anti&#8208;swelling/anti&#8208;bending, acid/alkali resistance, environmental friendliness, adhesion simplicity, and substrate universality are integrated in one anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling material. The design strategy with integrated functions provides an important route for the development of multifunctional interfacial materials.








Abstract
Underwater superoleophobic surfaces featuring anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling properties are of great significance in widespread fields. However, their complicated engineering process and weak interfacial adhesion strength with underlying substrates severely hamper these ideal surfaces toward practical applications. Here, a moss&#8208;inspired sticky&#8722;slippy skin composed of layered organohydrogel is reported through a one&#8208;step wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (WET) strategy, which unprecedentedly integrates robust inherent adhesion with durable anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling properties. The sticky organogel layer can be simply attached to various substrates, from metals and plastics to glass, independent of any surface pretreatment. The slippy hydrogel layer enables stable underwater superoleophobicity and ultralow oil adhesion for diverse kinds of oils. The sticky&#8722;slippy skin features outstanding comprehensive properties including easy&#8208;pasting, anti&#8208;swelling/anti&#8208;bending, compatibility with commercial adhesives, acid/alkali resistance, environmental friendliness, and substrate universality. The design strategy with integrated functions provides a clue to accelerate the development of bioinspired multifunctional interfacial materials toward real&#8208;world applications.

&lt;p&gt;Underwater superoleophobic surfaces featuring anti-oil-fouling properties are of great significance in widespread fields. However, their complicated engineering process and weak interfacial adhesion strength with underlying substrates severely hamper these ideal surfaces toward practical applications. Here, a moss-inspired sticky&#8722;slippy skin composed of layered organohydrogel is reported through a one-step wetting-enabled-transfer (WET) strategy, which unprecedentedly integrates robust inherent adhesion with durable anti-oil-fouling properties. The sticky organogel layer can be simply attached to various substrates, from metals and plastics to glass, independent of any surface pretreatment. The slippy hydrogel layer enables stable underwater superoleophobicity and ultralow oil adhesion for diverse kinds of oils. The sticky&#8722;slippy skin features outstanding comprehensive properties including easy-pasting, anti-swelling/anti-bending, compatibility with commercial adhesives, acid/alkali resistance, environmental friendliness, and substrate universality. The design strategy with integrated functions provides a clue to accelerate the development of bioinspired multifunctional interfacial materials toward real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full&#8208;Dimensional Grain Boundary Stress Release for Flexible Perovskite Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grain boundary stress release strategy is proposed for high&#8208;stability flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaics by the grain boundary penetration with borax 3D stretchable molecules. The full&#8208;dimensional grain boundary stress release enables the flexible perovskite photovoltaics deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.63% under AM 1.5G illumination and an indoor PCE of 31.85% under 1062 lux.








Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaics are strong potential candidates to drive low&#8208;power off&#8208;grid electronics for indoor applications. Compared with rigid devices, flexible perovskite devices can provide a more suitable surface for indoor small electronic devices, enabling them have a broader indoor application prospect. However, the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite photovoltaics is an urgent issue solved. Herein, a kind of 3D crosslinking agent named borax is selected to carry out grain boundary penetration treatment on perovskite film to realize full&#8208;dimensional stress release. This strategy improves the mechanical and phase stabilities of perovskite films subjected to external forces or large temperature changes. The fabricated perovskite photovoltaics deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.63% under AM 1.5G illumination, which is the highest one to date. The merit of low trap states under weak light makes the devices present a superior indoor PCE of 31.85% under 1062 lux (LED, 2956 K), which is currently the best flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaic device. This work provides a full&#8208;dimensional grain boundary stress release strategy for highly stable flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaics.

         <title>Hypothesis learning in automated experiment: application to combinatorial materials libraries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Machine learning is rapidly becoming an integral part of experimental physical discovery via automated and high&#8208;throughput synthesis, and active experiments in scattering and electron/probe microscopy. This, in turn, necessitates the development of active learning methods capable of exploring relevant parameter spaces with the smallest number of steps. Here we introduce an active learning approach based on co&#8208;navigation of the hypothesis and experimental spaces. This is realized by combining the structured Gaussian Processes containing probabilistic models of the possible system's behaviors (hypotheses) with reinforcement learning policy refinement (discovery). This approach closely resembles classical human&#8208;driven physical discovery, when several alternative hypotheses realized via models with adjustable parameters are tested during an experiment. We demonstrate this approach for exploring concentration&#8208;induced phase transitions in combinatorial libraries of Sm&#8208;doped BiFeO3 using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy, but it is straightforward to extend it to higher&#8208;dimensional parameter spaces and more complex physical problems once the experimental workflow and hypothesis&#8208;generation are available.

         <title>Ligand Modulation of Active Sites to Promote Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rationally designed catalysts hold the key to address the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, engineering the active sites of such catalysts still faces grand challenges. This study proposes a feasible ligand modulation strategy to boost the OER catalytic activity of cobalt&#8208;iron oxyhydroxide ((Fe,Co)OOH). The 2&#8208;methylimidazole (MI) ligand coordination on (Fe,Co)OOH reduces the orbital overlap between the Fe/Co 3d and O 2p, which weakens the adsorption to oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and thus facilitates the unfavorable O2 desorption. As a result, the MI ligand modulated (Fe,Co)OOH achieves an excellent OER performance with low overpotentials (230/290&#160;mV at 10/100&#160;mA cm&#8211;2) and excellent durability (&gt;155 h). This study provides a novel ligand modulation strategy for the design of OER catalysts.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Tailored Surface Oxide on Cu&#8208;Ga Intermetallics Enhances CO2 Reduction Selectivity to Methanol at Ultra&#8208;Low Potential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this work, electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has been performed on two intermetallic compounds formed by copper and gallium metals (CuGa2 and Cu9Ga4) for the first time. Among them, CuGa2 selectively converts CO2 to methanol with remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.26% at an extremely low potential of &#8208;0.3&#160;V versus RHE. The, high performance of CuGa2 compared to Cu9Ga4 has been driven by its unique two&#8208;dimensional structure that retains surface and sub&#8208;surface oxide species (Ga2O3) even in the reduction atmosphere. The Ga2O3, species have been mapped by XPS and XAFS techniques and electrochemical measurements. The eCO2RR activity and selectivity to methanol have been decreased at higher potential due to the lattice expansion caused by the reduction of the Ga2O3, which has been probed by in&#8208;situ XAFS, quasi in&#8208;situ powder XRD and ex&#8208;situ XPS measurements. The mechanism of the formation of methanol from CO2 at various potentials has been visualized by in&#8208;situ IR spectroscopy and source of carbon of methanol at the molecular level confirmed from the isotope labelling experiments in the presence of 13CO2. Finally, to minimize the mass transport limitations and improve the overall eCO2RR performance, PTFE&#8208;based gas diffusion electrode (GDE) has been employed in the flow cell configuration.

         <title>Synergy between Palladium Single Atoms and Nanoparticles via Hydrogen Spillover for Enhancing CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic Pd1 and PdNPs form a functional catalyst for enhancing photocatalytic CO2 methanation. Pd1 activate CO2, while PdNPs boost H2O dissociation. The H* produced by PdNPs migrates to Pd1 via hydrogen spillover to promote multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer processes. Moreover, the adjacent Pd1 and PdNPs stabilize intermediates, such as *CHO. Therefore, efficient photocatalytic CO2 to CH4 is highly favored.








Abstract
Selective photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbon&#8208;neutral fuels such as methane (CH4) is extremely desirable but remains a challenge since sluggish multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer and various C1 intermediates are involved. Herein, a synergistic function between single Pd atoms (Pd1) and Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) on graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) for photocatalytic CO2 methanation is presented. The catalyst achieves a high selectivity of 97.8% for CH4 production with a yield of 20.3&#160;&#181;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. Mechanistic studies revealed that Pd1 sites activated CO2, while PdNPs sites boosted water (H2O) dissociation for increased H* coverage. The H* produced by PdNPs migrate to the Pd1 sites to promote multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer via hydrogen spillover. Moreover, the adjacent Pd1 and PdNPs effectively stabilized intermediates such as *CHO, thereby favoring the pathway for CH4 production. This work provides a new perspective into the development of selective photocatalytic CO2 conversion through the artful design of synergistic catalytic sites.

&lt;p&gt;Selective photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into carbon-neutral fuels such as methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is extremely desirable but remains a challenge since sluggish multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer and various C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates are involved. Herein, a synergistic function between single Pd atoms (Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and Pd nanoparticles (Pd&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt;) on graphitic carbon nitride (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanation is presented. The catalyst achieves a high selectivity of 97.8% for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production with a yield of 20.3&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in pure water. Mechanistic studies revealed that Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sites activated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while Pd&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt; sites boosted water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) dissociation for increased H* coverage. The H* produced by Pd&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt; migrate to the Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sites to promote multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer via hydrogen spillover. Moreover, the adjacent Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Pd&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt; effectively stabilized intermediates such as *CHO, thereby favoring the pathway for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production. This work provides a new perspective into the development of selective photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion through the artful design of synergistic catalytic sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermally drawn highly conductive fibers with controlled elasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electronic fabrics necessitate both electrical conductivity and, like any textile, elastic recovery. Achieving both requirements on the scale of a single fiber remains an unmet need. Here, two approaches for achieving conductive fibers (107S/m) reaching 50% elongation while maintaining minimal change in resistance (&lt;0.5%) in embedded metallic electrodes are introduced. The first approach involves inducing a buckling instability in a metal microwire within a cavity of a thermally drawn elastomer fiber. The second approach relies on twisting an elastomer fiber to yield helical metal electrodes embedded in a stretchable yarn. The scalability of both approaches is illustrated in apparatuses for continuous buckling and twisting that yield tens of meters of elastic conducting fibers. Through experimental and analytical methods, we elucidate how geometric parameters, such as buckling pre&#8208;strain and helical angle, as well as materials choice, control not only the fiber's elasticity but also its Young's modulus. Links between mechanical and electrical properties are exposed. The resulting fibers are used to construct elastic fabrics that contain diodes, by weaving and knitting, thus demonstrating the scalable fabrication of conformable and stretchable antennas that support optical data transmission.

         <title>Macroscale Conjugated Microporous Polymers: Controlling Versatile Functionalities Over Several Dimensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in macroscale conjugated microporous polymers for gas adsorption, energy, sensing, filtration/purification, and catalysis applications are reviewed, with particular focus on how the macroscopic architectures brings about more functionalities and opportunities.








Abstract
Since discovered in 2007, conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) have been developed for numerous applications including gas adsorption, sensing, organic and photoredox catalysis, energy storage, etc. While featuring abundant micropores, the structural rigidity derived from CMPs&#8217; stable &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton leads to insolubility and thus poor processability, which severely limits their applicability, e.g., in CMP&#8208;based devices. Hence, the development of CMPs whose structure can not only be controlled on the micro&#8208; but also on the macroscale have attracted tremendous interest. In conventional synthesis procedures, CMPs are obtained as powders, but in recent years various bottom&#8208;up synthesis strategies have been developed, which yield CMPs as thin films on substrates or as hybrid materials, allowing to span length scales from individual conjugated monomers to micro&#8208;/macrostructures. This review surveys recent advances on the construction of CMPs into macroscale structures, including membranes, films, aerogels, sponges, and other architectures. The focus is to describe the underlying fabrication techniques and the implications which follow from the macroscale morphologies, involving new chemistry and physics in such materials for applications like molecular separation/filtration/adsorption, energy storage and conversion, photothermal transformation, sensing, or catalysis.

         <title>Spatial Separation of Cocatalysts on Z&#8208;Scheme Organic/Inorganic Heterostructure Hollow Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and In&#8208;Depth Analysis of the Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction hollow sphere with spatially separated cocatalysts is proposed to overcome the fundamental limitation in photocatalytic water splitting. The Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction effectively stimulates interfacial charge transfer while retaining high redox power, whereas the spatially separated cocatalysts stimulate surface charge separation. Their synergistic effect results in an exceptional photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of 8.15 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction with spatially separated cocatalysts is proposed for overcoming fundamental issues in photocatalytic water splitting, such as inefficient light absorption, charge recombination, and sluggish reaction kinetics. For efficient light absorption and interfacial charge separation, Z&#8208;scheme organic/inorganic heterojunction photocatalysts are synthesized by firmly immobilizing ultrathin g&#8208;C3N4 on the surface of TiO2 hollow spheres via electrostatic interactions. Additionally, two cocatalysts, Pt and IrOx, are spatially separated along the Z&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer pathway to enhance surface charge separation and reaction kinetics. The as&#8208;prepared Pt/g&#8208;C3N4/TiO2/IrOx (PCTI) hollow sphere photocatalyst exhibits an exceptional H2 evolution rate of 8.15&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 24.3% at 330&#160;nm in the presence of 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.2 wt% IrOx cocatalysts on g&#8208;C3N4 and TiO2, respectively. Photoassisted Kelvin probe force microscopy is used to systematically analyze the Z&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer mechanism within PCTI. Furthermore, the benefits of spatially separating cocatalysts in the PCTI system are methodically investigated in comparison to randomly depositing them. This work adequately demonstrates that the combination of a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction and spatially separated cocatalysts can be a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic platforms for solar fuel production.

This review pioneeringly presents the unique and essential role of some s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metal species enabling transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts to efficiently drive hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Transition metals, in particular noble metals, are the most common species in metal&#8208;mediated water electrolysis because they serve as highly active catalytic sites. In many cases, the presence of nontransition metals, that is, s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals with high natural abundance in the earth&#8208;crust in the catalytic material is indispensable to boost efficiency and durability in water electrolysis. This is why alkali metals, alkaline&#8208;earth metals, rare&#8208;earth metals, lean metals, and metalloids receive growing interest in this research area. In spite of the pivotal role of these nontransition metals in tuning efficiency of water electrolysis, there is far more room for developments toward a knowledge&#8208;based catalyst design. In this review, five classes of nontransition metals species which are successfully utilized in water electrolysis, with special emphasis on electronic structure&#8211;catalytic activity relationships and phase stability, are discussed. Moreover, specific fundamental aspects on electrocatalysts for water electrolysis as well as a perspective on this research field are also addressed in this account. It is anticipated that this review can trigger a broader interest in using s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals species toward the discovery of advanced polymetal&#8208;containing electrocatalysts for practical water splitting.

FeFET with large counterclockwise hysteresis and negative capacitance FET free of hysteresis are realized for memory (neural computing) and low&#8208;power computing, respectively. It paves a new path toward both in&#8208;memory computing and transistor&#8208;memory monolithic integration.








Abstract
The functional reconfiguration of transistors and memory in homogenous ferroelectric devices offers significant opportunities for implementing the concepts of in&#8208;memory computing and logic&#8208;memory monolithic integration. Thus far, reconfiguration is realized through programmable doping profiles in the semiconductor channel using multiple&#8208;gate operation. This complex device architecture limits further scaling to match the overall chip requirements. Here, reconfigurable memory/transistor functionalities in a ferroelectric&#8208;gated van der Waals transistor by controlling the behavior of ferroelectric oxygen vacancies at the interface are demonstrated. Short&#8208; and long&#8208;term memory functions are demonstrated by modulating the border oxygen vacancy distribution and the associated charge dynamics. The quasi&#8208;nonvolatile long&#8208;term memory exhibits data retention of over 105 s and endurance of up to 5 &#215; 105 cycles, verifying its applicability as a potential device platform for neuromorphic networks. More importantly, by modulating the ferroelectricity of the interfacial domains with the interactions of oxygen vacancies, a hysteresis&#8208;free logic transistor is realized with a subthermionic subthreshold swing down to 46&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, which resembles a negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistor. The new concept of achieving functional reconfiguration with prior device performance in a single&#8208;gate ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor is of great advantage in future integrated circuit applications.

         <title>Gradient Doping in Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskites by Barium Ions for Efficient Single&#8208;Junction and Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Barium ions are reported to effectively n&#8208;dope perovskites. Distribution of the barium ions and related n&#8208;doping effect is in a gradient across the perovskite film, resulting in a homojunction, which facilitates the separation and transport of the photogenerated carriers. Carrier diffusion length &gt;2&#160;&#181;m and boosted efficiencies of 21.2% for single&#8208;junction cell and 25.3% for all&#8208;perovskite tandem cell are achieved.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) tin (Sn)&#8211;lead (Pb) perovskites generally have a high density of unintentional p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping, which reduces the charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes, diffusion lengths, and device efficiencies. Here, a&#160;p&#8211;n&#160;homojunction across the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite is demonstrated, which results from a gradient doping by barium ions (Ba2+). It is reported that 0.1&#160;mol% Ba2+ can effectively compensate the p&#8208;doping of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites or even turns it to n&#8208;type without changing its bandgap. Ba2+ cations are found to stay at the interstitial sites and work as shallow electron donor. In addition, Ba2+ cations show a unique heterogeneous distribution in perovskite film. Most of the barium ions stay in the top 600&#160;nm region of the perovskite films and turn it into weakly n&#8208;type, while the bottom portion of the film remains as p&#8208;type. The gradient doping forms a homojunction from top to bottom of the perovskite films with a built&#8208;in field that facilitates extraction of photogenerated carriers, resulting in an increased carrier extraction length. This strategy enhances the efficiency of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite single&#8208;junction solar cells to over 21.0% and boosts the efficiencies of monolithic perovskite&#8211;perovskite tandem solar cells to 25.3% and 24.1%, for active areas of 5.9&#160;mm2&#160;and 0.94&#160;cm2, respectively.

         <title>Electrode Engineering in Halide Perovskite Electronics: Plenty of Room at the Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational selection of electrodes plays a critical role in perovskite&#8208;based electronics due to the high reactivity of halide perovskite materials. A comprehensive review of perovskite/electrode interfaces, as well as, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact engineering, which assists the development of perovskite&#8208;based devices with inhibited interfacial reactions, ohmic carrier transport, and non&#8208;hysteric electronic characteristics, is presented.








Abstract
Contact engineering is a prerequisite for achieving desirable functionality and performance of semiconductor electronics, which is particularly critical for organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskites due to their ionic nature and highly reactive interfaces. Although the interfaces between perovskites and charge&#8208;transporting layers have attracted lots of attention due to the photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting diode applications, achieving reliable perovskite/electrode contacts for electronic devices, such as transistors and memories, remains as a bottleneck. Herein, a critical review on the elusive nature of perovskite/electrode interfaces with a focus on the interfacial electrochemistry effects is presented. The basic guidelines of electrode selection are given for establishing non&#8208;polarized interfaces and optimal energy level alignment for perovskite materials. Furthermore, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies on interface&#8208;related electrode engineering are reviewed and discussed, which aim at achieving ohmic transport and eliminating hysteresis in perovskite devices. The role and multiple functionalities of self&#8208;assembled monolayers that offer a unique approach toward improving perovskite/electrode contacts are also discussed. The insights on electrode engineering pave the way to advancing stable and reliable perovskite devices in diverse electronic applications.

         <title>Recent Progress in Protective Membranes Fabricated via Electrospinning: Advanced Materials, Biomimetic Structures, and Functional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospinning has been used for several applications over the last 20 years. Multifunctional protective membranes in terms of novel material design, novel structure construction, and various applications via electrospinning are reviewed. Diverse protective membranes are investigated, existing problems are discussed, and solutions for future technology development are proposed. This is of significance for the sustainable development of intelligent protection systems.








Abstract
Electrospinning is a significant micro/nanofiber processing technology and has been rapidly developing in the past 2 decades. It has several applications, including advanced sensing, intelligent manufacturing, and high&#8208;efficiency catalysis. Here, multifunctional protective membranes fabricated via electrospinning in terms of novel material design, construction of novel structures, and various protection requirements in different environments are reviewed. To achieve excellent comprehensive properties, such as, high water vapor transmission, high hydrostatic pressure, optimal mechanical property, and air permeability, combinations of novel materials containing nondegradable/degradable materials and functional structures inspired by nature have been investigated for decades. Currently, research is mainly focused on conventional protective membranes with multifunctional properties, such as, anti&#8208;UV, antibacterial, and electromagnetic&#8208;shielding functions. However, important aspects, such as, the properties of electrospun monofilaments, development of &#8220;green electrospinning solutions&#8221; with high solid content, and approaches for enhancing adhesion between hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers are not considered. Based on this systematic review, the development of electrospinning for protective membranes is discussed, the existing gaps in research are discussed, and solutions for the development of technology are proposed. This review will assist in promoting the diversified development of protective membranes and is of great significance for fabricating advanced materials for intelligent protection.

         <title>Regulation of Surface Defect Chemistry towards Stable Ni&#8208;rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Surface reconstruction of Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides degrades the cycling stability and safety of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which challenges typical surface modification approaches to build a robust interface with electrochemical activity. Here, we propose a strategy by leveraging the low strain analogues of Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208; rich layered oxides to reconstruct a stable surface on the Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes. The new surface structure not only consists of a gradient chemical composition but also contains a defect&#8208;rich structure regarding the formation of oxygen vacancies and cationic ordering, which can simultaneously facilitate lithium diffusion and stabilize the crystal structure during the (de)lithiation. These features in the Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides lead to a dramatic improvement in electrochemical properties, especially the cyclability under high voltage cycling, exhibiting the 30% increase in capacity retention after 200 cycles at the current density of 1C (3.0&#8208;4.6&#160;V). Our findings offer a facile and effective way to regulate defect chemistry and surface structure in parallel on Ni&#8208;rich layered structure cathodes to achieve high&#8208;energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Sensitive Activatable Nanoprobes for Real&#8208;time Ratiometric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Reactive Oxygen Species and Ameliorating Inflammation In Vivo</title>

Abstract
Imaging guided real&#8208;time monitoring of the treatment process of inflammatory diseases is important for the timely adjustment of the treatment planning to lower unnecessary side effects and improve treatment outcomes. However, it is difficult to reflect the dynamic changes of inflammation in vivo with enough tissue penetration depth. Here, we developed a novel nanotheranostic agent (denominated TMSN@PM) with platelet membrane&#8208;coated, tempol&#8208;grafted, manganese&#8208;doped, mesoporous silica nanoparticles. The platelet membrane endowed the TMSN@PM with the ability to target inflammation sites, which were verified by fluorescence imaging with Cy5&#8208;labeled TMSN@PM. Under the inflammatory environment (mild acidity and excess reactive oxygen species, ROS), TMSN@PM can scavenge the excess ROS, thereby alleviating inflammation, degrade and release manganese ions for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The relaxation changes (&#916;R1) were almost linearly correlated with the concentration of H2O2, which could reflect the degree of inflammation. This method offers a non&#8208;invasive imaging&#8208;based strategy for early prediction of the therapeutic outcomes in inflammatory therapy, which may contribute to precision medicine in terms of prognostic stratification and therapeutic planning in future.

         <title>More Than Carbazole Derivatives Activate Room Temperature Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence of Benzoindole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The mechanism of carbazole(Cz)&#8208;based phosphors is still unclear since its isomer (1H&#8208;benzo[f]indole, Bd) was discovered in 2020. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of four Cz/Bd derivatives, named as 2CzBr, CzBdBr, 2BdBr and 3Bd, and give the general mechanism of Bd derivatives for their ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP). Bd and its derivatives gave double groups of intrinsic phosphorescence, including the short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence with a short lifetime and the ultralong phosphorescence at long wavelengths, assigned to their neutral molecules and radical cations, respectively. Interestingly, the doped PMMA films of CzBdBr and 2BdBr showed photo&#8208;activated ultralong phosphorescence at room temperature (RT). The activation of RT ultralong phosphorescence of Bd derivatives involved three factors: (1) well dispersion in the matrix with limited amount, (2) generation of their radical cations and (3) the matrix&#8208;mediated stabilization of radical cations. In addition, the function of Cz derivatives to activate the intrinsic ultralong phosphorescence of Bd derivatives could be replaced by photo&#8208;activation or by using other matrixes. Moreover, the photo&#8208;activated ultralong phosphorescence was closely related to the molecular structures of Bd derivatives and the stability of their radical cations. For some Cz systems obtained from commercially available Cz, their ultralong phosphorescence might originate from synergistic effect of two or even more kinds of Bd derivatives. Significantly, the application of the doped PMMA films was practiced and gave an exciting result that the high&#8208;resolution QR code could be reversibly printed and erased on the doped film. Our research has expanded the understanding in the field of ultralong organic phosphorescence and it may pave a new way for its development.

         <title>Confined growth of silver&#8208;copper Janus nanostructures with {100} facets for highly selective tandem electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds significant potential to promote carbon neutral. However, the selectivity toward multi&#8208;carbon products in CO2RR is still too low to meet practical applications. Here we report the delicate synthesis of three kinds of Ag&#8208;Cu Janus nanostructures with {100} facets (JNS&#8208;100) for highly selective tandem electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products. By controlling the surfactant and reduction kinetics of Cu precursor, we realize the confined growth of Cu with {100} facets on one of the six equal faces of Ag nanocubes. Compared with Cu nanocubes, Ag65&#8208;Cu35 JNS&#8208;100 demonstrate much superior selectivity for both ethylene and multi&#8208;carbon products in CO2RR at less negative potentials. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the compensating electronic structure and carbon monoxide spillover in Ag65&#8208;Cu35 JNS&#8208;100 contribute to the enhanced CO2RR performance. This study provides an effective strategy to design advanced tandem catalysts toward the extensive application of CO2RR.

         <title>Multifunctional PA/FL Dual&#8208;mode Imaging Gold&#8208;based Theranostic Nanoformulation without External Laser Limitations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Theranostics is a new type of biomedical technology that organically combines the diagnosis and therapy of diseases. Among molecular imaging techniques, the integration of photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence (FL) imaging modes with high sensitivity and imaging depth provides precise diagnostic outcomes. Gold nanorods (Au NRs) are well&#8208;known contrast agents for PA imaging and photothermal therapy. However, its high toxicity, poor biocompatibility, rapid clearance, and the need for an external laser source limits its application. Therefore, modification of Au NRs with carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials (CBNs) is done to obtain a multifunctional dual&#8208;mode gold&#8208;based nanoformulation (mdGC), which preforms dual&#8208;mode imaging of PA and FL. The results show that mdGC promotes tumor cell apoptosis and exhibits good antitumor performance through the mitochondria&#8208;mediated apoptotic pathway by increasing the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, and regulating the expression of apoptosis&#8208;related genes. The targeting rate of mdGC to tumor tissue is up to 20.71&#177;1.94%&#160;ID g&#8211;1; the tumor growth inhibition rate is as high as 80.44% without external laser sources. In general, mdGC is a potential multifunctional diagnostic and therapy integrated nanoformulation.

         <title>Heterointerface Created on Au&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Loaded Unilamellar Hydroxide Electrocatalysts as a Highly Active Site for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The material design for interface active sites to allow a novel oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism is proposed. The Au&#8208;cluster&#8208;loaded unilamellar layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide nanosheet electrocatalysts create interfacial active sites that exhibit interfacial direct O&#63743;O coupling and excellent OER performance.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical element for all sorts of reactions that use water as a hydrogen source, such as hydrogen evolution and electrochemical CO2 reduction, and novel design principles that provide highly active sites on OER electrocatalysts push the limits of their practical applications. Herein, Au&#8208;cluster loading on unilamellar exfoliated layered double hydroxide (ULDH) electrocatalysts for the OER is demonstrated to fabricate a heterointerface between Au clusters and ULDHs as an active site, which is accompanied by the oxidation state modulation of the active site and interfacial direct O&#63743;O coupling (&#8220;interfacial DOOC&#8221;). The Au&#8208;cluster&#8208;loaded ULDHs exhibit excellent activities for the OER with an overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements reveal that charge transfer from the Au clusters to ULDHs modifies the oxidation states of trivalent metal ions, which can be active sites on the ULDHs. The present study, supported by highly sensitive spectroscopy combining reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy and modulation&#8208;excitation spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, indicates that active sites at the interface between the Au clusters and ULDHs promote a novel OER mechanism through interfacial DOOC, thereby achieving outstanding catalytic performance.

         <title>Magnetoelectric effect in hydrogen harvesting: magnetic field as a trigger of catalytic reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic fields have been regarded as an additional stimulus for electro&#8208; and photocatalytic reactions, but not as a direct trigger for catalytic processes. Multiferroic/magnetoelectric materials, whose electrical polarization and surface charges can be magnetically altered, are especially suitable for triggering and control of catalytic reactions solely with magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate that magnetic fields can be employed as an independent input energy source for hydrogen harvesting by means of the magnetoelectric effect. Composite multiferroic CoFe2O4&#8208;BiFeO3 core&#8208;shell nanoparticles act as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that is triggered when an alternating magnetic field is applied to an aqueous dispersion of the magnetoelectric nanocatalysts. Based on density functional calculations, we propose that the hydrogen evolution is driven by changes in the ferroelectric polarization direction of BiFeO3 caused by the magnetoelectric coupling. We believe our findings will open new avenues towards magnetically induced renewable energy harvesting.

         <title>Distinct Crystal&#8208;Facet&#8208;Dependent Behaviors for Single&#8208;Atom Palladium&#8208;On&#8208;Ceria Catalysts: Enhanced Stabilization and Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct behaviors of single Pd atoms dispersed on different crystal facets of CeO2 is investigated. In situ characterizations reveal that the oxygen defects on the different facets of CeO2 can affect the formation and stability of single atoms. Pd atoms dispersed on CeO2(100) exhibit higher sinter&#8208;resistant performance than those on CeO2(111), and a different selectivity in the N&#8208;alkylation reaction.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance, fully atomically dispersed single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation industrial catalysts. However, it remains a great challenge to avoid the aggregation of isolated atoms into nanoparticles during the preparation and application of SACs. Here, the evolution of Pd species is investigated on different crystal facets of CeO2, and vastly different behaviors on the single&#8208;atomic dispersion of surface Pd atoms are surprisingly discovered. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ near&#8208;ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;XPS (NAP&#8208;XPS), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that, in a reducing atmosphere, more oxygen vacancies are generated on the (100) facet of CeO2, and Pd atoms can be trapped and thus feature atomic dispersion; by contrast, on the CeO2 (111) facet, Pd atoms will readily aggregate into clusters (Pdn). Furthermore, Pd1/CeO2(100) gives a high selectivity of 90.3% for the catalytic N&#8208;alkylation reaction, which is 2.8 times higher than that for Pdn/CeO2(111). This direct evidence demonstrates the crucial role of crystal&#8208;facet effects in the preparation of metal&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide SACs. This work thus opens an avenue for the rational design and targeted synthesis of ultrastable and sinter&#8208;resistant SACs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Stretchable and Fast Self&#8208;Healing Ionic Hydrogel in Cryogenic Environments for Artificial Nerve Fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors propose an ionic hydrogel with outstanding self&#8208;healing ability, ultra&#8208;stretchability, and conductivity in cryogenic environments. The artificial nerve fiber (SSANF) is fabricated based on the ionic hydrogel through bionic structural design. The SSANF enables stable information and energy transmission when connected to the biomimetic intelligent robot, even under big deformation and &#8722;78.5&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Self&#8208;healing materials behave with irreplaceable advantages in biomimetic intelligent robots (BIR) for avoiding or reducing safety hazards and economic losses from accidental damage during service. However, the self&#8208;healing ability is unreservedly lost and even becomes rigid and fragile in the cryogenic environment where BIR are precisely needed. Here, the authors report a versatile ionic hydrogel with fast self&#8208;healing ability, ultra&#8208;stretchability, and stable conductivity, even at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C. The hydrogel is systematically optimized to improve a hydrogen&#8208;bonded network nanostructure, coordinated achieving a quick self&#8208;healing ability within 10&#160;min, large deformation tolerance of over 7000%, superior conductivity of 11.76 S cm&#8722;1 and anti&#8208;freezing ability, which is difficult to obtain simultaneously. Such a hydrogel provides new opportunities for artificial electronic devices in harsh environments. As a prospective application, they fabricate an artificial nerve fiber by mimicking the structure and functions of the myelinated axon, exhibiting the property of fast and potential&#8208;gated signal transmission. This artificial nerve fiber is integrated into a robot for demonstrating a real&#8208;time high fidelity and high throughput information interaction under big deformation and cryogenic temperature. The hydrogel and bionic device will bring pioneering functions for robots and open a broad application scenario in extreme conditions.

         <title>Anionic Lipid Nanoparticles Preferentially Deliver mRNA to the Hepatic Reticuloendothelial System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) capable of delivering therapeutic RNA to specific cells in the body are required if the immense potential of these plug&#8208;and&#8208;play technologies is to be realized. Using embryonic zebrafish as a predictive in vivo model and with a thorough understanding of the nano&#8211;biointeractions involved, LNPs capable of preferential messenger RNA delivery to hepatic reticuloendothelial system cells are rationally designed.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP&#8208;based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP&#8208;based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP&#8211;mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES&#8208;targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver&#8208;specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano&#8211;biointeractions involved.

     alt="Anionic Lipid Nanoparticles Preferentially Deliver mRNA to the Hepatic Reticuloendothelial System"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) capable of delivering therapeutic RNA to specific cells in the body are required if the immense potential of these plug-and-play technologies is to be realized. Using embryonic zebrafish as a predictive in vivo model and with a thorough understanding of the nano&#8211;biointeractions involved, LNPs capable of preferential messenger RNA delivery to hepatic reticuloendothelial system cells are rationally designed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP-based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP-based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP&#8211;mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES-targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver-specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano&#8211;biointeractions involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Observation of Near&#8208;Intrinsic Exciton Linewidth in Monolayer WS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 7.18 meV near&#8208;intrinsic exciton linewidth in monolayer WS2 is achieved at room temperature by coupling it with a moderate&#8208;refractive&#8208;index hydrogenated silicon nanosphere in water. The dielectric nanosphere is designed to boost the dynamic competition between WS2 exciton and trion decay channels and rebuild the excitonic relaxation processes with suppressed exciton nonradiative recombination. A tunable exciton linewidth is also demonstrated.








Abstract
The homogeneous exciton linewidth, which captures the coherent quantum dynamics of an excitonic state, is a vital parameter in exploring light&#8211;matter interactions in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). An efficient control of the exciton linewidth is of great significance, and in particular of its intrinsic linewidth, which determines the minimum timescale for the coherent manipulation of excitons. However, such a control is rarely achieved in TMDs at room temperature (RT). While the intrinsic A exciton linewidth is down to 7 meV in monolayer WS2, the reported RT linewidth is typically a few tens of meV due to inevitable homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening effects. Here, it is shown that a 7.18 meV near&#8208;intrinsic linewidth can be observed at RT when monolayer WS2 is coupled with a moderate&#8208;refractive&#8208;index hydrogenated silicon nanosphere in water. By boosting the dynamic competition between exciton and trion decay channels in WS2 through the nanosphere&#8208;supported Mie resonances, the coherent linewidth can be tuned from 35 down to 7.18 meV. Such modulation of exciton linewidth and its associated mechanism are robust even in presence of defects, easing the sample quality requirement and providing new opportunities for TMD&#8208;based nanophotonics and optoelectronics.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
The indispensable requirement for sustainable development of human society has forced almost all countries to seek highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective ways to harvest and convert solar energy. Though continuous progress has advanced, it remains a daunting challenge to achieve full&#8208;spectrum solar absorption and maximize the conversion efficiency of sunlight. Recently, thermoplasmonics has emerged as a promising solution, which involves several beneficial effects including enhanced light absorption and scattering, generation and relaxation of hot carriers, as well as localized/collective heating, offering tremendous opportunities for optimized energy conversion. Besides, all these functionalities can be tailored via elaborated designs of materials and nanostructures. In this review, first the fundamental physics governing thermoplasmonics is presented and then the strategies for both material selection and nanostructured designs toward more efficient energy conversion are summarized. Based on this, recent progress in thermoplasmonic applications including solar evaporation, photothermal chemistry, and thermophotovoltaic is reviewed. Finally, the corresponding challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Antibacterial Strategies Enabled by Gene&#8208;Transfection and Immunomodulatory Nanoparticles in 3D&#8208;printed Scaffolds for Synergistic Exogenous and Endogenous Treatment of Infections</title>

         <dc:description>
As research on refractory Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;related implant infection intensifies, certain challenges remain, including low antibiotic concentrations within infected areas, immune escape achieved by intracellular bacteria, myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) inducing regional immunosuppression, and recurrence of residual pathogenic bacteria after drug suspension. Herein, we propose a novel antimicrobial system to simultaneously address these issues. Specifically, we have designed an oxygen species&#8208;responsive 3D printed scaffold with shell&#8208;core nanoparticles, which are loaded with an antimicrobial peptide plasmid (LL37 plasmid) and have LL37 grafted on their surface (LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37). The surface&#8208;grafted LL37 directly kills S. aureus and, following entry into cells, the nanoparticles kill intracellular bacteria. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo, following translation of the LL37 plasmid, cells function as factories of the antimicrobial peptide, thereby generating a continuous, prolonged, antibacterial effect at the site of infection. This system significantly reduces the abnormal increase in MDSCs within the infected microenvironment, thus, relieving the immunosuppressive state and restoring a protective antimicrobial immune response. Hence, this proposed antimicrobial system provides an antimicrobial immune response. Hence, this proposed antimicrobial system provides a novel strategy for S. aureus&#8208;related infections by offering a combined active antimicrobial and immunotherapeutic strategy, thereby significantly reducing the recurrence rate following recovery from implant&#8208;associated infections.

         <title>A biomaterial&#8208;based hedging immune strategy for scarless tendon healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Scarring rather than regeneration, is an inevitable outcome of unbalanced amplifications of inflammation&#8208;destructive signals and atresia of the regenerative niche. However, identifying and effectively hedging against the risk of scarring and realizing the conversion of regenerative cues remain difficult. In this paper, we report a hedging immune strategy based microfibrous membrane (Him&#8208;MFM) by tethering distearoyl phosphoethanolamine layer&#8208;supported copoly(lactic/glycolic acid) electrospun fibers with identified CD11b+/CD68+ scarring subpopulation membranes in the immune landscape after tendon injury to counterweigh tissue damage. Him&#8208;MFM, carrying relevant risk receptors was shown to shift high type I biased polarization, alleviate apoptosis and metabolic stress, and mitigate inflammatory tenocyte response. Remarkably, the hedging immune strategy reversed the damaged tendon sheath barrier to the innate IL&#8208;33 secretory phenotype by 4.36 times and initiated the mucous&#8208;IL&#8208;33&#8208;Th2 axis, directly supplying a transient but obligate regenerative niche for sheath stem cell proliferation. In murine flexor tendon injury, the wrapping of Him&#8208;MFM alleviated pathological responses, protected tenocytes in situ, and restored hierarchically arranged collagen fibers covered with basement membrane, structurally and functionally comparable to mature tendons, demonstrating that hedging immunity is a promising strategy to yield regenerative responses not scarring.

         <title>A Van der Waals Interface Hosting Two Groups of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple groups of magnetic skyrmions add an additional degree of freedom for skyrmion&#8208;based ultrahigh&#8208;density memory devices. Vertical imprinting of magnetic skyrmions in 2D layered magnetic heterostructures are reported. Two sets of topological Hall effects are observed at low temperatures and these two groups of skyrmions are directly imaged using magnetic force microscopy.








Abstract
Multiple magnetic skyrmion phases add an additional degree of freedom for skyrmion&#8208;based ultrahigh&#8208;density spin memory devices. Extending the field to 2D van der Waals magnets is a rewarding challenge, where the realizable degree of freedoms (e.g., thickness, twist angle, and electrical gating) and high skyrmion density result in intriguing new properties and enhanced functionality. In this work, a van der Waals interface, formed by two 2D ferromagnets Cr2Ge2Te6 and Fe3GeTe2 with a Curie temperature of &#8776;65 and &#8776;205 K, respectively, hosting two groups of magnetic skyrmions, is reported. Two sets of topological Hall effect signals are observed below 6s0 K when Cr2Ge2Te6 is magnetically ordered. These two groups of skyrmions are directly imaged using magnetic force microscopy, and supported by micromagnetic simulations. Interestingly, the magnetic skyrmions persist in the heterostructure with zero applied magnetic field. The results are promising for the realization of skyrmionic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures hosting multiple skyrmion&#160;phases.

In this work, a van der Waals interface, formed by two 2D ferromagnets Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a Curie temperature of &#8776;65 and &#8776;205 K, respectively, hosting two groups of magnetic skyrmions, is reported. Two sets of topological Hall effect signals are observed below 6s0 K when Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is magnetically ordered. These two groups of skyrmions are directly imaged using magnetic force microscopy, and supported by micromagnetic simulations. Interestingly, the magnetic skyrmions persist in the heterostructure with zero applied magnetic field. The results are promising for the realization of skyrmionic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures hosting multiple skyrmion&#160;phases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Soft Actuators Made of Discrete Grains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;change actuators have been shown to achieve useful volumetric expansions. Simultaneously, granular systems are able to flow, jam, and exhibit unique bulk properties. In this work, granular actuators are introduced, where each grain is a phase&#8208;change actuator. Grains can be used independently for micro&#8208;actuation, in agglomerates for macro&#8208;actuation, can flow for freeform actuator printability, and exhibit compatibility with various granular assembly designs.








Abstract
Recent work has demonstrated the potential of actuators consisting of bulk elastomers with phase&#8208;changing inclusions for generating high forces and large volumetric expansions. Simultaneously, granular assemblies have been shown to enable tunable properties via different packings, dynamic moduli via jamming, and compatibility with various printing methods via suspension in carrier fluids. Herein, granular actuators are introduced, which represent a new class of soft actuators made of discrete grains. The soft grains consist of a hyperelastic shell and multiple solvent cores. Upon heating, the encapsulated solvent cores undergo liquid&#8208;to&#8208;gas phase change, inducing rapid and strong volumetric expansion of the hyperelastic shell up to 700%. The grains can be used independently for micro&#8208;actuation, or in granular agglomerates for meso&#8208; and macroscale actuation, demonstrating the scalability of the granular actuators. Furthermore, the active grains can be suspended in a carrier resin or solvent to enable printable soft actuators via established granular material processing techniques. By combining the advantages of phase&#8208;change soft actuation and granularity, this work presents the opportunity to realize soft actuators with tunable bulk properties, compatibility with self&#8208;assembly techniques, and on&#8208;demand reconfigurability.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;1D Electronic Transport in a 2D Magnetic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CrSBr is a 2D semiconductor of interest for its magnetic properties. Temperature&#8208; and gate&#8208;dependent transport exhibit an extreme anisotropy (ca. 102 to 105)&#8212;stronger than in any other 2D semiconductor&#8212;and the photocurrent shows clear signatures of 1D behavior. This work shows that CrSBr is a quasi&#8208;1D electronic system, a unique characteristic in the panorama of known 2D semiconductors.








Abstract
Electronic transport through exfoliated multilayers of CrSBr, a 2D semiconductor of interest because of its magnetic properties, is investigated. An extremely pronounced anisotropy manifesting itself in qualitative and quantitative differences of all quantities measured along the in&#8208;plane a and b crystallographic directions is found. In particular, a qualitatively different dependence of the conductivities &#963;a and &#963;b on temperature and gate voltage, accompanied by orders of magnitude differences in their values (&#963;b/&#963;a&#160;&#8776; 3 &#215; 102&#160;to 105 at low temperature and negative gate voltage) are observed, together with a different behavior of the longitudinal magnetoresistance in the two directions and the complete absence of the Hall effect in transverse resistance measurements. These observations appear not to be compatible with a description in terms of conventional band transport of a 2D doped semiconductor. The observed phenomenology&#8212;and unambiguous signatures of a 1D van Hove singularity detected in energy&#8208;resolved photocurrent measurements&#8212;indicate that electronic transport through CrSBr multilayers is better interpreted by considering the system as formed by weakly and incoherently coupled 1D wires, than by conventional 2D band transport. It is concluded that CrSBr is the first 2D semiconductor to show distinctly quasi&#8208;1D electronic transport properties.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production by Seawater Electrolysis Coupling Sulfion Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seawater electrolysis coupling sulfion degradation enables energy&#8208;saving and chlorine&#8208;free hydrogen production at low electricity expense while rapidly degrading sulfion pollutants to value&#8208;added sulfur for better sustainability.








Abstract
Electrolysis of costless and infinite seawater is a promising way toward grid&#8208;scale hydrogen production without causing freshwater stress. Practical potential of this technology, however, is hindered by low energy efficiency and anode corrosion by the detrimental chlorine chemistry in seawater in addition to unaffordable electricity expense. Herein, energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production is reported by chlorine&#8208;free seawater splitting coupling sulfion oxidation. It yields hydrogen at a low cell voltage of 0.97&#160;V, cutting the electricity consumption to 2.32&#160;kWh per m3 H2 at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Compared to alkaline water electrolysis, the energy expense is primarily saved by 60% with 50% lower energy equivalent input. Benefiting from the ultralow cell voltage, the hazardous chlorine chemistry is fully avoided without anode corrosion regardless of Cl&#8722; crossover. Meanwhile, it also allows fast degradation of S2&#8722; pollutant from the water body to value&#8208;added sulfur with 80% efficiency, for further reducing hydrogen cost and protection of the ecosystem. Connecting such a hybrid seawater electrolyzer to a commercial solar cell can harvest the hydrogen from seawater with better sustainability. This work may offer new opportunities for low&#8208;cost hydrogen production from the unlimited ocean resources with environmental protection.

         <title>The Development of Chiral Nanoparticles to Target NK Cells and CD8+ T Cells for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral nanoparticles (NPs) are developed as tumor immunoadjuvants for the treatment and prevention of cancer by stimulating both the innate and acquired immune responses. It is revealed that chiral NPs stimulate the expression of cytokines to induce cytotoxic activity in natural killer (NK) cells, while the CD8+ T cells are activated to eliminate tumor cells via antigen cross presentation.








Abstract
The chirality of nanomaterials (nanoparticles, NPs) can influence their interaction with cells and biological systems. However, how chirality can exert impact on the immune response has yet to be investigated. Here, the immunological effect of chiral nanomaterials is investigated as a therapeutic and preventive option against tumors. Compared with achiral nanoparticles, chiral NPs with a g&#8208;factor of 0.44 are shown to enhance both innate and acquired immunity against tumor growth. It is also found that chiral NPs enhance the activation of CD8+ T and natural killer cells (CD69+ NK cells) by stimulating dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, L&#8208;type NPs induce a 1.65&#8208;fold higher proportion of CD8+ T and CD69+ NK cells than D&#8208;type NPs. Next, the therapeutic and preventative effects of chiral NPs against tumors in a EG7.OVA tumor model are investigated. It is found that L&#8208;type NPs have a significant greater ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and prolong the survival time of model mice than D&#8208;type NPs. Mice treated with L&#8208;type NPs induce the activation of 84.98&#160;&#177; 6.63% CD8+ T cells and 33.62&#160;&#177; 3.41% of NK cells in tumor tissues; these are 1.62&#8208;fold and 1.39&#8208;fold higher than that seen in the mice treated with D&#8208;type NPs. Mechanistic studies reveal that chiral NPs exert mechanical force on bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and stimulate the expression of cytokines to induce cytotoxic activity in NK cells. Synergistically, the CD8+ T cells are stimulated to eliminate tumor cells via antigen cross presentation. The force of interaction between L&#8208;type NPs and cells is higher than that for D&#8208;NPs, thus further promoting the activation of NK cells and CD8+ T cells and their infiltration into tumor tissue. These findings open up a new avenue for chiral nanomaterials to act as immunoadjuvants for the prevention and treatment of cancer.

         <title>A Transformable Amphiphilic and Block Polymer&#8722;Dendron Conjugate for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Retention with Cellular Homeostasis Perturbation via Membrane Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme&#8208;triggered stealthy&#8208;to&#8208;sticky transformation of a polymer&#8722;dendron conjugate can both meliorate its tumor tissue distribution and perturb cancer cellular homeostasis via the membrane flow process. This work presents a versatile approach to augmenting the tumor therapeutic efficacy of a nanomedicine via manipulation of its interactions with tumor membrane systems.








Abstract
Efficient penetration and retention of therapeutic agents in tumor tissues can be realized through rational design of drug delivery systems. Herein, a polymer&#8722;dendron conjugate, POEGMA&#8208;b&#8208;p(GFLG&#8208;Dendron&#8208;Ppa) (GFLG&#8208;DP), is presented, which allows a cathepsin&#8208;B&#8208;triggered stealthy&#8208;to&#8208;sticky structural transformation. The compositions and ratios are optimized through dissipative particle dynamics simulations. GFLG&#8208;DP displays tumor&#8208;specific transformation and the consequently released dendron&#8208;Ppa is found to effectively accumulate on the tumor cell membrane. The interaction between the dendron&#8208;Ppa and the tumor cell membrane results in intracellular and intercellular transport via membrane flow, thus achieving efficient deep penetration and prolonged retention of therapeutic agents in the solid tumor tissues. Meanwhile, the interaction of dendron&#8208;Ppa with the endoplasmic reticulum disrupts cell homeostasis, making tumor cells more vulnerable and susceptible to photodynamic therapy. This platform represents a versatile approach to augmenting the tumor therapeutic efficacy of a nanomedicine via manipulation of its interactions with tumor membrane systems.

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;Double&#8208;Layer Solid Electrolyte with Adjustable Interphases Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;double&#8208;layer solid electrolyte is designed by using different kinds of plasticizers coupled with a polymer. Through the in situ polymerization of propylene carbonate on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, to form a protective layer, the oxidation and cycling stability of the cathode are improved. The low&#8208;voltage stability and fast ion transmission is improved by the affinity of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and poly(vinylidene fluoride).








Abstract
Increasing the energy density and long&#8208;term cycling stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries necessitates the stability of electrolytes under high/low voltage application and stable electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact. However, neither a single polymer nor liquid electrolyte can realize this due to their limited internal energy gap, which cannot avoid lithium&#8208;metal deposition and electrolyte oxidation simultaneously. Herein, a novel type of quasi&#8208;double&#8208;layer composite polymer electrolytes (QDL&#8208;CPEs) is proposed by using plasticizers with high oxidation stability (propylene carbonate) and high reduction stability (diethylene glycol dimethyl ether) in a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based electrolyte composites. In&#8208;situ&#8208;polymerized propylene carbonate can function as a cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) film, which can enhance the antioxidant ability. The nucleophilic substitution reaction between diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and PVDF increases the reduction stability of the electrolyte on the anodic side, without the formation of lithium dendrites. The QDL&#8208;CPEs has high ionic conductivity, an enhanced electrochemical reaction window, adjustable electrode/electrolyte interphases, and no additional electrolyte&#8211;electrolyte interfacial resistance. Thus, this ingenious design of the QDL&#8208;CPEs improves the cycling performance of a fabricated LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)//QDL&#8208;CPEs//hard carbon full cell at room temperature, paving a new way for designing solid&#8208;state battery systems accessible for practical applications.

         <title>Unraveling Heat Transport and Dissipation in Suspended MoSe2 from Bulk to Monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study using Raman thermometry and ab initio simulations to unravel the heat transport properties of suspended MoSe2 crystals with systematic thickness variation down to the monolayer. Monolayer films have almost the same in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity as bulk material thanks to an additional heat&#8208;carrying low&#8208;frequency mode. Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane heat dissipation to air is extremely efficient for the thinnest flakes.








Abstract
Understanding heat flow in layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals is crucial for applications exploiting these materials. Despite significant efforts, several basic thermal transport properties of TMDs are currently not well understood, in particular how transport is affected by material thickness and the material's environment. This combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study establishes a unifying physical picture of the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of the representative TMD MoSe2. Thermal conductivity measurements using Raman thermometry on a large set of clean, crystalline, suspended crystals with systematically varied thickness are combined with ab initio simulations with phonons at finite temperature. The results show that phonon dispersions and lifetimes change strongly with thickness, yet the thinnest TMD films exhibit an in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity that is only marginally smaller than that of bulk crystals. This is the result of compensating phonon contributions, in particular heat&#8208;carrying modes around &#8776;0.1&#160;THz in (sub)nanometer thin films, with a surprisingly long mean free path of several micrometers. This behavior arises directly from the layered nature of the material. Furthermore, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane heat dissipation to air molecules is remarkably efficient, in particular for the thinnest crystals, increasing the apparent thermal conductivity of monolayer MoSe2 by an order of magnitude. These results are crucial for the design of (flexible) TMD&#8208;based (opto&#8208;)electronic&#160;applications.

         <title>Multiferroic&#8208;Enabled Magnetic&#8208;Excitons in 2D Quantum&#8208;Entangled Van der Waals Antiferromagnet NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum&#8208;entangled magnetic excitons develop in a triangular multiferroic NiI2 when it goes through a second phase transition at low temperatures. In this graph of optical absorption data, the bright regions indicate where two exciton&#8208;related peaks appear below the second magnetic phase transition as indicated by the dashed line. The many&#8208;body calculations show that this exciton arises from a transition between two quantum&#8208;entangled states of Zhang&#8211;Rice triplet and Zhang&#8211;Rice singlet states.








Abstract
Matter&#8211;light interaction is at the center of diverse research fields from quantum optics to condensed matter physics, opening new fields like laser physics. A magnetic exciton is one such rare example found in magnetic insulators. However, it is relatively rare to observe that external variables control matter&#8208;light interaction. Here, it is reported that the broken inversion symmetry of multiferroicity can act as an external knob enabling magnetic excitons in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiI2. It is further discovered that this magnetic exciton arises from a transition between Zhang&#8211;Rice&#8208;triplet and Zhang&#8211;Rice&#8208;singlet fundamentally quantum&#8208;entangled states. This quantum entanglement produces an ultrasharp optical exciton peak at 1.384&#160;eV with a 5 meV linewidth. The work demonstrates that NiI2 is 2D magnetically ordered with an intrinsically quantum&#8208;entangled ground state.

         <title>Highly Transparent and Self&#8208;Healable Solar Thermal Anti&#8208;/Deicing Surfaces: When Ultrathin MXene Multilayers Marry a Solid Slippery Self&#8208;Cleaning Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar anti&#8208;/deicing surfaces, exhibiting high transparency (coated glass, transmittance &gt;77%&#160;at 550&#160;nm) and photothermal healability, are fabricated on various substrates, by applying a solid omniphobic slippery coating onto layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer&#8208;assembled MXene multilayers. The surface temperature rises by 31 &#176;C under 1.0 sun illumination for anti&#8208;/deicing applications, and the surface possesses self&#8208;cleaning capability to spontaneously shed waterborne and organic liquids.








Abstract
Solar anti&#8208;/deicing can solve icing problems by converting sunlight into heat. One of the biggest problems, which has long been plaguing the design of solar anti&#8208;/deicing surfaces, is that photothermal materials are always lightproof and appear black, because of the mutual exclusiveness between generating heat and retaining transparency. Herein, a highly transparent and scalable solar anti&#8208;/deicing surface is reported, which enables the coated glass to exhibit high transparency (&gt;77% transmittance at 550&#160;nm) and meanwhile causes a &gt;30 &#176;C&#160;surface temperature increase relative to the ambient environment under 1.0 sun illumination. Such a transparent anti&#8208;/deicing surface can be fabricated onto a large class of substrates (e.g., glass, ceramics, metals, plastics), by applying a solid omniphobic slippery coating onto layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer&#8208;assembled ultrathin MXene multilayers. Hence, the surface possesses a self&#8208;cleaning ability to shed waterborne and oil&#8208;based liquids thanks to residue&#8208;free slipping motion. Passive anti&#8208;icing and active deicing capabilities are, respectively, obtained on the solar thermal surface, which effectively prevents water from freezing and simultaneously melts pre&#8208;formed ice and thick frost. The self&#8208;cleaning effect enables residue&#8208;free removal of unfrozen water and interfacially melted ice/frost to boost the anti&#8208;/deicing efficiency. Importantly, the surface is capable of self&#8208;healing under illumination to repair physical damage and chemical degradation.

         <title>2D FeP Nanoframe Superlattices via Space&#8208;Confined Topochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D superlattices comprising monolayer FeP nanoframes are designed and synthesized through a space&#8208;confined topochemical transformation approach, using carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices as a precursor. The resulting 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices possess a number of unique features unavailable in conventional nanocrystal superlattices, which make them particularly promising as highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled nanocrystal superlattices represent an emergent class of designer materials with potentially programmable functionalities. The ability to construct hierarchically structured nanocrystal superlattices with tailored geometry and porosity is critical for extending their applications. Here, 2D superlattices comprising monolayer FeP nanoframes are synthesized through a space&#8208;confined topochemical transformation approach induced by the Kirkendall effect, using carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices as a precursor. The particle shape and the close&#8208;packed nature of Fe3O4 nanocubes as well as the interconnected carbon layer network contribute to the topochemical transformation process. The resulting 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices possess several unique and advantageous structural features that are unavailable in conventional 3D nanocrystal superlattices, which make them particularly attractive for catalytic applications. As a proof of concept, such 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices are harnessed as highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, the performance of which is superior to that of most FeP&#8208;based catalysts reported previously. This topochemical transformation approach is scalable and general, representing a new route of designing hierarchical superlattices with highly open features that cannot be accessible by traditional self&#8208;assembly methods.

         <title>Escalating Ferromagnetic Order via Se&#8208;Vacancies Near Vanadium in WSe2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhancement of ferromagnetism is demonstrated via Se&#8208;vacancy engineering in V&#8208;doped WSe2 diluted magnetic semiconductors and the underlying mechanism is elucidated. After generation of abundant Se&#8208;vacancies via heat&#8208;treatment, butterfly&#8208;shaped hysteresis in the magnetoresistance curves and distinct magnetic domains are clearly observed. With state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art atomic elemental mapping and comprehensive theoretical explanation, the origin of the enhanced ferromagnetism is revealed.








Abstract
Magnetic order has been proposed to arise from a variety of defects, including vacancies, antisites, and grain boundaries, which are relevant in numerous electronics and spintronics applications. Nevertheless, its magnetism remains controversial due to the lack of structural analysis. The escalation of ferromagnetism in vanadium&#8208;doped WSe2 monolayer is herein demonstrated by tailoring complex configurations of Se vacancies (SeVac) via post heat&#8208;treatment. Structural analysis of atomic defects is systematically performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), enabled by the monolayer nature. Temperature&#8208;dependent magnetoresistance hysteresis ensures enhanced magnetic order after high&#8208;temperature heat&#8208;treatment, consistent with magnetic domain analysis from magnetic force microscopy (MFM). The vanadium&#8211;Se vacancy pairing is a key to promoting ferromagnetism via spin&#8208;flip by electron transfer, predicted from density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations. The approach toward nanodefect engineering paves a way to overcome weak magnetic order in diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) for renovating semiconductor spintronics.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Treatment for Highest&#8208;Efficiency Ambient Printed Stable All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ionic liquid, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate (EMIMHSO4), is employed for managing defects in printed cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) films. The EMIMHSO4 can succesfully regulate perovskite thin&#8208;film growth and strongly coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+, which enable the achievement of the highest&#8208;efficiencies ambient printed CsPbI3 solar cells, both under 1 sun illumination (20.01%, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and indoor light illumination (37.24%, 1000 lux, 365 &#181;W cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) perovskite is well known for its unparalleled stability at high temperatures up to 500 &#176;C and under oxidative chemical stresses. However, upscaling solar cells via ambient printing suffers from imperfect crystal quality and defects caused by uncontrollable crystallization. Here, the incorporation of a low concentration of novel ionic liquid is reported as being promising for managing defects in CsPbI3 films, interfacial energy alignment, and device stability of solar cells fabricated via ambient blade&#8208;coating. Both theoretical simulations and experimental measurements reveal that the ionic liquid successfully regulates the perovskite thin&#8208;film growth to decrease perovskite grain boundaries, strongly coordinates with the undercoordinated Pb2+ to passivate iodide vacancy defects, aligns the interface to decrease the energy barrier at the electron&#8208;transporting layer, and relaxes the lattice strain to promote phase stability. Consequently, ambient printed CsPbI3 solar cells with power conversion efficiency as high as 20.01% under 1 sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and 37.24% under indoor light illumination (1000 lux, 365 &#181;W cm&#8722;2) are achieved; both are the highest for printed all&#8208;inorganic cells for corresponding applications. Furthermore, the bare cells show an impressive long&#8208;term ambient stability with only &#8776;5% PCE degradation after 1000 h aging under ambient conditions.

         <title>A New Durable Surface Nanoparticles&#8208;Modified Perovskite Cathode for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells from Selective Cation Exsolution under Oxidizing Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major perovskite phase, m&#8208;BCFZYN&#8208;095, in BCFZYN&#8208;095 has high proton conductivity, and NiO nanoparticles on the surface effectively improve the oxygen surface exchange rate, thereby simultaneously increasing proton and oxygen ion conductivities of the BCFZYN&#8208;095 composite. Consequently, favorable peak power densities of a protonic ceramic fuel cell with the BCFZYN&#8208;095 composite cathode in H2 are obtained.








Abstract
A high&#8208;performance cathode of a protonic ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) should possess excellent oxygen reduction reactivity, high proton/oxygen&#8208;ion/electron conductivity, and sufficient operational stability, thus requiring a delicate tuning of both the bulk and surface properties of the electrode material. Although surface modification of perovskites with nanoparticles from reducing&#8208;atmosphere exsolution has been demonstrated effective at improving the electrochemical anodic oxidation, such nanoparticles would easily re&#8208;incorporate into the perovskite lattice causing a big challenge for their application as a cathode. Here, a durable perovskite&#8208;based nanocomposite cathode for PCFCs is reported, which is facilely prepared via the exsolution of nanoparticles in an oxidizing atmosphere. Through composition and cation nonstoichiometry manipulation, a precursor with the nominal composition of Ba0.95(Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1)0.95Ni0.05O3&#8722;&#948; (BCFZYN&#8208;095) is designed, synthesized, and investigated, which, upon calcination, gives rise to the formation of a perovskite&#8208;based nanocomposite comprising a major perovskite phase and a minor NiO phase enriched on the perovskite surface. The major perovskite phase enabled by the proper cation nonstoichiometry manipulation promotes bulk proton conduction while the NiO nanoparticles facilitate the oxygen surface exchange process, leading to a superior cathodic performance with a maximum peak power density of 1040&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and excellent operational stability of 400 h at 550&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Dopant Selection for Metal Oxide&#8208;Based Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting: The Case Study of Fe2O3 and CuO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning is applied to guide rational dopant selection in metal oxide photoelectrodes with improved photoelectrochemical water splitting performance. The chemical state is found to be the most significant factor for dopant selection, while dopants with stronger metal&#8211;oxygen bond and larger ionic radius are preferred for charge separation and transfer.








Abstract
Doping is an effective strategy for tuning metal oxide&#8208;based semiconductors for solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Despite decades of extensive research effort, the dopant selection is still largely dependent on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Machine learning (ML) is promising in providing predictable insights on the dopant selection for high&#8208;performing PEC systems because it can uncover correlations from the seemingly ambiguous linkages between vast features of dopants and the PEC performance of doped photoelectrodes. Herein, the authors successfully build ML model to predict the doping effect of 17 metal dopants into hematite (Fe2O3), a prototype photoelectrode material. Their findings disclose the critical parameters from the 10 intrinsic features of each dopant. The model is further experimentally validated by the coherent prediction on Y and La dopants&#8217; behaviors. Further interpretation of the ML model suggests that the chemical state is the most significant selection criteria, meanwhile, dopants with higher metal&#8211;oxygen bond formation enthalpy and larger ionic radius are favored in improving the charge separation and transfer (CST) in the Fe2O3 photoanodes. The generic feature of this ML guided selection criteria has been further extended to CuO&#8208;based photoelectrodes showing improved CST by alkaline metal ions doping.

         <title>A High Conductivity 1D &#960;&#8211;d Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Efficient Polysulfide Trapping&#8208;Diffusion&#8208;Catalysis in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationally designed multifunctional polysulfide mediators based on a novel 1D &#960;&#8211;d conjugated Ni&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D) are demonstrated as excellent cathode materials in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, realizing the adsorption&#8208;catalysis&#8208;conversion of polysulfides, and thus batteries with exceptional lifespan are delivered.








Abstract
The shuttling behavior and sluggish conversion kinetics of the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS) represent the main obstructions to the practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, a 1D &#960;&#8211;d conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D, is presented as an efficient sulfur host to overcome these limitations. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D is characterized by a remarkable binding strength for trapping soluble LiPS species. Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D also acts as an effective catalyst for S reduction during the discharge process and Li2S oxidation during the charging process. In addition, the delocalization of electrons in the &#960;&#8211;d system of Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D provides a superior electrical conductivity to improve electron transfer. Thus, cathodes based on Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D enable LSBs with excellent performance, for example, impressive cycling stability with over 82% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 3 C, superior rate performance of 575 mAh g&#8722;1 at 8 C, and a high areal capacity of 6.63 mAh cm&#8722;2 under raised sulfur loading of 6.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. The strategies and advantages here demonstrated can be extended to a broader range of &#960;&#8211;d conjugated MOFs materials, which the authors believe have a high potential as sulfur hosts in LSBs.

         <title>Fabrication of Stretchable Superamphiphobic Surfaces with Deformation&#8208;Induced Rearrangeable Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable and durable superamphiphobic surface is fabricated by a simple and low&#8208;cost spray&#8208;coating method. Low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids can easily slide off the surface, even when the tensile strain of the surface is &#8805;225%.








Abstract
Stretchable superamphiphobic surfaces with a high deformation resistance are in demand to achieve liquid&#8208;repellent performance in flexible electronics, artificial skin, and textile dressings. However, it is challenging to make mechanically robust superamphiphobic coatings, which maintain their superliquid repellency in a highly stretched state. Here, a stretchable superamphiphobic surface is reported, on which the microstructures can rearrange during stretching to maintain a stable superamphiphobicity even under a high tensile strain. The surface is prepared by spray&#8208;coating silicone nanofilaments onto a prestretched substrate (e.g., cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;polyisoprene) with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) layer as a binder. After subsequent fluorination, this surface keeps its superamphiphobicity to both water and n&#8208;hexadecane up to the tensile strain of at least 225%. The binding PDMS layer and rearrangeable structures maximize the deformation resistance of the surface during the stretching process. The superamphiphobicity and morphology of the surface are maintained even after 1000 stretch&#8211;release cycles. Taking advantage of the mentioned benefits, a liquid manipulation system is designed, which has the potential for fabricating reusable and low&#8208;cost platforms for biochemical detection and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.

         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;field nanoscopy monitors active and passive tuning of ultranarrow resonances in phononic nanoantennas over a wide spectral range (&#8722;35 cm&#8722;1, being the resonance linewidth &#8776;9 cm&#8722;1). Passive tunability can be realized by tailoring the dielectric environment of nanoantennas made of boron nitride, while reversible in situ tuning of narrow resonances is realized by placing nanoantennas on top of a graphene layer.








Abstract
Optical nanoantennas are of great importance for photonic devices and spectroscopy due to their capability of squeezing light at the nanoscale and enhancing light&#8211;matter interactions. Among them, nanoantennas made of polar crystals supporting phonon polaritons (phononic nanoantennas) exhibit the highest quality factors. This is due to the low optical losses inherent in these materials, which, however, hinder the spectral tuning of the nanoantennas due to their dielectric nature. Here, active and passive tuning of ultranarrow resonances in phononic nanoantennas is realized over a wide spectral range (&#8776;35 cm&#8722;1, being the resonance linewidth &#8776;9 cm&#8722;1), monitored by near&#8208;field nanoscopy. To do that, the local environment of a single nanoantenna made of hexagonal boron nitride is modified by placing it on different polar substrates, such as quartz and 4H&#8208;silicon carbide, or covering it with layers of a high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index van der Waals crystal (WSe2). Importantly, active tuning of the nanoantenna polaritonic resonances is demonstrated by placing it on top of a gated graphene monolayer in which the Fermi energy is varied. This work presents the realization of tunable polaritonic nanoantennas with ultranarrow resonances, which can find applications in active nanooptics and (bio)sensing.

         <dc:description>
A stretchable microneedle&#8208;based extended gate field effect transistor for minimally invasive detection of sodium in the interstitial fluids and for real&#8208;time health monitoring is reported. The device exhibits excellent biocompatibility, and on&#8208;body mechanical stability and enables transfer of data via Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things platforms.








Abstract
Sodium is a prominent prognostic biomarker for assessing health status, such as dysnatremia. As of now, detection and monitoring of sodium levels in the human body is carried out by means of laborious and bulky laboratory equipmentand/or by offline analysis of various body fluids. Herein, an innovative stretchable, skin&#8208;conformal and fast&#8208;response microneedle extended&#8208;gate FET biosensor is reported for real&#8208;time detection of sodium in interstitial fluids for minimally invasive health monitoring along with high sensitivity, low limit of detection, excellent biocompatibility, and on&#8208;body mechanical stability. The integration of the reported device with a wireless&#8208;data transmitter and the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things cloud for real&#8208;time monitoring and long&#8208;term analysis is reported and discussed. This platform would eventually help bringing unlimited possibilities for effecient medical care and accurate clinical decision&#8208;making.

         <title>High Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution via Strong Built&#8208;In Electric Field Induced by High Crystallinity of Perylene Imide Supramolecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline perylene imide supramolecular photocatalyst (PDI&#8208;NH) is successfully constructed via &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding. The PDI&#8208;NH performs a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), exceeding most of photocatalysts. The high crystallinity of PDI&#8208;NH ensures the built&#8208;in electric field, acting as a kinetic force to promote the charge separation.








Abstract
A highly crystalline perylene imide supramolecular photocatalyst (PDI&#8208;NH) is synthesized via imidazole solvent method. The catalyst shows a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) with apparent quantum yield of 10.4% at 400&#160;nm, which is 1353 times higher than the low crystalline PDI&#8208;NH. The highly crystalline structure comes from the ordered self&#8208;assembly process in molten imidazole solvent via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding. Further, the excellent performance ascribes to the robust built&#8208;in electric field induced by its high crystallinity, which greatly accelerates the charge separation and transfer. What is more, the PDI&#8208;NH is quite stable and can be reused over 50 h without performance attenuation. Briefly, the crystalline PDI&#8208;NH with strong built&#8208;in electric field throws light on photocatalytic oxygen evolution, showing a new perspective for the design of organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass Anode with an Exceptional Cycling&#8208;Induced Capacity Enhancement for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZIF glass (melt&#8208;quench Co ZIF&#8208;62 glass), for the first time, is evaluated as anode for high performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This ZIF glass anode exhibits an unusual capacity enhancement during charge&#8208;discharge cycling. This exceptional phenomenon is related to the unique structure of ZIF glass, e.g., short&#8208;range disorder.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise as high&#8208;energy anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their tunable chemistry, pore structure and abundant reaction sites. However, the pore structure of crystalline MOFs tends to collapse during lithium&#8208;ion insertion and extraction, and hence, their electrochemical performances are rather limited. As a critical breakthrough, a MOF glass anode for LIBs has been developed in the present work. In detail, it is fabricated by melt&#8208;quenching Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 (Co(Im)1.75(bIm)0.25) to glass, and then by combining glass with carbon black and binder. The derived anode exhibits high lithium storage capacity (306 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at of 2 A g&#8722;1), outstanding cycling stability, and superior rate performance compared with the crystalline Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 and the amorphous one prepared by high&#8208;energy ball&#8208;milling. Importantly, it is found that the Li&#8208;ion storage capacity of the MOF glass anode continuously rises with charge&#8211;discharge cycling and even tripled after 1000 cycles. Combined spectroscopic and structural analyses, along with density functional theory calculations, reveal the origin of the cycling&#8208;induced enhancement of the performances of the MOF glass anode, that is, the increased distortion and local breakage of the Co&#63743;N coordination bonds making the Li&#8208;ion intercalation sites more accessible.

         <title>A Minimalist Binary Vaccine Carrier for Personalized Postoperative Cancer Vaccine Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of minimalist vaccine carriers based on azole molecules&#8208;modified branched polyethylenimine is reported, which orchestrates the innate stimulating activity and antigen cross&#8208;presentation processes in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and achieves impressive personalized vaccine therapy results with the thus prepared binary vaccine.








Abstract
In recent years, significant evolutions have been made in applying nanotechnologies for prophylactic and therapeutic cancer vaccine design. However, the clinical translation of nanovaccines is still limited owing to their complicated compositions and difficulties in the spatiotemporal coordination of antigen&#8208;presenting cell activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation. Herein, a minimalist binary nanovaccine (BiVax) is designed that integrates innate stimulating activity into the carrier to elicit robust antitumor immunity. The authors started by making a series of azole molecules end&#8208;capped polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;M), and were&#160;surprised to find that over 60% of the PEI&#8208;M polymers have innate stimulating activity via activation of the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. PEI&#8208;4BImi, a PEI&#8208;M obtained from a series of polymers, elicits robust antitumor immune responses when used as a subcutaneously injected nanovaccine by simply mixing with ovalbumin antigens, and this BiVax system performs much better than the traditional ternary vaccine system, as well as, commercialized aluminum&#8208;containing adjuvants. This system also enables the fast preparation of personalized BiVax by compositing PEI&#8208;4BImi with autologous tumor cell membrane protein antigens, and a 60% postoperative cure rate is observed when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, significant evolutions have been made in applying nanotechnologies for prophylactic and therapeutic cancer vaccine design. However, the clinical translation of nanovaccines is still limited owing to their complicated compositions and difficulties in the spatiotemporal coordination of antigen-presenting cell activation and antigen cross-presentation. Herein, a minimalist binary nanovaccine (BiVax) is designed that integrates innate stimulating activity into the carrier to elicit robust antitumor immunity. The authors started by making a series of azole molecules end-capped polyethylenimine (PEI-M), and were&#160;surprised to find that over 60% of the PEI-M polymers have innate stimulating activity via activation of the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. PEI-4BImi, a PEI-M obtained from a series of polymers, elicits robust antitumor immune responses when used as a subcutaneously injected nanovaccine by simply mixing with ovalbumin antigens, and this BiVax system performs much better than the traditional ternary vaccine system, as well as, commercialized aluminum-containing adjuvants. This system also enables the fast preparation of personalized BiVax by compositing PEI-4BImi with autologous tumor cell membrane protein antigens, and a 60% postoperative cure rate is observed when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fully Synthetic 3D Fibrous Scaffolds for Stromal Tissues&#8212;Replacement of Animal&#8208;Derived Scaffold Materials Demonstrated by Multilayered Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of electrospun fibers and extensive amounts of porogens maximize the porosity of sub&#8208;micrometer fibrous scaffolds. The ensemble of loose fiber networks and appropriately sized pores enable the infiltration with stromal cells and the transformation to biological tissues. Thereby, the limitations of animal&#8208;derived scaffolds like decellularized tissues and hydrogels for tissue engineering applications or advanced therapy medicinal products are overcome.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) of soft tissues in vivo has remarkable biological and structural properties. Thereby, the ECM provides mechanical stability while it still can be rearranged via cellular remodeling during tissue maturation or healing processes. However, modern synthetic alternatives fail to provide these key features among basic properties. Synthetic matrices are usually completely degraded or are inert regarding cellular remodeling. Based on a refined electrospinning process, a method is developed to generate synthetic scaffolds with highly porous fibrous structures and enhanced fiber&#8208;to&#8208;fiber distances. Since this approach allows for cell migration, matrix remodeling, and ECM synthesis, the scaffold provides an ideal platform for the generation of soft tissue equivalents. Using this matrix, an electrospun&#8208;based multilayered skin equivalent composed of a stratified epidermis, a dermal compartment, and a subcutis is able to be generated without the use of animal matrix components. The extension of classical dense electrospun scaffolds with high porosities and motile fibers generates a fully synthetic and defined alternative to collagen&#8208;gel&#8208;based tissue models and is a promising system for the construction of tissue equivalents as in vitro models or in vivo implants.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Blind ZnMgO Colloidal Quantum Dot Downconverters Expand Silicon CMOS Sensors Spectral Coverage into Ultraviolet and Enable UV&#8208;Band Discrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nontoxic, visible&#8208;blind quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based downconverting thin&#8208;film technology that offers a ninefold enhancement in the UV sensitivity of a silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor sensor without deteriorating its performance in the visible and near&#8208;infrared is reported. Additionally, a tandem stack of such QDs is reported, which enables UV&#8208;band discrimination in a cost effective and facile manner.








Abstract
Selective spectral detection of ultraviolet (UV) radiation is highly important across numerous fields from health and safety to industrial and environmental monitoring applications. Herein, a nontoxic, visible&#8208;blind, quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based sensing scheme that expands the spectral coverage of silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) sensors into the UV, enabling efficient UV detection without affecting the sensor performance in the visible and UV&#8208;band discrimination, is reported. This scheme uses zinc magnesium oxide (ZnMgO) QDs with compositionally tunable absorption across UV and high photoluminescence quantum yield in the visible. The efficient luminescence and large Stokes shift of these QDs are exploited herein to act as an efficient downconverting material that enhances the UV sensitivity of Si&#8208;photodetectors (Si&#8208;PDs). A Si&#8208;PD integrated with the QDs results in a ninefold improvement in photoresponsivity from 0.83 to 7.5&#160;mA W&#8722;1 at 260&#160;nm. Leveraging the tunability of these QDs, a simple UV&#8208;band identification scheme is further reported, which uses two distinct&#8208;bandgap ZnMgO QDs stacked in a tandem architecture whose spectral emission color depends on the UV&#8208;band excitation light. The downconverting stack enables facile discrimination of UV light using a standard CMOS image sensor (camera) or by the naked eye and avoids the use of complex optics.

         <title>Synergistic Disruption of Metabolic Homeostasis through Hyperbranched Poly(ethylene glycol) Conjugates as Nanotherapeutics to Constrain Cancer Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanotherapeutic is presented for combination therapy through controllable co&#8208;delivery of doxorubicin and pyropheophorbide&#8208;a using nanoparticles (HP&#8208;PD NPs) co&#8208;assembled from two hyperbranched polymer&#8208;based conjugates (HP&#8208;P and HP&#8208;D). The demonstrated tumor suppression effect can result from the reduced protein translation due to disruption of metabolic homeostasis as evidenced by metabolic variations.








Abstract
Combination therapy is a promising approach for effective treatment of tumors through synergistically regulating pathways. However, the synergistic effect is limited, likely by uncontrolled co&#8208;delivery of different therapeutic payloads in a single nanoparticle. Herein, a combination nanotherapeutic is developed by using two amphiphilic conjugates, hyperbranched poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (Ppa) (HP&#8208;P) and hyperbranched poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;doxorubicin (DOX) (HP&#8208;D) to construct co&#8208;assembly nanoparticles (HP&#8208;PD NPs) for controllably co&#8208;loading and co&#8208;delivering Ppa and DOX. In vitro and in vivo antitumor studies confirm the synergistic effect of photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy from HP&#8208;PD NPs. Metabolic variations reveal that tumor suppression is associated with disruption of metabolic homeostasis, leading to reduced protein translation. This study uncovers the manipulation of metabolic changes in tumor cells through disruption of cellular homeostasis using HP&#8208;PD NPs and provides a new insight into the rational design of synergistic nanotherapeutics for combination therapy.

         <title>Treatment of Ruptured and Nonruptured Aneurysms Using a Semisolid Iodinated Embolic Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel semisolid gel embolization agent is presented to achieve instant occlusion of saccular aneurysms. This approach is&#160;developed, optimized, and tested in vitro, in 3D models, in vivo in rat and in porcine arterial aneurysms. Most importantly, in ruptured porcine aneurysms causing catastrophic bleeding, the gel embolic material is able to achieve instant hemostasis in survival experiments.








Abstract
Saccular aneurysms (SAs) are focal outpouchings from the lateral wall of an artery. Depending on their morphology and location, minimally invasive treatment options include coil embolization, flow diverter stents, stent&#8208;assisted coiling, and liquid embolics. Many drawbacks are associated with these treatment options including recanalization, delayed healing, rebleeding, malpositioning of the embolic or stent, stent stenosis, and even rupture of the SA. To overcome these drawbacks, a nanoclay&#8208;based shear&#8208;thinning hydrogel (STH) is&#160;developed for the endovascular treatment of SAs. Extensive in vitro testing is&#160;performed to optimize STH performance, visualization, injectability, and endothelialization in cell culture. Femoral artery saccular aneurysm models in rats and in pigs are&#160;created to test stability, efficacy, immune response, endothelialization, and biocompatibility of STH in both ruptured and unruptured SA. Fluoroscopy and computed tomography imaging consistently confirmed SA occlusion without recanalization, migration, or nontarget embolization; STH is&#160;also shown to outperform coil embolization of porcine aneurysms. In pigs with catastrophic bleeding due to SA rupture, STH is&#160;able to achieve instant hemostasis rescuing the pigs in long&#8208;term survival experiments. STH is a promising semisolid iodinated embolic agent that can change the standard of medical practice and potentially save lives.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Efficient Sequential Drug Delivery of Biomimetic Nanosystem for Multimodal Chemo&#8208;, Antiangiogenic, and Anti&#8208;MDSC Therapy in Melanoma</title>

         <dc:description>
The biomimetic DS@HLipo targets the tumor site, where near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;induced membrane permeation triggers the &#8220;ultrafast&#8221; and &#8220;thorough&#8221; release of sunitinib for both antiangiogenic therapy and anti&#8208;MDSC immunotherapy. The liberated doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded small&#8208;sized polymeric nanoparticles (DOX&#8208;NP) from the liposomes can then be more easily ingested by tumor cells for improved immunogenic chemotherapy.








Abstract
In view of the multiple pathological hallmarks of tumors, nanosystems for the sequential delivery of various drugs whose targets are separately located inside and outside tumor cells are desired for improved cancer therapy. However, current sequential delivery is mainly achieved through enzyme&#8208; or acid&#8208;dependent degradation of the nanocarrier, which would be influenced by the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, and unloading efficiency of the drug acting on the target outside tumor cells is usually unsatisfactory. Here, a light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy based on a liposomal formulation of doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded small&#8208;sized polymeric nanoparticles (DOX&#8208;NP) and free sunitinib in the aqueous cavity, is developed. The liposomal membrane is doped with photosensitizer porphyrin&#8211;phospholipid (PoP) and hybridized with red blood cell membrane to confer biomimetic features. Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;induced membrane permeabilization triggers the &#8220;ultrafast&#8221; and &#8220;thorough&#8221; release of sunitinib (100% release in 5&#160;min) for antiangiogenic therapy and also myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cell (MDSC) inhibition to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor environment. Subsequently, the small&#8208;sized DOX&#8208;NP liberated from the liposomes is more easily uptaken by tumor cells for improved immunogenic chemotherapy. RNA sequencing and immune&#8208;related assay indicates therapeutic immune enhancement. This light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy demonstrates the potency in cancer multimodal therapy against multiple targets in different spatial positions in tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Modulating Tumor Extracellular Matrix by Simultaneous Inhibition of Two Cancer Cell Receptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneously blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor and integrin pathways with recombinant protein&#8208;drug conjugates treatment improves the tumor accumulation and cellular internalization of drug through regulating the F&#8208;actin content in cancer cells and extracellular matrix in the tumor environments as well as the physical environment of tumors, leading to an improved tumor therapy compared to free drug.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in fundamental cellular processes and pathological progression of many diseases. While most research and current knowledge focuses on the processes of biological and mechanical changes in ECM signaling residing cancer cells to respond, little is known of the converse&#8211;of how cancer cells initiate the changes of ECM properties. Here, it is reported that blocking the cancer cell signaling leads to disruption of tumor ECM. Using recombinant proteins (RPs) and recombinant protein&#8208;drug conjugates (RPDCs) that simultaneously target both epidermal growth factor receptor and integrin, it is demonstrated that multireceptor&#8208;mediated active modulation of tumor ECM can inhibit and even reverse tumor remodeling of the physiological and structural microenvironment. These results not only provide insights into the regulatory roles of cancer cells in developing a protumoral microenvironment, but also introduce a new therapeutic platform or strategy to treat cancers.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Nanophotonic Structures for High&#8208;Performance SEIRA Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of high&#8208;performance nanophotonic surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) sensor employing liquid gallium as the ground plane of nanopatch antennas is demonstrated. Superior performance for sensing thin analyte films such as monolayer 1&#8208;octadecanethiol is achieved. The developed cost&#8208;effective procedure for realizing such liquid&#8208;gallium&#8208;based nanophotonic SEIRA sensors is suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy can provide label&#8208;free, nondestructive detection and identification of analytes with high sensitivity and specificity, and therefore has been widely used for various sensing applications. SEIRA sensors usually employ resonant nanophotonic structures, which can substantially enhance the electric field and hence light&#8211;matter interactions by orders of magnitude in certain nanoscale hot spots of the devices. However, as ever, smaller hot spots are employed to further enhance the field, the delivery of analytes into such hot spots becomes increasingly challenging. Here, high&#8208;performance nanophotonic SEIRA sensors based on nanopatch antennas with a liquid gallium ground plane are demonstrated, which not only lead to ultrahigh field confinement and enhancement, but also allow for convenient and efficient delivery of analytes into nanometric hot spots by employing a simple procedure suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. The sensors exhibit superior sensitivity in the midinfrared spectral region. Around 10% molecular vibrational signals (i.e., the modulation of a sensor's reflection spectrum owing to the molecular vibrational modes of the analytes) near 2900&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;are achieved from sensing monolayer 1&#8208;octadecanethiol. This cost&#8208;effective and reliable method for realizing liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanophotonic structures provides a new strategy for developing high&#8208;performance sensors and other photonics applications in the infrared region.

         <title>PEG&#8208;Like Brush Polymer Conjugate of RNA Aptamer That Shows Reversible Anticoagulant Activity and Minimal Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a path is offered to rescuing RNA therapeutics from the deleterious immune side effects of PEG that induces life&#8208;threatening hypersensitivity reactions upon reactivity toward PEG antibodies using a next&#8208;generation PEG&#8208;like stealth polymer conjugate technology. These results breathe new life into an established and valuable drug delivery technology facing an impasse.








Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics are an emerging class of drugs. RNA aptamers are of significant therapeutic and clinical interest because their activity can be easily reversed in vivo&#8212;a useful feature that is difficult to achieve using other therapeutic modalities. Despite their therapeutic promise, RNA aptamers are limited by their poor blood circulation. The attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to RNA aptamers addresses this limitation. However, an RNA aptamer&#8208;PEG conjugate that is a reversible anticoagulant fails in a clinical trial due to the reactivity of the conjugate with pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies and has cast a pall over PEGylation of aptamers and other biologics, despite its long history of utility in drug delivery. Here, PEG antibody&#8208;reactivity of this RNA aptamer is eliminated by conjugating it to a next&#8208;generation PEG&#8208;like brush polymer&#8212;poly[(oligoethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate)] (POEGMA). The conjugate retained the drug's therapeutic action and the ability to be easily reversed. Importantly, this conjugate does not bind pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies that are prevalent in humans and does not induce a humoral immune response against the polymer itself in mice. These findings suggest a path to rescuing the PEGylation of RNA therapeutics and vaccines from the deleterious side&#8208;effects of PEG.

         <title>A Universal Ternary&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Ink Strategy toward Efficient Inkjet&#8208;Printed Perovskite Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally&#8208;friendly ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink system with excellent printability and film&#8208;forming ability is tailor&#8208;made for efficient inkjet&#8208;printed perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). A record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% is achieved in inkjet&#8208;printed green perovskite QLEDs for the first time.








Abstract
Toward next&#8208;generation electroluminescent quantum dot (QD) displays, inkjet printing technique has been convinced as one of the most promising low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale manufacturing of patterned quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). The development of high&#8208;quality and stable QD inks is a key step to push this technology toward practical applications. Herein, a universal ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink strategy is proposed for the cesium lead halides (CsPbX3) perovskite QDs and their corresponding inkjet&#8208;printed QLEDs. With this tailor&#8208;made ternary halogen&#8208;free solvent (naphthene, n&#8208;tridecane, and n&#8208;nonane) recipe, a highly dispersive and stable CsPbX3 QD ink is obtained, which exhibits much better printability and film&#8208;forming ability than that of the binary solvent (naphthene and n&#8208;tridecane) system, leading to a much better qualitied perovskite QD thin film. Consequently, a record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% and maximum luminance of 43&#160;883.39&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 is achieved in inkjet&#8208;printed green perovskite QLEDs, which is much higher than that of the binary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system&#8208;based devices (EQE = 2.26%). Moreover, the ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system exhibits a universal applicability in the inkjet&#8208;printed red and blue perovskite QLEDs as well as cadmium (Cd)&#8208;based QLEDs. This work demonstrates a new strategy for tailor&#8208;making a general ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;QD&#8208;ink system for efficient inkjet&#8208;printed QLEDs as well as the other solution&#8208;processed electronic devices in the future.

&lt;p&gt;An environmentally-friendly ternary-solvent-ink system with excellent printability and film-forming ability is tailor-made for efficient inkjet-printed perovskite quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). A record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% is achieved in inkjet-printed green perovskite QLEDs for the first time.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward next-generation electroluminescent quantum dot (QD) displays, inkjet printing technique has been convinced as one of the most promising low-cost and large-scale manufacturing of patterned quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). The development of high-quality and stable QD inks is a key step to push this technology toward practical applications. Herein, a universal ternary-solvent-ink strategy is proposed for the cesium lead halides (CsPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskite QDs and their corresponding inkjet-printed QLEDs. With this tailor-made ternary halogen-free solvent (naphthene, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-tridecane, and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-nonane) recipe, a highly dispersive and stable CsPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QD ink is obtained, which exhibits much better printability and film-forming ability than that of the binary solvent (naphthene and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-tridecane) system, leading to a much better qualitied perovskite QD thin film. Consequently, a record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% and maximum luminance of 43&#160;883.39&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in inkjet-printed green perovskite QLEDs, which is much higher than that of the binary-solvent-system-based devices (EQE = 2.26%). Moreover, the ternary-solvent-system exhibits a universal applicability in the inkjet-printed red and blue perovskite QLEDs as well as cadmium (Cd)-based QLEDs. This work demonstrates a new strategy for tailor-making a general ternary-solvent-QD-ink system for efficient inkjet-printed QLEDs as well as the other solution-processed electronic devices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nonvolatile Ferroelectric&#8208;Domain&#8208;Wall Memory Embedded in a Complex Topological Domain Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prototype memory based on conductive ferroelectric domain&#8208;walls confined in a topological quadrant domain is demonstrated, which exhibits a resistive&#8208;switching characteristic with a large on/off ratio &gt;104&#160;and high readout current, as well as an excellent endurance over 108&#160;cycles and a long retention over 12&#160;days.








Abstract
The discovery and precise manipulation of atomic&#8208;size conductive ferroelectric domain walls offers new opportunities for a wide range of prospective electronic devices, and the emerging field of walltronics. Herein, a highly stable and fatigue&#8208;resistant nonvolatile memory device is demonstrated, which is based on deterministic creation and erasure of conductive domain walls that are geometrically confined in a topological domain structure. By introducing a pair of delicately designed coaxial electrodes onto the epitaxial BiFeO3&#160;film, a center&#8208;type quadrant topological domain with conductive charged domain walls can be easily created. More importantly, reversible switching of the quadrant domain between the convergent state with highly conductive confined walls and the divergent state with insulating confined walls can be realized, resulting in an apparent resistance change with a large on/off ratio of &gt;104&#160;and a technically preferred readout current (up to 40&#160;nA). Owing to restrictions from the clamped quadrant ferroelastic domain, the device exhibits excellent restoration repeatability over 108&#160;cycles and a long retention of over 12&#160;days (&gt;106&#160;s). These results provide a new pathway toward high&#8208;performance ferroelectric&#8208;domain&#8208;wall memory, which may spur extensive interest in exploring the immense potential in the emerging field of walltronics.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance In&#8208;Memory Photodetector Realized by Charge Storage in a van der Waals MISFET</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;memory photodetector is successfully designed based on a WSe2/h&#8208;BN/SiO2 van der Waals heterostructure, which demonstrates not only an ultrahigh photoresponsivity (337.8 A W&#8722;1) but also an extremely long&#8208;term retention (&gt;10 years). Moreover, the working mechanism with charge&#8208;storage effect of the h&#8208;BN/SiO2 structure is proved through a novel in situ optoelectronic electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy analysis.








Abstract
The emerging data&#8208;intensive applications in optoelectronics are driving innovation toward the fused integration of sensing, memory, and computing to break through the restrictions of the von Neumann architecture. However, the present photodetectors with only optoelectronic conversion functions cannot satisfy the growing demands of the multifunctions required in single devices. Here, a novel route for the integration of non&#8208;volatile memory into a photodetector is proposed, with a WSe2/h&#8208;BN van der Waals heterostructure on a Si/SiO2 substrate to realize in&#8208;memory photodetection. This photodetector exhibits an ultrahigh readout photocurrent of 3.4 &#181;A and photoresponsivity of 337.8 A W&#8722;1 in the solar&#8208;blind wavelength region, together with an extended retention time of more than 10 years. Furthermore, the charge&#8208;storage&#8208;based non&#8208;volatile mechanism of h&#8208;BN/SiO2 is successfully proven through a novel analysis of in situ optoelectronic electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy. These results represent a leap forward to future applications and insightful mechanisms of in&#8208;memory photodetection.

         <title>Oxide/ZIF&#8208;8 Hybrid Nanofiber Yarns: Heightened Surface Activity for Exceptional Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional chemiresistive gas sensor composed of nanofiber yarn sputter&#8208;deposited with indium tin oxide (ITO) as a sensing layer is designed, and then coated with zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) for nanofiltration of gas analytes. Through comprehensive sensing experiments and molecular modeling, it is demonstrated that yarn@ITO@ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits highly sensitive and selective sensing properties toward NO at room temperature with accelerated responding speeds.








Abstract
Though highly promising as powerful gas sensors, oxide semiconductor chemiresistors have low surface reactivity, which limits their selectivity, sensitivity, and reaction kinetics, particularly at room temperature (RT) operation. It is proposed that a hybrid design involving the nanostructuring of oxides and passivation with selective gas filtration layers can potentially overcome the issues with surface activity. Herein, unique bi&#8208;stacked heterogeneous layers are introduced; that is, nanostructured oxides covered by conformal nanoporous gas filters, on ultrahigh&#8208;density nanofiber (NF) yarns via sputter deposition with indium tin oxide (ITO) and subsequent self&#8208;assembly of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) nanocrystals. The NF yarn composed of ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;coated ITO films can offer heightened surface activity at RT because of high porosity, large surface area, and effective screening of interfering gases. As a case study, the hybrid sensor demonstrated remarkable sensing performances characterized by high NO selectivity, fast response/recovery kinetics (&gt;60&#8208;fold improvement), and large responses (12.8&#8208;fold improvement @ 1&#160;ppm) in comparison with pristine yarn@ITO, especially under highly humid conditions. Molecular modeling reveals an increased penetration ratio of NO over O2 to the ITO surface, indicating that NO oxidation is reliably prevented and that the secondary adsorption sites provided by the ZIF&#8208;8 facilitate the adsorption/desorption of NO, both to and from ITO.

         <title>A Stiffness&#8208;Switchable, Biomimetic Smart Material Enabled by Supramolecular Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stiffness&#8208;changing biomimetic smart material is developed through a unique water&#8211;ethanol solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;induced supramolecular reconfiguration strategy. The dynamic switchable supramolecular network imparts the material with an interesting self&#8208;regulation behavior in mechanical properties between soft and hard states, self&#8208;healing capability, and excellent formability, which holds great application potential in smart buildings, personal protection devices, soft robots, intelligent devices, and beyond.








Abstract
In nature, stiffness&#8208;changing behavior is essential for living organisms, which, however, is challenging to achieve in synthetic materials.

&lt;p&gt;A stiffness-changing biomimetic smart material is developed through a unique water&#8211;ethanol solvent-exchange-induced supramolecular reconfiguration strategy. The dynamic switchable supramolecular network imparts the material with an interesting self-regulation behavior in mechanical properties between soft and hard states, self-healing capability, and excellent formability, which holds great application potential in smart buildings, personal protection devices, soft robots, intelligent devices, and beyond.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature, stiffness-changing behavior is essential for living organisms, which, however, is challenging to achieve in synthetic materials. Here, a stiffness-changing smart material, through developing interchangeable supramolecular configurations inspired from the dermis of the sea cucumber, which shows extreme, switchable mechanical properties, is reported. In the hydrated state, the material, possessing a stretched, double-stranded supramolecular network, showcases a soft-gel behavior with a low stiffness and high pliability. Upon the stimulation of ethanol to transform into the coiled supramolecular configuration, it self-adjusts to a hard state with nearly 500-times enhanced stiffness from 0.51&#160;to 243.6&#160;MPa, outstanding load-bearing capability (over 35&#160;000&#160;times its own weight), and excellent puncture/impact resistance with a specific impact strength of &#8776;116&#160;kJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (g&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (higher than some metals and alloys such as aluminum, and even comparable to the commercially available protective materials such as D3O and Kevlar). Moreover, this material demonstrates reconfiguration-dependent self-healing behavior and designable formability, holding great promise in advanced engineering fields that require both high-strength durability and good formability.

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Coordinated High&#8208;Performance Moisture Power in Natural Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient sunlight&#8208;coordinated &#8220;moist&#8208;electric generator&#8221; offers a record&#8208;high short&#8208;circuit current density, harvesting multiple sources of moisture and light synchronously, which is available for scalable integration toward portable and wearable power&#8208;supply systems under different real natural conditions, working for lighting and electrically driven objects.








Abstract
It is a challenge to spontaneously harvest multiple clean sources from the environment for upgraded energy&#8208;converting systems. The ubiquitous moisture and sunlight in nature are attractive for sustainable power generation especially. A high&#8208;performance light&#8208;coordinated &#8220;moist&#8208;electric generator&#8221; (LMEG) based on the rational combination of a polyelectrolyte and a phytochrome is herein developed. By spontaneous adsorption of gaseous water molecules and simultaneous exposure to sunlight, a piece of 1 cm2 composite film offers an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.92&#160;V and a considerable short&#8208;circuit current density of up to 1.55&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This record&#8208;high current density is about two orders of magnitude improvement over that of most conventional moisture&#8208;enabled systems, which is caused by moisture&#8208;induced charge separation accompanied with photoexcited carrier migration, as confirmed by a dynamic Monte Carlo device simulation. Flexible devices with customizable size are available for large&#8208;scale integration to effectively work under a wide range of relative humidity (about 20&#8211;100%), temperature (10&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C), and light intensity (30&#8211;200&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). The wearable and portable LMEGs provide ample power supply in natural conditions for indoor and outdoor electricity&#8208;consuming systems. This work opens a novel avenue to develop sustainable power generation through collecting multiple types of natural energy by a single hybrid harvester.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Growth of Amorphous Discharge Products toward an Ultrawide Band Light&#8208;Assisted Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated fast kinetics for an ultrawide band photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 system is developed. The bifunctional Ag/Bi2MoO6 cathode is favorable to promoting the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction kinetics due to the discharge products is amorphous Li2O2. The reaction mechanism is revealed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. 








Abstract
Photoassisted electrochemical reaction is regarded as an effective approach to reduce the overpotential of lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries. However, the achievement of both broadband absorption and long term battery cycling stability are still a formidable challenge. Herein, an oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated fast kinetics for a photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 system is developed with a silver/bismuth molybdate (Ag/Bi2MoO6) hybrid cathode. The cathode can offer both double advantages for light absorption covering UV to visible region and excellent electrochemical activity for O2. Upon discharging, the photoexcited electrons from Ag nanoplate based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are injected into the oxygen vacancy in Bi2MoO6. The fast oxygen reaction kinetics generate the amorphous Li2O2, and the discharge plateau is improved to 3.05&#160;V. Upon charging, the photoexcited holes are capable to decompose amorphous Li2O2 promptly, yielding a very low charge plateau of 3.25&#160;V. A first cycle round&#8208;trip efficiency is 93.8% and retention of 70% over 500 h, which is the longest cycle life ever reported in photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 batteries. This work offers a general and reliable strategy for boosting the electrochemical kinetics by tailoring the crystalline of Li2O2 with wide&#8208;band light.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Programmable Microgel Lasers for Information Encoding and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural responsivity of active biomaterials, laser information encoding is demonstrated by exploiting enzyme&#8208;bioactive hydrogel materials confined in a microcavity. Tunable lasing wavelengths are achieved by manipulating the biological activity and nanostructures in hydrogel droplets. This study represents the first development of a biologically controlled laser for optical information applications.








Abstract
Microscale laser emissions have emerged as a promising approach for information encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting for their feature&#8208;rich spectra and high sensitivity to the surrounding environment. Compared with artificial materials, natural responsive biomaterials enable a higher level of complexity and versatile ways for tailoring optical responses. However, precise control of lasing wavelengths and spatial locations with biomolecules remains a huge challenge. Here, a biologically programmable laser, in which the lasing can be manipulated by biomolecular activities at the nanoscale, is developed. Tunable lasing wavelengths are achieved by exploiting the swelling properties of enzyme&#8208;responsive hydrogel droplets in a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot microcavity. Both experimental and theoretical means demonstrate that inner 3D network structures and external curvature of the hydrogel droplets lead to different lasing thresholds and resonance wavelengths. Finally, inkjet&#8208;printed multiwavelength laser encoding and anti&#8208;counterfeiting are showcased under different scalabilities and environments. Hyperspectral laser images are utilized as an advanced feature for a higher level of security. The biologically encoded laser will provide a new insight into the development of biosynthetic and bioprogrammable laser devices, offering new opportunities for secure communication and smart sensing.

         <title>Synthetic Matrix Scaffolds Engineer the In Vivo Tumor Immune Microenvironment for Immunotherapy Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor growth dynamics and reproducibility of preclinical breast cancer models are improved utilizing a system leveraging synthetic material scaffolds. These scaffolds induce reliable tumor formation and programmable immune infiltration based on composition, enabling enhanced consistency and relevance to human disease. Various immunotherapeutic strategies are tested, revealing differential efficacy based on immune milieu, demonstrating the promise to improve clinical immunotherapy applications.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most powerful anti&#8208;cancer therapies but is stymied by the limits of existing preclinical models with respect to disease latency and reproducibility. Additionally, the influence of differing immune microenvironments within tumors observed clinically and associated with immunotherapeutic resistance cannot be tuned to facilitate drug testing workflows without changing model system or laborious genetic approaches. To address this testing platform gap in the immune oncology drug development pipeline, the authors deploy engineered biomaterials as scaffolds to increase tumor formation rate, decrease disease latency, and diminish variability of immune infiltrates into tumors formed from murine mammary carcinoma cell lines implanted into syngeneic mice. By altering synthetic gel formulations that reshape infiltrating immune cells within the tumor, responsiveness of the same tumor model to varying classes of cancer immunotherapies, including in situ vaccination with a molecular adjuvant and immune checkpoint blockade, diverge. These results demonstrate the significant role the local immune microenvironment plays in immunotherapeutic response. These engineered tumor immune microenvironments therefore improve upon the limitations of current breast tumor models used for immune oncology drug screening to enable immunotherapeutic testing relevant to the variability in tumor immune microenvironments underlying immunotherapeutic resistance seen in human patients.

&lt;p&gt;Tumor growth dynamics and reproducibility of preclinical breast cancer models are improved utilizing a system leveraging synthetic material scaffolds. These scaffolds induce reliable tumor formation and programmable immune infiltration based on composition, enabling enhanced consistency and relevance to human disease. Various immunotherapeutic strategies are tested, revealing differential efficacy based on immune milieu, demonstrating the promise to improve clinical immunotherapy applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most powerful anti-cancer therapies but is stymied by the limits of existing preclinical models with respect to disease latency and reproducibility. Additionally, the influence of differing immune microenvironments within tumors observed clinically and associated with immunotherapeutic resistance cannot be tuned to facilitate drug testing workflows without changing model system or laborious genetic approaches. To address this testing platform gap in the immune oncology drug development pipeline, the authors deploy engineered biomaterials as scaffolds to increase tumor formation rate, decrease disease latency, and diminish variability of immune infiltrates into tumors formed from murine mammary carcinoma cell lines implanted into syngeneic mice. By altering synthetic gel formulations that reshape infiltrating immune cells within the tumor, responsiveness of the same tumor model to varying classes of cancer immunotherapies, including in situ vaccination with a molecular adjuvant and immune checkpoint blockade, diverge. These results demonstrate the significant role the local immune microenvironment plays in immunotherapeutic response. These engineered tumor immune microenvironments therefore improve upon the limitations of current breast tumor models used for immune oncology drug screening to enable immunotherapeutic testing relevant to the variability in tumor immune microenvironments underlying immunotherapeutic resistance seen in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Radiosensitizer&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks Potentiate STING Pathway Activation for Advanced Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiotherapy suffers from high&#8208;dose radiation&#8208;induced systemic toxicity and radioresistance caused by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To overcome these limitations, a novel lanthanide&#8208;doped radiosensitizer&#8208;based metal&#8208;phenolic network is engineered to achieve a synergy of radiosensitization and stimulator of interferon genes pathway activation. This tactic promotes dendritic cell maturation and evokes potent systemic antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy, a mainstay of first&#8208;line cancer treatment, suffers from its high&#8208;dose radiation&#8208;induced systemic toxicity and radioresistance caused by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The synergy between radiosensitization and immunomodulation may overcome these obstacles for advanced radiotherapy. Here, the authors propose a radiosensitization cooperated with stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway activation strategy by fabricating a novel lanthanide&#8208;doped radiosensitizer&#8208;based metal&#8208;phenolic network, NaGdF4:Nd@NaLuF4@PEG&#8208;polyphenol/Mn (DSPM). The amphiphilic PEG&#8208;polyphenol successfully coordinates with NaGdF4:Nd@NaLuF4 (radiosensitizer) and Mn2+ via robust metal&#8208;phenolic coordination. After cell internalization, the pH&#8208;responsive disassembly of DSPM triggers the release of their payloads, wherein radiosensitizer sensitizes cancer cells to X&#8208;ray and Mn2+ promote STING pathway activation. This radiosensitizer&#8208;based DSPM remarkably benefits dendritic cell maturation, anticancer therapeutics in primary tumors, accompanied by robust systemic immune therapeutic performance against metastatic tumors. Therefore, a powerful radiosensitization with STING pathway activation mediated immunostimulation strategy is highlighted here to optimize cancer radiotherapy.

         <title>Assembly of Bioactive Nanoparticles via Metal&#8211;Phenolic Complexation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and tunable strategy is developed to assemble a range of biomacromolecules into bioactive metal&#8211;phenolic nanoparticles (b&#8208;MPN NPs), while retaining the intrinsic activity of the biomacromolecules. The bioactivity of the b&#8208;MPN NPs enables their use in various applications, including cell apoptosis, RNA degradation, cascade reactions, and gene silencing.








Abstract
The integration of bioactive materials (e.g., proteins and genes) into nanoparticles holds promise in fields ranging from catalysis to biomedicine. However, it is challenging to develop a simple and broadly applicable nanoparticle platform that can readily incorporate distinct biomacromolecules without affecting their intrinsic activity. Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic assembly approach is presented whereby diverse functional nanoparticles can be readily assembled in water by combining various synthetic and natural building blocks, including poly(ethylene glycol), phenolic ligands, metal ions, and bioactive macromolecules. The assembly process is primarily mediated by metal&#8211;phenolic complexes through coordination and hydrophobic interactions, which yields uniform and spherical nanoparticles (mostly &lt;200&#160;nm),&#160;while preserving the function of the incorporated biomacromolecules (siRNA and five different proteins used). The functionality of the assembled nanoparticles is demonstrated through cancer cell apoptosis, RNA degradation, catalysis, and gene downregulation studies. Furthermore, the resulting nanoparticles can be used as building blocks for the secondary engineering of superstructures via templating and cross&#8208;linking with metal ions. The bioactivity and versatility of the platform can potentially be used for the streamlined and rational design of future bioactive materials.

         <title>Novel Oligomer Enables Green Solvent Processed 17.5% Ternary Organic Solar Cells: Synergistic Energy Loss Reduction and Morphology Fine&#8208;Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low energy loss ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PM6:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl achieve significantly improved power conversion efficiencies of 17.54% and 17.32% by introducing novel oligomers with higher HOMO level as third&#8208;components, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs by green solvent. The significance of high electroluminescence quantum efficiency is highlighted and new understanding of energy loss mechanisms is provided toward high&#8208;performance, ecofriendly OSCs.








Abstract
The large non&#8208;radiative recombination is the main factor that limits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two novel structurally similar oligomers (named 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT) with D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D and A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration are synthesized for high&#8208;performance ternary OSCs with low energy loss. As third components, these PM6 analogue oligomers effectively suppress the non&#8208;radiative recombination in OSCs. Although the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT are higher than that of PM6, the oligomers enabled ultra&#8208;high electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of 0.05% and improved VOC, indicating suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination overweighs the common belief of deeper HOMO requirement in third component selection. Moreover, the different compatibility of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT with PM6 and BTP&#8208;BO4Cl fine&#8208;tunes the active layer morphology with synergistic effects. The ternary devices based on PM6:5BDTBDD:BTPBO4Cl and PM6:5BDDBDT:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl achieve a significantly improved PCEs of 17.54% and 17.32%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art OSCs processed by green solvent of o&#8208;xylene. The strategy using novel oligomer as third component also has very wide composition tolerance in ternary OSCs. This is the first work that demonstrates novel structurally compatible D&#8208;A type oligomers are effective third components, and provides new understanding of synergetic energy loss mechanisms towards high performance OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bioprogrammable Lasers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by natural responsivity of biomaterials, in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202107809"&gt;2107809&lt;/a&gt;, Yu-Cheng Chen and co-workers demonstrate the first laser encoding by exploiting enzymatic hydrogels in a droplet cavity. The cover illustrates tunable lasing wavelengths achieved by manipulating biological activities and 3D networks in a microgel laser array. The biological encoded laser will provide a new insight into the development of bioprogrammable laser devices, offering new opportunities for secure communication and smart sensing.

Porous Fibrous Scaffolds
The dimensions of electrospun fibers are predestined for synthetic replacement of extracellular matrix structures. In article number 2106780, Tobias Weigel and co&#8208;workers generate highly porous electrospun scaffolds, featuring an ensemble of loose fibers and pores of appropriate size to enable applications in engineering animal&#8208;free 3D biomedical tissues. The mechanical properties and structural composition describe a tradeoff between current synthetic porous scaffolds and animal&#8208;derived hydrogels, which are deployed as electrospun&#8208;based multilayered skin equivalents.

Thin Films
When thinning down silicon films toward nanometer thickness, their thermal conductivity decreases dramatically. In article number 2108352, Klaas&#8208;Jan Tielrooij and co&#8208;workers report a combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study that shows that this is not the case for the layered semiconductor MoSe2. For the thinnest MoSe2 films, the decreasing thermal conductivity is compensated by low&#8208;energy, long&#8208;mean&#8208;free&#8208;path heat&#8208;carrying modes. These thin films furthermore exhibit efficient heat dissipation to air molecules.

Multiferroic Materials
In article number 2109144, Jae Hoon Kim, Je&#8208;Geun Park, and co&#8208;workers report a new exciton in multiferroic NiI2, consisting of a 2D triangular lattice. This newly discovered exciton is not only magnetic but also quantum entangled. When an electron and hole combine via a transition between two quantum&#8208;entangled states, it produces a bright reddish light of 1.384 eV.

Endovascular Treatment
In article number 2108266, Rahmi Oklu and co&#8208;workers report an endovascular treatment for ruptured saccular aneurysms. In the cover image, blue represents the catheter inside the artery releasing the shear thinning hydrogel (in yellow) inside the aneurysm sac, rapidly achieving hemostasis. The magnified image of the hydrogel demonstrates its structure, with the dark brown spots indicating iodine. The inset in the lower right demonstrates rapid healing of the aneurysm neck and the fibroinflammatory response to the hydrogel leading the fibrotic replacement of the biomaterial.

Gas Sensors
In article number 2105869, Jihan Kim, Il&#8208;Doo Kim, and co&#8208;workers present a multifunctional chemiresistive gas sensor composed of nanofiber yarn sputter deposited with an oxide sensing layer, and then coated with ZIF&#8208;8 for nanofiltration of gas analytes. Through comprehensive sensing experiments and molecular modeling, they demonstrate that this concept of introducing bistacked oxide/molecular sieve heterostructured layers on the yarn platform guarantees improved surface activity and selective molecular transport in a free&#8208;standing sensor.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Materials: The Turning Point of Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advancement of organic photovoltaics has been significantly aided by the emergence of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) materials, and they are also able to satisfy the varied criteria for various types of organic photovoltaic device architectures. Furthermore, the absorption window is the most fundamental criterion for developing novel NIR organic photoelectric materials.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing organic semiconductors have opened up many exciting opportunities for organic photovoltaic (OPV) research. For example, new chemistries and synthetical methodologies have been developed; especially, the breakthrough Y&#8208;series acceptors, originally invented by our&#160;group, specifically Y1, Y3, and Y6, have contributed immensely to boosting single&#8208;junction solar cell efficiency to around 19%; novel device architectures such as tandem and transparent organic photovoltaics have been realized. The concept of NIR donors/acceptors thus becomes a turning point in the OPV field. Here, the development of NIR&#8208;absorbing materials for OPVs is reviewed. According to the low&#8208;energy absorption window, here, NIR photovoltaic materials (p&#8208;type (polymers) and n&#8208;type (fullerene and nonfullerene)) are classified into four categories: 700&#8211;800 nm, 800&#8211;900 nm, 900&#8211;1000 nm, and greater than 1000&#160;nm. Each subsection covers the design, synthesis, and utilization of various types of donor (D) and acceptor (A) units. The structure&#8211;property relationship between various kinds of D, A units and absorption window are constructed to satisfy requirements for different applications. Subsequently, a variety of applications realized by NIR materials, including transparent OPVs, tandem OPVs, photodetectors, are presented. Finally, challenges and future development of novel NIR materials for the next&#8208;generation organic photovoltaics and beyond are discussed.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Free Click Chemistry: Applications in Drug Delivery, Cell Tracking, and Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;free click chemistry is applicable outside of the laboratory, as it can be used controllably on cell surfaces, in the cytosol, and in living bodies. It is consequently of interest to biomedical researchers, and various new materials have been proposed. They can be categorized as nanoparticles for drug delivery, imaging agents for cell tracking, and hydrogels for tissue engineering.








Abstract
Traditionally, organic chemical reactions require organic solvents, toxic catalysts, heat, or high pressure. However, copper&#8208;free click chemistry has been shown to have favorable reaction rates and orthogonality in water, buffer solutions, and physiological conditions without toxic catalysts. Strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition and inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions are representative of copper&#8208;free click chemistry. Artificial chemical reactions via click chemistry can also be used outside of the laboratory in a controllable manner on live cell surfaces, in the cytosol, and in living bodies. Consequently, copper&#8208;free click chemistry has many features that are of interest in biomedical research, and various new materials and strategies for its use have been proposed. Herein, recent remarkable trials that have used copper&#8208;free click chemistry are described, focusing on their applications in molecular imaging and therapy. The research is categorized as nanoparticles for drug delivery, imaging agents for cell tracking, and hydrogels for tissue engineering, which are rapidly advancing fields based on click chemistry. The content is based primarily on the experience with click chemistry&#8208;based biomaterials over the last 10 years.

         <title>Colloidal Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Nanoplatelets: Thickness&#8208;Controlled Synthesis, Properties, and Application in Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 10, March 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the research progress and challenges associated with thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis, stability, surface passivation, doping, optical (linear and nonlinear) properties of both organic and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid lead and lead&#8208;free halide perovskite nanoplatelets along with recent progress on their application to light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Colloidal metal&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (MHP NCs) are gaining significant attention for a wide range of optoelectronics applications owing to their exciting properties, such as defect tolerance, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and tunable emission across the entire visible wavelength range. Although the optical properties of MHP NCs are easily tunable through their halide composition, they suffer from light&#8208;induced halide phase segregation that limits their use in devices. However, MHPs can be synthesized in the form of colloidal nanoplatelets (NPls) with monolayer (ML)&#8208;level thickness control, exhibiting strong quantum confinement effects, and thus enabling tunable emission across the entire visible wavelength range by controlling the thickness of bromide or iodide&#8208;based lead&#8208;halide perovskite NPls. In addition, the NPls exhibit narrow emission peaks, have high exciton binding energies, and a higher fraction of radiative recombination compared to their bulk counterparts, making them ideal candidates for applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). This review discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in colloidal MHP NPls: synthetic routes, thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis of both organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid and all&#8208;inorganic MHP NPls, their linear and nonlinear optical properties (including charge&#8208;carrier dynamics), and their performance in LEDs. Furthermore, the challenges associated with their thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis, environmental and thermal stability, and their application in making efficient LEDs are discussed.

         <title>Biomimetic Immunosuppressive Exosomes that Inhibit Cytokine Storms Contribute to the Alleviation of Sepsis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sepsis is a disease characterized by multiple organ failure caused by immune hyperactivation and cytokine storms. Studies have shown that the incidence of sepsis in melanoma patients is substantially lower compared to the general population. We also observe that experimental tumor&#8208;bearing animals have high survival rates after sepsis induction, suggesting that tumors may suppress sepsis&#8208;associated immune overactivation, thereby alleviating sepsis. Based on the above&#8208;described findings, we assess whether tumor cells play an antisepsis role in mice through the secretion of exosomes. Analysis of exosome activity reveals that the induced exosomes (iExo) secreted by tumor cells following lipopolysaccharide treatment improve sepsis to a greater extent than normal secretory exosomes (nExo). Further analysis reveals that iExos exert their protective effects mainly through seven key miRNAs. In vitro bionic simulation of exosomes is carried out using exosome mimics generated by loading the aforementioned microRNAs into hyaluronic acid&#8208;polyethylenimine nanoparticles. Exosome mimics at specific miRNA ratios alleviate sepsis in mice and cynomolgus monkeys, indicating that biomimetic simulation of tumor&#8208;suppressive exosomes may represent a promising therapeutic method for the treatment of sepsis and cytokine storm&#8208;related conditions.

         <title>Electrochemically Exfoliated Chlorine&#8208;doped Graphene for Flexible All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors with High Volumetric Energy Density</title>

Abstract
Graphene&#8208;constructed micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) have received considerable attention more recently, as part of the prospective wearable and portable electronics owing to their distinctive merits of well&#8208;tunable power output, robust mechanical flexibility, long cyclability, and wide operating temperature range. In the current work, we focus on the fabrication of high&#8208;quality and solution&#8208;processible chlorine&#8208;doped ultrathin graphene (Cl&#8208;G) nanosheets through a handy yet eco&#8208;friendly electrochemical exfoliation process. The Cl&#8208;G is characteristic of the large lateral size of around 10&#160;&#956;m, abundant nanopores with sizes of as small as 2&#160;nm, as well as numerous steps from the rugged surface. Arising from the rich chemical functionalities and structure defects, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state MSC built by using Cl&#8208;G via a facile mask&#8208;assisted method delivers a large reversible capacity and ultra&#8208;steady charge/discharge performance, with the capacitance being maintained at 98.1% even after 250&#8239;000 cycles. The Cl&#8208;G&#8208;MSC with EMIMBF4/PVDF&#8208;HFP as the electrolyte displays a large volumetric capacitance up to 160 F cm&#8211;3 at the scan rate of 5&#160;mV s&#8211;1 and high volumetric energy density of 97.9&#160;mW h cm&#8211;3 at the power density of 3.4 W cm&#8211;3. The device can also output a high voltage up to 3.5&#160;V and robust capability with 94.8% of capacitance retention upon 10&#8239;000 cycles. The scalable integration of MSCs based on Cl&#8208;G highlights their application potentials in microscale energy storage devices, given the facile and green fabrication process.

&lt;p&gt;Graphene-constructed micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) have received considerable attention more recently, as part of the prospective wearable and portable electronics owing to their distinctive merits of well-tunable power output, robust mechanical flexibility, long cyclability, and wide operating temperature range. In the current work, we focus on the fabrication of high-quality and solution-processible chlorine-doped ultrathin graphene (Cl-G) nanosheets through a handy yet eco-friendly electrochemical exfoliation process.

         <title>Bioinspired Colloidal Photonic Composites: Fabrications and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organisms in nature have evolved unique structural colors and stimuli&#8208;responsive functions for camouflage, warning, and communication over millions of years, which are essential to their survival in harsh conditions. Inspired by these characteristics, colloidal photonic composites (CPCs) composed of colloidal photonic crystals embedded in the polymeric matrix have been artificially prepared and show great promise in applications. This review focuses on the summary of building blocks, i.e., colloidal particles and polymeric matrices, and constructive strategies from the perspective of designing CPCs with robust performance and specific functionality. Furthermore, we also discuss their state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications, including colorful coatings, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence, especially in the field of visualized sensing. Finally, current challenges and potential for future developments in this field are discussed. The purpose of this review is not only to clarify the design principle for artificial CPCs but also to serve as a roadmap for the exploration of next&#8208;generation photonic materials.

         <title>Surface Modification of Two&#8208;Dimensional Photocatalysts for Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials show many particular properties, such as high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, high anisotropic degree, and adjustable chemical functionality. These unique properties in 2D materials have sparked immense interest due to their applications in photocatalytic systems, resulting in significantly enhanced light capture, charge transfer kinetics, and surface reaction. This review first introduces the research progress in 2D photocatalysts based on varied compositions and functions followed by specific surface modification strategies. Fundamental principles focusing on light&#8208;harvesting, charge separation and molecular adsorption/activation in a 2D materials&#8208;based photocatalytic system have been systemically explored. The examples described here detail the use of 2D materials in various photocatalytic energy conversion systems, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, H2O2 production, and organic synthesis. Finally, by elaborating the challenges and possible solutions for developing these 2D materials, we expect to provide some inspiration for the future research of 2D materials used on efficient photocatalytic energy conversions.

         <title>Engineering high strength and super toughness of unfolded structural proteins and their extraordinary anti&#8208;adhesion performance for abdominal hernia repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The utility of unfolded structural proteins with diverse sequences offers multiple potentials to create functional biomaterials. However, it is challenging to overcome their structural defects for the development of biological fibers with a combination of high strength and high toughness. Herein, robust fibers from a recombinant unfolded protein consisting of resilin and supercharged polypeptide were fabricated via wet&#8208;spinning approaches. Particularly, the highly ordered structures induced by supramolecular complexation significantly improved the fiber's mechanical performance. In contrast to chemical fibers with high strength and low toughness (or vice versa), the present fibers demonstrated exceptional high strength and super toughness, showing a breaking strength of &#8764;550&#160;MPa and a toughness of &#8764;250&#160;MJ m&#8211;3, respectively, surpassing many polymer and artificial protein fibers. Remarkably, the outstanding biocompatibility and superior mechanical properties allow the constructed fiber patches for efficient abdominal hernia repair in rat models. In stark contrast to clinical patches, there is no any observed tissue adhesion by this treatment. Therefore, our work provides a new type of engineered protein materials for surgical applications.

         <title>Large Transverse and Longitudinal Magneto&#8208;Thermoelectric Effect in Polycrystalline Nodal&#8208;Line Semimetal Mg3Bi2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological semimetals provide new opportunities for exploring novel thermoelectric phenomena, owing to their exotic and nontrivial electronic structure topology around the Fermi surface. Herein, we report on the discovery of large transverse and longitudinal magneto&#8208;thermoelectric (MTE) effects in Mg3Bi2, which is predicted to be a type&#8208;II nodal&#8208;line semimetal in the absence of spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). The maximum transverse power factor is 2182 &#956;Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;2 at 13.5 K and 6 Tesla. The longitudinal power factor reaches up to 3043 &#956;Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;2, which is 20 times higher than that in a zero&#8208;strength magnetic field and is also comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MTE materials. By compensating the Mg loss in Mg&#8208;rich conditions for tuning the carrier concentration close to intrinsic state, the sample fabricated in this study exhibits a large linear non&#8208;saturating magnetoresistance of 940% under a field of 14 Tesla. Using density functional calculations, we attribute the underlying mechanism to the parent linear&#8208;dispersed nodal&#8208;line electronic structure without SOC and the anisotropic Fermi surface shape with SOC, highlighting the essential role of high carrier mobility and open electron orbits in the moment space. Our work offers a new avenue toward highly efficient MTE materials through defect engineering in polycrystalline topological semimetals.

The maximum transverse power factor is 2182 &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;Wm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 13.5 K and 6 Tesla. The longitudinal power factor reaches up to 3043 &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;Wm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 20 times higher than that in a zero-strength magnetic field and is also comparable to state-of-the-art MTE materials. By compensating the Mg loss in Mg-rich conditions for tuning the carrier concentration close to intrinsic state, the sample fabricated in this study exhibits a large linear non-saturating magnetoresistance of 940% under a field of 14 Tesla. Using density functional calculations, we attribute the underlying mechanism to the parent linear-dispersed nodal-line electronic structure without SOC and the anisotropic Fermi surface shape with SOC, highlighting the essential role of high carrier mobility and open electron orbits in the moment space. Our work offers a new avenue toward highly efficient MTE materials through defect engineering in polycrystalline topological semimetals.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mesoporous single&#8208;crystal lithium titanate enabling fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries</title>

Abstract
There remain significant challenges in developing fast&#8208;charging materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to sluggish ion diffusion kinetics and unfavorable electrolyte mass transportation in battery electrodes. In this work, we report a mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline lithium titanate (MSC&#8208;LTO) microrod that can realize exceptional fast charge/discharge performance and excellent long&#8208;term stability in LIBs. The MSC&#8208;LTO microrods are featured with a single&#8208;crystalline structure and interconnected pores inside the entire single&#8208;crystalline body. These features not only shorten the lithium&#8208;ion diffusion distance but also allow for the penetration of electrolytes into the single&#8208;crystalline interior during battery cycling. Hence, the MSC&#8208;LTO microrods exhibit unprecedentedly high rate capability, achieving a specific discharge capacity of &#8764;174 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, which is very close to its theoretical capacity, and &#8764;169 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 C. More importantly, the porous single&#8208;crystalline microrods greatly mitigate the structure degradation during a long&#8208;term cycling test, offering &#8764;92% of the initial capacity after 10,000 cycles at 20 C. This work presents a novel strategy to engineer porous single&#8208;crystalline materials and paves a new venue for developing fast&#8208;charging materials for LIBs.

         <title>Nanoscale Faceting and Ligand Shell Structure Dominate the Self&#8208;Assembly of Non&#8208;Polar Nanoparticles into Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanoscale structures at liquid&#8208;solid interfaces occurs in a broad range of industrial processes and is found in various phenomena in nature. Conventional theory assumes spherical particles and homogeneous surfaces, but that model is oversimplified, and nanoscale in&#8208;situ observations are needed for a more complete understanding. We used liquid phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;STEM) to examine the interactions that direct the self&#8208;assembly of superlattices formed by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in non&#8208;polar liquids. Varying the molecular coating of the substrate modulated short&#8208;ranged attraction and led to switching between a range of different geometric structures including hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp), simple hexagonal (sh), dodecahedral quasi&#8208;crystal (dqc), and body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) lattices, as well as random distributions. Langevin dynamics simulations explain the experimental results in terms of the interplay between nanoparticle faceting, ligand shell structure, and substrate&#8208;NP&#8208;interactions.

         <title>Recent Structural Engineering of Polymer Semiconductors Incorporating Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Highly planar, extended &#960;&#8208;electron organic conjugated polymers have been increasingly attractive for achieving high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors. In addition to the conventional strategy to construct rigid backbone by covalent bonds, hydrogen bond has been employed extensively to increase the planarity and rigidity of polymer via intramolecular noncovalent interactions. This review provides a general summary of high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers incorporating hydrogen bonds in field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) over recent years. The structural engineering of the hydrogen bond&#8208;containing building blocks and the discussion of theoretical simulation, microstructural characterization, and device performance are covered. Additionally, the effects of the introduction of hydrogen bond on self&#8208;healing, stretchability, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties are also discussed. The review aims to help and inspire design of new high&#8208;mobility conjugated polymers with superiority of mechanical flexibility by incorporation of hydrogen bond for the application in flexible electronics.

         <title>Mobile Phone Flashlight Excited Red Afterglow Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence materials with ultralong lifetime possess the remarkable advantage in bioimaging for elimination of background noise by characteristic time scale. However, most of RTP luminogens need to be excited by the harmful UV lamp, and exhibit green or yellow emission with shallow tissue penetration, constraining the in vivo bioimaging for further application in clinical diagnosis and pathological study. In this text, the much safer excitation process by sunlight and mobile phone flashlight is realized by organic luminogens with various electronic pull&#8208;push systems. Moreover, the bright red RTP emission with lifetime up to 344&#160;ms is achieved by optimizing molecular geometry and electronic property. Especially, the mobile phone flashlight excited red afterglow imaging of lymph nodes in living mice has been realized for the first time, affording a safe and conventional approach to achieve the afterglow imaging of living mice with deep issue penetration and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Affords Sustainable Plastics with Ultrahigh Robustness and Water&#8208;assisted Arbitrarily Shape Engineering</title>

Abstract
Herein, we introduce the supramolecular plastic&#8208;like hydrogel (SPH) as a platform to fabricate sustainable plastics with ultrahigh stiffness and strength as well as water&#8208;assisted arbitrarily shapeable capability. The transparent plastics are constructed from SPHs of cellulose ether/polycarboxylic acid complexes and demonstrate mechanical robustness with Young's modulus up to 3.4&#160;GPa and tensile strength up to 124.0&#160;MPa, superior or comparable to most common plastics. Meanwhile, the shape of the plastics can be reversibly engineered by air drying of the SPHs with diverse 2D/3D shapes and structures, which are generated conveniently via origami, kirigami, embossing, etc., in virtue of plastic deformation and shape memory effect of SPHs. On the basis of multi&#8208;dimensional infrared&#8208;spectral analysis, it is revealed that the dense acid&#8208;acid and acid&#8208;ether H&#8208;bonding network in the plastic is responsible for the mechanical robustness while the evolution of water&#8208;polymer H&#8208;bonds into polymer&#8208;polymer H&#8208;bonds during air drying contributes to the shape fixing. This work provides a novel method of manufacturing sustainable plastics with simultaneous strong mechanical performance and convenient processibility from hydrogels with plastic&#8208;like mechanical behavior.

High&#8208;entroy (HE) electrocatalysts are becoming the research hotspot due to their interesting &#8220;Cocktail Effect&#8221; and great potential for tailored catalytic properties. However, it is still a great challenge to illustrate their inherent catalytic mechanism for &#8220;Cocktail Effect&#8221;, and there is also a paucity of quantitative descriptors to characterize the specific catalytic activity and give logical design stratiges for HE systems. Herein we first report unexpected activation of all metal sites in HE Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe&#8208;Ag&#8208;Mo (oxy)hydroxides for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and find that metal&#8208;oxygen d&#8208;p hybridization as an effective descriptor can indicate the intrinsic activity of each metal site. According to the quantitative hybridizaiton, introducing electrons donor (e.g., Ag) is raised and verified to reinforce the electrocatalytic activity of HE system. Consequently, we construct Ag&#8208;decorated Co&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8208;Ag&#8208;Mo (oxy)hydroxide (Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH) electrocatalysts by an electrochemical reconstruction method and their OER performances are thoroughly characterized. The Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH is verified with a low overpotential (270&#160;mV at 100&#160;mA/cm2) and a small Tafel slope (35.3&#160;mV/dec) as well as good electrochemical stability. The favorable activity of electrons donor and underlying synergistic &#8220;Cocktail Effect&#8221; are demonstrated and disclosed. Our work opens up a new strategy to guide the design/fabricaiton of advanced HE electrocatalysts.

         <title>Chemical Passivation Stabilizes Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) are an attractive option for grid scale energy storage, which vital to the integration of renewable energy resources with the electric energy infrastructure. The cycling stability of aqueous ZIBs is determined by the electrochemical reversibility of Zn anode, which is often deteriorated by its corrosion and dendritic Zn deposition. Here, we demonstrate a simple and rapid surface passivation strategy that can drastically improve the cycling stability of Zn anodes. For example, a dip in KMnO4 solution readily forms a continuous, conformal and robust protective layer on the native Zn surface, leading to more uniform plating/stripping process, increased corrosion resistance and tolerance to manufacturing and processing defects on Zn metal electrodes. The Zn electrode cycling stabilities at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 are extended by about 40 times. In full battery tests in the configuration of Zn||&#946;&#8208;MnO2, the full cell with passivated Zn anode exhibited a capacity retention of 68.7% after 300 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g&#8722;1, while the cell with untreated Zn anode could only retain 7.4% of capacity under the same conditions.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Defective and Porous Ir Metallene with Polyallylamine for Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The design of defects and porous structures into metallene with functional surfaces is highly desired to improve its permeability, surface area and active sites, but remains a great challenge. In this work, polyallylamine encapsulated Ir metallene with defects and porous structure (Ir@PAH metallene) is easily fabricated by a one&#8208;step wet chemical reduction method. The Ir@PAH metallene exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with an overpotential of only 14&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, a low Tafel slope of 31.2&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, and almost no activity decay after stability test. The abundant defects and pores as well as several&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer nanosheet structures of Ir@PAH metallene provide a large specific surface area, high conductivity and efficient mass transport/diffusion. In addition, surface&#8208;functionalized PAH molecules can modulate the electronic structure through strong Ir&#8208;N interaction and act as proton carriers to capture hydrogen ions, which is very beneficial for HER in acidic media. This work provides a useful strategy for the synthesis of the defective and porous metallene with functionalized surfaces for various catalytic applications.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Fe Catalysts for Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions: Roles of Different N Species</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Recognizing and controlling the structure&#8208;activity relationships of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is vital for manipulating their catalytic properties for various practical applications. Herein, we report Fe SACs supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (SA&#8208;Fe/CN), which show high catalytic reactivity (97% degradation of bisphenol A in only 5&#160;min), high stability (80% of reactivity maintained after five runs), and wide pH suitability (working pH range 3&#8211;11) toward Fenton&#8208;like reactions. We further explored the roles of different N species in these reactions, both experimentally and theoretically. We discovered that graphitic N is an adsorptive site for the target molecule, pyrrolic N coordinates with Fe(III) and plays a dominant role in the reaction, and pyridinic N, coordinated with Fe(II), is only a minor contributor to the reactivity of SA&#8208;Fe/CN. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that a lower d&#8208;band center location of pyrrolic&#8208;type Fe sites leads to the easy generation of Fe&#8208;oxo intermediates, and thus, excellent catalytic properties.

         <title>Protein&#8208;encoding Free&#8208;standing RNA Hydrogel for Sub&#8208;compartmentalized Translation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
RNA can self&#8208;fold into complex structures that can serve as major biological regulators in protein synthesis and in catalysis. Due to the abundance of structural primitives and functional diversity, RNA has been utilized for designing Nature&#8208;defined goals despite its intrinsic chemical instability and lack of technologies. Here, a robust, free&#8208;standing RNA hydrogel was developed through a sequential process involving both ligation and rolling circle transcription to form RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes, capable of both catalytic activity and enhancing expression of several proteins in sub&#8208;compartmentalized, phase&#8208;separated translation environments. Our observations suggest that this hydrogel will expand RNA research and impact practical RNA principles and applications.

         <title>Stabilization of Metastable Halide Perovskite Lattices in the 2D Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size effects of metastability in halide perovskites, especially the phase stabilization in the 2D limit due to the dominance of surface effects, are critically reviewed. This stabilization allows the incorporation of various A&#8208;cations that deemed oversized for 3D perovskites into the 2D perovskite lattices, which provide new insights on how the A&#8208;cations influence the structural, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric properties.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites constitute a new class of semiconductors that are structurally tailorable, exhibiting rich structural polymorphs. In this perspective, the polymorphism in lead halide perovskites is described&#8212;a material system currently used for high&#8208;performance photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Strategies for stabilizing the metastable perovskite polymorphs based on crystal size reduction and surface functionalization are critically reviewed. Focus is on an unprecedented stabilization of metastable perovskite lattices in the 2D limit (e.g., with a thickness down to a few unit cells) due to the dominance of surface effects. This stabilization allows the incorporation of various A&#8208;cations that deemed oversized for 3D perovskites into the 2D perovskite lattices, which bring new insights on the relationships between the crystal structures and optoelectronic properties and lead to emergent ferroelectricity in halide perovskites. A comprehensive understanding is provided on how the A&#8208;cations influence the structural, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric properties, with an emphasis on the second order Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion caused by the oversized A&#8208;cations. Finally, future perspectives on new structure exploration and studies of fundamental photophysical properties using stabilized perovskite lattices are provided.

         <title>Generation and Control of Terahertz Spin Currents in Topology&#8208;Induced 2D Ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2|Bi2Te3 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature 2D ferromagnetism is successfully realized in topological&#8208;insulator&#8208;induced van der Waals Fe3GeTe2, which is evidenced by ultrafast THz emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, the direction of the external magnetic field is rotated and the sample's front surface is reversed to probe the THz radiation symmetry. The results reveal that the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion effect is the dominant THz radiation mechanism.








Abstract
Future information technologies for low&#8208;dissipation quantum computation, high&#8208;speed storage, and on&#8208;chip communication applications require the development of atomically thin, ultracompact, and ultrafast spintronic devices in which information is encoded, stored, and processed using electron spin. Exploring low&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials, designing novel heterostructures, and generating and controlling ultrafast electron spin in 2D magnetism at room temperature, preferably in the unprecedented terahertz (THz) regime, is in high demand. Using THz emission spectroscopy driven by femtosecond laser pulses, optical THz spin&#8208;current bursts at room temperature in the 2D van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) integrated with Bi2Te3 as a topological insulator are successfully realized. The symmetry of the THz radiation is effectively controlled by the optical pumping incidence and external magnetic field directions, indicating that the THz generation mechanism is the inverse Edelstein effect contributed spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. Thickness&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, and structure&#8208;dependent nontrivial THz transients reveal that topology&#8208;enhanced interlayer exchange coupling increases the FGT Curie temperature to room temperature, which provides an effective approach for engineering THz spin&#8208;current pulses. These results contribute to the goal of all&#8208;optical generation, manipulation, and detection of ultrafast THz spin currents in room&#8208;temperature 2D magnetism, accelerating the development of atomically thin high&#8208;speed spintronic devices.

         <title>Photopatternable Porous Separators for Micro&#8208;Electrochemical Energy Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photopatterning of a unique porous separator is demonstrated by modifying the chemistry of SU&#8208;8, an epoxy&#8208;derived photoresist, through the addition of an imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid, which serves as a templating agent. The photopatternable SU&#8208;8&#160;separator exhibits good electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical properties, and is integrated and electrochemically validated with nonplanar high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio 3D Li&#8208;ion microbatteries.








Abstract
The miniaturization of electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems, one of the key challenges facing the rapid expansion of the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, has been limited by poor performance of the various energy&#8208;storage components at the micrometer scale. Here, the development of a unique photopatternable porous separator that overcomes the electrolyte difficulties involving resistive losses at small dimensions is reported. The separator is based on modifying the chemistry of SU&#8208;8, an epoxy&#8208;derived photoresist, through the addition of a miscible ionic liquid. The ionic liquid serves as a templating agent, which is selectively removed by solution methods, leaving the SU&#8208;8&#160;scaffold whose interconnected porosity provides ion transport from the confined liquid electrolyte. The photopatternable separator exhibits good electrochemical, chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability during the operation of electrochemical devices in both 2D and 3D formats. For the latter, the separator demonstrates the ability to form conformal coatings over 3D structures. The development of the photopatternable separator overcomes the electrolyte issues, which have limited progress in the field of micro&#8208;EES.

         <title>Rapid Identification of DNA Fragments through Direct Sequencing with Electro&#8208;Optical Zero&#8208;Mode Waveguides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for flash sequencing of DNA molecules using single&#8208;molecule real&#8208;time sequencing is proposed. Electro&#8208;optical zero&#8208;mode waveguides are presented, which use voltage to efficiently load ultralow inputs (picogram&#8208;to&#8208;nanogram levels) of various&#8208;sized DNA fragments, followed by their optically guided sequencing in just a few minutes.








Abstract
In contrast to sequence&#8208;specific techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, DNA sequencing does not require prior knowledge of the sample for surveying DNA. However, current sequencing technologies demand high inputs for a suitable library preparation, which typically necessitates DNA amplification, even for single&#8208;molecule sequencing methods. Here, electro&#8208;optical zero&#8208;mode waveguides (eZMWs) are presented, which can load DNA into the confinement of zero&#8208;mode waveguides with high efficiency and negligible DNA fragment length bias. Using eZMWs, highly efficient voltage&#8208;induced loading of DNA fragments of various sizes from ultralow inputs (nanogram&#8208;to&#8208;picogram levels) is observed. Rapid DNA fragment identification is demonstrated by burst sequencing of short and long DNA molecules (260 and 20&#160;000&#160;bp) loaded from an equimolar picomolar&#8208;level concentration mixture in just a few minutes. The device allows further studies in which low&#8208;input DNA capture is essential, for example, in epigenetics, where native DNA is required for obtaining modified base information.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Insensitive Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaics by Bulk Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bulk&#8208;heterojunction strategy is developed to reduce the temperature sensitivity of inorganic perovskite solar cells to operation temperature, which may shed light on extending the application of perovskite solar cells for specific scenarios such as polar regions, near space, and exoplanet exploration.








Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) emerge as an ideal candidate for applications beyond terrestrial implementation due to their robustness. However, underlying mechanisms regarding their photovoltaic process at different temperatures remain unclear. Based on a stable absorber of CsPbI2.85(BrCl)0.15, considerable variation of corresponding device performance is revealed over temperature and further demonstrates a simple approach to an effective reduction of such variation. Interestingly, this absorber is found to be excitonic with poor carrier transport even at an ambient temperature of 285 K and below. With a novel device configuration of a PTB7&#8208;th/perovskite bulk heterojunction, exciton dissociation and carrier extraction is facilitated. The resultant solar cell attains a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.2% with the fill factor of &#8776;84%, which represents the highest&#8208;efficiency &#947;&#8208;phase IPSCs reported to date. Importantly, this device is less sensitive to operation temperature, wherein the PCE variation over the temperature range from 210 to 360 K is 60% suppressed compared with the reference. The approach is effectively extended to other IPSCs with different photoactive phases, which may shed light on realizing highly efficient IPSCs for specific scenarios such as polar regions, near&#8208;space, and exoplanet exploration.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Memristors Based on Ultrathin 2D Copper Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of ultrathin 2D copper chalcogenides with intrinsic memristive properties is synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy. The fabricated memristors exhibit relatively small switching voltage, fast switching speed, high switching uniformity, and wide operating temperature range, as well as stable retention and switching characteristics, indicating their tangible applications in future electronics.








Abstract
Copper chalcogenides represent a class of materials with unique crystal structures, high electrical conductivity, and earth abundance, and are recognized as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation green electronics. However, their 2D structures and the corresponding electronic properties have rarely been touched. Herein, a series of ultrathin copper chalcogenide nanosheets with thicknesses down to two unit cells are successfully synthesized, including layered Cu2Te, as well as nonlayered CuSe and Cu9S5, via van der Waals epitaxy, and their nonvolatile memristive behavior is investigated for the first time. Benefiting from the highly active Cu ions with low migration barriers, the memristors based on ultrathin 2D copper chalcogenide crystals exhibit relatively small switching voltage (&#8776;0.4&#160;V), fast switching speed, high switching uniformity, and wide operating temperature range (from 80 to 420 K), as well as stable retention and good cyclic endurance.

     alt="High-Performance Memristors Based on Ultrathin 2D Copper Chalcogenides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A class of ultrathin 2D copper chalcogenides with intrinsic memristive properties is synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy. The fabricated memristors exhibit relatively small switching voltage, fast switching speed, high switching uniformity, and wide operating temperature range, as well as stable retention and switching characteristics, indicating their tangible applications in future electronics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper chalcogenides represent a class of materials with unique crystal structures, high electrical conductivity, and earth abundance, and are recognized as promising candidates for next-generation green electronics. However, their 2D structures and the corresponding electronic properties have rarely been touched. Herein, a series of ultrathin copper chalcogenide nanosheets with thicknesses down to two unit cells are successfully synthesized, including layered Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te, as well as nonlayered CuSe and Cu&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, via van der Waals epitaxy, and their nonvolatile memristive behavior is investigated for the first time. Benefiting from the highly active Cu ions with low migration barriers, the memristors based on ultrathin 2D copper chalcogenide crystals exhibit relatively small switching voltage (&#8776;0.4&#160;V), fast switching speed, high switching uniformity, and wide operating temperature range (from 80 to 420 K), as well as stable retention and good cyclic endurance. These results demonstrate their tangible applications in future low-power, cryogenic, and high temperature harsh electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intracellular Self&#8208;Immolative Polyprodrug with Near&#8208;Infrared Light Guided Accumulation and in Vivo Visualization of Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intracellular self&#8208;immolative polyprodrug (PMTO) is developed, wherein the drug accumulation in tumor is significantly enhanced under laser&#8208;triggered mild hyperthermia, and the drug release behavior is real&#8208;time monitored by ratiometric photoacoustic signals. PMTO holds great potential for enhanced targeted chemotherapy efficacy as well as the visualization of drug release in vivo, guiding the clinical medication in cancer treatment.








Abstract
The selective accumulation and real&#8208;time monitoring of drug release at tumor site are the key bottlenecks to the clinical translation of polyprodrug. Herein, an intracellular self&#8208;immolative polyprodrug (PMTO) is exploited, which not only shows the enhanced cellular internalization and selective accumulation in tumor site under the mild hyperthermia triggered by laser irradiation, but also possesses the self&#8208;monitoring drug release ability in vivo. The polyprodrug amphiphiles are synthesized by sequential esterification reaction, and hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) serves as blocking agent. On account of the mild hyperthermia produced by PMTO under the laser irradiation at tumor site, the cell membranous permeability increases, resulting in the enhanced cellular internalization and drug accumulation in tumor. After internalized by cells, the self&#8208;immolative PMTO nanoparticles can release free mitoxantrone (MTO) in intracellular reductive environment, and ratiometric photoacoustic imaging based on distinct signals between MTO and PMTO is presented to trace the drug release in vivo. Finally, this self&#8208;monitoring polyprodrug presents significant tumor suppression efficacy, which exhibits great potential for guiding the clinical medication in cancer treatment.

         <title>Enabling Anionic Redox Stability of P2&#8208;Na5/6Li1/4Mn3/4O2 by Mg Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substitution strategy of partial occupation of the Na&#8208;site by Mg ions in Na0.773Li0.25Mn0.75O2 not only reduces the chemical potential energy of oxygen but also reduces the undercoordinated oxygen, the nonbonded, and electron&#8208;deficient O2p states, thus enhancing the stability of oxygen anodic redox upon long&#8208;term cycling.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;based anionic redox reactions have recently emerged as a lever to increase the capacity of Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes in addition to the charge compensation based on cationic redox reactions for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, the irreversibility of anionic redox often aggravates irreversible structure change and poor cycling performance. Here, a stable anionic redox is achieved through substituting Na ions by Mg ions in P2&#8208;type Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mg substitution effectively decreases the oxygen chemical potential, causing an improvement in lattice oxygen stability. Moreover, at a highly desodiated state, Mg ions that remain in the lattice and interact with O 2p orbitals can decrease the undercoordinated oxygen and the nonbonded, electron&#8208;deficient O 2p states, facilitating the reversibility of oxygen redox. When cycled in the voltage range of 2.6&#8211;4.5&#160;V where only anionic redox occurs for charge compensation, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 presents a much better reversibility, giving a 4 times better cycle stability than that of Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Experimentally, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 exhibits a &#8776;1.1% volume expansion during sodium insertion/extraction, suggestive of a &#8220;zero&#8208;strain&#8221; cathode. Overall, the work opens a new avenue for enhancing anionic reversibility of oxygen&#8208;related Mn&#8208;rich cathodes.

         <title>Replicating the Cynandra opis Butterfly's Structural Color for Bioinspired Bigrating Color Filters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking inspiration from the unique structures found in the wings of the butterfly Cynandra opis, two&#8208;photon photolithography is used to fabricate bigrating nanostructures, whose optical properties may be controlled by variation of the height and period of the grating features. It is demonstrated that by tuning the grating period a structural color palette array can be printed and used as an artificial structural color device optimized for technological applications.








Abstract
Multilayer grating structures, such as those found on the wings of the butterfly Cynandra opis, are able to interact with light to generate structural coloration. When illuminated and viewed at defined angles, such structural color is characterized by exceptional purity and brightness. To provide further insight into the mechanism of structural coloration, two&#8208;photon laser lithography is used to fabricate bioinspired bigrating nanostructures, whose optical properties may be controlled by variation of the height and period of the grating features. Through the use of both spectral measurements and finite&#8208;element method simulations, herein specific feature dimensions are identified that due to the combined effects of multilayer interference and diffraction generate excellent spectral characteristics and high color purity over the entire visible range. Additionally, it is demonstrated that variation of feature period and/or height plays a central role in controlling both hue and purity. Importantly, such tuneable bigrating structures are of significant utility in color filtering applications.

         <title>Diradical&#8208;Featured Organic Small&#8208;Molecule Photothermal Material with High&#8208;Spin State in Dimers for Ultra&#8208;Broadband Solar Energy Harvesting</title>

         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of the synergetic effect of diradical feature and strong intermolecular interactions, a stable croconium derivative, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T, with high&#8208;spin state and ultra&#8208;broadband absorption covering 300 to 2000&#160;nm in the aggregated state is obtained. CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T demonstrates highly efficient photothermal conversion promoted by multiple nonradiative decay pathways, being a potential candidate for solar thermoelectric generation.








Abstract
Organic materials with radical characteristics are gaining increasing attention, due to their potential implications in highly efficient utilization of solar energy. Manipulating intermolecular interactions is crucial for tuning radical properties, as well as regulating their absorption bands, and thus improving the photothermal conversion efficiency. Herein, a diradical&#8208;featured organic small&#8208;molecule croconium derivative, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T, is reported for highly efficient utilization of solar energy. Upon aggregation, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T exists in dimer form, stabilized by the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and exhibits a rarely reported high&#8208;spin state. Benefiting from the synergic effects of radical characteristics and strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T powder absorbs broadly from 300 to 2000&#160;nm. In&#8208;depth investigations with transient absorption analysis reveal that the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions can promote nonradiative relaxation by accelerating internal conversion and facilitating intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) between dimeric molecules to open up faster internal conversion pathways. Remarkably, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T powder demonstrates a high photothermal efficiency of 79.5% under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. By employing CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T as a solar harvester, a CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T&#8208;loaded flexible self&#8208;healing poly(dimethylsiloxane) (H&#8208;PDMS) film, named as H&#8208;PDMS/CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T self&#8208;healing film, is fabricated and employed for solar&#8211;thermal applications. These findings provide a feasible guideline for developing highly efficient diradical&#8208;featured organic photothermal materials.

Benefiting from the synergic effects of radical characteristics and strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, CR-DPA-T powder absorbs broadly from 300 to 2000&#160;nm. In-depth investigations with transient absorption analysis reveal that the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions can promote nonradiative relaxation by accelerating internal conversion and facilitating intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) between dimeric molecules to open up faster internal conversion pathways. Remarkably, CR-DPA-T powder demonstrates a high photothermal efficiency of 79.5% under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. By employing CR-DPA-T as a solar harvester, a CR-DPA-T-loaded flexible self-healing poly(dimethylsiloxane) (H-PDMS) film, named as H-PDMS/CR-DPA-T self-healing film, is fabricated and employed for solar&#8211;thermal applications. These findings provide a feasible guideline for developing highly efficient diradical-featured organic photothermal materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Endogenous Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Coupled Electrospun Short Fiber via Collecting Wound Exudation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D bionic short&#8208;fiber scaffold with excellent reversible hydroscopicity and biostable conductivity is fabricated to achieve precise tissue remodeling by collecting a large amount of secretions in the early stages of wound healing and transmitting bioelectrical signals to proactively match the cascade reaction of tissue repair.








Abstract
Endogenous electric fields (EF) are the basis of bioelectric signal conduction and the priority signal for damaged tissue regeneration. Tissue exudation directly affects the characteristics of endogenous EF. However, current biomaterials lead to passive repair of defect tissue due to limited management of early wound exudates and inability to actively respond to coupled endogenous EF. Herein, the 3D bionic short&#8208;fiber scaffold with the functions of early biofluid collection, response to coupled endogenous EF, is constructed by guiding the short fibers into a 3D network structure and subsequent multifunctional modification. The scaffold exhibits rapid reversible water absorption, reaching maximum after only 30 s. The stable and uniform distribution of polydopamine&#8208;reduced graphene oxide endows the scaffold with stable electrical and mechanical performances even after long&#8208;term immersion. Due to its unique &#8208; bionic structure and tissue affinity, the scaffold further acts as an &#8220;electronic skin,&#8221; which transmits endogenous bioelectricity via absorbing wound exudates, promoting the treatment of diabetic wounds. Furthermore, under the endogenous EF, the cascade release of vascular endothelial growth factor accelerates the healing process. Thus, the versatile scaffold is expected to be an ideal candidate for repairing different defect tissues, especially electrosensitive tissues.

         <title>Achieving Ultimate Narrowband and Ultrapure Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Polycyclo&#8208;Heteraborin Multi&#8208;Resonance Delayed&#8208;Fluorescence Emitters</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency ultrapure blue delayed&#8208;fluorescence materials are produced by the strategic doping of multiple boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms into the fused polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin &#960;&#8208;system. These new fluorophores allow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes to demonstrate ideal narrowband and ultrapure blue electroluminescence, meeting the requirements for modern ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays.








Abstract
To achieve an ultimate wide color gamut for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays, there is great demand for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) enabling monochromatic, ultrapure blue electroluminescence (EL). Herein, high&#8208;efficiency and ultrapure blue OLEDs based on polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials, BOBO&#8208;Z, BOBS&#8208;Z, and BSBS&#8208;Z, are reported. The key to the design of the present luminophores is the exquisite combination and interplay of multiple boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur heteroatoms embedded in a fused polycyclic &#960;&#8208;system. Comprehensive photophysical and computational investigations of this family of MR&#8208;TADF materials reveal that the systematic implementation of chalcogen (oxygen and sulfur) atoms can finely modulate the emission color while maintaining a narrow bandwidth, as well as the spin&#8208;flipping rates between the excited singlet and triplet states. Consequently, OLEDs based on BOBO&#8208;Z, BOBS&#8208;Z, and BSBS&#8208;Z demonstrate narrowband and ultrapure blue EL emission, with peaks at 445&#8211;463&#160;nm and full width at half maxima of 18&#8211;23&#160;nm, leading to Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage&#8208;y coordinates in the range of 0.04&#8211;0.08. Particularly, for OLEDs incorporating sulfur&#8208;doped BOBS&#8208;Z and BSBS&#8208;Z, notably high maximum external EL quantum efficiencies of 26.9% and 26.8%, respectively, and small efficiency roll&#8208;offs are achieved concurrently.

         <title>Supramolecular Reinforcement of Polymer&#8211;Nanoparticle Hydrogels for Modular Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin&#8208;based supramolecular binding enhances the viscoelastic properties of polymer&#8211;nanoparticle hydrogels and provides modular exchange of building blocks. This paradigm expands the interactions available for the formation of this class of injectable nanocomposite hydrogels, enabling unique applications in 3D printing, magnetic materials, and conductive hydrogels.








Abstract
Moldable hydrogels are increasingly used as injectable or extrudable materials in biomedical and industrial applications owing to their ability to flow under applied stress (shear&#8208;thin) and reform a stable network (self&#8208;heal). Nanoscale components can be added to dynamic polymer networks to modify their mechanical properties and broaden the scope of applications. Viscoelastic polymer&#8211;nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels comprise a versatile and tunable class of dynamic nanocomposite materials that form via reversible interactions between polymer chains and nanoparticles. However, PNP hydrogel formation is restricted to specific interactions between select polymers and nanoparticles, resulting in a limited range of mechanical properties and constraining their utility. Here, a facile strategy to reinforce PNP hydrogels through the simple addition of &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) to the formulation is introduced. The formation of polypseudorotoxanes between &#945;CD and the hydrogel components resulted in a drastic enhancement of the mechanical properties. Furthermore, supramolecular reinforcement of CD&#8211;PNP hydrogels enabled decoupling of the mechanical properties and material functionality. This allows for modular exchange of structural components from a library of functional polymers and nanoparticles. &#945;CD supramolecular binding motifs are leveraged to form CD&#8211;PNP hydrogels with biopolymers for high&#8208;fidelity 3D (bio)printing and drug delivery as well as with inorganic NPs to engineer magnetic or conductive&#160;materials.

         <title>Designing Angstrom&#8208;Scale Asymmetric MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Cavities for High Monovalent Ion Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of ion&#8208;selective membrane that possesses an asymmetrical bi&#8208;layer of functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF) with heterostructured connections between the two MOFs is introduced. The membrane consists of natural asymmetrical nanochannels that exhibit both extraordinary high ionic current rectification and high monovalent ion selectivity.








Abstract
Biological ion channels feature angstrom&#8208;scale asymmetrical cavity structures, which are the key to achieving highly efficient separation and sensing of alkali metal ions from aqueous resources. The clean energy future and lithium&#8208;based energy storage systems heavily rely on highly efficient ionic separations. However, artificial recreation of such a sophisticated biostructure has been technically challenging. Here, a highly tunable design concept is introduced to fabricate monovalent ion&#8208;selective membranes with asymmetric sub&#8208;nanometer pores in which energy barriers are implanted. The energy barriers act against ionic movements, which hold the target ion while facilitating the transport of competing ions. The membrane consists of bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF), possessing a 6 to 3.4&#8208;angstrom passable cavity structure. The ionic current measurements exhibit an unprecedented ionic current rectification ratio of above 100 with exceptionally high selectivity ratios of 84 and 80 for K+/Li+ and Na+/ Li+, respectively (1.14 Li+ mol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1). Furthermore, using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, it is shown that the combined effect of spatial hindrance and nucleophilic entrapment to induce energy surge baffles is responsible for the membrane's ultrahigh selectivity and ion rectification. This work demonstrates a striking advance in developing monovalent ion&#8208;selective channels and has implications in sensing, energy storage, and separation technologies.

         <title>Miniaturized Multispectral Detector Derived from Gradient Response Units on Single MAPbX3 Microwire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optic&#8208;component&#8208;free miniaturized multispectral detector with response&#8208;modulated photodetector units on gradient bandgap MAPbX3 microwire is fabricated to detect and discriminate incident light from 450 to 790&#160;nm, with 25&#160;nm resolution. This work will push multispectral detectors to universal application and provide guidance for forthcoming research in novel functional perovskite devices.








Abstract
Miniaturized multispectral detectors are urgently desired given the unprecedented prosperity of smart optoelectronic chips for integrated functions including communication, imaging, scientific analysis, etc. However, multispectral detectors require complicated prism optics or interference/interferometric filters for spectral recognition, which hampers the miniaturization and their subsequent integration in photonic integrated circuits. In this work, inspired by the advance of computational imaging, optical&#8208;component&#8208;free miniaturized multispectral detector on 4&#160;mm gradient bandgap MAPbX3 microwire with a diameter of 30&#160;&#181;m, is reported. With accurate composition engineering, halide ions in MAPbX3 microwire vary from Cl to I giving in the gradual variation of optical bandgap from 2.96 to 1.68&#160;eV along axis. The sensing units on MAPbX3 microwire offer the response edge ranging from 450 to 790&#160;nm with the responsivity over 20&#160;mA W&#8722;1, &#8722;3dB&#160;width over 450&#160;Hz, LDR of &#8776;60&#160;dB, and a noise current less than &#8776;1.4 &#215; 10&#8722;12 A Hz&#8722;0.5. As a result, the derived miniaturized detector achieves the function of multispectral sensing and discrimination with spectral resolution of &#8776;25&#160;nm and mismatch of &#8776;10&#160;nm. Finally, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept colorful imaging is successfully conducted with the miniaturized multispectral detector to further confirm its application in spectral recognition.

         <title>Single&#8208;, Dual&#8208;, Triple, and Quadruple&#8208;Wavelength Surface&#8208;Emitting Lasing in Blue&#8208;Phase Liquid Crystal</title>

A strategy of how to controllably construct a multiwavelength laser, from single&#8208;, dual&#8208;, triple&#8208; to quadruple&#8208;wavelength, in a simple configuration, i.e., a free&#8208;standing blue&#8208;phase liquid crystals film, is presented. The corresponding principle is also investigated.








Abstract
Soft organic lasers with multiwavelength output and high spectral purity are of crucial importance for versatile photonic devices, owing to their monochromaticity, coherence, and high intensity.&#160;However, there remain challenges for the achievement of&#160;surface&#8208;emitting multiwavelength lasing in soft photonic crystals, and the relative mechanisms need to be investigated. Herein, single&#8208;, dual&#8208;, triple&#8208;, and quadruple&#8208;wavelength lasers are successfully achieved in dye&#8208;doped blue&#8208;phase liquid crystal (BPLC) film. The number and wavelength of the lasing peaks can be manipulated by tuning the center of the bandgap, the order parameter of the laser dye, the quality of the resonance cavity, and even the pump energy. For single&#8208;wavelength lasing, &#160;a lasing peak with&#160;an ultranarrow linewidth of 0.04&#160;nm (Q&#8208;factor of 13&#160;454) is achieved. Multiwavelength lasing is attained based on the following aspects: i) the narrow bandgaps of the BPLCs with&#160;full width at half maximum of 14&#8211;20&#160;nm; ii) a laser dye with high gain over a wide wavelength band, having a low&#8208;order parameter in the liquid crystal matrix; iii) appropriate relative positions between the reflection and fluorescence peaks; and iv) the highly ordered crystal lattice of BPLC film. The proposed single&#8208;to&#8208;quadruple&#8208;wavelength surface&#8208;emitting lasers can be employed as coherent light sources for next&#8208;generation optical devices.

         <title>Multifunctional Biomimetic Nanovaccines Based on Photothermal and Weak&#8208;Immunostimulatory Nanoparticulate Cores for the Immunotherapy of Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal porous silicon@Au nanocomposites are used as particular cores to be coated by cancer cell membranes to construct biomimetic nanovaccine with good biosafety. The developed nanovaccine shows a good prophylactic and synergistic photothermal&#8211;immunotherapeutic efficacy on the occurrence, growth, and metastasis of solid tumors, via the recruitment and activation of immune&#8208;related cells to elicit antitumor immunity.








Abstract
An alternative strategy of choosing photothermal and weak&#8208;immunostimulatory porous silicon@Au nanocomposites as particulate cores to prepare a biomimetic nanovaccine is reported to improve its biosafety and immunotherapeutic efficacy for solid tumors. A quantitative analysis method is used to calculate the loading amount of cancer cell membranes onto porous silicon@Au nanocomposites. Assisted with foreign&#8208;body responses, these exogenous nanoparticulate cores with weak immunostimulatory effect can still efficiently deliver cancer cell membranes into dendritic cells to activate them and the downstream antitumor immunity, resulting in no occurrence of solid tumors and the survival of all immunized mice during 55 day observation. In addition, this nanovaccine, as a photothermal therapeutic agent, synergized with additional immunotherapies can significantly inhibit the growth and metastasis of established solid tumors, via the initiation of the antitumor immune responses in the body and the reversion of their immunosuppressive microenvironments. Considering the versatile surface engineering of porous silicon nanoparticles, the strategy developed here is beneficial to construct multifunctional nanovaccines with better biosafety and more diagnosis or therapeutic modalities against the occurrence, recurrence, or metastasis of solid tumors in future clinical practice.

         <title>A Universal Cosolvent Evaporation Strategy Enables Direct Printing of Perovskite Single Crystals for Optoelectronic Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite single crystals (SCs) are grown on&#8208;demand at room temperature and integrated directly onto optoelectronic devices via printing and coating using a scalable cosolvent evaporation (CSE) strategy. The CSE strategy controls supersaturation and suppresses competing nucleation during drying to yield high&#8208;quality SCs of 2D, 3D, lead&#8208;free, and mixed&#8208;ion perovskites with minimal residue.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskite (MHP) single crystals (SCs) are in high demand for a growing number of printed electronic applications due to their superior optoelectronic properties compared to polycrystalline thin films. There is an urgent need to make SC fabrication facile, scalable, and compatible with the printed electronic manufacturing infrastructure. Here, a universal cosolvent evaporation (CSE) strategy is presented by which perovskite SCs and arrays are produced directly on substrates via printing and coating methods within minutes at room temperature from drying droplets. The CSE strategy successfully guides the supersaturation via controlled drying of droplets to suppress all crystallization pathways but one, and is shown to produce SCs of a wide variety of 3D, 2D, and mixed&#8208;cation/halide perovskites with consistency. This approach works with commonly used precursors and solvents, making it universal. Importantly, the SC consumes the precursor in the droplet, which enables the large&#8208;scale fabrication of SC arrays with minimal residue. Direct on&#8208;chip fabrication of 3D and 2D perovskite photodetector devices with outstanding performance is demonstrated. The approach shows that any MHP SC can now be manufactured on substrates using precision printing and scalable, high&#8208;throughput coating methods.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Twist Fibers toward Rotating Microengines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Untethered twist fibers with reversible responsiveness have shown great potential as rotating microengine, of which high torque and high rotational deformation are desirable. Herein, liquid crystal elastomer twist fiber (LCETF) with fixed twisting orientation is developed, demonstrating outstanding rotational performance due to its significant intrinsic deformation. The obtained LCETF can function as a rotating microengine in an electricity generator.








Abstract
Untethered twist fibers do not require end&#8208;anchoring structures to hold their twist orientation and offer simple designs and convenient operation. The reversible responsiveness of these fibers allows them to generate torque and rotational deformation continuously upon the application of external stimuli. The fibers therefore have potential in rotating microengines. In practical applications, high torque and rotational deformation are desirable to meet work capacity requirements. However, the simultaneous endowment of reversible responsiveness and high rotational performance to untethered twist fibers remains a challenge. In this study, a liquid crystal elastomer twist fiber (LCETF) is designed and developed with a fixed twisting alignment of mesogens to provide untethered and reversible responsiveness. Outstanding rotational performance can be achieved when the mesogenic orientation is disrupted through heat triggering. Owing to the significant intrinsic contractile ratio of the LCE material, the rotational deformation of the LCETF can reach 243.6&#176; mm&#8722;1. More importantly, the specific torque can reach 10.1 N m kg&#8722;1, which exceeds previously reported values. In addition, the LCETF can be exploited in a rotating microengine to convert heat into electricity with an induction voltage as high as 9.4&#160;V. This work broadens the applications of LCEs for energy harvesters, micromachines, and soft robots.

         <title>Highly Bright AIE Nanoparticles by Regulating the Substituent of Rhodanine for Precise Early Detection of Atherosclerosis and Drug Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly bright and atherosclerosis (AS)&#8208;targeting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoprobe is designed and synthesized by delicate molecular surgery strategy of AIE luminogen and surface functionalization with anti&#8208;CD47 antibody, which can serve as an effective near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe for early detection of atherosclerotic plaque, studying the progression of AS, and screening of anti&#8208;AS drugs in a precise, sensitive, and rapid manner.








Abstract
Fluorescent probes capable of precise detection of atherosclerosis (AS) at an early stage and fast assessment of anti&#8208;AS drugs in animal level are particularly valuable. Herein, a highly bright aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoprobe is introduced by regulating the substituent of rhodanine for early detection of atherosclerotic plaque and screening of anti&#8208;AS drugs in a precise, sensitive, and rapid manner. With dicyanomethylene&#8208;substituted rhodanine as the electron&#8208;withdrawing unit, the AIE luminogen named TPE&#8208;T&#8208;RCN shows the highest molar extinction coefficient, the largest photoluminescence quantum yield, and the most redshifted absorption/emission spectra simultaneously as compared to the control compounds. The nanoprobes are obtained with an amphiphilic copolymer as the matrix encapsulating TPE&#8208;T&#8208;RCN molecules, which are further surface functionalized with anti&#8208;CD47 antibody for specifically binding to CD47 overexpressed in AS plaques. Such nanoprobes allow efficient recognition of AS plaques at different stages in apolipoprotein E&#8208;deficient (apoE&#8722;/&#8722;) mice, especially for the recognition of early&#8208;stage AS plaques prior to micro&#8208;computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These features impel to apply the nanoprobes in monitoring the therapeutic effects of anti&#8208;AS drugs, providing a powerful tool for anti&#8208;AS drug screening. Their potential use in targeted imaging of human carotid plaque is further demonstrated.

         <title>A Flexible and Degradable Hybrid Mineral as a Plastic Substitute</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biomineralization, a flexible and degradable hybrid mineral (HM), which is dominated by minerals, is constructed by the inorganic ionic polymerization of calcium phosphate ionic oligomers under biomimetic control from organic templates (polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate). The HM shows potential to serve as a plastic substitute owing to its superior mechanical properties and environmental friendliness.








Abstract
The development of environmentally friendly plastics is critical to ensure sustainable development. In contrast to polymer plastics derived from petrochemicals, inorganic minerals, which are the most abundant matter in Earth's crust, are environmentally friendly. However, the brittleness of these minerals limits their applications as plastics. Here, because of the advantages of both biomineralization and inorganic ionic polymerization, the calcium phosphate (CaP, a typical geological and biological mineral) oligomers are used for biomimetic mineralization under the regulation of polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate, resulting in flexible CaP nanofibers with periodic structural defects. The assembly of CaP nanofibers produces a hierarchically structured bulk hybrid mineral (HM), which overcomes the intrinsic brittleness of minerals and exhibits plasticity characteristics. HM exhibits better hardness and thermostability than classical polymer plastics due to its dominant mineral composition. Notably, HM is environmentally friendly and degradable in nature, as it can potentially participate in geological cycles, indicating that this material is an optimal plastic substitute. The construction of periodic structural defects within flexible minerals expands the current understanding of materials science.

         <title>A Novel Technique for Controlling Anisotropic Ion Diffusion: Bulk Single&#8208;Crystalline Metallic Silicon Clathrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic ion&#8208;diffusion process is developed. This technique can homogeneously extract Na+ from a type&#8208;II Si clathrate regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity by skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force. The synthesis concept behind the technique is expected to expose new exploration areas for thermodynamically metastable materials.








Abstract
Na&#8208;free Si clathrates consisting only of Si cages are an allotrope of diamond&#8208;structured Si. This material is promising for various device applications, such as next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. The probable technique for synthesizing Na&#8208;free Si clathrates is to extract Na+ from the Si cages of Na24Si136. Vacuum annealing is presently a well&#8208;known conventional and effective approach for extracting Na. However, this study demonstrates that Na+ cannot be extracted from the surface of a single&#8208;crystalline type&#8208;II metallic Si clathrate (Na24Si136) in areas deeper than 150&#160;&#181;m. Therefore, a novel method is developed to control anisotropic ion diffusion: this is effective for various compounds with a large difference in the bonding strength between their constituent elements, such as Na24Si136 composed of covalent Si cages and weakly trapped Na+. By skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force, Na+ is homogeneously extracted regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity. Additionally, the proposed point defect model is evaluated via density functional theory, and the migration of Na+ between the Si cages is explained. It is expected that the developed experimental and computational techniques would significantly advance material design for synthesizing thermodynamically metastable materials.

         <title>Interface Engineering Between Multi&#8208;Elemental Alloy Nanoparticles and a Carbon Support Toward Stable Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial engineering approach is used to improve the stability (e.g., nanoparticle agglomeration) of multi&#8208;elemental alloy (MEA) nanoparticles on a carbon substrate. MEA&#8211;oxide&#8211;carbon catalysts with a hierarchical structure are synthesized via a high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method. The catalysts show excellent thermal and electrochemical stability, holding great potential for a range of catalytic reactions.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;elemental alloy (MEA) nanoparticles have recently received notable attention owing to their high activity and superior phase stability. Previous syntheses of MEA nanoparticles mainly used carbon as the support, owing to its high surface area, good electrical conductivity, and tunable defective sites. However, the interfacial stability issue, such as nanoparticle agglomeration, remains outstanding due to poor interfacial binding between MEA and carbon. Such a problem often causes performance decay when MEA nanoparticles are used as catalysts, hindering their practical applications. Herein, an interface engineering strategy is developed to synthesize MEA&#8211;oxide&#8211;carbon hierarchical catalysts, where the oxide on carbon helps disperse and stabilize the MEA nanoparticles toward superior thermal and electrochemical stability. Using several MEA compositions (PdRuRh, PtPdIrRuRh, and PdRuRhFeCoNi) and oxides (TiO2 and Cr2O3) as model systems, it is shown that adding the oxide renders superior interfacial stability and therefore excellent catalytic performance. Excellent thermal stability is demonstrated under transmission electron microscopy with in situ heating up to 1023 K, as well as via long&#8208;term cycling (&gt;370 hours) of a Li&#8211;O2 battery as a harsh electrochemical condition to challenge the catalyst stability. This work offers a new route toward constructing efficient and stable catalysts for various applications.

MEA&#8211;oxide&#8211;carbon catalysts with a hierarchical structure are synthesized via a high-temperature thermal-shock method. The catalysts show excellent thermal and electrochemical stability, holding great potential for a range of catalytic reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-elemental alloy (MEA) nanoparticles have recently received notable attention owing to their high activity and superior phase stability. Previous syntheses of MEA nanoparticles mainly used carbon as the support, owing to its high surface area, good electrical conductivity, and tunable defective sites. However, the interfacial stability issue, such as nanoparticle agglomeration, remains outstanding due to poor interfacial binding between MEA and carbon. Such a problem often causes performance decay when MEA nanoparticles are used as catalysts, hindering their practical applications. Herein, an interface engineering strategy is developed to synthesize MEA&#8211;oxide&#8211;carbon hierarchical catalysts, where the oxide on carbon helps disperse and stabilize the MEA nanoparticles toward superior thermal and electrochemical stability. Using several MEA compositions (PdRuRh, PtPdIrRuRh, and PdRuRhFeCoNi) and oxides (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as model systems, it is shown that adding the oxide renders superior interfacial stability and therefore excellent catalytic performance. Excellent thermal stability is demonstrated under transmission electron microscopy with in situ heating up to 1023 K, as well as via long-term cycling (&amp;gt;370 hours) of a Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery as a harsh electrochemical condition to challenge the catalyst stability. This work offers a new route toward constructing efficient and stable catalysts for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanovesicle&#8208;Mediated Targeted Delivery of Immune Checkpoint Blockades to Potentiate Therapeutic Efficacy and Prevent Side Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4 antibody (&#945;CTLA&#8208;4)&#8208;conjugated and tumor antigen (TA)&#8208;loaded nanovesicles derived from dendritic cells can facilitate spatiotemporal delivery of TA and &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 to tumor&#8208;specific T cells. This leads to selective activation of tumor&#8208;reactive T cells, effective inhibition of tumor growth and prevention of immune&#8208;related adverse events, improving the current immune checkpoint blockade therapies.








Abstract
Despite the clinically proven efficacies of immune checkpoint blockades, including anti&#8208;cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4&#160;antibody (&#945;CTLA&#8208;4), the low response rate and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) in cancer patients represent major drawbacks of the therapy. These drawbacks of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;therapy are mainly due to the suboptimal activation of tumor&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and the systemic nonspecific activation of T cells. To overcome such drawbacks, &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;is delivered by dendritic cell&#8208;derived nanovesicles presenting tumor antigens (DCNV&#8208;TAs) that exclusively interact with tumor&#8208;specific T cells, leading to selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific CTLs. Compared to conventional &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;therapy, treatment with &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#8208;conjugated DCNV&#8208;TAs significantly inhibits tumor growth and reduces irAEs in syngeneic tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study demonstrates that the spatiotemporal presentation of both &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;and tumor antigens enables selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific T cells and potentiates the antitumor efficacy of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;without inducing systemic irAEs.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomachinery for Enhancement of Bone Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA&#8211;amorphous calcium phosphate nanomachine that induces extrafibrillar and intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen fibrils and regenerates new bone in a dynamic and programmable manner is developed. This multifunctional nanomachinery is comparable to the function of osteoblasts. The RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines that simulate physiological processes brings new opportunities and challenges to bone tissue engineering.








Abstract
The visionary idea that RNA adopts nonbiological roles in today's nanomaterial world has been nothing short of phenomenal. These RNA molecules have ample chemical functionality and self&#8208;assemble to form distinct nanostructures in response to external stimuli. They may be combined with inorganic materials to produce nanomachines that carry cargo to a target site in a controlled manner and respond dynamically to environmental changes. Comparable to biological cells, programmed RNA nanomachines have the potential to replicate bone healing in vitro. Here, an RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachine is developed, which accomplishes intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar mineralization of collagen scaffolds to mimic bone formation in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulation indicates that noncovalent hydrogen bonding provides the energy source that initiates self&#8208;assembly of these nanomachines. Incorporation of the RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines into collagen scaffolds in vivo creates an osteoinductive microenvironment within a bone defect that is conducive to rapid biomineralization and osteogenesis. Addition of RNA&#8208;degrading enzymes into RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines further creates a stop signal that inhibits unwarranted bone formation in tissues. The potential of RNA in building functional nanostructures has been underestimated in the past. The concept of RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines participating in physiological processes may transform the nanoscopic world of life science.

         <title>Inverse Design of Ferroelectric&#8208;Order in Perovskite Crystal for Self&#8208;Powered Ultraviolet Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered KTa1&#8722;xNbxO3&#160;photodetector is fabricated based on &#8220;inverse&#8208;design&#8221; of the ferroelectric order.








Abstract
It has always been a hot topic to design an orderly mesoscopic structure in functional materials to tailor the macroscopic properties or realize new functions. The existence of domains in ferroelectric materials has been proven to affect the macroscopic properties, being actively studied in nonlinear optical conversion and piezoelectric effects. However, the high&#8208;efficiency photoelectric conversion capability of ferroelectric crystals has not yet been explored. Here, the authors study the orderly arrangement of ferroelectric order in KTa1&#8722;xNbxO3 (KTN) perovskite crystals, and design the &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; domains by tuning the Curie temperature Tc, thereby generating abundant charged domain walls and robust conductive channels for electrons and holes. An ultrahigh ultraviolet photoresponsivity is achieved in the KTN crystal under zero bias voltage, being about four orders magnitude higher than that of the well&#8208;known ferroelectric materials. The substantial improvement can be attributed to the judiciously designed ferroelectric order, as demonstrated by the conductive atomic force microscopy. In addition, KTN detector exhibits high stability and reliability after high&#8208;temperature and fatigue treatment. KTN crystal features giant photoresponsivity, high electric&#8211;optical coefficient, and large &#967;(2) nonlinearity concurrently, indicating its great potential for application of all&#8208;optical devices on photonic chips.

         <title>Record&#8208;High Superconductivity in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Emerged in Compressed 2H&#8208;TaS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;Tc superconducting state emerges in 2H&#8208;TaS2 under high pressure. The Tc enhances rapidly and reaches a maximum of &#8776;16.4 K at &#8776;157.4&#160;GPa, which sets a new record for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). It is the first time this remarkable superconducting state has been found in TMDs. The result brings a new broad perspective on layered materials.








Abstract
Pressure has always been an effective method for uncovering novel phenomena and properties in condensed matter physics. Here, an electrical transport study is carried on 2H&#8208;TaS2 up to &#8776;208&#160;GPa, and an unexpected superconducting state (SC&#8208;II) emerging around 86.1&#160;GPa with an initial critical temperature (Tc) of 9.6 K is found. As pressure increases, the Tc enhances rapidly and reaches a maximum of 16.4 K at 157.4&#160;GPa, which sets a new record for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The original superconducting state (SC&#8208;I) is found to be re&#8208;enhanced above 100&#160;GPa after the recession around 10&#160;GPa, and coexists with SC&#8208;II to the highest pressure applied in this work. In situ high&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction and Hall effect measurements reveal that the occurrence of SC&#8208;II is accompanied by a structural modification and a concurrent enhancement of hole carrier density. The new high&#8208;Tc superconducting state in 2H&#8208;TaS2 can be attributed to the change of the electronic states near the Fermi surface, owing to pressure&#8208;induced interlayer modulation. It is the first time finding this remarkable superconducting state in TMDs, which not only brings a new broad of perspective on layered materials but also expands the field of pressure&#8208;modified superconductivity.

&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; enhances rapidly and reaches a maximum of 16.4 K at 157.4&#160;GPa, which sets a new record for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The original superconducting state (SC-I) is found to be re-enhanced above 100&#160;GPa after the recession around 10&#160;GPa, and coexists with SC-II to the highest pressure applied in this work. In situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction and Hall effect measurements reveal that the occurrence of SC-II is accompanied by a structural modification and a concurrent enhancement of hole carrier density. The new high-&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconducting state in 2H-TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be attributed to the change of the electronic states near the Fermi surface, owing to pressure-induced interlayer modulation. It is the first time finding this remarkable superconducting state in TMDs, which not only brings a new broad of perspective on layered materials but also expands the field of pressure-modified superconductivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Programmable Dual&#8208;Regime Spray for Large&#8208;Scale and Custom&#8208;Designed Electronic Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable dual&#8208;regime spray that enables direct writing of custom electronic textiles (e&#8208;textiles) into stretch fabrics or garments over meter scale is introduced. The e&#8208;textiles tightly fit various body sizes and shapes of large animals to support reliable monitoring of health data under ambulatory conditions in a wirelessly controlled fashion.








Abstract
Increasing demand for wearable healthcare synergistically advances the field of electronic textiles, or e&#8208;textiles, allowing for ambulatory monitoring of vital health signals. Despite great promise, the pragmatic deployment of e&#8208;textiles in clinical practice remains challenged due to the lack of a method in producing custom&#8208;designed e&#8208;textiles at high spatial resolution across a large area. To this end, a programmable dual&#8208;regime spray that enables the direct custom writing of functional nanoparticles into arbitrary fabrics at sub&#8208;millimeter resolution over meter scale is employed. The resulting e&#8208;textiles retain the intrinsic fabric properties in terms of mechanical flexibility, water&#8208;vapor permeability, and comfort against multiple uses and laundry cycles. The e&#8208;textiles tightly fit various body sizes and shapes to support the high&#8208;fidelity recording of physiological and electrophysiological signals on the skin under ambulatory conditions. Pilot field tests in a remote health&#8208;monitoring setting with a large animal, such as a horse, demonstrate the scalability and utility of the e&#8208;textiles beyond conventional devices. This approach will be suitable for the rapid prototyping of custom e&#8208;textiles tailored to meet various clinical needs.

         <title>Orchestrated Yolk&#8211;Shell Nanohybrids Regulate Macrophage Polarization and Dendritic Cell Maturation for Oncotherapy with Augmented Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;designed yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids Fe3O4@C/MnO2&#8208;PGEA with intrinsic immunomodulatory effects are constructed to realize oncotherapy with augmented antitumor immunity through regulating macrophage polarization and dendritic cell maturation.








Abstract
The protumoral and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments greatly limit the antitumor immune responses of nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy. Here, the intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of orchestrated nanoparticles and their ability to simultaneously trigger tumor antigen release, thereby reversing immunosuppression and achieving potent antitumor immunity and augmented cancer therapy, are explored. By optimizing both the composition and morphology, a facile strategy is proposed to construct yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids (Fe3O4@C/MnO2&#8208;PGEA, FCMP). The intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of FCMP are utilized to reprogram macrophages to M1 phenotype and induce the maturation of dendritic cells. In addition, the chemical, magnetic, and optical properties of FCMP contribute to amplified immunogenic cell death induced by multiaugmented chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and synergistic tumor treatment. Taking advantage of the unique yolk&#8211;shell structure, accurate T1&#8208;T2 dual&#8208;mode magnetic resonance imaging can be realized and CDT can be maximized through sufficient exposure of both the Fe3O4 core and MnO2 shell. Potent antitumor effects are found to substantially inhibit the growth of both primary and distant tumors. Furthermore, the strategy can be extended to the synthesis of other yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids with tailored properties. This work establishes a novel strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional nanoplatforms with yolk&#8208;shell structure for effective cancer therapy with immunomodulation&#8208;enhanced antitumor immunity.

         <title>Surfaces Decorated with Enantiomorphically Pure Polymer Nanohelices via Hierarchical Chirality Transfer across Multiple Length Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;templated approach to prepare nanohelices of chiral parylene polymers on surfaces with tunable length, pitch, and higher&#8208;order mesoscale morphologies by altering the chirality of the template and/or the precursor is described. A phenomenon of chirality transfer from molecular to mesoscale level takes places during chemical vapor deposition, allowing for detection of weak chiral signals on such surfaces.








Abstract
Mesoscale chiral materials are prepared by lithographic methods, assembly of chiral building blocks, and through syntheses in the presence of polarized light. Typically, these processes result in micrometer&#8208;sized structures, require complex top&#8211;down manipulation, or rely on tedious asymmetric separation. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization of chiral precursors into supported films of liquid crystals (LCs) are discovered to result in superhierarchical arrangements of enantiomorphically pure nanofibers. Depending on the molecular chirality of the 1&#8208;hydroxyethyl [2.2]paracyclophane precursor, extended arrays of enantiomorphic nanohelices are formed from achiral nematic templates. Arrays of chiral nanohelices extend over hundreds of micrometers and consistently display enantiomorphic micropatterns. The pitch of individual nanohelices depends on the enantiomeric excess and the purity of the chiral precursor, consistent with the theoretical model of a doubly twisted LC director configuration. During CVD of chiral precursors into cholesteric LC films, aspects of molecular and mesoscale asymmetry combine constructively to form regularly twisted nanohelices. Enantiomorphic surfaces permit the tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, such as the asymmetric induction of weak chiral systems.

         <title>Artificial Nacre with High Toughness Amplification Factor: Residual Stress&#8208;Engineering Sparks Enhanced Extrinsic Toughening Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work illustrates an anti&#8208;intuitive strategy that, with the merit of biomimetic designs, residual stress that is conventionally harmful to ceramics can inversely help improve the fracture toughness of biomimetic ceramics through nanoscale residual stress&#8208;induced platelet strengthening. This provides new insights into the design principles of nacre&#8208;like materials at the bottom level.








Abstract
The high fracture toughness of mollusk nacre is predominantly attributed to the structure&#8208;associated extrinsic mechanisms such as platelet sliding and crack deflection. While the nacre&#8208;mimetic structures are widely adopted in artificial ceramics, the extrinsic mechanisms are often weakened by the relatively low tensile strength of the platelets with a large aspect ratio, which makes the fracture toughness of these materials much lower than expected. Here, it is demonstrated that the fracture toughness of artificial nacre materials with high inorganic contents can be improved by residual stress&#8208;induced platelet strengthening, which can catalyze more effective extrinsic toughening mechanisms that are specific to the nacre&#8208;mimetic structures. Thereby, while the absolute fracture toughness of the materials is not comparable with advanced ceramic&#8208;based composites, the toughness amplification factor of the material reaches 16.1&#160;&#177; 1.1, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomimetic ceramics. The results reveal that, with the merit of nacre&#8208;mimetic structural designs, the overall fracture toughness of the artificial nacre can be improved by the platelet strengthening through extrinsic toughening mechanisms, although the intrinsic fracture toughness may decrease at platelet level due to the strengthening. It is anticipated that advanced structural ceramics with exceeding performance can be fabricated through these unconventional strategies.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Free, Low&#8208;Temperature Crystallization of Stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerosol&#8208;assisted crystallization method to prepare high&#8208;quality, pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films at only 100&#160;&#176;C without chemical additives is reported. Remarkably improved phase stability of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films and their applications in solar cells are demonstrated. The overriding mechanism of stabilizing &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is shown to be relaxation of residual tensile strains in the films.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) is attractive for photovoltaic devices due to its optimal bandgap at around 1.45&#160;eV and improved thermal stability compared with methylammonium&#8208;based perovskites. Crystallization of phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 conventionally requires high&#8208;temperature thermal annealing at 150&#160;&#176;C whilst the obtained &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is metastable at room temperature. Here, aerosol&#8208;assisted crystallization (AAC) is reported, which converts yellow &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 into black &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at only 100&#160;&#176;C using precursor solutions containing only lead iodide and formamidinium iodide with no chemical additives. The obtained &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 exhibits remarkably enhanced stability compared to the 150&#160;&#176;C annealed counterparts, in combination with improvements in film crystallinity and photoluminescence yield. Using X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray scattering, and density functional theory simulation, it is identified that relaxation of residual tensile strains, achieved through the lower annealing temperature and post&#8208;crystallization crystal growth during AAC, is the key factor that facilitates the formation of phase&#8208;stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This overcomes the strain&#8208;induced lattice expansion that is known to cause the metastability of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Accordingly, pure FAPbI3 p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells are reported, facilitated by the low&#8208;temperature (&#8804;100&#160;&#176;C) AAC processing, which demonstrates increases of both power conversion efficiency and operational stability compared to devices fabricated using 150&#160;&#176;C annealed films.

         <title>Boosting Reversibility and Stability of Li Storage in SnO2&#8211;Mo Multilayers: Introduction of Interfacial Oxygen Redistribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In assembled SnO2&#8211;Mo multilayers with adjustable interfaces and tunable oxygen distribution, the regulating effect of the SnO2/Mo interfaces on the stability and reversibility of conversion between SnO2 and Sn/Li2O is quantified. Mo/SnO2/Mo with boosted charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, realizes a breakthrough performance with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.6% and large capacity of 1067 mA h g&#8722;1 retaining &#8776;100% after 700 cycles.








Abstract
Among the promising high&#8208;capacity anode materials, SnO2 represents a classic and important candidate that involves both conversion and alloying reactions toward Li storage. However, the inferior reversibility of conversion reactions usually results in low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE, &#8776;60%), small reversible capacity, and poor cycling stability. Here, it is demonstrated that by carefully designing the interface structure of SnO2&#8211;Mo, a breakthrough comprehensive performance with ultrahigh average ICE of 92.6%, large capacity of 1067 mA h g&#8722;1, and 100% capacity retention after 700 cycles can be realized in a multilayer Mo/SnO2/Mo electrode. Furthermore, high capacity retentions are also achieved in pouch&#8208;type Mo/SnO2/Mo||Li half cells and Mo/SnO2/Mo||LiFePO4 full cells. The amorphous SnO2/Mo interfaces, which are induced by redistribution of oxygen between SnO2 and Mo, can precisely adjust the reversible capacity and cycling stability of the multilayers, while the stable capacities are parabolic with the interfacial density. Theoretical calculations and in/ex situ investigation reveal that oxygen redistribution in SnO2/Mo heterointerfaces boosts Li&#8208;ion transport kinetics by inducing a built&#8208;in electric field and improves the reaction reversibility of SnO2. This work provides a new understanding of interface&#8211;performance relationship of metal&#8211;oxide hybrid electrodes and pivotal guidance for creating high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A PF6&#8722;&#8208;Permselective Polymer Electrolyte with Anion Solvation Regulation Enabling Long&#8208;Cycle Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PF6&#8722;&#8208;permselective polymer electrolyte with abundant quaternary ammonium motifs, which can facilitate PF6&#8722; desolvation and thus maintain the structural integrity of graphite during cycling, is designed for high&#8208;voltage dual&#8208;ion batteries. Besides, this design philosophy also improves oxidation resistance of electrolyte. Eventually, long&#8208;life 5.4&#160;V&#8208;class dual&#8208;ion batteries with superior Coulombic efficiency (CE) are achieved.








Abstract
Graphitic carbon that allows reversible anion (de)intercalation is a promising cathode material for cost&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;voltage dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs). However, one notorious but overlooked issue is the incomplete interfacial anion desolvation, which not only reduces the oxidative stability of electrolytes, but also results in solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite layers. Here, an &#8220;anion&#8208;permselective&#8221; polymer electrolyte with abundant cationic quaternary ammonium motif is developed to weaken the PF6&#8722;&#8211;solvent interaction and thus facilitates PF6&#8722; desolvation. This strategy significantly inhibits solvent co&#8208;intercalation as well as enhances the oxidation resistance of electrolyte, ensuring the structural integrity of graphite. As a result, the as&#8208;assembled graphite||Li cell achieves a superior cyclability with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.0% (vs 95.7% for baseline electrolyte) and 87.1% capacity retention after 2000 cycles even at a high cutoff potential of 5.4&#160;V versus Li+/Li. Besides, this polymer also forms a robust cathode electrolyte interface, working together to enable a long&#8208;life DIB. This strategy of tuning anion coordination environment provides a promising solution to regulate solvent co&#8208;intercalation chemistry for DIBs.

         <title>Differential Polymer Chain Scission Enables Free&#8208;Standing Microcavity Laser Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of differential polymer chain scission is developed to fabricate free&#8208;standing optical microcavities with high&#8208;quality factors by one&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam direct writing on polymer bilayers. This strategy features high materials compatibility and design flexibility for the free&#8208;standing optical microstructures, which significantly expands the application scope for versatile photonic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Control over material architectures is essential to the performance of photonic devices and systems. Optical isolation of the photonic materials from substrates can significantly enhance their performance but suffers from complicated fabrication processes and limited applications. Here a differential polymer chain scission strategy is proposed to fabricate free&#8208;standing photonic structures based on one&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam direct writing on polymer bilayers (EOB). The polymer molecular mass&#8208;dependent sensitivity to electron beam enables differential patterning of the two layers of polymers, leading to the direct formation of suspended optical microcavities. The EOB technique features high materials compatibility and design flexibility for the optical microcavities, which significantly expands the application scope of the suspended optical microcavities. As well as providing a versatile strategy for building high&#8208;performance photonic materials, the results provide a promising platform for innovative applications of optical microstructures.

         <title>Engineering Metallic Heterostructure Based on Ni3N and 2M&#8208;MoS2 for Alkaline Water Electrolysis with Industry&#8208;Compatible Current Density and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of metallic nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide is designed and fabricated for large&#8208;current alkaline water electrolysis. The constructed water electrolyzer operates at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.644&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;with &#8776;100% current density retention over 300&#160;h, superior to the performance of commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO2 (2.41&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 100&#160;h, 58.2%).








Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis is commercially desirable to realize large&#8208;scale hydrogen production. Although nonprecious catalysts exhibit high electrocatalytic activity at low current density (10&#8211;50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), it is still challenging to achieve industrially&#160;required current density over 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;due to inefficient electron transport and competitive adsorption between hydroxyl and water. Herein, the authors design a novel metallic heterostructure based on nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide (Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2) for extraordinary water electrolysis. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;composite with heterointerface provides two kinds of separated reaction sites to overcome the steric hindrance of competitive hydroxyl/water adsorption. The kinetically decoupled hydroxyl/water adsorption/dissociation and metallic conductivity of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;enable hydrogen production from Ni3N and oxygen evolution from the heterointerface at large current density. The metallic heterostructure is proved to be imperative for the stabilization and activation of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2, which can efficiently regulate the active electronic states of Ni/N atoms around the Fermi&#8208;level through the charge transfer between the active atoms of Ni3N and Mo&#63743;Mo bonds of 2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;to boost overall water splitting. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;incorporated water electrolyzer requires ultralow cell voltage of 1.644&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;with &#8776;100% retention over 300&#160;h, far exceeding the commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO2 (2.41&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 100&#160;h, 58.2%).

         <title>Toward Exotic Layered Materials: 2D Cuprous Iodide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only a few dozen 2D crystals have been successfully prepared, though many more&#8212;including metal iodides&#8212;are predicted to exist. A major reason for this disparity is their instability under ambient conditions. A wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize 2D&#8208;CuI, stabilizing it by graphene encapsulation in a one&#8208;step process, is designed, and its chemical structure is imaged.








Abstract
Heterostructures composed of 2D materials are already opening many new possibilities in such fields of technology as electronics and magnonics, but far more could be achieved if the number and diversity of 2D materials were&#160;increased. So far, only a few dozen 2D crystals have been extracted from materials that exhibit a layered phase in ambient conditions, omitting entirely the large number of layered materials that may exist at other temperatures and pressures. This work demonstrates how such structures can be stabilized in 2D van der Waals (vdw) stacks under room temperature via growing them directly in graphene encapsulation by using graphene oxide as the template material. Specifically, an ambient stable 2D structure of copper and iodine, a material that normally only occurs in layered form at elevated temperatures between 645 and 675&#160;K, is produced. The results establish a simple route to the production of more exotic phases of materials that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to stabilize for experiments in&#160;ambient.

Anisotropic Ion Diffusion
An anisotropic ion diffusion process is developed, as reported by Masaya Fujioka and co&#8208;workers in article number 2106754. This technique can homogeneously extract Na+ from a type&#8208;II Si clathrate regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity, by skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force. The synthesis concept behind the technique is expected to expose new exploration areas for thermodynamically metastable materials.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range&#8208;Ordered Assembly of Micro&#8208;/Nanostructures at Superwetting Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of solution&#8208;processable materials with regulated patterning, dimensions, and orientation lays foundation for the integration of high&#8208;performance devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art assembly methods developed based on superwetting interfaces are overviewed. The confined capillary liquids have been highlighted as a versatile and robust platform for the long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of organic semiconductors, metal&#8208;halide perovskites, and colloidal nanoparticles.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip integration of solution&#8208;processable materials imposes stringent and simultaneous requirements of controlled nucleation and growth, tunable geometry and dimensions, and long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly, which is challenging in solution process far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Superwetting interfaces, underpinned by programmable surface chemistry and topography, are promising for steering transport, dewetting, and microfluid dynamics of liquids, thus opening a new paradigm for micro&#8208;/nanostructure assembly in solution process. Herein, assembly methods on the basis of superwetting interfaces are reviewed for constructing long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered micro&#8208;/nanostructures. Confined capillary liquids, including capillary bridges and capillary corner menisci realized by controlling local wettability and surface topography, are highlighted for simultaneously attained deterministic patterning and long&#8208;range order. The versatility and robustness of confined capillary liquids are discussed with assembly of single&#8208;crystalline micro&#8208;/nanostructures of organic semiconductors, metal&#8208;halide perovskites, and colloidal&#8208;nanoparticle superlattices, which lead to enhanced device performances and exotic functionalities. Finally, a perspective for promising directions in this realm is provided.

         <title>Fast Ionic Storage in Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion diffusion coefficients are highly related to the size and dimension of tunnels in materials, the radius of various ions, and the coinserted or lattice H2O molecules. Monovalent and divalent ions show significant differences in reaction kinetics in materials for their unique diffusion characteristics. Therefore, comprehensive review and prospects are provided for fast ionic storage in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
The highly dynamic nature of grid&#8208;scale energy systems necessitates fast kinetics in energy storage and conversion systems. Rechargeable aqueous batteries are a promising energy&#8208;storage solution for renewable&#8208;energy grids as the ionic diffusivity in aqueous electrolytes can be up to 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than in organic systems, in addition to being highly safe and low cost. Recent research in this regard has focussed on developing suitable electrode materials for fast ionic storage in aqueous electrolytes. In this review, breakthroughs in the field of fast ionic storage in aqueous battery materials, and 1D/2D/3D and over&#8208;3D&#8208;tunnel materials are summarized, and tunnels in over&#8208;3D materials are not oriented in any direction in particular. Various materials with different tunnel sizes are developed to be suitable for the different ionic radii of Li+, Na+, K+, H+, NH4+, and Zn2+, which show significant differences in the reaction kinetics of ionic storage. New topochemical paths for ion insertion/extraction, which provide superfast ionic storage, are also discussed.

         <title>KTaO3&#8212;The New Kid on the Spintronics Block</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
If a truly multifunctional material with a large spin&#8208;orbit coupling is looked for, it would be hard to beat KTaO3 (KTO). The 2D electron gas housed by KTO&#8208;based thin films and heterostructures exhibits spin&#8208;polarization, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, persistent photocurrent, etc., and provides a platform to realize exotic relativistic quantum particles. Read this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review for all the fascinating details.








Abstract
Long after the heady days of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity, the oxides came back into the limelight in 2004 with the discovery of the 2D electron gas (2DEG) in SrTiO3 (STO) and several heterostructures based on it. Not only do these materials exhibit interesting physics, but they have also opened up new vistas in oxide electronics and spintronics. However, much of the attention has recently shifted to KTaO3 (KTO), a material with all the &#8220;good&#8221; properties of STO (simple cubic structure, high mobility, etc.) but with the additional advantage of a much larger spin&#8208;orbit coupling. In this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review of the fascinating world of KTO, it is attempted to cover the remarkable progress made, particularly in the last five years. Certain unsolved issues are also indicated, while suggesting future research directions as well as potential applications. The range of physical phenomena associated with the 2DEG trapped at the interfaces of KTO&#8208;based heterostructures include spin polarization, superconductivity, quantum oscillations in the magnetoresistance, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, persistent photocurrent, Rashba effect, topological Hall effect, and inverse Edelstein Effect. It is aimed to discuss, on a single platform, the various fabrication techniques, the exciting physical properties and future application possibilities of this family of materials.
