         <title>A Multichannel Ca2+ Nanomodulator for Multilevel Mitochondrial Destruction&#8208;Mediated Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A curcumin (CUR) and cisplatin (CDDP) co&#8208;incorporating multichannel calcium&#8208;ion (Ca2+) nanomodulator (PEGCaNMCUR+CDDP) demonstrates enhanced anticancer efficacy owing to induced multilevel mitochondrial damage by Ca2+ overload, which is promoted by the degradation of amorphous calcium carbonate, the CUR&#8208;mediated Ca2+ metabolism, and the CDDP&#8208;augmented synergistic destruction of mitochondria, which can be visualized by both fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging.








Abstract
Subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted nanoformulations for cancer theranostics are receiving increasing attention owing to their benefits of precise drug delivery, maximized therapeutic index, and reduced off&#8208;target side effects. Herein, a multichannel calcium ion (Ca2+) nanomodulator (CaNMCUR+CDDP), i.e., a cisplatin (CDDP) and curcumin (CUR) co&#8208;incorporating calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle, is prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot strategy in a sealed container with in situ synthesized polydopamine (PDA) as a template to enhance Ca2+&#8208;overload&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer therapy. After systemic administration, the PEGylated CaNMCUR+CDDP (PEGCaNMCUR+CDDP) selectively accumulates in tumor tissues, enters tumor cells, and induces multilevel destruction of mitochondria by the combined effects of burst Ca2+ release, Ca2+ efflux inhibition by CUR, and chemotherapeutic CDDP, thereby observably boosting mitochondria&#8208;targeted tumor inhibition. Fluorescence imaging of CUR combined with photoacoustic imaging of PDA facilitates the visualization of the nanomodulator. The facile and practical design of this multichannel Ca2+ nanomodulator will contribute to the development of multimodal bioimaging&#8208;guided organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy in the future.

         <title>Mechanically Efficient Cellular Materials Inspired by Cuttlebone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex structure and functional advantages of the cuttlebone are revealed. The cuttlebone structure, constructed like lamellar septa, separated by asymmetric, distorted S&#8208;shaped walls, exhibits superior strength and energy&#8208;absorption capability to the octet&#8208;truss lattice and conventional polymer and metal foams. This study represents an effective approach for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance cellular materials through bioinspired 3D printing.








Abstract
Cellular materials with excellent mechanical efficiency are essential for aerospace structures, lightweight vehicles, and energy absorption. However, current synthetic cellular materials, such as lattice materials with a unit cell arranged in an ordered hierarchy, are still far behind many biological cellular materials in terms of both structural complexity and mechanical performance. Here, the complex porous structure and the mechanics of the cuttlebone are studied, which acts as a rigid buoyancy tank for cuttlefish to resist large hydrostatic pressure in the deep&#8208;sea environment. The cuttlebone structure, constructed like lamellar septa, separated by asymmetric, distorted S&#8208;shaped walls, exhibits superior strength and energy&#8208;absorption capability to the octet&#8208;truss lattice and conventional polymer and metal foams. Inspired by these findings, mechanically efficient cellular materials are designed and fabricated by 3D printing, which are greatly demanded for many applications including aerospace structures and tissue&#8208;engineering&#8208;scaffold. This study represents an effective approach for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance cellular materials through bioinspired 3D printing.

         <title>Colorful Efficient Moir&#233;&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moir&#233; interference structure augments light diffraction channels, leading to elongated optical paths, and folds sunlight into the perovskite layer. Besides, the sets of Moir&#233; diffracted light achieve &#8220;1 + 1&#160;=&#160;3&#8221; comparing to the single diffraction grating. Therefore, moir&#233; perovskite solar cell has been constructed by the commercial DVD disc, resulting in the champion efficiency up to 20.17% (MAPbI3) and 21.76% ((FAPbI3)1&#8208;x(MAPbBr3)x).








Abstract
Light harvesting is crucial for thin&#8208;film solar cells. To substantially reduce optical loss in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), hierarchical light&#8208;trapping nano&#8208;architectures enable absorption enhancement to exceed the conventional upper limit and have great potential for achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the art optoelectronic performances. However, it remains a great challenge to design and fabricate a superior hierarchical light&#8208;trapping nano&#8208;architecture, which exhibits extraordinary light&#8208;harvesting ability and simultaneously avoids deteriorating the electrical performance of PSCs. Herein, colorful efficient moir&#233;&#8208;PSCs are designed and fabricated incorporating moir&#233; interference structures by the imprinting method with the aid of a commercial DVD disc. It is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that the light harvesting ability of the moir&#233; interference structure can be well manipulated through changing the rotation angle (0&#176;&#8211;90&#176;). The boosted short&#8208;circuit current is credited to augment light diffraction channels, leading to elongated optical paths, and fold sunlight into the perovskite layer. Moreover, the imprinting process suppresses the trap sites and voids at the active&#8208;layer interfaces with eliminated hysteresis. The moir&#233;&#8208;PSC with an optimized 30&#176; rotation angle achieves the best enhancement of light harvesting (28.5% higher than the pristine), resulting in efficiencies over 20.17% (MAPbI3) and 21.76% ((FAPbI3)1&#8208;x (MAPbBr3)x).

         <title>Photodriven Transient Picosecond Top&#8208;Layer Semiconductor to Metal Phase&#8208;Transition in p&#8208;Doped Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S sheet of the p&#8208;doped indirect semiconductor 2H&#8208;MoS2 is found to undergo a transient 1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;metallization of the surface layer by optical excitation with distinct threshold and saturation behaviour. This finding builds on the essential sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with tuneable synchrotron radiation.








Abstract
Visible light is shown to create a transient metallic S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S surface layer on bulk semiconducting p&#8208;doped indirect&#8208;bandgap 2H&#8208;MoS2. Optically created electron&#8211;hole pairs separate in the surface band bending region of the p&#8208;doped semiconducting crystal causing a transient accumulation of electrons in the surface region. This triggers a reversible 2H&#8208;semiconductor to 1T&#8208;metal phase&#8208;transition of the surface layer. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling of the indirect&#8208;bandgap p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2 enables this efficient pathway even at a low density of excited electrons with a distinct optical excitation threshold and saturation behavior. This mechanism needs to be taken into consideration when describing the surface properties of illuminated p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2. In particular, light&#8208;induced increased charge mobility and surface activation can cause and enhance the photocatalytic and photoassisted electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction of water on 2H&#8208;MoS2. Generally, it opens up for a way to control not only the surface of p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2 but also related dichalcogenides and layered systems. The findings are based on the sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with photon&#8208;energy&#8208;tuneable synchrotron&#160;radiation.

         <title>A Morphable Ionic Electrode Based on Thermogel for Non&#8208;Invasive Hairy Plant Electrophysiology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex surface topography on biological tissues presents a major challenge in bio&#8208;electronic interfacing. Taking hairy plants as an example, an ionic electrode based on a thermogel is reported, which adapts and adheres to the abrupt hairy surface asperities, establishing a conformal and adhesive interface. It enables non&#8208;invasive plant electrophysiological measurement with a signal fidelity not achievable by conventional gel electrodes.








Abstract
Plant electrophysiology lays the foundation for smart plant interrogation and intervention. However, plant trichomes with hair&#8208;like morphologies present topographical features that challenge stable and high&#8208;fidelity non&#8208;invasive electrophysiology, due to the inadequate dynamic shape adaptability of conventional electrodes. Here, this issue is overcome using a morphable ionic electrode based on a thermogel, which gradually transforms from a viscous liquid to a viscoelastic gel. This transformation enables the morphable electrode to lock into the abrupt hairy surface irregularities and establish a conformal and adhesive interface. It achieves down to one tenth of the impedance and 4&#8211;5 times the adhesive strengths of conventional hydrogel electrodes on hairy leaves. As a result of the improved electrical and mechanical robustness, the morphable electrode can record more than one order of magnitude higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio on hairy plants and maintains high&#8208;fidelity recording despite plant movements, achieving superior performance to conventional hydrogel electrodes. The reported morphable electrode is a promising tool for hairy plant electrophysiology and may be applied to diversely textured plants for advanced sensing and modulation.

         <title>Supramolecular Pins with Ultralong Efficient Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to intramolecular charge transfer enhanced by cucurbit[8]uril, a supramolecular pin shows afterglow with high phosphorescence quantum yield (99.38%) after incorporation into a rigid matrix, which is the highest yield reported to date for phosphorescent materials. Moreover, supramolecular pins are applied for targeted phosphorescence imaging of mitochondria.








Abstract
Constructing ultralong organic phosphorescent materials possessing a high quantum yield is challenging. Herein, assemblies of purely organic supramolecular pins composed of alkyl&#8208;bridged phenylpyridinium salts and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) are reported. Different from &#8220;one host with two guests&#8221; and &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; binding, the binding formation of supramolecular pins is &#8220;one host with one guest&#8221; and &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head,&#8221; which overcomes electrostatic repulsion and promotes intramolecular charge transfer. The supramolecular pin 1/CB[8] displays afterglow with high phosphorescence quantum yield (99.38%) after incorporation into a rigid matrix, which is the highest yield reported to date for phosphorescent materials. Moreover, multicolor photoluminescence can be obtained by different excitation wavelengths and ratios of host to guest. Owing to the redshift of the absorption, the supramolecular pins are applied for targeted phosphorescence imaging of mitochondria. This work will provide a reasonable supramolecular strategy to achieve redshifted and efficient phosphorescence both in the solid state and in aqueous solution.

         <title>A Spider&#8208;Silk&#8208;Inspired Wet Adhesive with Supercold Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired wet adhesive (SA) composed of polyurethane@poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PU@PVP, core@sheath) nanostructured fibers is fabricated by coaxial electrospinning. The SA achieves robust wet adhesion through a unique dissolving&#8211;wetting&#8211;adhering process of the core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers. Furthermore, the SA retains reliable adhesion from 4 to &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C, even maintains constant adhesion after being stored in liquid nitrogen, showing promising applicability in cryogenic environments.








Abstract
Conventional adhesives often encounter interfacial failure in humid conditions due to small droplets of water condensed on surface, but spider silks can capture prey in such environment. Here a robust spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired wet adhesive (SA) composed of core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers with hygroscopic adhesive nanosheath (poly(vinylpyrrolidone)) and supporting nanocore (polyurethane) is reported. The wet adhesion of the SA is achieved by a unique dissolving&#8211;wetting&#8211;adhering process of core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers, revealed by in situ observations at macro&#8208; and microscales. Further, the SA maintains reliable adhesion on wet and cold substrates from 4 to &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C and even tolerates splashing, violent shaking, and weight loading in liquid nitrogen (&#8722;196&#160;&#176;C), showing promising applicability in cryogenic environments. This study will provide an innovative route to design functional wet adhesives.

         <title>Wicking&#8211;Polarization&#8208;Induced Water Cluster Size Effect on Triboelectric Evaporation Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A textile that can couple active triboelectric polarization and passive wicking to break&#8208;up large&#8208;sized water clusters into small&#8208;sized water clusters or water monomers is reported to promote sweat evaporation. This textile is a useful weapon for eliminating sweat produced by strenuous exercise, and it also shows broad application prospects in quick&#8208;drying sportswear, cooling fabrics and wireless sports monitoring insoles.








Abstract
Sweating during exercise, physical labor, or hot weather leads to a feeling of discomfort. The stuffiness, stickiness, and heaviness brought by sweat may promote negative emotions or disease. Clothing, textiles, and wearable devices exacerbate these problems by restricting evaporation of sweat. Here, a textile that can promote and enhance sweat evaporation by coupling wicking and polarization is reported. The wicking is produced by the wettability gradient and pore size, which make the surface moisture content of the textile in contact with the skin strictly 0%. The polarization is driven by a ferroelectric&#8208;enhanced triboelectric textile. This textile degrades large&#8208;sized water clusters into small&#8208;sized water clusters or water monomers, so that the textiles have an excellent moisture evaporation rate (4.4 and 3.6 times faster than the cotton and polyester textiles, respectively). This work provides a new source of inspiration for quick&#8208;drying textiles and also finds an attractive application for triboelectric technology.

         <title>Tin Oxide Electron&#8208;Selective Layers for Efficient, Stable, and Scalable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Notable developments of SnO2 as an electron&#8208;selective layer for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are reviewed, along with an overview of the fabrication methods and interfacial passivation routes. Furthermore, techno&#8208;economic and toxicology analyses of SnO2 are discussed for possible large&#8208;scale deployment of PSCs. Finally, the role of SnO2 in scaled module and tandem solar cell production is revealed.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a promising photovoltaic (PV) technology, where the evolution of the electron&#8208;selective layers (ESLs), an integral part of any PV device, has played a distinctive role to their progress. To date, the mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2)/compact TiO2 stack has been among the most used ESLs in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PSCs. However, this material requires high&#8208;temperature sintering and may induce hysteresis under operational conditions, raising concerns about its use toward commercialization. Recently, tin oxide (SnO2) has emerged as an attractive alternative ESL, thanks to its wide bandgap, high optical transmission, high carrier mobility, suitable band alignment with perovskites, and decent chemical stability. Additionally, its low&#8208;temperature processability enables compatibility with temperature&#8208;sensitive substrates, and thus flexible devices and tandem solar cells. Here, the notable developments of SnO2 as a perovskite&#8208;relevant ESL are reviewed with emphasis placed on the various fabrication methods and interfacial passivation routes toward champion solar cells with high stability. Further, a techno&#8208;economic analysis of SnO2 materials for large&#8208;scale deployment, together with a processing&#8208;toxicology assessment, is presented. Finally, a perspective on how SnO2 materials can be instrumental in successful large&#8208;scale module and perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cell manufacturing is provided.

         <title>A &#916;E&#160;= 0.63 V Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalyst Enables High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycling Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction and evolution is achieved with the indicator &#916;E&#160;= 0.63&#160;V, far exceeding the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmark and most reported electrocatalysts. Corresponding rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries afford ultralong lifespan over 3600 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and ultrahigh cycling current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries constitute promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and feasibility to realize high cycling current density and long cycling lifespan. Nevertheless, their cathodic reactions involving oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution are highly sluggish in kinetics, requiring high&#8208;performance noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts that exceed the current noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks. Herein, a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalyst is fabricated, which demonstrates ultrahigh bifunctional activity and renders excellent performance in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. Concretely, atomic Co&#8211;N&#8211;C and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are respectively selected as oxygen reduction and evolution active sites and are further rationally integrated to afford the resultant CoNC@LDH composite electrocatalyst. The CoNC@LDH electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable bifunctional activity delivering an indicator &#916;E of 0.63&#160;V, far exceeding the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based Pt/C+Ir/C benchmark (&#916;E = 0.77&#160;V) and most reported electrocatalysts. Correspondingly, ultralong lifespan (over 3600 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and excellent rate performances (cycling current density at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) are achieved in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. This work highlights the current advances of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and endows high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycling rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries for efficient sustainable energy storage.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Near Unit Internal Quantum Efficiency at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes based on metal halide perovskite FAPbI3 can work perfectly at low temperatures. A peak external quantum efficiency of 32.8%, corresponding to an internal quantum efficiency of 100%, is achieved at 45&#160;K. Importantly, the device shows almost no degradation after working at a constant current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2 for 330&#160;h.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes based on metal halide perovskite FAPbI3 are shown to be able to work perfectly at low temperatures. A peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.8%, corresponding to an internal quantum efficiency of 100%, is achieved at 45&#160;K. Importantly, the devices show almost no degradation after working at a constant current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2 for 330&#160;h. The enhanced EQEs at low temperatures result from the increased photoluminescence quantum efficiencies of the perovskite, which is caused by the increased radiative recombination rate. Spectroscopic and calculation results suggest that the phase transitions of the FAPbI3 play an important role for the enhancement of exciton binding energy, which increases the recombination rate.

         <title>Selenic Acid Etching Assisted Vacancy Engineering for Designing Highly Active Electrocatalysts toward the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, selenic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted etching strategy from a metal&#8211;organic framework as a precursor is developed to realize carbon&#8208;coated 3d metal selenides MmSen (Co0.85Se1&#8722;x, NiSe2&#8722;x, FeSe2&#8208;x) with rich Se vacancies as high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals a mechanism that the introduction of abundant Se vacancies can improve the conductivity and reduce reaction barriers for the formation of intermediates.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution electrocatalysts are central to overall water splitting, and they should meet the requirements of low cost, high activity, high conductivity, and stable performance. Herein, a general, selenic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted etching strategy is designed from a metal&#8211;organic framework as a precursor to realize carbon&#8208;coated 3d metal selenides MmSen (Co0.85Se1&#8722;x, NiSe2&#8722;x, FeSe2&#8722;x) with rich Se vacancies as high&#8208;performance precious metal&#8208;free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Specifically, the as&#8208;prepared Co0.85Se1&#8722;x@C nanocages deliver an overpotential of only 231&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the OER and the corresponding full water&#8208;splitting electrolyzer requires only a cell voltage of 1.49&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculation reveals the important role of abundant Se vacancies for improving the catalytic activity through improving the conductivity and reducing reaction barriers for the formation of intermediates. Although phase change after long&#8208;term operation is observed with the formation of metal hydroxides, catalytic activity is not obviously affected, which strengthens the important role of the carbon network in the operating stability. This study provides a new opportunity to realize high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts by a general strategy on selenic acid etching assisted vacancy engineering.

         <title>An Electron Acceptor Analogue for Lowering Trap Density in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy of employing an acceptor&#8208;analogue is developed to efficiently reduce trap density to a magnitude of 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for organic photovoltaic materials, which is comparable to and even lower than those of some inorganic counterparts, and boosts the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells up to 17.8%.








Abstract
Typical organic semiconductor materials exhibit a high trap density of states, ranging from 1016 to 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3, which is one of the important factors in limiting the improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In order to reduce the trap density within OSCs, a new strategy to design and synthesize an electron acceptor analogue, BTPR, is developed, which is introduced into OSCs as a third component to enhance the molecular packing order of electron acceptor with and without blending a polymer donor. Finally, the as&#8208;cast ternary OSC devices employing BTPR show a notable PCE of 17.8%, with a low trap density (1015&#160;cm&#8722;3) and a low energy loss (0.217&#160;eV) caused by non&#8208;radiative recombination. This PCE is among the highest values for single&#8208;junction OSCs. The trap density of OSCs with the BTPR additives, as low as 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, is comparable to and even lower than those of several typical high&#8208;performance inorganic/hybrid counterparts, like 1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 for amorphous silicon, 1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 for metal oxides, and 1014 to 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for halide perovskite thin film, and makes it promising for OSCs to obtain a PCE of up to 20%.

The trap density of OSCs with the BTPR additives, as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, is comparable to and even lower than those of several typical high&#8208;performance inorganic/hybrid counterparts, like 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; for amorphous silicon, 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; for metal oxides, and 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; for halide perovskite thin film, and makes it promising for OSCs to obtain a PCE of up to 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Lithium Metal Electrode with Increased Air Stability and Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase Realized by Silane Coupling Agent Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense modification layer of a silane coupling agent enables Li metal to be stable in air and during cycling. This layer firmly adheres to the Li metal surface by forming Li&#63743;O&#63743;Si bonds, and it connects with the solid electrolyte interphase layer by chemical bonds and physical intertwining effects.








Abstract
The quality of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is the decisive factor for the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries. Due to the absence of effective bonding, a natural SEI layer may exfoliate from the Li anode during interfacial fluctuations. Here, a silane coupling agent is introduced to serve as an adhesion promoter to bridge these two dissimilar materials via both chemical bonding and physical intertwining effects. Its inorganic reactive groups can combine with the Li substrate by forming Li&#63743;O&#63743;Si bonds, while organic functional groups can take part in the formation of the SEI layer and thereby bond with SEI components. Li metal electrodes with silane coupling agent modification exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, even under extreme testing conditions. This modification layer with dense structure could also protect the Li metal from corrosion by air, evidenced by the comparable electrochemical activity of the modified Li metal electrodes even after being exposed in air for 2 h. This design provides a promising pathway for the development of Li metal electrodes that will be stable both in electrolyte and in air.

         <title>A Novel Soft&#8208;Magnetic B2&#8208;Based Multiprincipal&#8208;Element Alloy with a Uniform Distribution of Coherent Body&#8208;Centered&#8208;Cubic Nanoprecipitates</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel Al1.5Co4Fe2Cr multiprincipal element alloy with ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates in a B2 matrix is developed via tuning the chemical composition to manipulate the microstructure. It exhibits a prominent soft&#8208;magnetic property, high Curie temperature, and electrical resistivity, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The current approach offers a new way to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Multiprincipal&#8208;element alloys (MPEAs), including high&#8208;entropy alloys, are a new class of materials whose thermodynamical properties are mainly driven by configuration entropy, rather than enthalpy in the traditional alloys, especially at high temperatures. Herein, the design of a novel soft&#8208;magnetic nonequiatomic, quaternary MPEA is described, via tuning its chemical composition to deliberately manipulate its microstructure, such that it contains ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates (3&#8211;7&#160;nm) uniformly distributed in a B2&#8208;phase matrix. The new alloy Al1.5Co4Fe2Cr exhibits high saturation magnetization (MS&#160;= 135.3 emu g&#8208;1), low coercivity (HC&#160;= 127.3 A m&#8208;1), high Curie temperature (TC&#160;= 1061 K), and high electrical resistivity (&#961;&#160; =&#160;244 &#956;&#937; cm), promising for soft magnets. More importantly, these prominent soft&#8208;magnetic properties are observed to be retained even after the alloy is thermally exposed at 873 K for 555 h, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The versatility of the magnetic properties of this new alloy is discussed in light of the microstructural change induced by tuning the chemical composition, and the enhanced performance of the alloy is compared directly with that of the traditional soft&#8208;magnetic alloys. The perspective is also addressed to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Frequency&#8208;Independent Terahertz Anomalous Hall Effect in DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73 Thin Films from DC to 40 THz</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a fundamental spintronic phenomenon that is a potentially essential ingredient of future high&#8208;speed spintronic devices operating at terahertz (THz) frequencies. It is revealed that the AHE remains operative from DC up to 40 THz with a flat frequency response in thin films of three technologically relevant magnetic materials: DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73.








Abstract
The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a fundamental spintronic charge&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion phenomenon and closely related to spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion by the spin Hall effect. Future high&#8208;speed spintronic devices will crucially rely on such conversion phenomena at terahertz (THz) frequencies. Here, it is revealed that the AHE remains operative from DC up to 40 THz with a flat frequency response in thin films of three technologically relevant magnetic materials: DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73. The frequency&#8208;dependent conductivity&#8208;tensor elements &#963;xx and &#963;yx&#8197;are&#8197;measured, and good agreement with DC measurements is found. The experimental findings are fully consistent with ab initio calculations of &#963;yx for CoFe and highlight the role of the large Drude scattering rate (&#8776;100&#160;THz) of metal thin films, which smears out any sharp spectral features of the THz AHE. Finally, it is found that the intrinsic contribution to the THz AHE dominates over the extrinsic mechanisms for the Co32Fe68 sample. The results imply that the AHE and related effects such as the spin Hall effect are highly promising ingredients of future THz spintronic devices reliably operating from DC to 40 THz and beyond.

         <title>Efficient Electron Transport Layer Free Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells with Superior Device Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells based on a new electron donor reach power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13% with and without the use of electrode interlayers but differ strongly in stability. Surprisingly, the surface composition and morphology of the interlayers deteriorate with time even under inert conditions, reducing device performance. Without interlayers, the cells give stable high performance.








Abstract
Electron transport layers (ETLs) placed between the electrodes and a photoactive layer can enhance the performance of organic solar cells but also impose limitations. Most ETLs are ultrathin films, and their deposition can disturb the morphology of the photoactive layers, complicate device fabrication, raise cost, and also affect device stability. To fully overcome such drawbacks, efficient organic solar cells that operate without an ETL are preferred. In this study, a new small&#8208;molecule electron donor (H31) based on a thiophene&#8208;substituted benzodithiophene core unit with trialkylsilyl side chains is designed and synthesized. Blending H31 with the electron acceptor Y6 gives solar cells with power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13% with and without 2,9&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(dimethyloxidoamino)propyl]anthra[2,1,9&#8208;def:6,5,10&#8208;d&#8242;e&#8242;f&#8201;&#8242;]diisoquinoline&#8208;1,3,8,10(2H,9H)&#8208;tetrone (PDINO) as the ETL. The ETL&#8208;free cells deliver a superior shelf life compared to devices with an ETL. Small&#8208;molecule donor&#8211;acceptor blends thus provide interesting perspectives for achieving efficient, reproducible, and stable device architectures without electrode interlayers.

         <title>Harnessing Ionic Power from Equilibrium Electrolyte Solution via Photoinduced Active Ion Transport through van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;Like Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide&#8208;based van der Waals multilayer heterostructures are used to harvest ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solutions via a coupled photon&#8208;carrier&#8211;ion transport mechanism. Under optimized conditions, an uttermost power density of nearly 2 mW&#160;m&#8211;2 is achieved under one sun equivalent excitation.








Abstract
Nanofluidic ion transport through van der Waals heterostructures, composed of two or more types of reconstructed 2D nanomaterials, gives rise to fascinating opportunities for light&#8208;energy harvesting, due to coupling between the optoelectronic properties of the layered constituents and ion transport in between the atomic layers. Here, a photoinduced active ion transport phenomenon through transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#8208;based van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;like multilayer heterostructures is reported for harnessing ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solution. The binary heterostructure comprises sequentially stacked 2D&#8208;WS2 and 2D&#8208;MoS2 multilayers with sub&#8208;1 nm interlayer spacing. Upon visible&#8208;light illumination, a net ionic flow is initiated through the Janus membrane, suggesting a directional cationic transport from WS2 to MoS2 part. The transport mechanism is explained in terms of a photovoltaic effect due to type II band alignment of WS2/MoS2 heterostructures. The driving mechanism can be generally applied to a variety of heterogeneous TMD membranes with type II semiconductor heterojunctions. In equilibrium ionic solutions, the maximum ionic photoresponse approaches &#8776;21 &#181;A&#160;cm&#8211;2 and &#8776;45&#160;mV under one sun equivalent excitation. Under optimized conditions, the harvested power density reaches 2&#160;mW&#160;m&#8211;2. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of photonic&#8208;to&#8208;ionic power generation within angstrom&#8208;scale confinement anticipates potential for light&#8208;controlled ionic circuits, artificial photosynthesis, and biomimetic energy conversion.

         <title>Multiresponsive Nonvolatile Memories Based on Optically Switchable Ferroelectric Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is fabricated. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time.








Abstract
Organic transistors are key elements for flexible, wearable, and biocompatible logic applications. Multiresponsivity is highly sought&#8208;after in organic electronics to enable sophisticated operations and functions. Such a challenge can be pursued by integrating more components in a single device, each one responding to a specific external stimulus. Here, the first multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric organic field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is reported. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by means of light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time. Such a proof of concept paves the way toward enhanced functional complexity in optoelectronics via the interfacing of multiple components in a single device, in a fully integrated low&#8208;cost technology compatible with flexible substrates.

         <title>Solvent Engineering of the Precursor Solution toward Large&#8208;Area Production of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent engineering of precursor solutions toward efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is reviewed comprehensively. The key role of solvent engineering for solution&#8208;processed perovskite film is highlighted, especially for the large&#8208;area production of PSCs. Light is shed on the significance of solvent engineering in PSCs, and critical guidance for future commercialization development of highly efficient PSCs is provided.








Abstract
Solar cells based on emerging organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have reached certified power conversion efficiency as high as 25.5%, showing great potential in the next generation of photovoltaics toward large&#8208;scale industrialization. The most competitive feature of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is that the perovskite light absorber can be fabricated by a low&#8208;cost solution method. For the solution method, the characteristics of the solvent play a key role in determining the crystallization kinetics, growth orientation, and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film. Although significant progress has been made in the field of solvent engineering in PSCs, it is still challenging for the solution method to sustainably produce industrial&#8208;scale PSCs for future commercialization applications. Herein, the advanced progress of solvent engineering of precursor solution in terms of coordination regulation and toxicity reduction is highlighted. The physical and chemical characteristics of different solvents in reducing the toxicity of the solvent system, regulating the coordination property of the precursor solution, controlling the film&#8208;forming process of the perovskite film, and adjusting the photovoltaic performance of the PSC are systematically discussed. Lastly, important perspectives on solvent engineering of the perovskite precursor solution toward future industrial production of high&#8208;performance PSCs are provided.

         <title>Porous Semiconducting Polymers Enable High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous polymer films are fabricated using the efficient breath figure method and their performance in organic electrochemical transistors is investigated. Introducing the porosity significantly enhances the ion penetration rates and results in high transconductance and fast switching properties.








Abstract
Organic polymer electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are of great interest for flexible electronics and bioelectronics applications owing to their high transconductance and low operating voltage. However, efficient OECT operation must delicately balance the seemingly incompatible materials optimizations of redox chemistry, active layer electronic transport, and ion penetration/transport. The latter characteristics are particularly challenging since most high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers are hydrophobic, which hinders efficient ion penetration, hence limiting OECT performance. Here, the properties and OECT response of a series of dense and porous semiconducting polymer films are compared, the latter fabricated via a facile breath figure approach. This methodology enables fast ion doping, high transconductance (up to 364 S cm&#8722;1), and a low subthreshold swing for the hydrophobic polymers DPPDTT and P3HT, rivalling or exceeding the metrics of the relatively hydrophilic polymer, Pg2T&#8208;T. Furthermore, the porous morphology also enhances the transconductance of hydrophilic polymers, offering a general strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance electrochemical transistors.

         <title>Tip&#8208;Enhanced Electric Field: A New Mechanism Promoting Mass Transfer in Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanistic understanding of the enhanced alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics is achieved by employing dense arrays of nanocones with sharp tips. A local electric field promotes aggregation of hydroxide ions  near the high&#8208;curvature active sites, leading to lower overpotential and higher intrinsic OER activity compared to blunt cones.








Abstract
The slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) causes high power consumption for electrochemical water splitting. Various strategies have been attempted to accelerate the OER rate, but there are few studies on regulating the transport of reactants especially under large current densities when the mass transfer factor dominates the evolution reactions. Herein, NixFe1&#8211;x alloy nanocones arrays (with &#8776;2 nm surface NiO/NiFe(OH)2 layer) are adopted to boost the transport of reactants. Finite element analysis suggests that the high&#8208;curvature tips can enhance the local electric field, which induces an order of magnitude higher concentration of hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;) at the active sites and promotes intrinsic OER activity by 67% at 1.5 V. Experimental results show that a fabricated NiFe nanocone array electrode, with optimized alloy composition, has a small overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 255 mV at 500 mA cm&#8722;2. When calibrated by electrochemical surface area, the nanocones electrode outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OER electrocatalysts. The positive effect of the tip&#8208;enhanced local electric field in promoting mass transfer is also confirmed by comparing samples with different tip curvature radii. It is suggested that this local field enhanced OER kinetics is a generic effect to other OER catalysts.

Experimental results show that a fabricated NiFe nanocone array electrode, with optimized alloy composition, has a small overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 255 mV at 500 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. When calibrated by electrochemical surface area, the nanocones electrode outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OER electrocatalysts. The positive effect of the tip&#8208;enhanced local electric field in promoting mass transfer is also confirmed by comparing samples with different tip curvature radii. It is suggested that this local field enhanced OER kinetics is a generic effect to other OER catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Assembled Vacuolated Coacervates Control Macromolecule Spatiotemporal Distribution to Provide a Stable Segregated Cell Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactive core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with different chemical makeups can self&#8208;assemble into stable vacuolated coacervates under physiological conditions, driven by physical interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding) derived from the end groups of the hydrophilic shell, thus providing novel insights into the morphological, physical, and functional complexity of coacervate organelles.








Abstract
Membraneless coacervate compartments in the intracellular and pericellular space mediate critical cellular functions. Developing synthetic coacervates that emulate the morphological, physical, and functional complexity of these natural coacervates is challenging but highly desirable. Herein, a generalizable nanoparticle assembly (NPA) strategy is developed, which is applicable to interactive core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with different chemical makeups, to fabricate vacuolated coacervates. The obtained NPA coacervates contain stable internal vacuoles to provide segregated microcompartments, which can mediate the spatially heterogeneous distribution of diverse macromolecules via restricted diffusion. It is further shown that the vacuolated NPA coacervates can harbor and retain macromolecular medium supplements to regulate the functions of cells encapsulated in vacuoles. Furthermore, the restricted macromolecule diffusion can be abolished on demand via the triggered coacervate&#8211;hydrogel transition, thereby altering the exposure of encapsulated cells to environmental factors. It is believed that the NPA strategy provides new insights into the design principles of hierarchical coacervates that hold promising potential for a wide array of biomedical applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hybrid Nanozymes as Superoxide Scavengers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key factor for de novo design of a metalloenzyme mimetic includes a suitable protein scaffold and enzyme active centers. A biomimetic cascade nanozyme is artificially created based on the hybridization of a recombinant ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein scaffold modified for mitochondria&#8208;targeting and a Mn&#8208;based nanoparticle as the core of the enzymatic activity.








Abstract
Development of enzyme mimics for the scavenging of excessive mitochondrial superoxide (O2&#8226;&#8722;) can serve as an effective strategy in the treatment of many diseases. Here, protein reconstruction technology and nanotechnology is taken advantage of to biomimetically create an artificial hybrid nanozyme. These nanozymes consist of ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein as the enzyme scaffold and a metal nanoparticle core as the enzyme active center. This artificial cascade nanozyme possesses superoxide dismutase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;like activities and also targets mitochondria by overcoming multiple biological barriers. Using cardiac ischemia&#8208;reperfusion animal models, the protective advantages of the hybrid nanozymes are demonstrated in vivo during mitochondrial oxidative injury and in the recovery of heart functionality following infarction via systemic delivery and localized release from adhesive hydrogels (i.e., cardiac patch), respectively. This study illustrates a de novo design strategy in the development of enzyme mimics and provides a promising therapeutic option for alleviating oxidative damage in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Ultrathin Amorphous/Crystalline Heterophase Rh and Rh Alloy Nanosheets as Tandem Catalysts for Direct Indole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin Rh and RhM (M = Cu, Zn, Ru) alloy nanosheets with amorphous/crystalline heterophases are successfully synthesized. In tandem catalysis to directly synthesize indole, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh nanosheets (NSs) outperform their crystalline counterpart, demonstrating much higher catalytic activity. Impressively, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase RhCu NSs show dramatically enhanced indole selectivity of over 99.9% and excellent activity.








Abstract
Heterogeneous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysis plays an essential role in the production of fine chemicals. Rh&#8208;based catalysts are one of the most active candidates for indole synthesis. However, it is still highly desired to develop heterogeneous Rh&#8208;based catalysts with high activity and selectivity. In this work, a general, facile wet&#8208;chemical method is reported to synthesize ultrathin amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh and Rh&#8208;based bimetallic alloy nanosheets (NSs), including RhCu, RhZn, and RhRu. Impressively, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh NSs exhibit enhanced catalytic activity toward the direct synthesis of indole compared to the crystalline counterpart. Importantly, the obtained amorphous/crystalline heterophase RhCu alloy NSs can further enhance the selectivity to indole of &gt;99.9% and the conversion is 100%. This work demonstrates the importance of phase engineering and metal alloying in the rational design and synthesis of tandem heterogeneous catalysts toward fine chemical synthesis.

         <title>Revealing Structural Disorder in Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon for a Low&#8208;Loss Photonic Platform at Visible Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic bonding networks of hydrogenated amorphous silicon are revealed to reduce its optical loss in the visible region. Atomic bonding networks are manipulated by controlling the process conditions of plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The optimal atomic configuration demonstrates the low&#8208;loss hydrogenated amorphous silicon as being an efficient photonic platform by expanding the working frequencies from the infrared to the visible spectrum.








Abstract
The high refractive index of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si:H) at optical frequencies is an essential property for the efficient modulation of the phase and amplitude of light. However, substantial optical loss represented by its high extinction coefficient prevents it from being utilized widely. Here, the bonding configurations of a&#8208;Si:H are investigated, in order to manipulate the extinction coefficient and produce a material that is competitive with conventional transparent materials, such as titanium dioxide and gallium nitride. This is achieved by controlling the hydrogenation and silicon disorder by adjusting the chemical deposition conditions. The extinction coefficient of the low&#8208;loss a&#8208;Si:H reaches a minimum of 0.082 at the wavelength of 450&#160;nm, which is lower than that of crystalline silicon (0.13). Beam&#8208;steering metasurfaces are demonstrated to validate the low&#8208;loss optical properties, reaching measured efficiencies of 42%, 62%, and 75% at the wavelengths of 450, 532, and 635&#160;nm, respectively. Considering its compatibility with mature complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor processes, the low&#8208;loss a&#8208;Si:H will provide a platform for efficient photonic operating in the full visible regime.

         <title>Combination of Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation with Selective Oxygenation of Organic Substrates using Manganese Borophosphates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical manganese borophosphates are employed to address two highly demanding yet kinetically controlled reactions: durable electrochemical water oxidation to efficiently produce molecular oxygen and the selective oxygenation of organics to deliver prominent value&#8208;added chemicals.








Abstract
One of the key catalytic reactions for life on earth, the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen, occurs in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of the photosystem II (PSII) mediated by a manganese&#8208;containing cluster. Considerable efforts in this research area embrace the development of efficient artificial manganese&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using artificial OER catalysts for selective oxygenation of organic substrates to produce value&#8208;added chemicals is a worthwhile objective.

&lt;p&gt;Helical manganese borophosphates are employed to address two highly demanding yet kinetically controlled reactions: durable electrochemical water oxidation to efficiently produce molecular oxygen and the selective oxygenation of organics to deliver prominent value&#8208;added chemicals.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key catalytic reactions for life on earth, the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen, occurs in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of the photosystem II (PSII) mediated by a manganese&#8208;containing cluster. Considerable efforts in this research area embrace the development of efficient artificial manganese&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using artificial OER catalysts for selective oxygenation of organic substrates to produce value&#8208;added chemicals is a worthwhile objective. However, unsatisfying catalytic performance and poor stability have been a fundamental bottleneck in the field of artificial PSII analogs. Herein, for the first time, a manganese&#8208;based anode material is developed and paired up for combining electrocatalytic water oxidation and selective oxygenations of organics delivering the highest efficiency reported to date. This can be achieved by employing helical manganese borophosphates, representing a new class of materials.

         <title>Terahertz Spin&#8208;to&#8208;Charge Conversion by Interfacial Skew Scattering in Metallic Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terahertz emission spectroscopy is used to study spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (S2C) in ferromagnetic (F)|nonmagnetic (N) bilayer metal thin films. The measurements indicate that S2C at the F/N interfaces can become comparable to the overall S2C and that the sign is drastically affected by interface modifications. A possible extrinsic S2C mechanism, skew scattering of spin&#8208;polarized electrons at interfacial imperfections, is suggested.








Abstract
The efficient conversion of spin to charge transport and vice versa is of major relevance for the detection and generation of spin currents in spin&#8208;based electronics. Interfaces of heterostructures are known to have a marked impact on this process. Here, terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy is used to study ultrafast spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion (S2C) in about 50 prototypical F|N bilayers consisting of a ferromagnetic layer F (e.g., Ni81Fe19, Co, or Fe) and a nonmagnetic layer N with strong (Pt) or weak (Cu and Al) spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Varying the structure of the F/N interface leads to a drastic change in the amplitude and even inversion of the polarity of the THz charge current. Remarkably, when N is a material with small spin Hall angle, a dominant interface contribution to the ultrafast charge current is found. Its magnitude amounts to as much as about 20% of that found in the F|Pt reference sample. Symmetry arguments and first&#8208;principles calculations strongly suggest that the interfacial S2C arises from skew scattering of spin&#8208;polarized electrons at interface imperfections. The results highlight the potential of skew scattering for interfacial S2C and propose a promising route to enhanced S2C by tailored interfaces at all frequencies from DC to terahertz.

         <title>A Virus&#8208;Mimicking Nucleic Acid Nanogel Reprograms Microglia and Macrophages for Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A virus&#8208;mimicking membrane&#8208;coated nucleic acid nanogel Vir&#8208;Gel is constructed using therapeutic miRNA as a crosslinker to direct the self&#8208;assembly of DNA&#8208;grafted polycaprolactone (DNA&#8208;g&#8208;PCL) brushes to form a nanogel. Vir&#8208;Gel can effectively reprogram microglia and macrophages from a tumor&#8208;promoting M2 phenotype to an anti&#8208;tumor M1 phenotype, thereby breaking the immunosuppression tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma and improving the therapeutic effect.








Abstract
Immunotherapy is recognized as one of the most promising approaches to treat cancers. However, its effect in glioblastoma (GBM) treatment is insufficient, which can in part be attributed to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Microglia and macrophages are the main immune infiltrating cells in the TME of GBM. Unfortunately, instead of initiating the anti&#8208;tumor response, GBM&#8208;infiltrating microglia and macrophages switch to a tumor&#8208;promoting phenotype (M2), and support tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression by the release of cytokines. In this work, a virus&#8208;mimicking membrane&#8208;coated nucleic acid nanogel Vir&#8208;Gel embedded with therapeutic miRNA is developed, which can reprogram microglia and macrophages from a pro&#8208;invasive M2 phenotype to an anti&#8208;tumor M1 phenotype. By mimicking the virus infection process, Vir&#8208;Gel significantly enhances the targetability and cell uptake efficiency of the miR155&#8208;bearing nucleic acid nanogel. In vivo evaluations demonstrate that Vir&#8208;Gel apparently prolongs the circulation lifetime of miR155 and endows it with an active tumor&#8208;targeting capability and excellent tumor inhibition efficacy. Owing to its noninvasive feature and effective delivery capability, the virus&#8208;mimicking nucleic acid nanogel provides a general and convenient platform that can successfully treat a wide range of diseases.

         <title>Directional Polarized Light Emission from Thin&#8208;Film Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly directional and polarized light emission is demonstrated in thin&#8208;film light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) by suppressing the background emission and extracting only the transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode. It is found that the TE waveguide mode increases with the refractive index of the emitting layer and a 2.6 times higher current efficiency is achieved in a perovskite LED.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with directional and polarized light emission have many photonic applications, and beam shaping of these devices is fundamentally challenging because they are Lambertian light sources. In this work, using organic and perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) for demonstrations, by selectively diffracting the transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode while suppressing other optical modes in a nanostructured LED, the authors first demonstrate highly directional light emission from a full&#8208;area organic LED with a small divergence angle less than 3&#176; and a TE to transverse magnetic (TM) polarization extinction ratio of 13. The highly selective diffraction of only the TE waveguide mode is possible due to the planarization of the device stack by thermal evaporation and solution processing. Using this strategy, directional and polarized emission from a perovskite LED having a current efficiency 2.6 times compared to the reference planar device is further demonstrated. This large enhancement in efficiency in the PeLED is attributed to a larger contribution from the TE waveguide mode resulting from the high refractive index in perovskite materials.

         <title>From Understanding Mechanical Behavior to Curvature Prediction of Humidity&#8208;Triggered Bilayer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the mechanical properties of bilayer actuators based on the humidity&#8208;responsive polymer poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) in combination with volumetric strain measurements allows for the curvature prediction of humidity&#8208;triggered bilayer actuators by an analytic composite beam model.








Abstract
Nature will always be an endless source of bioinspiration for man&#8208;made smart materials and multifunctional devices. Impressively, even cutoff leaves from resurrection plants can autonomously and reproducibly change their shape upon humidity changes, which goes along with total recovery of their mechanical properties after being completely dried. In this work, simple bilayers are presented as autonomously moving, humidity&#8208;triggered bending actuators. The bilayers&#8212;showing reproducible bending behavior with reversible kinematics and multiway behavior&#8212;are studied in terms of their mechanical behavior upon humidity changes. The active layer consists of a highly conducting polymer film based on poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as passive layer. The response to humidity is explored with dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and quartz crystal microbalance measurements. Introduction of a composite beam model allows to predict the curvature of the actuators with input from the rheological measurements. It is clearly demonstrated that volumetric strain and Young's modulus, both heavily influenced by the water uptake, dominate the bending behavior and therefore the curvature of the actuators. This loop of rheological characterization coupled with an analytical model allows to predict curvatures of in principle any complex geometry and material combination for moving parts in soft robotics.

         <title>Realizing an All&#8208;Round Hydrogel Electrolyte toward Environmentally Adaptive Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, ultralow freezing point, excellent mechanical properties, good self&#8208;healing ability, high adhesion, and good heat&#8208;resistance ability is constructed. It can effectively suppress the growth of zinc dendrites and the occurrence of parasitic side reactions, thereby enabling a high&#8208;performance flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery that can work normally in a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Flexible energy storage devices are at the forefront of next&#8208;generation power supplies, one of the most important components of which is the gel electrolyte. However, shortcomings exist, more or less, for all the currently developed hydrogel electrolytes. Herein, a facile and cost&#8208;effective method is developed to construct an all&#8208;round hydrogel electrolyte by using cotton as the raw material, tetraethyl orthosilicate as the crosslinker, and glycerol as the antifreezing agent. The obtained hydrogel electrolyte has high ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical properties (e.g., high tensile strength and elasticity), ultralow freezing point, good self&#8208;healing ability, high adhesion, and good heat&#8208;resistance ability. Remarkably, this hydrogel electrolyte can provide a record&#8208;breaking high ionic conductivity of 19.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared with previously reported aqueous electrolytes for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, this hydrogel electrolyte can significantly inhibit zinc dendritic growth and parasitic side reactions from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. With this hydrogel electrolyte, a flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery is assembled, which shows remarkable energy densities from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The battery also exhibits outstanding cycling durability and has high endurance under various harsh conditions. This work opens new opportunities for the development of hydrogel electrolytes.

         <title>Metallic Diluted Dimerization in VO2 Tweeds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;insulator transition of VO2 holds promise for numerous applications, yet the phase trajectory remains poorly understood. It is shown that strained films develop multicomponent tweeds prior to relaxation to the monoclinic ground state, triggered by the nucleation of partially dimerized V&#8208;chains. The suppression of the bonding/antibonding splitting in&#160;&#8220;isolated&#8221; V sites renders metallicity to this new monoclinic phase.








Abstract
The observation of electronic phase separation textures in vanadium dioxide, a prototypical electron&#8208;correlated oxide, has recently added new perspectives on the long standing debate about its metal&#8211;insulator transition and its applications. Yet, the lack of atomically resolved information on phases accompanying such complex patterns still hinders a comprehensive understanding of the transition and its implementation in practical devices. In this work, atomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy unveils the existence of ferroelastic tweed structures on &#8776;5 nm length scales, well below the resolution limit of currently used spectroscopic imaging techniques. Moreover, density functional theory calculations show that this pretransitional fine&#8208;scale tweed, which on average looks and behaves like the standard metallic rutile phase, is in fact weaved by semi&#8208;dimerized chains of vanadium in a new monoclinic phase that represents a structural bridge to the monoclinic insulating ground state. These observations provide a multiscale perspective for the interpretation of existing data, whereby phase coexistence and structural intermixing can occur all the way down to the atomic scale.

         <title>Fused Aromatic Network with Exceptionally High Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline fused aromatic network with a basal plane stoichiometry of C5N exhibits exceptionally high carrier mobility. The thin flakes of C5N, obtained by poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamping, show ambipolar charge transport and remarkably high electron and hole mobilities, demonstrating their huge potential for applications in thin&#8208;film electronics.








Abstract
Recently, studies of 2D organic layered materials with unique electronic properties have generated considerable interest in the research community. However, the development of organic materials with functional electrical transport properties is still needed. Here, a 2D fused aromatic network (FAN) structure with a C5N basal plane stoichiometry is designed and synthesized, and thin films are cast from C5N solution onto silicon dioxide substrates. Then field&#8208;effect transistors are fabricated using C5N thin flakes as the active layer in a bottom&#8208;gate top&#8208;contact configuration to characterize their electrical properties. The C5N thin flakes, isolated by polydimethylsiloxane stamping, exhibit ambipolar charge transport and extraordinarily high electron (996 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and hole (501 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) mobilities, surpassing the performance of most pristine organic materials without doping. These results demonstrate their vast potential for applications in thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Unprecedented Fluorophore Photostability Enabled by Low&#8208;Loss Organic Hyperbolic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophores are much more photostable on organic hyperbolic materials (OHMs) than on glass. On a glass substrate, fluorophores are photobleached almost immediately; highly photostable fluorophores, however, are observed on an OHM substrate. Fluorophore photobleaching lifetimes are lengthened up to four orders of magnitude with a 230&#8208;fold increase in photon count.








Abstract
The dynamics of photons in fluorescent molecules plays a key role in fluorescence imaging, optical sensing, organic photovoltaics, and displays. Photobleaching is an irreversible photodegradation process of fluorophores, representing a fundamental limitation in relevant optical applications. Chemical reagents are used to suppress the photobleaching rate but with exceptionally high specificity for each type of fluorophore. Here, using organic hyperbolic materials (OHMs), an optical platform to achieve unprecedented fluorophore photostability without any chemical specificity is demonstrated. A more than 500&#8208;fold lengthening of the photobleaching lifetime and a 230&#8208;fold increase in the total emitted photon counts are observed simultaneously. These exceptional improvements solely come from the low&#8208;loss hyperbolic dispersion of OHM films and the large resultant Purcell effect in the visible spectral range. The demonstrated OHM platform may open up a new paradigm in nanophotonics and organic plasmonics for super&#8208;resolution imaging and the engineering of light&#8211;matter interactions at the nanoscale.

         <title>Interplay of Different Major Ampullate Spidroins during Assembly and Implications for Fiber Mechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural spider major ampullate silk exhibits mechanical properties unmatched by most other known natural or man&#8208;made fibrous materials. Upon recombinant co&#8208;production of two different spidroins derived from one spider species, they interconnect already in solution and during assembly. Their interplay yields fibers with overall properties different to those of one&#8208;protein fibers, but equaling that of the natural blueprint.








Abstract
Major ampullate (MA) spider silk has fascinating mechanical properties combining strength and elasticity. All known natural MA silks contain at least two or more different spidroins; however, it is unknown why and if there is any interplay in the spinning dope. Here, two different spidroins from Araneus diadematus are co&#8208;produced in Escherichia coli to study the possible dimerization and effects thereof on the mechanical properties of fibers. During the production of the two spidroins, a mixture of homo&#8208; and heterodimers is formed triggered by the carboxyl&#8208;terminal domains. Interestingly, homodimeric species of the individual spidroins self&#8208;assemble differently in comparison to heterodimers, and stoichiometric mixtures of homo&#8208; and heterodimers yield spidroin networks upon assembly with huge impact on fiber mechanics upon spinning. The obtained results provide the basis for man&#8208;made tuning of spinning dopes to yield high&#8208;performance fibers.

Their interplay yields fibers with overall properties different to those of one&#8208;protein fibers, but equaling that of the natural blueprint.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major ampullate (MA) spider silk has fascinating mechanical properties combining strength and elasticity. All known natural MA silks contain at least two or more different spidroins; however, it is unknown why and if there is any interplay in the spinning dope. Here, two different spidroins from &lt;i&gt;Araneus diadematus&lt;/i&gt; are co&#8208;produced in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; to study the possible dimerization and effects thereof on the mechanical properties of fibers. During the production of the two spidroins, a mixture of homo&#8208; and heterodimers is formed triggered by the carboxyl&#8208;terminal domains. Interestingly, homodimeric species of the individual spidroins self&#8208;assemble differently in comparison to heterodimers, and stoichiometric mixtures of homo&#8208; and heterodimers yield spidroin networks upon assembly with huge impact on fiber mechanics upon spinning. The obtained results provide the basis for man&#8208;made tuning of spinning dopes to yield high&#8208;performance fibers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Designing the Bending Stiffness of 2D Material Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial engineering is used to tune the bending stiffness of 2D material heterostructures composed of graphene and MoS2 by over several hundred percent. The incorporation of twisted or heterointerfaces facilitates interlayer slip, which dramatically softens the 2D stacks. A bending model is developed to predict and design the deformability of 2D heterostructures as a function of composition, stacking order, and geometry of the structure.








Abstract
2D monolayers represent some of the most deformable inorganic materials, with bending stiffnesses approaching those of lipid bilayers. Achieving 2D heterostructures with similar properties would enable a new class of deformable devices orders of magnitude softer than conventional thin&#8208;film electronics. Here, by systematically introducing low&#8208;friction twisted or heterointerfaces, interfacial engineering is leveraged to tailor the bending stiffness of 2D heterostructures over several hundred percent. A bending model is developed and experimentally validated to predict and design the deformability of 2D heterostructures and how it evolves with the composition of the stack, the atomic arrangements at the interfaces, and the geometry of the structure. Notably, when each atomic layer is separated by heterointerfaces, the total bending stiffness reaches a theoretical minimum, equal to the sum of the constituent layers regardless of scale of deformation&#8212;lending the extreme deformability of 2D monolayers to device&#8208;compatible&#160;multilayers.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission for Deep Tumor&#8208;Penetrating Radio&#8208; and Radiodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination polymer nanoparticles constructed from a photosensitizer with aggregation&#8208;induced emission property (AIE PS) and the high&#8208;Z element hafnium (Hf) is fabricated through a solvothermal method. After PEGylation followed by bioorthogonal click chemistry, Hf&#8208;AIE&#8208;PEG&#8208;DBCO (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol); DBCO: dibenzocyclooctyne) can react on the surface of tumor cells to realize deep tumor&#8208;penetrating radiotherapy and radiodynamic therapy with enhanced tumor accumulation and extended tumor retention.








Abstract
Radiodynamic therapy (RDT), an emerging therapeutic approach for cancer treatment by employing ionizing irradiation to induce localized photodynamic therapy (PDT) can overcome the drawbacks of the limited penetration depth for traditional PDT and the unconcentrated energy in the tumor for traditional radiotherapy (RT). Taking advantage of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers with bright fluorescence and efficient singlet oxygen production in the aggregate state, Hf&#8208;AIE coordination polymer nanoparticles (CPNs), which show both strong RT and RDT effect under X&#8208;ray irradiation, are developed. Furthermore, to enhance the tumor accumulation and prolong the tumor retention of the CPNs, bioorthogonal click chemistry is applied in the system through coupling between dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified CPNs (Hf&#8208;AIE&#8208;PEG&#8208;DBCO) (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) and azide groups on the cell membrane formed by metabolic glycoengineering. Thanks to the high penetration of X&#8208;ray irradiation, the bioorthogonal&#8208;assisted RT and RDT combination therapy realizes significant killing of cancer cells without showing noticeable biotoxicity after intravenous administration of CPNs.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Antibiotic&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticle Specifically Binds Pathogens and Overcomes Antimicrobial&#8208;Resistant Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dextran&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticle is developed to target and eliminate antimicrobial&#8208;resistant pathogens. The NP can bind to lectins expressed by bacteria and accumulate in the infected tissues, releasing the antimicrobial in response to the inflammatory microenvironment, and overcoming antimicrobial resistance. The NP can eliminate biofilm and intracellular infections, and exhibits remarkable in vivo efficacy in treating antimicrobial&#8208;resistant infections.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infections are a growing threat to public health and there is a general lack of development in new antibiotics. Here, a dextran&#8208;coated stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP) that encapsulates the hydrophobic antibiotic, rifampicin, and specifically binds bacteria to overcome AMR infections is reported. The NP shows a strong affinity with a variety of pathogens in vitro and effectively accumulates in the bacterial infected tissues. The NP is activated by either low pH or high reactive oxygen species in the infectious microenvironment, and releases both cationic polymer and rifampicin that display synergistic activity against AMR pathogens. The NP carrier also enables the antibiotic to penetrate both bacterial biofilms and mammalian cells, thus allowing the elimination of biofilm and intracellular infections. The NP formulation demonstrates both safety and efficacy in two animal infection models against either Gram&#8208;negative or Gram&#8208;positive AMR pathogens.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization of Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Fused Silica Glass Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution 3D printing of photocurable silica nanocomposites using two&#8208;photon direct laser writing is presented. The nanocomposites are consecutively debound and sintered to high&#8208;quality fused silica microstructures with optical surface roughness.








Abstract
Fused silica glass is the material of choice for many high&#8208;performance components in optics due to its high optical transparency combined with its high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. Especially, the generation of fused silica microstructures is of high interest for microoptical and biomedical applications. Direct laser writing (DLW) is a suitable technique for generating such devices, as it enables nearly arbitrary structuring down to the sub&#8208;micrometer level. In this work, true 3D structuring of transparent fused silica glass using DLW with tens of micrometer resolution and a surface roughness of Ra&#160;&#8776; 6&#160;nm is demonstrated. The process uses a two&#8208;photon curable silica nanocomposite resin that can be structured by DLW, with the printout being convertible to transparent fused silica glass via thermal debinding and sintering. This technology will enable a plethora of applications from next&#8208;generation optics and photonics to microfluidic and biomedical applications with resolutions on the scale of tens of micrometers.

         <title>Materials Screening for Disorder&#8208;Controlled Chalcogenide Crystals for Phase&#8208;Change Memory Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio simulations and transport experiments elucidate why Sb2Te3 can form an insulating rocksalt structure, extending the exploration of Anderson insulators to binary chalcogenides. A systematic computational screening over binary and ternary chalcogenides, which leads to an in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is also carried out.








Abstract
Tailoring the degree of disorder in chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) plays an essential role in nonvolatile memory devices and neuro&#8208;inspired computing. Upon rapid crystallization from the amorphous phase, the flagship Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te PCMs form metastable rocksalt&#8208;like structures with an unconventionally high concentration of vacancies, which results in disordered crystals exhibiting Anderson&#8208;insulating transport behavior. Here, ab initio simulations and transport experiments are combined to extend these concepts to the parent compound of Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te alloys, viz., binary Sb2Te3, in the metastable rocksalt&#8208;type modification. Then a systematic computational screening over a wide range of homologous, binary and ternary chalcogenides, elucidating the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is carried out. The findings vastly expand the family of disorder&#8208;controlled main&#8208;group chalcogenides toward many more compositions with a tunable bandgap size for demanding phase&#8208;change applications, as well as a varying strength of spin&#8211;orbit interaction for the exploration of potential topological Anderson insulators.

&lt;p&gt;Ab initio simulations and transport experiments elucidate why Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can form an insulating rocksalt structure, extending the exploration of Anderson insulators to binary chalcogenides. A systematic computational screening over binary and ternary chalcogenides, which leads to an in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is also carried out.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tailoring the degree of disorder in chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) plays an essential role in nonvolatile memory devices and neuro&#8208;inspired computing. Upon rapid crystallization from the amorphous phase, the flagship Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te PCMs form metastable rocksalt&#8208;like structures with an unconventionally high concentration of vacancies, which results in disordered crystals exhibiting Anderson&#8208;insulating transport behavior. Here, ab initio simulations and transport experiments are combined to extend these concepts to the parent compound of Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te alloys, viz., binary Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, in the metastable rocksalt&#8208;type modification. Then a systematic computational screening over a wide range of homologous, binary and ternary chalcogenides, elucidating the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is carried out. The findings vastly expand the family of disorder&#8208;controlled main&#8208;group chalcogenides toward many more compositions with a tunable bandgap size for demanding phase&#8208;change applications, as well as a varying strength of spin&#8211;orbit interaction for the exploration of potential topological Anderson insulators.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthetic Kramers Pair in Phononic Elastic Plates and Helical Edge States on a Dislocation Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological origin of the &#8220;zone&#8208;folding&#8221; phononic topological insulator is revealed and its interpretation as an analog to the quantum spin Hall effect is shown to present key differences in comparison with its electronic counterpart. Also, the possibility of realizing two counter&#8208;propagating gapless helical edge states on a dislocation interface connecting two subdomains with bulk pattern identical up to a relative translation is shown.








Abstract
In conventional theories, topological band properties are intrinsic characteristics of the bulk material and do not depend on the choice of the reference frame. In this scenario, the principle of bulk&#8208;edge correspondence can be used to predict the existence of edge states between topologically distinct materials. In this study, a 2D elastic phononic plate is proposed with a Kekul&#233;&#8208;distorted honeycomb pattern engraved on it. It is found that the pseudospin and the pseudospin&#8208;dependent Chern numbers are not invariant properties, and the &#8484;2 number is no longer a sufficient indicator to examine the existence of the edge state. The distinctive pseudospin texture and the pseudomagnetic field are also revealed. Finally, the synthetic helical edge states are successfully devised and experimentally implemented on a dislocation interface connecting two subdomains with bulk pattern identical up to a relative translation. The edge state is also imaged via laser&#160;vibrometry.

         <title>Hybrid 0D Antimony Halides as Air&#8208;Stable Luminophores for High&#8208;Spatial&#8208;Resolution Remote Thermography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides are increasingly explored as thermal phosphors for high&#8208;resolution remote thermography and thermometry due to the high thermal sensitivity of their radiative lifetime. Thin films of such hybrids, conformally coating the surface of interest, can map the temperature with a spatial precision as high as 1 &#956;m using fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging.








Abstract
Luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides are of rising interest as thermographic phosphors. The intrinsic nature of the excitonic self&#8208;trapping provides for reliable temperature sensing due to the existence of a temperature range, typically 50&#8211;100 K wide, in which the luminescence lifetimes (and quantum yields) are steeply temperature&#8208;dependent. This sensitivity range can be adjusted from cryogenic temperatures to above room temperature by structural engineering, thus enabling diverse thermometric and thermographic applications ranging from protein crystallography to diagnostics in microelectronics. Owing to the stable oxidation state of Sb3+, Sb(III)&#8208;based halides are far more attractive than all major non&#8208;heavy&#8208;metal alternatives (Sn&#8208;, Ge&#8208;, Bi&#8208;based halides). In this work, the relationship between the luminescence characteristics and crystal structure and microstructure of TPP2SbBr5 (TPP = tetraphenylphosphonium) is established, and then its potential is showcased as environmentally stable and robust phosphor for remote thermography. The material is easily processable into thin films, which is highly beneficial for high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution remote thermography. In particular, a compelling combination of high spatial resolution (1&#160;&#181;m) and high thermometric precision (high specific sensitivities of 0.03&#8211;0.04 K&#8722;1) is demonstrated by fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging of a heated resistive pattern on a flat substrate, covered with a solution&#8208;spun film of TPP2SbBr5.

         <title>Strong Chemical Interaction between Lithium Polysulfides and Flame&#8208;Retardant Polyphosphazene for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Enhanced Safety and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a flame&#8208;retardant interlayer for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, polyphosphazene (PPZ) covalently modified holey graphene/carbonized cellulose paper can not only increase the electrochemical performance via strong chemical interaction between components, but also improves the safety of batteries due to the high and low temperature resistance property as well as the good flame&#8208;retardant characteristics of PPZ.








Abstract
The shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and potential safety hazard caused by the burning of flammable organic electrolytes, sulfur cathode, and lithium anode seriously limit the practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Here, a flame&#8208;retardant polyphosphazene (PPZ) covalently modified holey graphene/carbonized cellulose paper is reported as a multifunctional interlayer in Li&#8211;S batteries. During the discharge/charge process, once the LiPS are generated, the as&#8208;obtained flame&#8208;retardant interlayer traps them immediately through the nucleophilic substitution reaction between PPZ and LiPS, effectively inhibiting the shuttling effect of LiPS to enhance the cycle stability of Li&#8211;S batteries. Meanwhile, this strong chemical interaction increases the diffusion coefficient for lithium ions, accelerating the lithiation reaction with complete inversion. Moreover, the as&#8208;obtained interlayer can be used as a fresh 3D current collector to establish a flame&#8208;retardant &#8220;vice&#8208;electrode,&#8221; which can trap dissolved sulfur and absorb a large amount of electrolyte, prominently bringing down the flammability of the sulfur cathode and electrolyte to improve the safety of Li&#8211;S batteries. This work provides a viable strategy for using PPZ&#8208;based materials as strong chemical scavengers for LiPS and a flame&#8208;retardant interlayer toward next&#8208;generation Li&#8211;S batteries with enhanced safety and electrochemical performance.

         <title>Ultrathin and Conformable Lead Halide Perovskite Photodetector Arrays for Potential Application in Retina&#8208;Like Vision Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin lead halide perovskite photodetector arrays with a thickness of 2.4&#160;&#181;m are fabricated based on patterned all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 films. The device with excellent flexibility and conformal contact characteristics shows robust mechanical stability under bending or compressive strain. More importantly, it conforms to a hemispherical support realizing imaging of the light distribution, indicating potential applications in retina&#8208;like vision sensing.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed lead halide perovskites are considered one of the promising materials for flexible optoelectronics. However, the array integration of ultrathin flexible perovskite photodetectors (PDs) remains a significant challenge limited by the incompatibility of perovskite materials with manufacturing techniques involving polar liquids. Here, an ultrathin (2.4&#160;&#181;m) and conformable perovskite&#8208;based PD array (10 &#215; 10 pixels) with ultralight weight (3.12&#160;g m&#8722;2) and excellent flexibility, is reported. Patterned all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite films with precise pixel position, controllable morphology, and homogenous dimension, are synthesized by a vacuum&#8208;assisted drop&#8208;casting patterning process as the active layer. The use of waterproof parylene&#8208;C film as substrate and encapsulation layer effectively protects the perovskite films against penetration of polar liquids during the peeling&#8208;off process. Benefitting from the encapsulation and ultrathin property, the device exhibits long&#8208;term stability in the ambient environment, and robust mechanical stability under bending or 50% compressive strain. More importantly, the ultrathin flexible PD arrays conforming to hemispherical support realize imaging of light distribution, indicating the potential applications in retina&#8208;like vision sensing.

More importantly, the ultrathin flexible PD arrays conforming to hemispherical support realize imaging of light distribution, indicating the potential applications in retina&#8208;like vision sensing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization: Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization of Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Fused Silica Glass Microstructures (Adv. Mater. 9/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glass is one of the most important materials for optical applications but it is difficult to shape on the microscale. In article number 2006341, Frederik Kotz and co&#8208;workers present two&#8208;photon polymerization of nanocomposites, which are subsequently converted to transparent fused silica glass. The cover shows a glass microtower fabricated by this process.

         <title>Fused Aromatic Network Structures: Fused Aromatic Network with Exceptionally High Carrier Mobility (Adv. Mater. 9/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004707, Joon Hak Oh, Jong&#8208;Beom Baek, and co&#8208;workers report the design and synthesis of fused aromatic network structures with C5N basal plane stoichiometry. Thin films cast onto silicon dioxide substrates from the C5N solution exhibit ambipolar charge transport and extraordinary high electron and hole mobilities in field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) devices, superior to the performance of most pristine organic materials without doping.

         <title>2D Materials: Designing the Bending Stiffness of 2D Material Heterostructures (Adv. Mater. 9/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single graphene sheet is stacked on top of monolayer MoS2. The 2D heterostructure is buckled out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, inducing bending in both layers. In article number 2007269, Arend M. van der Zande, Pinshane Y. Huang, and co&#8208;workers study the impact of interfacial engineering on the tunability of the bending stiffness in 2D multilayers. A bending model is developed to predict and design the deformability of any arbitrary 2D heterostructure.

In article number 2007982, Holger Steeb, Sabine Ludwigs, and co&#8208;workers present humidity&#8208;triggered bending actuators based on simple polymer bilayers and their in&#8208;depth mechanical characterization. A loop consisting of the mechanical characterization and a simple analytical model allows the prediction of deformations of in principle any complex geometry and material combination, for example, for moving parts and curvatures in soft robotics.

         <title>Phononic Waveguides: Synthetic Kramers Pair in Phononic Elastic Plates and Helical Edge States on a Dislocation Interface (Adv. Mater. 9/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2005160, Fabio Semperlotti and Ting&#8208;Wei Liu present a structural phononic waveguide engraved with a Kekule pattern, which enables performance analogous to a topological insulator. The elastic modes present a unique pseudospin texture distinct from its electronic counterpart. Backscattering&#8208;immune gapless edge states on a dislocation interface are realized and imaged via laser vibrometry.

Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene plays a significant role in photocatalysis. Rational design, preparation, and understanding the mechanism of N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;based photocatalysts provides a new opportunity to further enhance the photocatalytic performance. The research progress, atomic and band structures, photocatalytic mechanism, synthesis strategy, unique advantages, and wide application of N&#8208;doped graphene in photocatalysis are highlighted.








Abstract
Solving energy and environmental problems through solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis is an attractive and challenging topic. Hence, various types of photocatalysts have been developed successively to address the demands of photocatalysis. Graphene&#8208;based materials have elicited considerable attention since the discovery of graphene. As a derivative of graphene, nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) particularly stands out. Nitrogen atoms can break the undifferentiated structure of graphene and open the bandgap while endowing graphene with an uneven electron density distribution. Therefore, NG retains nearly all the advantages of original graphene and is equipped with several novel properties, ensuring infinite possibilities for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis. This review introduces the atomic and band structures of NG, summarizes in situ and ex situ synthesis methods, highlights the mechanism and advantages of NG in photocatalysis, and outlines its applications in different photocatalysis directions (primarily hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, and as photoactive ingredient). Lastly, the central challenges and possible improvements of NG&#8208;based photocatalysis in the future are presented. This study is expected to learn from the past and achieve progress toward the future for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis.

         <title>Liquid Metals: A Novel Possibility of Fabricating 2D Metal Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the fabrication of 2D metal oxides (2DMOs) via liquid metals are comprehensively reviewed. The introduction of progress in fabricating 2DMOs by virtue of the features of liquid metals improves diversity in the development and applications of 2DMOs. The current challenges concerning the fabrication of 2DMOs are discussed to promote future research.








Abstract
2D metal oxides (2DMOs) have been widely applied in the fields of electronic, magnetic, optical, and catalytic materials, owing to their rich surface chemistry and unique electronic structures. However, their further development faces challenges such as the difficulty in fabricating 2DMOs with unstable surface induced by strong surface polarizability, or the high cost and limited yield of the fabrication process. Recently, liquid metals have shown great potential in the fabrication of 2DMOs. The native oxide skin formed on the surface of liquid metals can be considered as a perfect 2D planar material. Due to the solubility, fluidity, and reactivity of liquid metals, they can act as the solvent, reactant, and interface in the fabrication of 2DMOs. Moreover, liquid metals undergo a liquid&#8211;solid phase transition, enabling them to be a symmetric matched substrate for growing high&#8208;quality 2DMOs. An insightful survey of the recent progress in this research direction is presented. The features of liquid metals including good solubility, chemical reactivity, weak interface force, and liquid&#8211;solid phase transitions are introduced in detail. Furthermore, strategies for the fabrication of 2DMOs by virtue of these features are summarized comprehensively. Finally, current challenges and prospects regarding the future development in the fabrication of 2DMOs via liquid metals are highlighted.

         <title>MnO2&#8208;Based Materials for Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent experimental and computational research progress on modulation of MnO2 single&#8208;species and MnO2&#8208;based composites for environmental applications are summarized. MnO2 single&#8208;species can be modified through morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping while MnO2&#8208;based composites can be tuned by construction of homojunctions, MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary heterojunctions, and MnO2&#8208;based ternary heterojunctions.








Abstract
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a promising photo&#8211;thermo&#8211;electric&#8208;responsive semiconductor material for environmental applications, owing to its various favorable properties. However, the unsatisfactory environmental purification efficiency of this material has limited its further applications. Fortunately, in the last few years, significant efforts have been undertaken for improving the environmental purification efficiency of this material and understanding its underlying mechanism. Here, the aim is to summarize the recent experimental and computational research progress in the modification of MnO2 single species by morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping. Moreover, the design and fabrication of MnO2&#8208;based composites via the construction of homojunctions and MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary/ternary heterojunctions is discussed. Their applications in environmental purification systems, either as an adsorbent material for removing heavy metals, dyes, and microwave (MW) pollution, or as a thermal catalyst, photocatalyst, and electrocatalyst for the degradation of pollutants (water and gas, organic and inorganic) are also highlighted. Finally, the research gaps are summarized and a perspective on the challenges and the direction of future research in nanostructured MnO2&#8208;based materials in the field of environmental applications is presented. Therefore, basic guidance for rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency MnO2&#8208;based materials for comprehensive environmental applications is provided.

         <title>A Brief History of OLEDs&#8212;Emitter Development and Industry Milestones</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The history of emitter development and industry's interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology are reviewed. OLED device technology has equally inspired and driven innovation in academia and industry. Three generations of emitters based on different emission mechanisms have been designed. Recently, research in both academia and industry points toward a fourth generation of light&#8208;emitting materials for OLEDs.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have come a long way ever since their first introduction in 1987 at Eastman Kodak. Today, OLEDs are especially valued in the display and lighting industry for their promising features. As one of the research fields that equally inspires and drives development in academia and industry, OLED device technology has continuously evolved over more than 30&#160;years. OLED devices have come forward based on three generations of emitter materials relying on fluorescence (first generation), phosphorescence (second generation), and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (third generation). Furthermore, research in academia and industry toward the fourth generation of OLEDs is in progress. Excerpts from the history of green, orange&#8208;red, and blue OLED emitter development on the side of academia and milestones achieved by key players in the industry are included in this report.

         <title>RhSe2: A Superior 3D Electrocatalyst with Multiple Active Facets for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Both Acid and Alkaline Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D structured transition metal sulfide, RhSe2, is synthesized, which exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction in both acid and alkaline electrolyte.








Abstract
Layered 2D materials are a vital class of electrocatalys for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), due to their large area, excellent activity, and facile fabrication. Theoretical caculations domenstrate, however, that only the edges of the 2D nanosheets act as active sites, while the much larger basal plane exhibits passive activity. Here, from a distinguishing perspective, RhSe2 is reported as a &#8220;3D&#8221; electrocatalyst for HER with top&#8208;class activity, synthesized by a facile solid&#8208;state method. Superior to 2D materials, multiple crystal facets of RhSe2 exhibit near&#8208;zero free energy change of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH), which guarantees high performance in most common morphologies. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the low&#8208;coordinated Rh atoms act as the active sites in acid, which enables the modified Kubas&#8208;mediated pathway, while the Se atoms act as the active sites in an alkaline medium. The overpotentials of HER activity of RhSe2 are measured to be 49.9 and 81.6&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in acid and alkaline solutions, respectively. This work paves the way to new transition metal chalcogenide catalysts.

         <title>Rational Design of High&#8208;Concentration Ti3+ in Porous Carbon&#8208;Doped TiO2 Nanosheets for Efficient Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 9, March 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous carbon&#8208;doped anatase TiOx (C&#8208;TiOx) nanosheet with controllable Ti3+ concentration is prepared by a reproducible bottom&#8208;up strategy. The optimal C&#8208;TiOx with high&#8208;concentration Ti3+ exhibits a NH3 production rate of 109.3 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 1.1% at 400&#160;nm, the highest compared with all previously reported TiO2&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Photocatalytic ammonia synthesis is exciting but quite challenging with a very moderate yield at present. One of the greatest challenges is to develop highly active centers in a photocatalyst for N2 reduction under ambient conditions. Herein, porous carbon&#8208;doped anatase TiOx (C&#8208;TiOx) nanosheets with high&#8208;concentration active sites of Ti3+ are presented, which are produced by layered Ti3SiC2 through a reproducible bottom&#8208;up approach. It is shown that the high&#8208;concentration Ti3+ sites are the major species for the significant increase in N2 photoreduction activity by the C&#8208;TiOx. Such bottom&#8208;up substitutional doping of C into TiO2 is responsible for both visible absorption and generation of Ti3+ concentration. Together with the porous nanosheets morphology and the loading of a Ru/RuO2 nanosized cocatalyst for enhanced charge separation and transfer, the optimal C&#8208;TiOx with a Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio of 72.1% shows a high NH3 production rate of 109.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 1.1% at 400&#160;nm, which is the highest compared to all TiO2&#8208;based photocatalysts at present.

         <title>Non&#8208;Solvent Induced Phase Separation Enables Designer Redox Flow Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation is introduced as a versatile and facile method to synthesize redox flow battery electrodes with hierarchical microstructures unachievable via conventional manufacturing approaches. Flow cell studies reveal that the novel materials can outperform conventional carbon fiber electrodes owing to better mass transfer and higher surface area, demonstrating that this method may enable new classes of porous electrodes tailored for particular electrochemical flow technologies.








Abstract
Porous carbonaceous electrodes are performance&#8208;defining components in redox flow batteries (RFBs), where their properties impact the efficiency, cost, and durability of the system. The overarching challenge is to simultaneously fulfill multiple seemingly contradictory requirements&#8212;i.e., high surface area, low pressure drop, and facile mass transport&#8212;without sacrificing scalability or manufacturability. Here, non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) is proposed as a versatile method to synthesize tunable porous structures suitable for use as RFB electrodes. The variation of the relative concentration of scaffold&#8208;forming polyacrylonitrile to pore&#8208;forming poly(vinylpyrrolidone) is demonstrated to result in electrodes with distinct microstructure and porosity. Tomographic microscopy, porosimetry, and spectroscopy are used to characterize the 3D structure and surface chemistry. Flow cell studies with two common redox species (i.e., all&#8208;vanadium and Fe2+/3+) reveal that the novel electrodes can outperform traditional carbon fiber electrodes. It is posited that the bimodal porous structure, with interconnected large (&gt;50 &#181;m) macrovoids in the through&#8208;plane direction and smaller (&lt;5 &#181;m) pores throughout, provides a favorable balance between offsetting traits. Although nascent, the NIPS synthesis approach has the potential to serve as a technology platform for the development of porous electrodes specifically designed to enable electrochemical flow technologies.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Range Oxygen Redox in P2&#8208;Layered Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 with native transitional metal (TM) vacancies is designed as a novel cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The TM vacancies lead to nonbonding O 2p orbitals in this material, pointing toward these vacancies triggering reversible whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;range oxygen redox during charge and discharge processes. This work provides new ideals for design of cathode materials in anionic redox chemistry.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;redox of layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;oxide cathodes has drawn great attention as an effective approach to break through the bottleneck of their capacity limit. However, reversible oxygen&#8208;redox can only be obtained in the high&#8208;voltage region (usually over 3.5 V) in current metal&#8208;oxide cathodes. Here, we realize reversible oxygen&#8208;redox in a wide voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V in a P2&#8208;layered Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 cathode material, where intrinsic vacancies are located in transition&#8208;metal (TM) sites and Mg&#8208;ions are located in Na sites. Mg&#8208;ions in the Na layer serve as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to stabilize the layered structure during electrochemical cycling, especially in the high&#8208;voltage region. Intrinsic vacancies in the TM layer create the local configurations of &#8220;&#9633;&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Na&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; and &#8220;Mg&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; to trigger oxygen&#8208;redox in the whole voltage range of charge&#8211;discharge. Time&#8208;resolved techniques demonstrate that the P2 phase is well maintained in a wide potential window range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V even at 10 C. It is revealed that charge compensation from Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;ions contributes to the whole voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V, while the redox of Fe&#8208;ions only contributes to the high&#8208;voltage region of 3.0&#8211;4.5 V. The orphaned electrons in the nonbonding 2p orbitals of O that point toward TM&#8208;vacancy sites are responsible for reversible oxygen&#8208;redox, and Mg&#8208;ions in Na sites suppress oxygen release effectively.

A plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods through manganese dioxide coating is explored for activatable photoacoustic/magnetic resonance duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal&#8208;chemodynamic therapy in the second near&#8208;infrared window.








Abstract
Nanotheranostic agents of gold nanomaterials in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window have attracted significant attention in cancer management, owing to the reduced background signal and deeper penetration depth in tissues. However, it is still challenging to modulate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of gold nanomaterials from the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) to NIR&#8208;II region. Herein, a plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods (GNRs) through manganese dioxide coating is developed for NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic/magnetic resonance (MR) duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal chemodynamic therapy. GNRs are coated with silica dioxide (SiO2) and then covered with magnesium dioxide (MnO2) to obtain the final product of GNR@SiO2@MnO2 (denoted as GSM). The LSPR peak of GNRs could be tuned by adjusting the thickness of the MnO2 layer. Theoretical simulations reveal that this plasmonic modulation is mainly due to the change of refraction index around the GNRs after coating with the MnO2 layer. Additionally, the MnO2 layer is demonstrated to degrade into Mn2+ ions in response to peroxide and acidic protons in the tumor microenvironment, which allows for MR imaging and chemodynamic therapy. This plasmonic modulation strategy can be adapted to other metal nanomaterials and the construction of a new class of NIR&#8208;II nanotheranostics.

&lt;p&gt;Nanotheranostic agents of gold nanomaterials in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window have attracted significant attention in cancer management, owing to the reduced background signal and deeper penetration depth in tissues. However, it is still challenging to modulate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of gold nanomaterials from the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) to NIR&#8208;II region. Herein, a plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods (GNRs) through manganese dioxide coating is developed for NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic/magnetic resonance (MR) duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal chemodynamic therapy. GNRs are coated with silica dioxide (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and then covered with magnesium dioxide (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to obtain the final product of GNR@SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (denoted as GSM). The LSPR peak of GNRs could be tuned by adjusting the thickness of the MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer. Theoretical simulations reveal that this plasmonic modulation is mainly due to the change of refraction index around the GNRs after coating with the MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer. Additionally, the MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer is demonstrated to degrade into Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in response to peroxide and acidic protons in the tumor microenvironment, which allows for MR imaging and chemodynamic therapy. This plasmonic modulation strategy can be adapted to other metal nanomaterials and the construction of a new class of NIR&#8208;II nanotheranostics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineering the Optical Emission and Robustness of Metal&#8208;Halide Layered Perovskites through Ligand Accommodation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic component in 2D layered perovskites can grant access to many possibilities for material design, in view of the rich variety. This work shows how the choice of the structure and chain length of organic cations can effectively guide the precise design of the emission color and efficiency of such versatile nanomaterials.








Abstract
The unique combination of organic and inorganic layers in 2D layered perovskites offers promise for the design of a variety of materials for mechatronics, flexoelectrics, energy conversion, and lighting. However, the potential tailoring of their properties through the organic building blocks is not yet well understood. Here, different classes of organoammonium molecules are exploited to engineer the optical emission and robustness of a new set of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper metal&#8208;halide layered perovskites. It is shown that the type of molecule regulates the number of hydrogen bonds that it forms with the edge&#8208;sharing [PbBr6]4&#8208; octahedra layers, leading to strong differences in the material emission and tunability of the color coordinates, from deep&#8208;blue to pure&#8208;white. Also, the emission intensity strongly depends on the length of the molecules, thereby providing an additional parameter to optimize their emission efficiency. The combined experimental and computational study provides a detailed understanding of the impact of lattice distortions, compositional defects, and the anisotropic crystal structure on the emission of such layered materials. It is foreseen that this rational design can be extended to other types of organic linkers, providing a yet unexplored path to tailor the optical and mechanical properties of these materials and to unlock new functionalities.

         <title>Fabrication of Quasi&#8208;2D Shape&#8208;Tailored Microparticles using Wettability Contrast&#8208;Based Platforms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin polymeric films with well&#8208;defined lateral size and geometry are fabricated taking advantage of the wettability contrast of oleophilic&#8211;oleophobic patterned surfaces. Cells mediate the pliability of quasi&#8208;2D films, and their integration in 3D cellular aggregates leads to enhanced cell metabolic activity and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor.








Abstract
The ability to fabricate materials with ultrathin architectures enables the breakthrough of low&#8208;dimensional structures with high surface area that showcase distinctive properties from their bulk counterparts. They are exploited in a wide range of fields, including energy harvesting, catalysis, and biomedicine. Despite such versatility, the fine tuning of the lateral dimensions and geometry of these structures remains challenging. Prepatterned platforms gain significant attention as enabling technologies to process materials with highly controlled shapes and dimensions. Herein, different nanometer&#8208;thick particles of various lateral sizes and geometries (e.g., squares, circles, triangles, hexagons) are processed with high precision and definition, taking advantage of the wettability contrast of oleophilic&#8211;oleophobic patterned surfaces. Quasi&#8208;2D polymeric microparticles with high shape&#8208; and size&#8208;fidelity can be retrieved as freestanding objects in a single step. These structures show cell&#8208;mediated pliability, and their integration in gravity&#8208;enforced human adipose&#8208;derived stem cell spheroids leads to an enhanced metabolic activity and a modulated secretion of proangiogenic factors.

         <title>Biologically Plausible Artificial Synaptic Array: Replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; Memory Curve with Selective Attention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the memorization process of the human brain, an artificial synaptic array is developed, which mimics the biological memorization process by replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; forgetting curve. To construct the artificial synaptic array, signal&#8208;transmitting access transistors and artificial synaptic memory transistors are designed using indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc&#8208;oxide and poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), respectively.








Abstract
The nature of repetitive learning and oblivion of memory enables humans to effectively manage vast amounts of memory by prioritizing information for long&#8208;term storage. Inspired by the memorization process of the human brain, an artificial synaptic array is presented, which mimics the biological memorization process by replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; forgetting curve. To construct the artificial synaptic array, signal&#8208;transmitting access transistors and artificial synaptic memory transistors are designed using indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc&#8208;oxide and poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), respectively. To secure the desired performance of the access transistor in regulating the input signal to the synaptic transistor, the content of gallium in the access transistor is optimized. In addition, the operation voltage of the synaptic transistor is carefully selected to achieve memory&#8208;state efficiency. Repetitive learning characterizing Ebbinghaus&#8217; oblivion curves is realized using an artificial synaptic array with optimized conditions for both transistor components. This successfully demonstrates a biologically plausible memorization process. Furthermore, selective attention for information prioritization in the human brain is mimicked by selectively applying repetitive learning to a synaptic transistor with a high memory state. The demonstrated biologically plausible artificial synaptic array provides great scope for advancement in bioinspired electronics.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are excellent delivery vehicles for various therapeutic agents. EVs are engineered to improve their efficiency, specificity, and safety for cancer therapy. A comprehensive overview of advanced strategies for engineering EVs is given. Additionally, potential applications of engineered EVs in cancer therapy and the challenges for translating them into clinical practice are discussed.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a novel cell&#8208;free strategy for the treatment of many diseases including cancer. As a result of their natural properties to mediate cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication and their high physiochemical stability and biocompatibility, EVs are considered as excellent delivery vehicles for a variety of therapeutic agents such as nucleic acids and proteins, drugs, and nanomaterials. Increasing studies have shown that EVs can be modified, engineered, or designed to improve their efficiency, specificity, and safety for cancer therapy. Herein, a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the strategies and methodologies of engineering EVs for scalable production and improved cargo&#8208;loading and tumor&#8208;targeting is provided. Additionally, the potential applications of engineered EVs in cancer therapy are discussed by presenting prominent examples, and the opportunities and challenges for translating engineered EVs into clinical practice are evaluated.

         <title>2D Homojunctions for Electronics and Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The booming development of 2D homojunctions has received tremendous attention over the past years. The recent research progress on the construction strategies and device applications in electronics and optoelectronics are comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
In the post&#8208;Moore era, 2D materials with rich physical properties have attracted widespread attention from the scientific and industrial communities. Among 2D materials, the 2D homojunctions are of great promise in designing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices due to their unique geometries and properties such as homogeneous components, perfect lattice matching, and efficient charge transfer at the interface. In this article, a pioneering review focusing on the structural design and device application of 2D homojunctions such as p&#8211;n homojunctions, heterophase homojunctions, and layer&#8208;engineered homojunctions is provided. The preparation strategies to construct 2D homojunctions including vapor&#8208;phase deposition, lithium intercalation, laser irradiation, chemical doping, electrostatic doping, and photodoping are summarized in detail. Specifically, a careful review on the applications of the 2D homojunctions in electronics (e.g., field&#8208;effect transistors, rectifiers, and inverters) and optoelectronics (e.g., light&#8208;emitting diodes, photovoltaics, and photodetectors) is provided. Eventually, the current challenges and future perspectives are commented for promoting the rapid development of 2D homojunctions.

         <title>A Polymer Multicellular Nanoengager for Synergistic NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer nanoengager (SPNE) with both tumor&#8208;associated antigens and T cell stimulating factors is designed to elicit potent multicellular engagement among tumor cells and immunocytes, enabling dual vaccination effects on both dendritic cells and T cells. Thus, the SPNE mediates synergistic second&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy that efficiently inhibits tumor growth and metastasis.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (CCNPs) that integrate the biophysiological advantages of cell membranes with the multifunctionalities of synthetic materials hold great promise in cancer immunotherapy. However, strategies have yet to be revealed to further improve their immunotherapeutic efficacy. Herein, a polymer multicellular nanoengager (SPNE) for synergistic second&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy is reported. The nanoengager consists of an NIR&#8208;II absorbing polymer as the photothermal core, which is camouflaged with fused membranes derived from immunologically engineered tumor cells and dendritic cells (DCs) as the cancer vaccine shell. In association with the high accumulation in lymph nodes and tumors, the multicellular engagement ability of the SPNE enables effective cross&#8208;interactions among tumor cells, DCs, and T cells, leading to augmented T cell activation relative to bare or tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;coated nanoparticles. Upon deep&#8208;tissue penetrating NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, SPNE eradicates the tumor and induces immunogenic cell death, further eliciting anti&#8208;tumor T cell immunity. Such a synergistic photothermal immunotherapeutic effect eventually inhibits tumor growth, prevents metastasis and procures immunological memory. Thus, this study presents a general cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coating approach to develop photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic agents for cancer therapy.

         <title>Mimicking Nature's Butterflies: Electrochromic Devices with Dual&#8208;Sided Differential Colorations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Janus&#8208;structured electrochromic devices are evolved from traditional electrochromic structures by inserting an optically thin (4&#8211;8 nm) metallic layer with&#160;complex refractive index. These unique differentially colored devices are used to mimick the butterfly Kallima inachus, which closely resembles a dry leaf when its wings are close and exhibits various bright colors when its wings are open.








Abstract
Some butterfly species such as the orange oakleaf (Kallima inachus) have strikingly different colors on the dorsal (front) sides of their wings compared to those on the ventral (back) sides of their wings, which helps camouflage the butterflies from predators and attract potential mates. However, few human&#8208;made materials, devices, and technologies can mimic such differential coloring for a long time. Here, a new type of Janus&#8208;structured two&#8208;sided electrochromic device is developed that, upon application of different voltages, exhibits a coloration state on one side that is distinctly different from that on the other side. This is achieved by inserting an optically thin (4&#8211;8 nm) metallic layer with a complex refractive index, such as a layer composed of tungsten, titanium, copper or silver, into typical electrochromic structures.

         <title>Trap Energy Upconversion&#8208;Like Near&#8208;Infrared to Near&#8208;Infrared Light Rejuvenateable Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new paradigm of trap energy upconversion&#8208;like near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to NIR light rejuvenateable persistent luminescence in bismuth&#8208;doped calcium stannate phosphors and nanoparticles is reported. These materials enable the occurrence of a reversed transition of the carriers from a deep&#8208;level energy trap to a shallow&#8208;level trap upon excitation by low&#8208;energy NIR photons. Thus they can be charged circularly via deep&#8208;tissue penetrable NIR photons.








Abstract
Persistent&#8208;luminescence phosphors (PLPs) have a wide variety of applications in the fields of photonics and biophotonics due to their ultralong afterglow lifetime. However, the existing PLPs are charged and recharged with short&#8208;wavelength high&#8208;energy photons or inconvenient and potentially risky X&#8208;ray beams. To date, deep tissue penetrable NIR light has mainly been used for photostimulated afterglow emission, which continues to decay and weaken after each cycle, Herein, a new paradigm of trap energy upconversion&#8208;like near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to near&#8208;infrared light rejuvenateable persistent luminescence in bismuth&#8208;doped calcium stannate phosphors and nanoparticles is reported. In contrast to the existing PLPs and persistent&#8208;luminescence nanoparticles, the materials enable the occurrence of a reversed transition of the carriers from a deep&#8208;level energy trap to a shallow&#8208;level trap upon excitation by low&#8208;energy NIR photons. Thus these new materials can be charged circularly via deep&#8208;tissue penetrable NIR photons, which is unable to be done for existing PLPs, and emit afterglow signals. This conceptual work will lay the foundation to design new categories of NIR&#8208;absorptive&#8211;NIR&#8208;emissive PLPs and nanoparticles featuring physically harmless and deep tissue penetrable NIR light renewability and sets the stage for numerous biological applications, which have been limited by current materials.

         <title>Water&#8211;Salt Oligomers Enable Supersoluble Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8211;salt oligomers break through the physical solubility limits of aqueous electrolytes, enabling high&#8208;capacity rechargeable batteries based on zinc&#8211;halogen chemistry. The polymer&#8208;like characters of such electrolytes are confirmed by relatively large molecular&#8208;ion peaks and low glass&#8208;transition temperatures. In situ electrochemical technologies reveal a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into the graphene cathode during charging, accounting for the high capacity of the assembled batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable batteries are highly safe, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly, but restricted by low energy density. One of the most efficient solutions is to improve the concentration of the aqueous electrolytes. However, each salt is limited by its physical solubility, generally below 21&#8211;32&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1 (m). Here, a ZnCl2/ZnBr2/Zn(OAc)2 aqueous electrolyte with a record super&#8208;solubility up to 75 m is reported, which breaks through the physical solubility limit. This is attributed to the formation of acetate&#8208;capped water&#8211;salt oligomers bridged by Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;&#8208;H and Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;/O&#8208;Zn2+ interactions. Mass spectrometry indicates that acetate anions containing nonpolarized protons prohibit the overgrowth and precipitation of ionic oligomers. The polymer&#8208;like glass transition temperature of such inorganic electrolytes is found at &#8776;&#8722;70 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, without the observation of peaks for salt&#8208;crystallization and water&#8208;freezing from 40 to &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C. This supersoluble electrolyte enables high&#8208;performance aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries that exhibit a reversible capacity of 605.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, corresponding to an energy density of 908.5&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, with a coulombic efficiency of 98.07%. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman technologies reveal that such high ionic concentrations of the supersoluble electrolyte enable a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into macroscopically assembled graphene cathode.

This is attributed to the formation of acetate&#8208;capped water&#8211;salt oligomers bridged by Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;H and Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/O&#8208;Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; interactions. Mass spectrometry indicates that acetate anions containing nonpolarized protons prohibit the overgrowth and precipitation of ionic oligomers. The polymer&#8208;like glass transition temperature of such inorganic electrolytes is found at &lt;b&gt;&#8776;&#8722;&lt;/b&gt;70 to &lt;b&gt;&#8722;&lt;/b&gt;60&#160;&lt;b&gt;&#176;&lt;/b&gt;C, without the observation of peaks for salt&#8208;crystallization and water&#8208;freezing from 40 to &lt;b&gt;&#8722;&lt;/b&gt;80&#160;&lt;b&gt;&#176;&lt;/b&gt;C. This supersoluble electrolyte enables high&#8208;performance aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries that exhibit a reversible capacity of 605.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to an energy density of 908.5&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with a coulombic efficiency of 98.07%. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman technologies reveal that such high ionic concentrations of the supersoluble electrolyte enable a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into macroscopically assembled graphene cathode.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Programmable Phototaxis of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Particle Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic microswimmers with precise light&#8208;driven velocities are engineered with promise for robotics, drug delivery, and environmental applications. Various cargos with distinct spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the microswimmers to tune the specific wavelengths of light that lead to motion under ultraviolet, blue, green, and orange light.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven directional motion is common in nature but remains a challenge for synthetic microparticles, particularly regarding collective motion on a macroscopic scale. Successfully engineering microparticles with light&#8208;driven collective motion could lead to breakthroughs in drug delivery, contaminant sensing, environmental remediation, and artificial life. Herein, metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers capable of autonomously sensing and swimming toward an external light source are reported, with the speed regulated by the wavelength and intensity of illumination. These microswimmers can travel macroscopic distances (centimeters) and can remain illuminated for hours without degradation of motility. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that motion is generated through chemical transformations of the organic component of the metal&#8211;phenolic complex. Furthermore, cargos with specific spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the particles and endow the particle microswimmers with activated motion corresponding to these spectral characteristics. The programmable nature of the light navigation, tunable size of the particles, and versatility of cargo loading demonstrate the versatility of these metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers.

         <title>Degradable Poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;Based Supramolecular Plastics with High Mechanical Strength in a Watery Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Completely degradable and easily processable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based supramolecular plastics are fabricated by complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA, hydrophobic humic acid, and Fe3+ ions. In watery environments, the plastics have a mechanical strength similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. The PVA&#8208;based plastics can completely degrade into nontoxic species after being placed under soil for approximately 108 d.








Abstract
It is challenging to fabricate degradable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based plastics that can be used in watery environments because PVA is soluble in water. In this study, PVA&#8208;based supramolecular plastics with excellent degradability in soil and high mechanical strength in watery environments are fabricated by the complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA (VPVA), hydrophobic humic acid (HA), and Fe3+ ions (hereafter denoted as VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes). Large&#8208;area PVA&#8208;based plastics can be easily prepared from a solution of VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes using a blade&#8208;coating method. The high&#8208;density of hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, as well as the reinforcement of self&#8208;assembled Fe3+&#8208;chelated HA nanoparticles, facilitate the fabrication of PVA&#8208;based plastics with a breaking strength of &#8776;85.0&#160;MPa. After immersion in water at room temperature for 7 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics exhibit a breaking strength of &#8776;26.2&#160;MPa, which is similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. Furthermore, owing to the reversibility of the hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, the VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe plastics are recyclable and can be conveniently processed into plastic products with desired shapes. After being placed under soil for &#8776;108 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics are completely degraded into nontoxic species without requiring manual interference.

         <title>Reducing Energy Disorder of Hole Transport Layer by Charge Transfer Complex for High Performance p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;transfer complex strategy to reduce the energy disorder of the organic semiconductor (OS) charge transport layers (CTLs) by doping a well&#8208;designed OS (BDT&#8208;Si) with electron&#8208;acceptor features in a commercial hole&#8208;transport material (PTAA) is proposed. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells with the optimized hole&#8208;transport layer exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87%, and good operating stability at maximum power point under continuous illumination.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed organic semiconductor charge&#8208;transport layers (OS&#8208;CTLs) with high mobility, low trap density, and energy level alignment have dominated the important progress in p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). Unfortunately, their inevitable long chains result in weak molecular stacking, which is likely to generate high energy disorder and deteriorate the charge&#8208;transport ability of OS&#8208;CTLs. Here, a charge&#8208;transfer complex (CTC) strategy to reduce the energy disorder in the OS&#8208;CTLs by doping an organic semiconductor, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(4,8&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline) (BDT&#8208;Si), in a commercial hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL), poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl) (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA), is proposed. The formation of the CTC makes the PTAA conjugated backbone electron&#8208;deficient, resulting in a quinoidal and stiffer character, which is likely to planarize the PTAA backbone and enhance the ordering of the film in nanoscale. The resultant HTL exhibits a reduced energy disorder, which simultaneously promotes hole transport in the HTL, hole extraction at the interface, energy level alignment, and quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting in the device. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar pero&#8208;SCs with optimized HTL exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87% with good operating stability. This finding demonstrates that the CTC strategy is an effective way to reduce the energy disorder in HTLs and to improve the performance of planar pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>A Flash&#8208;Induced Robust Cu Electrode on Glass Substrates and Its Application for Thin&#8208;Film &#956;LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash&#8208;induced robust Cu on a glass substrate for inorganic&#8208;based micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#956;LEDs) is developed by chemical/physical interlocking. The Cu2O layer at Cu/glass interface and Cu nano&#8208;interlocking resolve the inherent lattice mismatch for strong electrode adhesion, resulting in high optical power (41&#160;mW mm&#8211;2) of AlGaInP vertical thin&#8208;film &#956;LED and robust &#956;LED operation under severe environmental stresses.








Abstract
A robust Cu conductor on a glass substrate for thin&#8208;film &#956;LEDs using the flash&#8208;induced chemical/physical interlocking between Cu and glass is reported. During millisecond light irradiation, CuO nanoparticles (NPs) on the display substrate are transformed into a conductive Cu film by reduction and sintering. At the same time, intensive heating at the boundary of CuO NPs and glass chemically induces the formation of an ultrathin Cu2O interlayer within the Cu/glass interface for strong adhesion. Cu nanointerlocking occurs by transient glass softening and interface fluctuation to increase the contact area. Owing to these flash&#8208;induced interfacial interactions, the flash&#8208;activated Cu electrode exhibits an adhesion energy of 10&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2, which is five times higher than that of vacuum&#8208;deposited Cu. An AlGaInP thin&#8208;film vertical &#956;LED (VLED) forms an electrical interconnection with the flash&#8208;induced Cu electrode via an ACF bonding process, resulting in a high optical power density of 41&#160;mW&#160;mm&#8722;2. The Cu conductor enables reliable VLED operation regardless of harsh thermal stress and moisture infiltration under a high&#8208;temperature storage test, temperature humidity test, and thermal shock test. 50 &#215; 50 VLED arrays transferred onto the flash&#8208;induced robust Cu electrode show high illumination yield and uniform distribution of forward voltage, peak wavelength, and device temperature.

The Cu conductor enables reliable VLED operation regardless of harsh thermal stress and moisture infiltration under a high&#8208;temperature storage test, temperature humidity test, and thermal shock test. 50 &lt;b&gt;&#215;&lt;/b&gt; 50 VLED arrays transferred onto the flash&#8208;induced robust Cu electrode show high illumination yield and uniform distribution of forward voltage, peak wavelength, and device temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Texture Formation in Polycrystalline Thin Films of All&#8208;Inorganic Lead Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite exhibits pervasive texture expressions when solution processed into thin&#8208;film optical devices. Synchrotron&#8208;based large&#8208;area X&#8208;ray scattering techniques provide insights, which connect the final texture formation to the crystal symmetry of the halide perovskite, which can be tuned via halide mixing. Both I&#8208;rich and Br&#8208;rich materials each exhibit two different, energetically favored texture directions.








Abstract
Controlling grain orientations within polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite solar cells can help increase conversion efficiencies toward their thermodynamic limits; however, the forces governing texture formation are ambiguous. Using synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, mesostructure formation within polycrystalline CsPbI2.85Br0.15 powders as they cool from a high&#8208;temperature cubic perovskite (&#945;&#8208;phase) is reported. Tetragonal distortions (&#946;&#8208;phase) trigger preferential crystallographic alignment within polycrystalline ensembles, a feature that is suggested here to be coordinated across multiple neighboring grains via interfacial forces that select for certain lattice distortions over others. External anisotropy is then imposed on polycrystalline thin films of orthorhombic (&#947;&#8208;phase) CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskite via substrate clamping, revealing two fundamental uniaxial texture formations; i)&#160;I&#8208;rich films possess orthorhombic&#8208;like texture (&lt;100&gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &lt;010&gt; and &lt;001&gt; in&#8208;plane), while ii) Br&#8208;rich films form tetragonal&#8208;like texture (&lt;110&gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &lt;110&gt; and &lt;001&gt; in&#8208;plane). In contrast to relatively uninfluential factors like the choice of substrate, film thickness, and annealing temperature, Br incorporation modifies the &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx crystal structure by reducing the orthorhombic lattice distortion (making it more tetragonal&#8208;like) and governs the formation of the different, energetically favored textures within polycrystalline thin films.

         <title>3D Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Insulator&#8211;Metal&#8211;Insulator Layered Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) based on a g&#8208;C3N4 layer, which possesses high structural and compositional homogeneity, is proposed to guide conformal Li deposition in the van der Waals gap between graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4. The design of a 3D artificial SEI enables stable cycling of Li metal anodes and provides potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Despite considerable efforts to prevent lithium (Li) dendrite growth, stable cycling of Li metal anodes with various structures remains extremely difficult due to the direct contact of the liquid electrolyte with Li. Rational design of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) for 3D electrodes is a promising but still challenging strategy for preventing Li dendrite growth and avoiding lithium&#8211;electrolyte side reactions in Li&#8208;metal batteries. Here, a 3D architecture is constructed with g&#8208;C3N4/graphene/g&#8208;C3N4 insulator&#8211;metal&#8211;insulator sandwiched nanosheets to guide uniform Li plating/stripping in the van der Waals gap between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, and the function of which can be regarded as a 3D artificial SEI. Li deposition on the surface of g&#8208;C3N4 is suppressed due to its insulating nature. However, its uniform lithiophilic sites and nanopore channels enable homogeneous lithium plating between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, prohibiting the direct contact of the electrolyte with the Li metal. The use of the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;layer&#8208;modified 3D anode enables long&#8208;term Li deposition with a high Coulombic efficiency and stable cycling of full cells under high cathode loading, limited Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions. The concept of a 3D artificial SEI will shed light on developing safe and stable Li&#8208;metal anodes.

Abstract
Surface decoration of living cells by exogenous substances offers a unique tool for understanding and tuning cell behaviors, which plays a critical role in cell&#8208;based therapy. Here, a facile yet versatile approach for decorating individual living cells with multimodal coatings is reported. By simply co&#8208;depositing with dopamine under a cytocompatible condition, various functional small molecules and polymers can be encoded to form a multifunctional coating on a cell's surface. The accessibility and versatility of this method to decorate diverse cells, including bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells is demonstrated. With the ability to tune surface functions, ligand co&#8208;deposited gut microbiota is prepared as oral therapeutics for targeted treatment of colitis. Given the dual cytoprotective and targeting effects of the coating, decorated cells show more than 30&#8208;times higher bioavailability in the gut and fourfold higher accumulation in the inflamed tissue in comparison with those of uncoated bacteria. Multimodal therapeutic cells further validate strikingly increased treatment efficacy over clinical aminosalicylic acid in colitis mice. Decorating with multifunctional coatings proposes a robust platform for developing multimodal cells for enhanced cell&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>Designing Adaptive Binders for Microenvironment Settings of Silicon Anode Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For achieving high capacity in silicon anode of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, an &#8220;adaptive binder&#8221; is reported. The polymeric binder containing plant&#8208;inspired adhesive phenolic moieties&#8212;gallols&#8212;shows initial adaptive properties via reversible hydrogen bonds for setting of silicon microenvironments and further stabilization of SEI layers through irreversible covalent crosslinking of gallols, implementing great electrochemical performance at a rapid charge/discharge rate.








Abstract
This study reports the concept of an &#8220;adaptive binder&#8221; to address the silicon anode challenge in Li&#8208;ion batteries. Binders exhibit adaptable capabilities upon gradual changes in the microenvironments surrounding silicon particles during anodic expansion&#8211;shrinkage cycles. Long, flexible binder chains are repositioned and reoriented upon the gradual formation of Si&#8208;micro&#8208;environments (Si&#8208;&#956;&#8208;env) during the early battery cycles. At this stage, the chemical interactions between the polymeric binders are reversible hydrogen bonds. As the Si&#8208;&#956;&#8208;env become stably set by repeated battery cycles, the chemical interactions exhibit reversible&#8208;to&#8208;irreversible transitions by the formation of covalent linkages between the binder polymers at the later stage of cycles. The binder polymer showing the aforementioned adaptive properties is hyaluronic acid, which has never been explored as a silicon&#8208;anode binder material, onto which the plant&#8208;inspired adhesive phenolic moiety, gallol (1,2,3&#8208;trihydroxybenzene), is conjugated (HA&#8211;GA) for stable adhesion to the surfaces of silicon particles. It is confirmed that the HA&#8211;GA binder can maintain a charge capacity that is approximately 3.3 times higher (1153 mAh g&#8722;1) than that of the nonconjugated HA binder (347 mAh g&#8722;1) after 600 cycles even at a rapid charge/discharge rate of 1 C (3500&#160;mA g&#8722;1), indicating that adaptive properties are an important factor to consider in designing silicon&#8208;anode binders.

It is confirmed that the HA&#8211;GA binder can maintain a charge capacity that is approximately 3.3 times higher (1153 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) than that of the nonconjugated HA binder (347 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) after 600 cycles even at a rapid charge/discharge rate of 1 C (3500&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), indicating that adaptive properties are an important factor to consider in designing silicon&#8208;anode binders.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Perovskite Quantum Dots with Ultralow Trap Density by Acid Etching&#8208;Driven Ligand Exchange for High Luminance and Stable Pure&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the stable small&#8208;sized CsPbBr3 quantum dots obtained by a novel acid etching&#8208;driven ligand exchange exhibit the blue emission (470&#160;nm) with record luminance of 3850&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, external quantum efficiency of 4.7%, and long&#8208;term operational stability of 12 h.








Abstract
The research on metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with green and infrared emission has demonstrated significant progress in achieving higher functional performance. However, the realization of stable pure&#8208;blue (&#8776;470&#160;nm wavelength) PeLEDs with increased brightness and efficiency still constitutes a considerable challenge. Here, a novel acid etching&#8208;driven ligand exchange strategy is devised for achieving pure&#8208;blue emitting small&#8208;sized (&#8776;4&#160;nm) CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with ultralow trap density and excellent stability. The acid, hydrogen bromide (HBr), is employed to etch imperfect [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedrons, thereby removing surface defects and excessive carboxylate ligands. Subsequently, didodecylamine and phenethylamine are successively introduced to bond the residual uncoordinated sites of the QDs and attain in situ exchange with the original long&#8208;chain organic ligands, resulting in near&#8208;unity quantum yield (97%) and remarkable stability. The QD&#8208;based PeLEDs exhibit pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence at 470&#160;nm (corresponding to the Commission Internationale del'Eclairage (CIE) (0.13,&#160;0.11) coordinates), an external quantum efficiency of 4.7%, and a remarkable luminance of 3850&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which is the highest brightness reported so far for pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs. Furthermore, the PeLEDs exhibit robust durability, with a half&#8208;lifetime exceeding 12 h under continuous operation, representing a record performance value for blue PeLEDs.

         <title>Analysis of External and Internal Disorder to Understand Band&#8208;Like Transport in n&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular vibrations govern the charge transport in organic semiconductors, which is limited by different sources of disorder. Understanding and mastering the disorder in these materials can drive the design of better semiconductors featuring band&#8208;like transport.








Abstract
Charge transport in organic semiconductors is notoriously extremely sensitive to the presence of disorder, both internal and external (i.e., related to interactions with the dielectric layer), especially for n&#8208;type materials. Internal dynamic disorder stems from large thermal fluctuations both in intermolecular transfer integrals and (molecular) site energies in weakly interacting van der Waals solids and sources transient localization of the charge carriers. The molecular vibrations that drive transient localization typically operate at low&#8208;frequency (&lt;a&#8208;few&#8208;hundred cm&#8722;1), which makes it difficult to assess them experimentally. Hitherto, this has prevented the identification of clear molecular design rules to control and reduce dynamic disorder. In addition, the disorder can also be external, being controlled by the gate insulator dielectric properties. Here a comprehensive study of charge transport in two closely related n&#8208;type molecular organic semiconductors using a combination of temperature&#8208;dependent inelastic neutron scattering and photoelectron spectroscopy corroborated by electrical measurements, theory, and simulations is reported. Unambiguous evidence that ad hoc molecular design enables the electron charge carriers to be freed from both internal and external disorder to ultimately reach band&#8208;like electron transport is provided.

         <title>In Situ Tracking of Wetting&#8208;Front Transient Heat Release on a Surface&#8208;Mounted Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile capillary&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;imbibition approach is developed for in situ tracking of transient heat release at the wetting front of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (SURMOFs) on cellulosic fiber papers. As a potential disruption to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in trace&#8208;solvent detection technologies, the study shows promise for the integration of SURMOFs in future sensor devices.








Abstract
Transient heat generation during guest adsorption and host&#8211;guest interactions is a natural phenomenon in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) chemistry. However, in situ tracking of such MOF released heat is an insufficiently researched field due to the fast heat dissipation to the surroundings. Herein, a facile capillary&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;imbibition approach is developed for in situ tracking of transient heat release at the wetting front of surface&#8208;mounted MOFs (SURMOFs) on cellulosic fiber substrates. Spatiotemporal temperature distributions are obtained with infrared thermal imaging for a range of MOF&#8208;based substrates and imbibed liquids. Temperature rises at the wetting front of water and binary mixtures with organic solvents are found to be over 10&#160;K with an ultrafast and distinguishable thermal signal response (&lt;1 s) with a detectable concentration limit &#8804;1 wt%. As a an advancement to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in trace&#8208;solvent detection technologies, this study shows great prospects for the integration of SURMOFs in future sensor devices. Inspired by this prototypal study, SURMOF&#8208;based transient heat signal transduction is likely to be extended to an ever&#8208;expanding library of SURMOFs and other classes of surface&#8208;grafted porous materials, translating into a wide range of convenient, portable, and ubiquitous sensor devices.

         <title>Stable and Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution from Seawater Enabled by an Unsaturated Nickel Surface Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unsaturated nickel surface nitride exhibits efficient and stable performance for hydrogen evolution from seawater. The origin of the activity and stability of the unique surface nitride is investigated using in situ Raman spectroscopy. By coupling with hydrazine oxidation at the anode, a flow&#8208;electrolyzer is assembled that can deliver a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 with a small cell voltage of 0.7&#160;V.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic production of hydrogen from seawater provides a route to low&#8208;cost and clean energy conversion. However, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using seawater is greatly hindered by the lack of active and stable catalysts. Herein, an unsaturated nickel surface nitride (Ni&#8208;SN@C) catalyst that is active and stable for the HER in alkaline seawater is prepared. It achieves a low overpotential of 23&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater electrolyte, which is superior to Pt/C. Compared to conventional transition metal nitrides or metal/metal nitride heterostructures, the Ni&#8208;SN@C has no detectable bulk nickel nitride phase. Instead, unsaturated Ni&#63743;N bonding on the surface is present. In situ Raman measurements show that the Ni&#8208;SN@C performs like Pt with the ability to generate hydronium ions in a high&#8208;pH electrolyte. The catalyst operation is then demonstrated in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer system, coupling with hydrazine oxidation at the anode. Using this system, a cell voltage of only 0.7&#160;V is required to achieve a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Beyond the Visible: Bioinspired Infrared Adaptive Materials</title>

Infrared adaptation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and biological systems.

Abstract
Infrared (IR) adaptation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and biological systems. Taking inspiration from natural creatures, researchers have devoted extensive efforts for developing advanced IR adaptive materials and exploring their applications in areas of smart camouflage, thermal energy management, biomedical science, and many other IR&#8208;related technological fields. Herein, an up&#8208;to&#8208;date review is provided on the recent advancements of bioinspired IR adaptive materials and their promising applications. First an overview of IR adaptation in nature and advanced artificial IR technologies is presented. Recent endeavors are then introduced toward developing bioinspired adaptive materials for IR camouflage and IR radiative cooling. According to the Stefan&#8208;Boltzmann law, IR camouflage can be realized by either emissivity engineering or thermal cloaks. IR radiative cooling can maximize the thermal radiation of an object through an IR atmospheric transparency window, and thus holds great potential for use in energy&#8208;efficient green buildings and smart personal thermal management systems. Recent advances in bioinspired adaptive materials for emerging near&#8208;IR (NIR) applications are also discussed, including NIR&#8208;triggered biological technologies, NIR light&#8208;fueled soft robotics, and NIR light&#8208;driven supramolecular nanosystems. This review concludes with a perspective on the challenges and opportunities for the future development of bioinspired IR adaptive materials.

         <title>A Nanoformulation&#8208;Mediated Multifunctional Stem Cell Therapy with Improved Beta&#8208;Amyloid Clearance and Neural Regeneration for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoformulation&#8208;mediated multifunctional stem cell therapy is developed for Alzheimer's disease treatment with improved beta&#8208;amyloid clearance and neural regeneration. With the synergy of neprilysin (NEP) gene&#8208;based beta&#8208;amyloid degradation, nanoformulation&#8208;based neuronal differentiation promotion, and neural stem cells, a single administration of this therapy achieves long&#8208;term efficacy (6&#160;months) with respect to memory reversal and improvement of learning deficits.








Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common dementia that is currently incurable. The existing treatments can only moderately relieve the symptoms of AD&#160;to slow down its progress. How to achieve effective neural regeneration to ameliorate cognitive impairments is a major challenge for current AD&#160;treatment. Here, the therapeutic potential of a nanoformulation&#8208;mediated neural stem cell (NSC) therapy capable of simultaneous A&#946; clearance and neural regeneration is investigated in a murine model. Genetically engineered NSCs capable of stably and continuously expressing neprilysin (NEP) are developed to enhance A&#946;&#160;degradation and NSC survival in the brain. A PBAE&#8208;PLGA&#8208;Ag2S&#8208;RA&#8208;siSOX9 (PPAR&#8208;siSOX9) nanoformulation with high gene/drug deliverability is synthesized to overcome AD microenvironment&#8208;associated adverse effects and to promote neuronal differentiation of the NEP&#8208;expressing NSCs. For achieving accurate stereotactic transplantation, Ag2S quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based fluorescence imaging is used to guide NSC transplantation in real time. This strategy shows numerous benefits, including efficient and long&#8208;lasting A&#946; degradation, improved neural regeneration, and accurate cell transplantation. It is shown that a single administration of this therapy achieves long&#8208;term efficacy (6&#160;months) with respect to memory reversal and improvement of learning deficits.

         <title>Surface and Interface Engineering of Nanoarrays toward Advanced Electrodes and Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical overview of surface and interface engineering of 3D nanoarray (3D&#8208;NA) electrodes is provided. The concepts and principles for utilizing 3D&#8208;NAs in purposely designed electrode architectures, charge storage mechanism analysis, and integrated device architecture design are outlined. Future perspectives and solutions to achieve electrode charge balance, multiphase solid&#8208;state interface optimization, and 3D solid electrolyte infiltration are also presented.








Abstract
The overall performance of electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs) is intrinsically correlated with surfaces and interfaces. As a promising electrode architecture, 3D nanoarrays (3D&#8208;NAs) possess relatively ordered, continuous, and fully exposed active surfaces of individual nanostructures, facilitating mass and electron transport within the electrode and charge transfer across interfaces and providing an ideal platform for engineering. Herein, a critical overview of the surface and interface engineering of 3D&#8208;NAs, from electrode and interface designs to device integration, is presented. The general merits of 3D&#8208;NAs and surface/interface engineering principles of 3D&#8208;NA hybrid electrodes are highlighted. The focus is on the use of 3D&#8208;NAs as a superior platform to regulate the interface nature and unveiling new mechanism/materials without the interference of binders. The engineering and utilization of the surface of 3D&#8208;NAs to develop flexible/solid&#8208;state EESDs with 3D integrated electrode/electrolyte interfaces, or 3D triphase interfaces involving other active species, which are characteristic of (quasi&#8208;)solid&#8208;state electrolyte infiltration into the entire device, are also considered. Finally, the challenges and future directions of surface/interface engineering of 3D&#8208;NAs are outlined. In particular, potential strategies to obtain electrode charge balance, optimize the multiphase solid&#8208;state interface, and attain 3D solid electrolyte infiltration are proposed.

         <title>Co and Pt Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atoms with Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt Dimer Sites for Ultrahigh Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum (Pt) single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging. A route of cobalt (Co) and Pt dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms is reported, which improves the Pt mass activity for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution significantly.








Abstract
The platinum single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging because the size issue of Pt is approached at the ultimate ceiling as single atoms. Here, a new route for further improving Pt catalytic efficiency by cobalt (Co) and Pt dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms on titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces, which contains a fraction of nonbonding oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimers, is reported. These Co&#8211;Pt dimer sites originate from loading high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atoms and Co single&#8208;atoms, with them anchoring randomly on the TiO2 substrate. This dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst yields 13.4% dimer sites and exhibits an ultrahigh and stable photocatalytic activity with a rate of 43.467&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and external quantum efficiency of &#8776;83.4% at 365&#160;nm. This activity far exceeds those of equal amounts of Pt single&#8208;atom and typical Pt clustered catalysts by 1.92 and 1.64 times, respectively. The enhancement mechanism relies on the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimer coupling, which can mutually optimize the electronic states of both Pt and Co sites to weaken H* binding. Namely, the &#8220;mute&#8221; Co single&#8208;atom is activated by Pt single&#8208;atom and the activity of the Pt atom is further enhanced through the dimer interaction. This strategy of nonbonding interactive dimer sites and the oxygen&#8208;mediated catalytic mechanisms provide emerging rich opportunities for greatly improving the catalytic efficiency and developing novel catalysts with creating new electronic states.

         <title>Fabrication Strategies of Twisted Bilayer Graphenes and Their Unique Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in fabrication of twisted bilayer graphene by the mainstream methods and the topological physical properties applied in different applications is comprehensively presented. The discovery of killer application with suitable preparation method for twisted bilayer graphene is systematically discussed by listing the advantages and disadvantages of preparation methods and various applications.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) exhibits a host of innovative physical phenomena owing to the formation of moir&#233; superlattice. Especially, the discovery of superconducting behavior has generated new interest in graphene. The growing studies of tBLG mainly focus on its physical properties, while the fabrication of high&#8208;quality tBLG is a prerequisite for achieving the desired properties due to the great dependence on the twist angle and the interfacial contact. Here, the cutting&#8208;edge preparation strategies and challenges of tBLG fabrication are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of chemical vapor deposition, epitaxial growth on silicon carbide, stacking monolayer graphene, and folding monolayer graphene methods for the fabrication of tBLG are analyzed in detail, providing a reference for further development of preparation methods. Moreover, the characterization methods of twist angle for the tBLG are presented. Then, the unique physicochemical properties and corresponding applications of tBLG, containing correlated insulating and superconducting states, ferromagnetic state, soliton, enhanced optical absorption, tunable bandgap, and lithium intercalation and diffusion, are described. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for fabricating high&#8208;quality and large&#8208;area tBLG are discussed, unique physical properties are displayed, and new applications inferred from its angle&#8208;dependent features are explored, thereby impelling the commercialization of tBLG from laboratory to market.

Moreover, the characterization methods of twist angle for the tBLG are presented. Then, the unique physicochemical properties and corresponding applications of tBLG, containing correlated insulating and superconducting states, ferromagnetic state, soliton, enhanced optical absorption, tunable bandgap, and lithium intercalation and diffusion, are described. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for fabricating high&#8208;quality and large&#8208;area tBLG are discussed, unique physical properties are displayed, and new applications inferred from its angle&#8208;dependent features are explored, thereby impelling the commercialization of tBLG from laboratory to market.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In Search of Excellence: Convex versus Concave Noble Metal Nanostructures for Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave noble metal nanocrystals represent the new class of electrocatalyst materials. In recent decades, extensive works have been employed in the search for excellent catalyst materials for electrocatalysis applications. The surface defects and structural stability are considered responsible for the superiority of concave noble metals compared to their conventional convex counterparts.








Abstract
Controlling the shape of noble metal nanoparticles is a challenging but important task in electrocatalysis. Apart from hollow and nanocage structures, concave noble metal nanoparticles are considered a new class of unconventional electrocatalysts that exhibit superior electrocatalytic properties as compared with those of conventional nanoparticles (including convex and flat ones). Herein, several facile and highly reproducible routes for synthesizing nanostructured concave noble metal materials reported in the literature are discussed, together with their advantages over noble metal nanoparticles with convex shapes. In addition, possible ways of optimizing the synthesis procedure and enhancing the electrocatalytic characteristics of concave metal nanoparticles are suggested. Nanostructured noble metals with concave features are found to show better catalytic activity and stability hence improve their practical applicability in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Sensitive Compression&#8208;Stress Sensor Using Integrated Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weak compression stresses in the order of 100&#8211;103 Pa, found in a broad range of physical phenomena from the daily life to the laboratory, are not detected by conventional mechano&#8208;responsive materials. Visualization and colorimetric quantification of weak compression stresses are achieved by integrated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, namely layered polydiacetylene and dry liquid, through response cascades.








Abstract
Measurement of mechanical stresses, such as compression, shear, and tensile stresses, contributes toward achieving a safer and healthier life. In particular, the detection of weak compression stresses is required for healthcare monitoring and biomedical applications. Compression stresses in the order of 106&#8211;1010&#160;Pa have been visualized and/or quantified using mechano&#8208;responsive materials in previous works. However, in general, it is not easy to detect compression stresses weaker than 103&#160;Pa using conventional mechano&#8208;responsive materials because the dynamic motion of the rigid mechano&#8208;responsive molecules is not induced by such a weak stress. In the present work, weak compression stresses in the order of 100&#8211;103&#160;Pa are visualized and measured via the integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, such as layered polydiacetylene (PDA) and dry liquid (DL), through response cascades. DLs consisting of liquid droplets covered by solid particles release the interior liquid and collapse with application of a weak compression stress. The color of the layered PDA is changed by the spilled liquid as a chemical stress. A variety of weak compression stresses, such as expiratory pressure, are visualized and colorimetrically measured using the paper&#8208;based device of the integrated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. Diverse mechano&#8208;sensing devices can be designed via the integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Infrared Metasurface Augmented by Deep Learning for Monitoring Dynamics between All Major Classes of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces have outstanding light manipulation capabilities at the nanoscale, which enable functions beyond what otherwise is seen in nature. Here, highly sensitive, broadband mid&#8208;IR metasurfaces for spectroscopy are augmented with artificial intelligence to allow the label&#8208;free monitoring of biomolecules from all major classes. This pioneering bioanalytical technology offers unprecedented opportunities for unravelling complex biomolecular processes.








Abstract
Insights into the fascinating molecular world of biological processes are crucial for understanding diseases, developing diagnostics, and effective therapeutics. These processes are complex as they involve interactions between four major classes of biomolecules, i.e., proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids, which makes it important to be able to discriminate between all these different biomolecular species. In this work, a deep learning&#8208;augmented, chemically&#8208;specific nanoplasmonic technique that enables such a feat in a label&#8208;free manner to not disrupt native processes is presented. The method uses a highly sensitive multiresonant plasmonic metasurface in a microfluidic device, which enhances infrared absorption across a broadband mid&#8208;IR spectrum and in water, despite its strongly overlapping absorption bands. The real&#8208;time format of the optofluidic method enables the collection of a vast amount of spectrotemporal data, which allows the construction of a deep neural network to discriminate accurately between all major classes of biomolecules. The capabilities of the new method are demonstrated by monitoring of a multistep bioassay containing sucrose&#8208; and nucleotides&#8208;loaded liposomes interacting with a small, lipid membrane&#8208;perforating peptide. It is envisioned that the presented technology will impact the fields of biology, bioanalytics, and pharmacology from fundamental research and disease diagnostics to drug development.

         <title>Toward Practical High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries: Quantifying Hydrogen Evolution and a Solid&#8208;Ion Conductor for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogen evolution in a Zn metal battery is accurately quantified by in situ battery&#8211;gas chromatography&#8211;mass analysis. Meanwhile, a highly electronically insulating but highly Zn2+ ion conductive ZnF2 solid ion conductor is utilized to isolate Zn metal from liquid electrolyte, which not only prohibits over 99.2% parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction during cycling but also guides uniform Zn electrodeposition.








Abstract
The hydrogen evolution in Zn metal battery is accurately quantified by in situ battery&#8211;gas chromatography&#8211;mass analysis. The hydrogen fluxes reach 3.76 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a Zn//Zn symmetric cell in each segment, and 7.70 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a Zn//MnO2 full cell. Then, a highly electronically insulating (0.11 mS cm&#8722;1) but highly Zn2+ ion conductive (80.2 mS cm&#8722;1) ZnF2 solid ion conductor with high Zn2+ transfer number (0.65) is constructed to isolate Zn metal from liquid electrolyte, which not only prohibits over 99.2% parasitic hydrogen evolution but also guides uniform Zn electrodeposition. Precisely quantitated, the Zn@ZnF2//Zn@ZnF2 cell only produces 0.02 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 of hydrogen (0.53% of the Zn//Zn cell). Encouragingly, a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn@ZnF2//MnO2 (&#8776;3.2 mAh cm&#8722;2) full cell only produces maximum hydrogen flux of 0.06 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (0.78% of the Zn//Zn cell) at the fully charging state. Meanwhile, Zn@ZnF2//Zn@ZnF2 symmetric cell exhibits excellent stability under ultrahigh current density and areal capacity (10 mA cm&#8722;2, 10 mAh cm&#8722;2) over 590 h (285 cycles), which far outperforms all reported Zn metal anodes in aqueous systems. In light of the superior Zn@ZnF2 anode, the high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity aqueous Zn@ZnF2//MnO2 batteries (&#8776;3.2 mAh cm&#8722;2) shows remarkable cycling stability over 1000 cycles with 93.63% capacity retained at &#8776;100% Coulombic efficiency.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries with Extended Cycling Enabled by Dynamic Adaptive Solid&#8208;State Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid interfacial contact loss is a severe challenge that impedes the development of solid&#8208;state batteries. A brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8208;inspired smart electrolyte film, with excellent compatibility and self&#8208;adaptability, that can control the interfacial kinetics to form a durable stable interface is reported. The related solid&#8208;state batteries demonstrate extended&#8208;cycling performance at room temperature.








Abstract
Improving the long&#8208;term cycling stability of solid&#8208;state lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (SSBs) is a severe challenge because of the notorious solid&#8211;solid interfacial contact loss originating from the repeated expansion and contraction of the Li anodes. Here, it is reported that high&#8208;performance SSBs are enabled by constructing brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar electrolytes that can dynamically adapt to the interface changes during cycling. An electrolyte film with a high mechanical strain (250%) is fabricated by filling viscoelastic (600% strain) and piezoelectric block&#8208;copolymer electrolytes (mortar) into a mixed conductor Li0.33La0.56TiO3&#8208;x nanofiber film (brick). During Li&#8208;plating, the electrolytes can homogenize the interfacial electric field and generate piezoelectricity to promote uniform Li&#8208;deposition, while the mortar can adhere to the Li&#8208;anode without interfacial disintegration in the reversed Li&#8208;stripping. As a result, the electrolytes show excellent compatibility with the electrodes, leading to a long electrochemical cyclability at room temperature. The symmetrical Li//Li cells run stably for 1880 h without forming dendrites, and the LiFePO4/Li full batteries deliver high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99.5%) and capacity retention (&gt;85%) over 550 cycles. More practically, the pouch cells exhibit excellent flexibility and safety for potential practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Solid interfacial contact loss is a severe challenge that impedes the development of solid&#8208;state batteries. A brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8208;inspired smart electrolyte film, with excellent compatibility and self&#8208;adaptability, that can control the interfacial kinetics to form a durable stable interface is reported. The related solid&#8208;state batteries demonstrate extended&#8208;cycling performance at room temperature.

         <title>Current&#8208;Induced Spin Torques on Single GdFeCo Magnetic Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new platform is proposed for spintronics. GdFeCo/Cu bilayers are found to be 20 times more efficient than Pt layers to generate spin currents from charge currents. It is also shown that these spin currents create strong &#8220;self&#8208;torques&#8221; on GdFeCo without need of heavy metal. This work opens another way to control the magnetic state of devices.








Abstract
Spintronics exploit spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) to generate spin currents, spin torques, and, in the absence of inversion symmetry, Rashba and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions. The widely used magnetic materials, based on 3d metals such as Fe and Co, possess a small SOC. To circumvent this shortcoming, the common practice has been to utilize the large SOC of nonmagnetic layers of 5d heavy metals (HMs), such as Pt, to generate spin currents and, in turn, exert spin torques on the magnetic layers. Here, a new class of material architectures is introduced, excluding nonmagnetic 5d HMs, for high&#8208;performance spintronics operations. Very strong current&#8208;induced torques exerted on single ferrimagnetic GdFeCo layers, due to the combination of large SOC of the Gd 5d states and inversion symmetry breaking mainly engineered by interfaces, are demonstrated. These &#8220;self&#8208;torques&#8221; are enhanced around the magnetization compensation temperature and can be tuned by adjusting the spin absorption outside the GdFeCo layer. In other measurements, the very large emission of spin current from GdFeCo, 80% (20%) of spin anomalous Hall effect (spin Hall effect) symmetry is determined. This material platform opens new perspectives to exert &#8220;self&#8208;torques&#8221; on single magnetic layers as well as to generate spin currents from a magnetic layer.

         <title>Targeted Dual Small Interfering Ribonucleic Acid Delivery via Non&#8208;Viral Polymeric Vectors for Pulmonary Fibrosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocarriers loaded with siRNA enter lung&#8208;resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR&#8208;MSCs) by targeting the cellular surface receptor Sca1. Successful suppression of myofibroblast differentiation of LR&#8208;MSCs is obtained by silencing the RUNX1 and Gli1 genes in an IPF mouse model administered with Fab&#8242; (siRUNX1&#160;+&#160;siGli1)&#8208;loaded micelles.








Abstract
Inhibiting the myofibroblast differentiation of lung&#8208;resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR&#8208;MSCs) is a promising yet challenging approach for pulmonary fibrosis (PF) therapy. Here, micelles formed by a graft copolymer of multiple PEGs modified branched polyethylenimine are used for delivering runt&#8208;related transcription factor&#8208;1 (RUNX1) small interfering RNA (siRNA) (siRUNX1) to the lung, aiming to inhibit the myofibroblast differentiation of LR&#8208;MSCs. LR&#8208;MSC targeting is achieved by functionalizing the micelle surface with an anti&#8208;stem&#8208;cell antigen&#8208;1 antibody fragment (Fab&#8242;). Consequently, therapeutic benefits are obtained by successful suppression of myofibroblast differentiation of LR&#8208;MSCs in bleomycin&#8208;induced PF model mice treated with siRUNX1&#8208;loaded micelles. Furthermore, an excellent synergistic effect of PF therapy is achieved for this micelle system loaded siRUNX1 and glioma&#8208;associated oncogene homolog&#8208;1 (Gli1) small interfering RNA (siGli1), a traditional anti&#8208;PF siRNA of glioma&#8208;associated oncogene homolog&#8208;1. Hence, this work not only provides RUNX1 as a novel PF therapeutic target, but also as a promising dual siRNA&#8208;loaded nanocarrier system for the therapy of PF.

         <title>Capturing Mobile Lithium Ions in a Molecular Hole Transporter Enhances the Thermal Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally stable perovskite solar cell is developed by capturing mobile lithium ions using a new molecular hole transporter, 1,3&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;octyl&#8208;4H&#8208;thieno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6(5H)&#8208;dione (coded HL38), where a strong interaction of the lithium ions in lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide with the 5&#8208;octylthieno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6&#8208;dione (octyl&#8208;TPD) moiety in HL38 is responsible for maintaining &#8776;86% of the initial power conversion efficiency for over 1000&#160;h at 85&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
A thermally stable perovskite solar cell (PSC) based on a new molecular hole transporter (MHT) of 1,3&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) amino)phenyl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;octyl&#8208;4H&#8208;thieno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;4,6(5H)&#8208;dione (coded HL38) is reported. Hole mobility of 1.36 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and glass transition temperature of 92.2 &#176;C are determined for the HL38 doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine as additives. Interface engineering with 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)thiophene hydroiodide (2&#8208;TEAI) between the perovskite and the HL38 improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 19.60% (untreated) to 21.98%, and this champion PCE is even higher than that of the additive&#8208;containing 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;MeOTAD)&#8208;based device (21.15%). Thermal stability testing at 85 &#176;C for over 1000 h shows that the HL38&#8208;based PSC retains 85.9% of the initial PCE, while the spiro&#8208;MeOTAD&#8208;based PSC degrades unrecoverably from 21.1% to 5.8%. Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry studies combined with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveal that HL38 shows lower lithium ion diffusivity than spiro&#8208;MeOTAD due to a strong complexation of the Li+ with HL38, which is responsible for the higher degree of thermal stability. This work delivers an important message that capturing mobile Li+ in a hole&#8208;transporting layer is critical in designing novel MHTs for improving the thermal stability of PSCs. In addition, it also highlights the impact of interface design on non&#8208;conventional MHTs.

         <title>Unveiling the Local Atomic Arrangements in the Shear Band Regions of Metallic Glass</title>

Direct mapping of local atomic bonding and packing in deformed metallic glass is reported, with identification of the structural/chemical variation in and across the shear bands, forming the shear&#8208;affected zones. The results confirm theoretical predictions for local softening in the deformed areas and provide necessary information to further engineer the catastrophic deformation failure of metallic glasses.








Abstract
The prospective applications of metallic glasses are limited by their lack of ductility, attributed to shear banding inducing catastrophic failure. A concise depiction of the local atomic arrangement (local atomic packing and chemical short&#8208;range order), induced by shear banding, is quintessential to understand the deformation mechanism, however still not clear. An explicit view of the complex interplay of local atomic structure and chemical environment is presented by mapping the atomic arrangements in shear bands (SBs) and in their vicinity in a deformed Vitreloy 105 metallic glass, using the scanning electron diffraction pair distribution function and atom probe tomography. The results experimentally prove that plastic deformation causes a reduction of geometrically favored polyhedral motifs. Localized motifs variations and antisymmetric (bond and chemical) segregation extend for several hundred nanometers from the SB, forming the shear band affected zones. Moreover, the variations within the SB are found both perpendicular and parallel to the SB plane, also observable in the oxidation activity. The knowledge of the structural&#8211;chemical changes provides a deeper understanding of the plastic deformation of metallic glasses especially for their functional applications and future improvements.
