         <title>Efficient Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes based on Heavy&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Quantum Dots</title>

Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) light emission is important for a diverse range of modern applications, such as eye&#8208;safe depth sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), facial recognition, eye tracking, optical communication and health monitoring technologies. However, there is a very limited number of known semiconductors that could emit efficiently in the SWIR spectral range. Presently, SWIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) based on colloidal quantum dots are dominated by lead chalcogenide systems (PbS, PbSe), despite the presence of heavy metal and modest efficiencies. Here, we present a highly&#8208;efficient SWIR LED based on heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free indium arsenide (InAs) core&#8208;shell colloidal quantum dots (CQD). In our LED design, the implementation of an otherwise hole&#8208;transporting poly(vinyl&#8208;carbazole) (PVK) layer on the electron&#8208;injecting side of the device stack led to a surprising enhancement in device performance, giving remarkably high external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of 13.3% at long emission wavelengths of 1006 nm. Single&#8208;carrier device and optical investigations reveal the origins of enhancement to be the electronic decoupling of the CQD layer with the electron&#8208;injecting zinc oxide (ZnO) layer, which mitigated luminescence quenching and improved charge balance. This work marks one of the highest efficiencies reported for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed LEDs in the SWIR spectral region (&gt;1000 nm), and could find significant applications in emerging consumer electronic technologies.

         <title>A Versatile Molten&#8208;salt Induction Strategy to Achieve Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Open&#8208;circuit Voltage &gt;1.2 V</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite has emerged as an important photovoltaic material due to its high thermal stability and suitable bandgap for tandem devices. Currently, the cell performance of CsPbI3 solar cells is mainly subject to a large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit. Herein, we demonstrate a multifunctional room&#8208;temperature molten salt, dimethylamine acetate (DMAAc), which not only directly acts as a solvent for precursor solutions but also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics. DMAAc can stabilize the DMAPbI3 structure and eliminate the Cs4PbI6 intermediate phase, which is easily spatially segregated. Meanwhile, a new homogeneous intermediate phase DMAPb(I, Ac)3 is formed, which finally affords high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films. With this approach, the charge capture activity of defects in the CsPbI3 film is significantly suppressed. Consequently, a VOC (open&#8208;circuit voltage) of 1.25&#160;V and &gt;21% PCE (power conversion efficiency) are achieved, which is the highest record reported thus far. This intermediate phase regulation strategy is believed to be applicable to other perovskite material systems.

Abstract
The development of human&#8208;interactive sensing displays (HISDs) that simultaneously detect and visualize stimuli is important for numerous cutting&#8208;edge human&#8211;machine interface technologies. Therefore, innovative device platforms with optimized architectures of HISDs combined with novel high&#8208;performance sensing and display materials are demonstrated. This study comprehensively reviews the recent advances in HISDs, particularly the device architectures that enable scaling&#8208;down and simplifying the HISD, as well as material designs capable of directly visualizing input information received by various sensors. Various HISD platforms for integrating sensors and displays are described. HISDs consist of a sensor and display connected through a microprocessor, and attempts to assemble the two devices by eliminating the microprocessor are detailed. Single&#8208;device HISD technologies are highlighted in which input stimuli acquired by sensory components are directly visualized with various optical components, such as electroluminescence, mechanoluminescence, and structural color. The review forecasts future HISD technologies that demand the development of materials with molecular&#8208;level synthetic precision that enables simultaneous sensing and visualization. Furthermore, emerging HISDs combined with artificial intelligence technologies and those enabling simultaneous detection and visualization of extrasensory information are discussed.

         <title>A Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Enhanced Simultaneous and Multimodal Sensor Based on Moist&#8208;Electric Powered Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene oxide multimodal sensor (GO&#8208;MS) capable of self&#8208;powered sensing of various environmental stimuli based on a spontaneously generated moist&#8208;electric potential is developed. Through the decoupling of characteristic response signals by machine&#8208;learning models, simultaneous monitoring of multiple stimuli by a single GO&#8208;MS is realized, providing a promising technical means for real&#8208;time multimodal perception and complex information system identification.








Abstract
Simultaneous multimodal monitoring can greatly perceive intricately multiple stimuli, which is important for the understanding and development of a future human&#8211;machine fusion world. However, the integrated multisensor networks with cumbersome structure, huge power consumption, and complex preparation process have heavily restricted practical applications. Herein, a graphene oxide single&#8208;component multimodal sensor (GO&#8208;MS) is developed, which enables simultaneous monitoring of multiple environmental stimuli by a single unit with unique moist&#8208;electric self&#8208;power supply. This GO&#8208;MS can generate a sustainable moist&#8208;electric potential by spontaneously adsorbing water molecules in air, which has a characteristic response behavior when exposed to different stimuli. As a result, the simultaneous monitoring and decoupling of the changes of temperature, humidity, pressure, and light intensity are achieved by this single GO&#8208;MS with machine&#8208;learning (ML) assistance. Of practical importance, a moist&#8208;electric&#8208;powered human&#8211;machine interaction wristband based on GO&#8208;MS is constructed to monitor pulse signals, body temperature, and sweating in a multidimensional manner, as well as gestures and sign language commanding communication. This ML&#8208;empowered moist&#8208;electric GO&#8208;MS provides a new platform for the development of self&#8208;powered single&#8208;component multimodal sensors, showing great potential for applications in the fields of health detection, artificial electronic skin, and the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things.

         <title>Unraveling the Mechanisms of the Apis mellifera Honeycomb Construction by 4D X&#8208;ray Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using X&#8208;ray microscopy, a millennium&#8208;old question of how bees build combs is answered. Individual cells are seen to grow out of the spine, which behaves as a substrate from which the hexagonal geometry is directly adopted. Seminal features such as the corrugated spine, coping, and porosities are observed, that further give us significant insights into the comb's construction and properties.








Abstract
Honeycomb is one of nature's best engineered structures. Even though it has inspired several modern engineering structures, an understanding of the process by which the hexagonal cells are formed in 3D space is lacking. Previous studies on the structure of the honeycomb are based on either 2D microscopy or by direct visual observations. As a result, several critical features of its microstructure and the precise mechanisms of its growth are not well understood. Using 4D X&#8208;ray microscopy, this study shows how individual and groups of honeycomb cells are formed. Cells grow additively from a corrugated central spine in a dynamic manner. The previously undocumented, corrugated spine contributes significantly to the comb's robust mechanical properties in all three dimensions. As cells grow, honey bees create a &#8220;coping,&#8221; which this study shows to be the location where new wax material is deposited behind where compaction and densification take place. This is exemplified by pores in the wax observed at the coping and alternating rear junctions between the comb cells that arise from the additive building technique and the highly efficient cell packing methodology, respectively. Additional mechanisms for growth and formation are discussed and described.

Using 4D X-ray microscopy, this study shows how individual and groups of honeycomb cells are formed. Cells grow additively from a corrugated central spine in a dynamic manner. The previously undocumented, corrugated spine contributes significantly to the comb's robust mechanical properties in all three dimensions. As cells grow, honey bees create a &#8220;coping,&#8221; which this study shows to be the location where new wax material is deposited behind where compaction and densification take place. This is exemplified by pores in the wax observed at the coping and alternating rear junctions between the comb cells that arise from the additive building technique and the highly efficient cell packing methodology, respectively. Additional mechanisms for growth and formation are discussed and described.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of FeSe&#8211;MnSe Heterointerfaces with Abundant Se Vacancies Embedded in N,B Co&#8208;Doped Hollow Carbon Microspheres for Accelerating the Sulfur Reduction Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
N,B co&#8208;doped conductive hollow carbon microspheres embedded with dense FeSe&#8211;MnSe heterostructures and abundant Se vacancies are rationally synthesized and used for Li&#8211;S batteries. The catalysts can subtly guide the Li2S nucleation and deposition in the 3D framework, avoiding the formation of L2S passivation layer and leaving enough channels for the continuous Li+ diffusion and subsequent nucleation of Li2S.








Abstract
Currently, extensive research efforts are being devoted to suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The uncontrollable deposition of insulating Li2S onto the surface of sulfur host materials dramatically inhibits the continuous reduction of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, N,B co&#8208;doped hollow carbon microspheres embedded with dense FeSe&#8211;MnSe heterostructures and abundant Se vacancies (FeSe&#8211;MnSe/NBC) are rationally designed and synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction using ionic liquids as dopants. The introduction of abundant heterostructures subtly guides Li2S nucleation and deposition in 3D frameworks, thus avoiding the formation of the Li2S passivation layer and allowing for continuous Li+ diffusion and subsequent nucleation of Li2S. Owing to these beneficial features, Li&#8211;S batteries comprising an FeSe&#8211;MnSe/NBC electrode exhibit significantly improved performance, including a high initial capacity of 1334 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and ultralong cycle stability with a low capacity fading rate of 0.029% cycle&#8722;1 over 1000 cycles at 1.0 C. Remarkably, the FeSe&#8211;MnSe/NBC pouch cell delivers a considerable areal capacity of 3.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C. This study provides valuable insight into heterostructures and Se vacancies for developing practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Passivating Defect and Constructing Dual Energy Transfer Pathway through Functional Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>

Abstract
Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites have emerged as a promising luminescent material for perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;LEDs). However, efficiency and stability are still obstacles to practical application due to numerous defects and inefficient energy transfer of perovskite film. Herein, we firstly introduced functional phenethylammonium bromine modified CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 NCs) as multifunctional additive to simultaneously improve above&#8208;mentioned problems. PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 NCs not only serves as hetero&#8208;nuclear seeds and triggers growth, thus greatly reducing leakage current, but also deliver Cs+ and Br&#8722; to passivate the intrinsic defects inside film. More importantly, PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 construct one new carrier transfer pathway from small&#8208;n phase of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite to PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3, which not only accelerates the energy transfer process but also promote radiation recombination of carriers due to stronger quantum confinement effect. Afterward, the PEDOT: PSS/TFB: black phosphorus QDs (BPQDs) double hole transport layer (HTL) is successfully constructed to enhance its carrier injection and charge transport abilities. Consequently, a champion external quantum efficiency of 25.32% and maximal brightness of 128842&#160;cd/m2, which is the record efficiency of the quasi&#8208;2D Pe&#8208;LED with pure green emission at 530&#160;nm. Moreover, an impressive 174&#160;min lifetime was obtained at T50, which is about 5 times longer than the control device.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Protein Glues with Superior Adhesion Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of protein complex glues with outstanding adhesion performance is fabricated by molecular engineering. The encoded arginine moieties significantly strengthen multiple molecular interactions in the protein complex, leading to ultrastrong adhesion, outperforming many chemically reacted and biomimetic glues. The combined robust interfacial adhesion and superior antibacterial activity endow the materials as highly favorable for visceral hemostasis and tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Naturally inspired proteins are investigated for the development of bioglues that combine adhesion performance and biocompatibility for biomedical applications. However, engineering such adhesives by rational design of the proteins at the molecular level is rarely reported. Herein, it is shown that a new generation of protein&#8208;based glues is generated by supramolecular assembly through de novo designed structural proteins in which arginine triggers robust liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation. The encoded arginine moieties significantly strengthen multiple molecular interactions in the complex, leading to ultrastrong adhesion on various surfaces, outperforming many chemically reacted and biomimetic glues. Such adhesive materials enable quick visceral hemostasis in 10 s and outstanding tissue regeneration due to their robust adhesion, good biocompatibility, and superior antibacterial capacity. Remarkably, their minimum inhibitory concentrations are orders of magnitude lower than clinical antibiotics. These advances offer insights into molecular engineering of de novo designed protein glues and outline a general strategy to fabricate mechanically strong protein&#8208;based materials for surgical applications.

         <title>MoSe2&#8211;VSe2&#8211;NbSe2 Ternary Alloy Nanosheets to Boost Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoSe2&#8211;VSe2&#8211;NbSe2 ternary alloy nanosheets are synthesized via a colloidal reaction. Ternary alloying produces a miscible phase over a wide range. Compared to each binary alloy, the ternary alloys display higher electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic electrolyte. Spin&#8208;polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations consistently predict the homogenous atomic distributions and support that ternary alloying greatly enhances the HER performance.








Abstract
Alloying of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a pioneering method for engineering electronic structures with expanded applications. In this study, MoSe2&#8211;VSe2&#8211;NbSe2 ternary alloy nanosheets are synthesized via a colloidal reaction. The composition is successfully tuned over a wide range to adjust the 2H&#8211;1T phase transition. The alloy nanosheets consist of miscible atomic structures at all compositions, which is distinct from immiscible binary alloys. Compared to each binary alloy, the ternary alloys display higher electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic electrolyte. The HER performance exhibits a volcano&#8208;type composition dependence, which is correlated with the experimental d&#8208;band center (&#949;d). Spin&#8208;polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations consistently predict the homogenous atomic distributions. The Gibbs free energy of H adsorption (&#916;GH*) and the activation barrier (Ea) support that miscible ternary alloying greatly enhances the HER performance.

         <title>Cationic Polysaccharide Conjugates as Antibiotic Adjuvants Resensitize Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria and Prevent Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic polysaccharide conjugates (Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn) are synthesized using controllable disulfide exchange polymerization as antibiotic adjuvants to treat multidrug&#8208;resistant Acinetobacter baumannii&#8208;induced pneumonia in mice. Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn disrupts bacterial membranes and efflux pumps, and facilitates antibiotic accumulation inside bacteria. Antibiotic efficacy is restored and bacterial resistance is prevented by Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn.








Abstract
In recent years, traditional antibiotic efficacy has rapidly diminished due to the advent of multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria, which poses severe threat to human life and globalized healthcare. Currently, the development cycle of new antibiotics cannot match the ongoing MDR infection crisis. Therefore, novel strategies are required to resensitize MDR bacteria to existing antibiotics. In this study, novel cationic polysaccharide conjugates Dextran&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(5&#8208;(1,2&#8208;dithiolan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;guanidinoethyl)pentanamide) (Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn) is synthesized using disulfide exchange polymerization. Critically, bacterial membranes and efflux pumps are disrupted by a sub&#8208;inhibitory concentration of Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30, which enhances rifampicin (RIF) accumulation inside bacteria and restores its efficacy. Combined Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 and RIF prevents bacterial resistance in bacteria cultured over 30 generations. Furthermore, Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 restores RIF effectiveness, reduces inflammatory reactions in a pneumonia&#8208;induced mouse model, and exhibits excellent in vivo biological absorption and degradation capabilities. As an antibiotic adjuvant, Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 provides a novel resensitizing strategy for RIF against MDR bacteria and bacterial resistance. This Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 research provides a solid platform for future MDR applications.

         <title>Resistive Switching Crossbar Arrays Based on Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Resistive switching (RS) devices are metal/insulator/metal (MIM) cells that can change their electrical resistance when electrical stimuli are applied between the electrodes, and they can be used to store and compute data. Planar crossbar arrays of RS devices can offer a high integration density (&gt;108 devices/mm2) and this can be further enhanced by stacking them three&#8208;dimensionally. The advantage of using layered materials (LMs) in RS devices (compared to traditional phase&#8208;change materials and metal&#8208;oxides) is that their electrical properties can be adjusted with a higher precision. Here we define the key figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit and procedures to implement LM&#8208;based RS devices. We identify and discuss LM&#8208;based RS devices fabricated using methods compatible with industry. We focus on small devices (size &lt;9 &#956;m2) arranged in crossbar structures, since larger devices may be affected by artefacts, such as grain boundaries and flake junctions. We also discuss how to enhance device performance, so to accelerate the development of this technology.

         <title>Filamented Light (FLight) Biofabrication of Highly Aligned Tissue&#8208;engineered Constructs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cell&#8208;laden hydrogels used in tissue engineering generally lack sufficient 3D topographical guidance for encapsulated cells to mature into aligned tissues. A new strategy called Filamented Light (FLight) biofabrication rapidly creates hydrogels composed of unidirectional microfilament networks, with diameters on the length scale of single cells (&lt; 30&#160;&#956;m). Due to optical modulation instability, a light beam from a laser&#8208;based K&#246;hler illumination system is divided optically into filamented light beams. Local polymerization of a photoactive resin is triggered, leading to local increase in refractive index, which itself creates self&#8208;focusing waveguides and further polymerization of photoresin into long hydrogel microfilaments. Diameter and spacing of the microfilaments can be tuned from 2&#8211;30&#160;&#956;m by changing the coherence length of the light beam. Hydrogel microfilaments show outstanding cell instructive properties with fibroblasts, tenocytes, endothelial cells, and myoblasts, influencing cell alignment, deformation of cell nucleus, and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). FLight is compatible with multiple types of photoresins and allows for biofabrication of centimeter&#8208;scale cell&#8208;laden hydrogel constructs with excellent cell viability within seconds (&lt; 10 s per construct). Multiple directions of microfilaments are achievable within a single hydrogel construct by changing the direction of FLight projection (Cross&#8208;FLight), and complex multi&#8208;material/multi&#8208;cellular tissue&#8208;engineered constructs are possible by sequentially exchanging the cell&#8208;laden photoresin. FLight offers a transformational approach to developing anisotropic tissues using photocrosslinkable biomaterials.

         <title>Polar Species for Effective Dielectric Regulation to Achieve High&#8208;Performance CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar species modification (PSM) is employed to reduce the defect capturing probability by strengthening the defect dielectric screening effect via increasing the dielectric constant of a perovskite film. The introduction of F3EAI fills the vacancy defects at surface and also produces a hydrophobic umbrella with high resistance to humidity. PSM realizes a power conversion efficiency of 20.5% for CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Nonradiative losses caused by defects are the main obstacles to further advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). There is focused research to boost the device performance by reducing the number of defects and deactivating defects; however, little attention is paid to the defect&#8208;capture capacity. Here, upon systematically examining the defect&#8208;capture capacity, highly polarized fluorinated species are designed to modulate the dielectric properties of the perovskite material to minimize its defect&#8208;capture radius. On the one hand, fluorinated polar species strengthen the defect dielectric&#8208;screening effect via enhancing the dielectric constant of the perovskite film, thus reducing the defect&#8208;capture radius. On the other, the fluorinated iodized salt replenishes the I&#8208;vacancy defects at the surface, hence lowering the defect density. Consequently, the power&#8208;conversion efficiency of an all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 PSC is increased to as high as 20.5% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2&#160;V and a fill factor of 82.87%, all of which are among the highest in their respective categories. Furthermore, the fluorinated species modification also produces a hydrophobic umbrella yielding significantly improved humidity tolerance, and hence long&#8208;term stability. The present strategy provides a general approach to effectually regulate the defect&#8208;capture radius, thus enhancing the optoelectronic performance.

         <title>Balancing the Selective Absorption and Photon&#8208;to&#8208;Electron Conversion for Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics with 5.0% Light&#8208;Utilization Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Balancing the selective absorption and photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion is key to achieving high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs). Following this, ST&#8208;OPV with a high light&#8208;utilization efficiency of 5.0% is reached via comprehensive optimization on materials, active layers, and device structures. Furthermore, the ST&#8208;OPV exhibits good upscaling and thermal control ability, representing a promising candidate adaptive to versatile applications.








Abstract
Efficiently converting invisible light while allowing full visible light transmission is key to achieving high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs). Here, a detailed balance strategy is explored to optimize the ST&#8208;OPV via taking both absorption and carrier dynamics into consideration. Based on this principle, comprehensive optimizations are carried out, including a ternary strategy, donor:acceptor blend ratio, thickness, antireflection, etc., to compromise the invisible energy conversion and visible transmission for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs. As a result, the opaque OPV device exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.35% (certificated 19.07%), and most strikingly, the best ST&#8208;OPV shows a remarkably high light&#8208;utilization efficiency of 5.0%, where the efficiency and the average visible transmission are 12.95% and 38.67%, respectively. An efficiency of 12.09% is achieved on the upscaled device with an area of 1.05 cm2, demonstrating its promise for large&#8208;area fabrication. These results are among the best values for ST&#8208;OPVs. Besides, it is demonstrated that the ST&#8208;OPV exhibits good infrared light&#8208;reflection capability for thermal control. This work provides a rational design of balancing the absorbing selectivity and photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs, and may pave the way toward the practical application of solar windows.

As a result, the opaque OPV device exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.35% (certificated 19.07%), and most strikingly, the best ST-OPV shows a remarkably high light-utilization efficiency of 5.0%, where the efficiency and the average visible transmission are 12.95% and 38.67%, respectively. An efficiency of 12.09% is achieved on the upscaled device with an area of 1.05 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating its promise for large-area fabrication. These results are among the best values for ST-OPVs. Besides, it is demonstrated that the ST-OPV exhibits good infrared light-reflection capability for thermal control. This work provides a rational design of balancing the absorbing selectivity and photon-to-electron conversion for high-performance ST-OPVs, and may pave the way toward the practical application of solar windows.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Measurement of Cell Mechanics as a Clinically Relevant Readout of an In Vitro Lung Fibrosis Model Established on a Bioinspired Basement Membrane</title>

         <dc:description>
A &#8220;breathing&#8221; human&#8208;based in vitro mini&#8208;lung with a patient&#8208;derived triple coculture fibrosis model introduces longitudinal pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics studies to in vitro testing of inhaled drugs. This technology relies on a novel copolymeric basement membrane for cell culturing, which overcomes the shortcomings of silicon&#8208;based membranes, and on a novel method for real&#8208;time monitoring tissue mechanics as clinically relevant functional readout.








Abstract
Lung fibrosis, one of the major post&#8208;COVID&#160;complications, is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease without a cure. Here, an organ&#8208; and disease&#8208;specific&#160;in vitro&#160;mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model equipped with noninvasive real&#8208;time monitoring of cell mechanics is introduced as a functional readout. To establish an intricate multiculture model under physiologic conditions, a biomimetic ultrathin basement (biphasic elastic thin for air&#8211;liquid culture conditions, BETA) membrane (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m) is developed&#160;with unique properties, including biocompatibility,&#160;permeability, and high elasticity (&lt;10&#160;kPa) for cell culturing under air&#8211;liquid interface and cyclic mechanical stretch conditions. The human&#8208;based triple coculture fibrosis model, which includes epithelial and endothelial cell lines combined with primary fibroblasts from&#160;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients established on the BETA membrane, is integrated into a millifluidic bioreactor system (cyclic in vitro cell&#8208;stretch, CIVIC) with dose&#8208;controlled aerosolized drug delivery, mimicking inhalation therapy. The real&#8208;time measurement of cell/tissue stiffness (and compliance) is shown as a clinical biomarker of the progression/attenuation of fibrosis upon drug treatment, which is confirmed for&#160;inhaled&#160;Nintedanib&#8212;an antifibrosis drug.&#160;The mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model allows the combined longitudinal testing of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs, which is expected to enhance the predictive capacity of&#160;preclinical&#160;models&#160;and hence facilitate the development of approved therapies for lung fibrosis.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Over 1.2&#160;V Achieved by a Dual&#8208;Side Passivation Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New synthesized non&#8208;conjugated polyelectrolyte is introduced as an interfacial layer between the charge&#8208;transport layer and perovskite absorbent, which significantly reduce both bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination losses, but also aligns the interface's energy level. The modified perovskite solar cells show a power conversion efficiency of 24.4% (open&#8208;circuit voltage 1.21&#160;V) with negligible hysteresis and superior operational stability.








Abstract
Suppressing nonradiative recombination at the interface between the organometal halide perovskite (PVK) and the charge&#8208;transport layer (CTL) is crucial for improving the efficiency and stability of PVK&#8208;based solar cells (PSCs). Here, a new bathocuproine (BCP)&#8208;based nonconjugated polyelectrolyte (poly&#8208;BCP) is synthesized and this is introduced as a &#8220;dual&#8208;side passivation layer&#8221; between the tin oxide (SnO2) CTL and the PVK absorber. Poly&#8208;BCP significantly suppresses both bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination by passivating oxygen&#8208;vacancy defects from the SnO2 side and simultaneously scavenges ionic defects from the other (PVK) side. Therefore, PSCs with poly&#8208;BCP exhibits a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.4% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.21&#160;V with a reduced voltage loss (PVK bandgap of 1.56&#160;eV). The non&#8208;encapsulated PSCs also show excellent long&#8208;term stability by retaining 93% of the initial PCE after 700 h under continuous 1&#8208;sun irradiation in nitrogen atmosphere conditions.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Derived Ordered Mesoporous Carbon&#8208;Based Nanostructure for High&#8208;Performance and Universal Multivalent Metal Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;doped Zn&#8211;MOF (metal&#8211;organic framework) derived orderly mesoporous carbon&#8208;based nanostructure is synthesized by template&#8208;free pyrolysis and the Cu doping presents a direction&#8208;inducing function on the dissociation process of organic ligands during the pyrolysis. This orderly mesoporous derivative provides a fruitful platform to achieve a class of high&#8208;performance electrodes for universal multivalent metal ion storage in aqueous electrolytes.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) derivatives promise great potential in energy storage and conversion because of their excellent tunability in both the active metal sites, organic links, and the overall structures down to atomic and up to mesoscale. Nevertheless, a big challenge is to precisely control and thoroughly understand the actual MOF&#8208;to&#8208;derivative conversion process to realize the template&#8208;free synthesis of the MOF&#8208;derived ordered mesoporous materials. Here, a class of ordered mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon nanoflakes is presented with slit&#8208;shaped pores synthesized by one&#8208;step pyrolysis of Zn1Cux&#8211;MOF, where the Cu doping plays a critically important direction&#8208;inducing function on the dissociation of organic ligands during the pyrolysis. Benefiting from the uniquely ordered mesoporous structure and large specific surface area (910 m2 g&#8722;1), the Zn1Cux&#8211;MOF&#8208;derived ordered mesoporous carbon nanoflakes present outstanding electrochemical storage performance for multivalent metal ions, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Al3+, and Zn2+, demonstrating the universal nature of the slit&#8208;shaped pores in enabling the multivalent metal ions for energy storage. Moreover, the assembled flexible Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHSC) delivers a high specific capacity of 134 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, excellent cycling and mechanical stability, showing great application potential in the new generation energy storage devices.

         <title>Honeycomb&#8208;like Porous Crystalline Hetero&#8208;electrocatalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Porous hetero&#8208;structure electrocatalysts with multi&#8208;functionality and synergistic effect have much benefit for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet it still remains a daunting challenge to explore covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based hetero&#8208;structures in this field. Here, we have synthesized a series of honeycomb&#8208;like porous crystalline hetero&#8208;electrocatalysts (MCH&#8208;X, X = 1&#8211;4, X stands for the numbered sample obtained from different MOFs doses in MCH synthesis) and successfully applied them in electrocatalytic CO2RR. The specially designed hetero&#8208;structures with integrated porous MOF&#8208;template and ultrathin COF&#8208;coating enable efficient CO2 adsorption/activation and conversion into CH4. Best of them, the MCH&#8208;3 showed greatly inhibited H2 evolution, excellent current density (&#8208;398.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), and superior FECH4 (76.7%) to physical mixture (38.0%), MOF@COF without honeycomb&#8208;like morphology (47.7%), bare COF (37.5%) and MOF (15.9%) at &#8208;1.0&#160;V. Based on the DFT calculations and various characterizations, the vital roles of MOF in facilitating CO2 adsorption/activation, stabilizing intermediates, and conquering the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step have been intensively studied.

         <title>Continuous color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting devices based on compositionally graded monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide alloys</title>

Abstract
The diverse series of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials has been employed in various optoelectronic applications, such as photodetectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and lasers. Typically, the detection or emission range of optoelectronic devices is unique to the bandgap of the active material. Therefore, to improve the capability of these devices, extensive efforts have been devoted to tune the bandgap, such as gating, strain, and dielectric engineering. However, the controllability of these methods is severely limited (typically &#8764;0.1&#160;eV). In contrast, alloying TMDCs is an effective approach that yields a composition&#8208;dependent bandgap and enables light emissions over a wide range. In this study, we fabricated a color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device using compositionally graded TMDC alloys. The monolayer WS2/WSe2 alloy grown by chemical vapor deposition showed a spatial gradient in the light emission energy, which varied from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. We incorporated this alloy in an electrolyte&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting device structure that can tune the recombination zone laterally. Thus, we successfully fabricated a continuous and reversible color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device by controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions. Our results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor&#8208;based broadband optical applications.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Robust Full&#8208;color Organic Afterglow Through 2D Superlattices Embedment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Purely organic afterglow (POA) originated from the slow radiative decay of stabilized triplet excited state has shown amazing potentials in many fields. However, achieving highly stable POA with high phosphorescent quantum yield (PhQY) and long lifetime is still a formidable challenge owing to the intrinsically active and sensitive nature of triplet excitons. Here, triplet excitons of phosphors were protected and stabilized by embedding in tri&#8208;component tri&#8208;hapto self&#8208;assembled 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices, which not only enables deep&#8208;blue POA with high PhQY (up to 65%), ultralong lifetime (over 1300&#160;ms) and the highest figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit at room temperature, but also achieves excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, solvent, pressure, light and heat. Besides, POA color was tuned from deep&#8208;blue to red via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the deep&#8208;blue POA emitters to fluorophores. Moreover, with the high&#8208;performance, robust, and full&#8208;color POA materials, flexible anti&#8208;counterfeit display and direct current (DC)&#8208;driven lifetime&#8208;encrypted color Morse Code applications were facilely realized.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Bioactive Nanomicelle&#8208;Based &#8220;One Stone for Multiple Birds&#8221; Strategy for Precision Therapy of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</title>

Abstract
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains a lethal aortic disease in the elderly. Currently, no effective drugs can be clinically applied to prevent the development of AAA. Herein we report a &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy for AAA therapy. As a proof of concept, three bioactive conjugates are designed and synthesized, which can assemble into nanomicelles. Cellularly, these nanomicelles significantly inhibit migration and activation of inflammatory cells as well as protect vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from induced oxidative stress, calcification, and apoptosis, with the best effect for nanomicelles (TPTN) derived from a conjugate TPT. After intravenous delivery, TPTN efficiently accumulates in the aneurysmal tissue of AAA rats, showing notable distribution in neutrophils, macrophages, and VSMCs, all relevant to AAA pathogenesis. Whereas three examined nanomicelles effectively delay expansion of AAA in rats, TPTN most potently prevents AAA growth by simultaneously normalizing the pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment and regulating multiple pathological cells. TPTN is effective even at 0.2&#160;mg/kg. Besides, TPTN can function as a bioactive nanoplatform for site&#8208;specifically delivering and triggerably releasing anti&#8208;aneurysmal drugs, affording synergistic therapeutic effects. Consequently, TPTN is a promising multi&#8208;bioactive nanotherapy and bioresponsive targeting delivery nanocarrier for effective therapy of AAA and other inflammatory vascular diseases.

         <title>Engineering 3d&#8208;2p&#8208;4f Gradient Orbital Coupling to Enhance Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of highly efficient and economical materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a key role in practical energy conversion technologies. However, the intrinsic scaling relations exert the thermodynamic inhibition on realizing highly active ORR electrocatalysts. Herein, we propose a novel and feasible gradient orbital coupling strategy for tuning the ORR performance through the construction of Co 3d&#8208;O 2p&#8208;Eu 4f unit sites on the Eu2O3&#8208;Co model. Through the gradient orbital coupling, the pristine ionic property between Eu and O atoms is assigned with increased covalency, which optimizes the eg occupancy of Co sites, and weakens the O = O bond, thus ultimately breaking the scaling relation between *OOH and *OH at Co&#8208;O&#8208;Eu unit sites. The optimized model catalyst displays the onset and half&#8208;wave potential of 1.007&#160;V and 0.887&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, which are higher than those of commercial Pt/C and most Co&#8208;based catalysts ever reported. In addition, the catalyst is found to possess superior selectivity and durability. It also reveals better cell performance than commercial noble&#8208;metal catalysts in Zn&#8208;air batteries in terms of high power/energy densities and long cycle life. This study provides a new perspective for electronic modulation strategy by the construction of gradient 3d&#8208;2p&#8208;4f orbital coupling.

         <title>Weakening the Solvating Power of Solvents to Encapsulate Lithium Polysulfides Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Long cycling lifespan is a prerequisite for practical utilization of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries yet is restricted by the side reactions between soluble polysulfides and lithium metal anodes. The regulation on solvation structure of polysulfides renders encapsulating&#8208;polysulfides electrolyte (EPSE) that emerges as a promising solution to suppress the parasitic reactions. The solvating power of the solvents in the outer solvent shell of lithium polysulfides is critical for the encapsulation effect of EPSE. Herein a typical hydrofluoroether, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (HFE) is demonstrated as a superior outer&#8208;shell solvent to construct EPSE. On the basis of the large steric hindrance of fluorohydrocarbon chains, the electron&#8208;withdrawing &#8211;CF2&#8211; segment further endows HFE molecule with prominently weak solvating power. The HFE&#8208;EPSE improves the lifespan from 54 to 135 cycles of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with ultrathin lithium metal anodes (50&#160;&#956;m) and high&#8208;areal&#8208;loading sulfur cathodes (4.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, a 334&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell (2.4 Ah level) with HFE&#8208;EPSE stably undergoes 25 cycles. This work demonstrates the vital role of weakening solvating power of the outer&#8208;shell solvent of lithium polysulfides to construct superior EPSE and inspires the significance of regulating the solvation chemistry of polysulfides to achieve long cycling lifespan of working lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Large Memory Window of van der Waals Heterostructure Devices Based on MOCVD&#8208;Grown 2D Layered Ge4Se9</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge4Se9, a new insulating 2D&#8208;layered material, is synthesized using metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition at 240 &#176;C&#160;with&#160;low&#8208;reactive&#160;precursors.&#160;The 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 forms a low band offset with MoS2, exhibiting a large memory window with linear gate&#8208;tunability. As an artificial synapse, the MoS2/Ge4Se9 heterostructure exhibits synaptic updates with low non&#8208;linearity of 0.26 and low energy consumption of 15 fJ.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have drawn much interest over the last decade owing to their absence of dangling bonds and their intriguing low&#8208;dimensional properties. The emergence of 2D materials has enabled the achievement of significant progress in both the discovery of physical phenomena and the realization of superior devices. In this work, the group IV metal chalcogenide 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 is introduced as a new selection of insulating vdW material. 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 is synthesized with a rectangular shape using the metalcorganic chemical vapor deposition system using a liquid germanium precursor at 240 &#176;C. By stacking the Ge4Se9 and MoS2, vdW heterostructure devices are fabricated with a giant memory window of 129&#160;V by sweeping back gate range of &#177;80&#160;V. The gate&#8208;independent decay time reveals that the large hysteresis is induced by the interfacial charge transfer, which originates from the low band offset. Moreover, repeatable conductance changes are observed over the 2250 pulses with low non&#8208;linearity values of 0.26 and 0.95 for potentiation and depression curves, respectively. The energy consumption of the MoS2/Ge4Se9 device is about 15 fJ for operating energy and the learning accuracy of image classification reaches 88.3%, which further proves the great potential of artificial synapses.

         <title>Crossover Effects in Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries with a Localized High Concentration Electrolyte and High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profound effects of chemical crossover in a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte with a high&#8208;nickel cathode and lithium&#8208;metal anode are presented. Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt is stripped of fluorine at the anode and further decomposed at the cathode, causing a 3&#215; reduction in lithium solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase growth relative to symmetric cells and a 3&#215; increase in cathode capacity fade relative to cells with graphite anode.








Abstract
While crossover effects, such as transition&#8208;metal dissolution, are well&#8208;understood in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, there is a limited understanding of the effect of crossed&#8208;over chemical species in cells with oxide cathodes and lithium&#8208;metal anodes. In this work, the effects of cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode and anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode crossover are explored in cells with a high&#8208;nickel cathode, lithium&#8208;metal anode, and a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE). Dramatic differences are found among cells; a lithium&#8208;metal anode paired with a high&#8208;nickel cathode has three times less solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase growth than a lithium&#8208;metal anode paired with lithium metal. Meanwhile, the cathode paired with lithium metal has 2&#8211;3 times higher capacity fade than the same cathode paired with graphite. Decomposition and crossover of the FSI salt is identified as the main source of these changes. The fluorine in the salt is first stripped off at the lithium&#8208;metal anode, and the remaining sulfur and nitrogen cross over to the cathode. Although the reduction in fluorine content harms the surface stability of the cathode, the lithium&#8208;metal anode benefits from the increased fluorine content. Because the lithium&#8208;metal anode is typically the bottleneck for cells with thin lithium, crossover is a major factor in the enhanced performance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries with LHCE.

         <title>An Aqueous Analog MAC Machine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 16 &#215; 16 array of ionic transistors that electrochemically functions in aqueous quinone solution is reported. It executes analog multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations, a computing modality hotly pursued for low&#8208;power artificial neural networks. This demonstrates the use of ions in the aqueous milieu for analog computing is a step toward developing a more complex bioinspired information processing platforms.








Abstract
Using ions in aqueous milieu for signal processing, like in biological circuits, may potentially lead to a bioinspired information processing platform. Studies, however, have focused on individual ionic diodes and transistors rather than circuits comprising many such devices. Here a 16&#160;&#215;&#160;16 array of new ionic transistors is developed in an aqueous quinone solution. Each transistor features a concentric ring electrode pair with a disk electrode at the center. The electrochemistry of these electrodes in the solution provides the basis for the transistor operation. The ring pair electrochemically tunes the local electrolytic concentration to modulate the disk's Faradaic reaction rate. Thus, the disk current as a Faradaic reaction to the disk voltage is gated by the ring pair. The 16&#160;&#215;&#160;16 array of these transistors performs analog multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations, a computing modality hotly pursued for low&#8208;power artificial neural networks. This exploits the transistor's operating regime where the disk current is a multiplication of the disk voltage and a weight parameter tuned by the ring pair gating. Such disk currents from multiple transistors are summated in a global reference electrode to complete a MAC task. This ionic circuit demonstrating analog computing is a step toward sophisticated aqueous ionics.

         <title>Construction of Ultrathin S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions of Single Ni Atom Immobilized Ti&#8208;MOF and BiVO4 for CO2 Photoconversion of nearly 100% to CO by Pure Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;spectrum heterojunctions are successfully fabricated by coupling single&#8208;atom Ni immobilized single&#8208;coordination&#8208;layer NTU&#8208;9 as a reformative reduction half semiconductor with 2DBiVO4 through H&#8208;bonding induction, which represents a novel S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst model. Favorable charge separation and efficient catalytic sites of single Ni atoms with unique local microenvironment synergistically promote CO2 photoconversion, achieving up to 66&#8208;fold conversion rate by pure water compared to reference BiVO4 nanoparticles, together with nearly 100% selectivity to CO without any H2.








Abstract
To rationally design single&#8208;atom metal&#8211;organic&#160;framework&#160;(MOF)&#8208;involving photocatalysts remains an ongoing challenge for efficient CO2 conversion. Here, cuppy microstructures, consisting of a Ti(IV)&#8208;oxo node and three linked carboxylic moieties, in the single&#8208;coordination&#8208;layer Ti2(H2dobdc)3 MOF (NTU&#8208;9) are exploited to immobilize abundant single Ni(II) sites (Ni@MOF). The coupling of Ni@MOF with BiVO4 (BVO) nanosheets by H&#8208;bonding&#8208;induced assembly process obtains wide&#8208;spectrum 2D heterojunctions. The optimal heterojunction exhibits competitive performance and enables around 66&#8208;fold CO2 conversion of that for BVO nanoparticles by pure water, with nearly 100% CO selectivity. The exceptional photoactivity is attributed to favorable S&#8208;scheme charge transfer from BVO to MOF then to single Ni(II) sites. Noteworthily, single Ni(II) sites anchored by the Ti(IV)&#8208;oxo node and vicinal carboxylic moieties serving as a unique local microenvironment (LME) are found to synergistically catalyze CO2 conversion. Specifically, the hydroxyl groups of carboxylic moieties can form H&#8208;bonds with CO2 to promote its adsorption on single Ni(II) sites, and also can provide accessible protons to facilitate H&#8208;assisted CO2 reduction. Moreover, the CO desorption and subsequent CO2 adsorption on single Ni(II) sites with LME is proved to be thermodynamically favored, and hence dominates the high CO selectivity. This work highlights the significance of modulating the LME of single atoms to rationally design photocatalysts for realizing carbon neutralization.

         <title>Massively Parallel Selection of NanoCluster Beacons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Approximately 40&#8197;000 distinct NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) are screened on next&#8208;generation sequencing chips and new NCBs that outperform the known best NCBs are identified. Dramatic fluorescence changes are observed by substituting a single nucleotide in an NCB, which can be explained by the proposed zipper&#8208;bag model. Combining high&#8208;throughput screening with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, bright and multicolor NCBs are designed in silico.








Abstract
NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) are multicolor silver nanocluster probes whose fluorescence can be activated or tuned by a proximal DNA strand called the activator. While a single&#8208;nucleotide difference in a pair of activators can lead to drastically different activation outcomes, termed polar opposite twins (POTs), it is difficult to discover new POT&#8208;NCBs using the conventional low&#8208;throughput characterization approaches. Here, a high&#8208;throughput selection method is reported&#160;that takes advantage of repurposed next&#8208;generation&#8208;sequencing chips to screen the activation fluorescence of &#8776;40&#8201;000&#160;activator sequences. It is found that the nucleobases at positions 7&#8211;12&#160;of the 18&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;long activator are critical to creating bright NCBs and positions 4&#8211;6&#160;and 2&#8211;4&#160;are hotspots to generate yellow&#8211;orange and red POTs, respectively. Based on these findings, a &#8220;zipper&#8208;bag&#8221; model is proposed that can explain how these hotspots facilitate the formation of distinct silver cluster chromophores and alter their chemical yields. Combining high&#8208;throughput screening with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, a pipeline is established to design bright and multicolor NCBs in silico.

         <title>Multifaceted Catalytic ROS&#8208;Scavenging via Electronic Modulated Metal Oxides for Regulating Stem Cells Fates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Developing reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging nanostructures to protect and regulate stem cells has emerged as an intriguing strategy for promoting tissue regeneration, especially in trauma microenvironments or refractory wounds. Here, we develop an electronic modulated metal oxide via Mn atom substitutions in Co3O4 nanocrystalline (Mn&#8208;Co3O4) for highly efficient and multifaceted catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging to reverse the fates of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in oxidative stress microenvironments. Benefiting from the atomic Mn&#8208;substitution and charge transfer from Mn to Co, the Co site in Mn&#8208;Co3O4 displays an increased ratio of Co2+/Co3+ and improved redox properties, thus enhancing its intrinsic and broad&#8208;spectrum catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging activities, which surpasses most of the currently reported metal oxides. Consequently, the Mn&#8208;Co3O4 can efficiently protect the MSCs from ROS attack and rescue their functions, including adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. We suggest that this work not only establishes an efficient material for catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging in stem cell&#8208;based therapeutics but also provides a new avenue to design biocatalytic metal oxides via electronic structure modulation.

         <title>Large&#8208;scale Production of Rectorite Nanosheets and their Co&#8208;assembly with Aramid Nanofibres for High&#8208;Performance Electrical Insulating Nanopapers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Compared with raw rectorite microplatelets (RMs), rectorite nanosheets (RNs) have considerably greater application prospect in the preparation of advanced composite materials because of their larger aspect ratio, higher surface reactivity, and intrinsically superior mechanical and physical properties. However, the difficulty in efficient preparation of RNs significantly limits their large&#8208;scale applications. Here, a scalable polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;assisted stirring approach was developed to prepare ultrathin RNs from the abundant natural RMs. A higher production rate (&#8764;0.675&#160;g h&#8722;1) was achieved compared with that of most other nanosheets. Additionally, instead of using conventional time&#8208; and energy&#8208;consuming high&#8208;speed centrifugation, an efficient poly (dienedimethylammonium chloride)&#8208;assisted sedimentation strategy was proposed here to rapidly separate the exfoliated RNs from the RN dispersion. Then, the RNs were co&#8208;assembled with aramid nanofibres (ANFs) into large&#8208;scale nacre&#8208;mimetic ANF&#8208;RN nanopapers with considerably enhanced mechanical, electrical insulating, and high&#8208;temperature resistant properties compared with pure ANF nanopapers and ANF&#8208;RM micropapers. Moreover, these properties were superior to those of previously reported ANF&#8208;based nanopapers and commercial insulating micropapers.

         <title>A Smart Photothermal Nanosystem with an Intrinsic Temperature&#8208;Control Mechanism for Thermostatic Treatment of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted extensive attention in disease treatments. However, conventional photothermal systems do not possess a temperature&#8208;control mechanism, which poses a serious risk to healthy tissues and/or organs due to inevitable thermal damages. Herein, we report a smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections. The smart photothermal nanosystem is constructed by loading a thermochromic material into a hollow&#8208;structured silica nanocarrier, in which the thermochromic material is composed of naturally&#8208;occurring phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), a proton&#8208;responsive spirolactone, and a proton source. The resulting nanosystem shows strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and efficient photothermal conversion in solid PCMs but becomes NIR&#8208;transparent when PCMs are melted upon NIR irradiation. Such an attractive feature can precisely regulate the photothermal equilibrium temperature to the melting point of PCMs, regardless of the variation in external experimental parameters. In contrast to conventional PTT with severe thermal damages, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds. The smart photothermal nanosystem is a versatile PTT platform, holding great promise in the safe and efficient treatment of bacterial infections and multi&#8208;modality synergistic therapy.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Cascade Responsive Nanoparticles Enhance Pancreatic Cancer Therapy by Eliminating Tumor&#8208;Resident Intracellular Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The limited drug penetration and robust bacteria&#8208;mediated drug inactivation in pancreatic cancer result in the failure of chemotherapy. To fight against these issues, a dual&#8208;cascade responsive nanoparticle (sNP@G/IR) that can sequentially trigger deep penetration, killing of intratumor bacteria, and controlled release of chemo&#8208;drug, is reported. sNP@G/IR consists of a hyaluronic acid (HA) shell and glutathione (GSH) responsive polymer&#8208;core (NP@G/IR) that encapsulates gemcitabine (Gem) and photothermal agent (IR1048). The polymer core, as an antibiotic alternative, is tailored to exert the optimal antibacterial activity and selectivity. sNP@G/IR actively homes in tumor due to CD44 targeting of the HA shell, which is subsequently degraded by the hyaluronidase in extracellular matrix. The resultant NP@G/IR in a decreased size and reversed charge facilitates deep tumor penetration. After cellular endocytosis, the exposed guanidine on NP@G/IR kills intracellular bacteria through disrupting cell membranes. Intracellular GSH further triggers the controlled release of cargos. Thus, the protected Gem eventually induces cell apoptosis. Under laser irradiation, the hyperthermia of IR1048 helps further elimination of tumors and bacteria. Moreover, sNP@G/IR activates immune response, thereby reinforcing anticancer capacity. Therefore, this dual&#8208;cascade responsive sNP@G/IR eliminates tumor&#8208;resident intracellular bacteria and augments drug delivery efficacy, providing a new avenue for improving cancer therapy.

         <title>Confinement&#8208;driven inverse domain scaling in polycrystalline ErMnO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The research on topological phenomena in ferroelectric materials has revolutionized the way we understand polar order. Intriguing examples are polar skyrmions, vortex/anti&#8208;vortex structures and ferroelectric incommensurabilties, which promote emergent physical properties ranging from electric&#8208;field&#8208;controllable chirality to negative capacitance effects. Here, we study the impact of topologically protected vortices on the domain formation in improper ferroelectric ErMnO3 polycrystals, demonstrating inverted domain scaling behavior compared to classical ferroelectrics. We observe that as the grain size increases, smaller domains are formed. Phase field simulations reveal that elastic strain fields drive the annihilation of vortex/anti&#8208;vortex pairs within the grains and individual vortices at the grain boundaries. The inversion of the domain scaling behavior has far&#8208;reaching implications, providing fundamentally new opportunities for topology&#8208;based domain engineering and the tuning of the electromechanical and dielectric performance of ferroelectrics in general.

         <title>Strong Electronic Metal&#8208;support Interaction Between Iridium Single Atoms and WO3 Support Promotes Highly Efficient and Robust CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The CO2 cycloaddition of epoxides to cyclic carbonates is of great industrial importance owing to the high economical values of its products. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have great potential in CO2 cycloaddition by virtue of their high atom utilization efficiency and desired activity, but they are generally suffered from poor reaction stability and catalytic activity arising from the weak interaction between the active centers and the supports. Here, we develop Ir single atoms stably anchored on the WO3 support (Ir1&#8208;WO3) with a strong electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). Supeirior CO2 cycloaddition is realized in the Ir1&#8208;WO3 catalyst via the EMSI effect: 100% conversion efficiency for the CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate after 15&#160;h at 40 &#176;C and excellent stability with no degradation even after 10 reaction cycles for a total of more than 150&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the EMSI effect results in significant charge redistribution between the Ir single atoms and the WO3 support, and consequently lowers the energy barrier associated with epoxide ring opening. This work furnishes new insights into the catalytic mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition and would guide the design of stable SACs for efficient CO2 cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Roughness Suppression in Electrochemical Nanoimprinting of Si for Applications in Silicon Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;assisted electrochemical nanoimprinting (Mac&#8208;Imprint) scales the fabrication of micro&#8208; and nanoscale 3D freeform geometries in silicon and holds the promise to enable novel chip&#8208;scale optics operating at the near&#8208;infrared spectrum. However, Mac&#8208;Imprint of silicon concomitantly generates mesoscale roughness (e.g., protrusion size &#8764; 45&#160;nm) creating prohibitive levels of light scattering. This arises from the requirement to coat stamps with nanoporous gold catalyst that, while sustaining etchant diffusion, imprints its pores (e.g., dave &#8764; 42&#160;nm) onto silicon. In this paper, roughness is reduced to sub&#8208;10&#160;nm levels, which is in par with plasma etching, by decreasing pore size of the catalyst via dealloying in far&#8208;from equilibrium conditions. At this level, single&#8208;digit nanometric details such as grain boundary grooves of the catalyst are imprinted and attributed to the resolution limit of Mac&#8208;Imprint which is argued to be twice the Debye length (i.e., 1.7&#160;nm) &#8211; a finding that broadly applies to metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching. Lastly, Mac&#8208;Imprint is employed to produce single&#8208;mode rib&#8208;waveguides on pre&#8208;patterned silicon&#8208;on&#8208;insulator wafers with RMS line edge roughness less than 10&#160;nm while providing depth uniformity (i.e., 42.9 &#177; 5.5&#160;nm), and limited levels of silicon defect formation (e.g., Raman peak shift &lt;0.1 cm&#8722;1) and sidewall scattering.

         <title>Chemical Welding of Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface by Zn Metal&#8208;Initiated in&#8208;situ Gelation for Ultralong&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
A compatible and robust electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface is favorable in resolving severe dendritic growth and side reactions of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries toward commercial&#8208;standard lifespan and charging&#8208;discharging rate. Herein, we report a chemical welding strategy through in&#8208;situ construction of a gel electrolyte that enables Zn&#8208;ion batteries to achieve ultralong life and reversibility. The gel electrolyte is spontaneously formed on the Zn anode surface by redox polymerization with the initiation of Zn metal. The direct participation of Zn anode in the chemical synthesis of gel electrolyte brings a well&#8208;bonded and water&#8208;poor electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which not only alleviates side reactions but also enables a preferential (002) Zn deposition. The in&#8208;situ symmetric cell thus prepared delivers an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 5100&#160;h (&gt;212 days), and a hybrid capacitor with the in&#8208;situ electrolyte runs smoothly over 40,000 cycles at 20 A g&#8722;1. Even at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and capacity of 40 mAh cm&#8722;2, the cell still operates stably for 240&#160;h, alongside a high Zn utilization with 87% depth of discharge. The in&#8208;situ gel electrolyte integrating robust interface and preparation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one cells demonstrate a commercializable path for aqueous Zn&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Optically Controlled Virtual Microsensor for Biomarker Detection In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current technologies for the real&#8208;time analysis of biomarkers in vivo, such as needle&#8208;type microelectrode and molecular imaging methods based on exogenous contrast agents, are still facing great challenges in either invasive detection or lack of active control of the imaging probes. In this study, by combining the design concepts of needle&#8208;type microelectrode and fluorescence imaging method, we have developed a new technique for detecting biomarker in vivo, named as optically controlled virtual microsensor (OCViM). OCViM is established by the organic integration of a specially shaped laser beam and fluorescent nanoprobe, which serve as the virtual handle and sensor tip, respectively. The laser beam can trap and manipulate the nanoprobe in a programmable manner, and meanwhile excite it to generate fluorescence emission for biosensing. On this basis, the fully active control of the nanoprobe was achieved noninvasively in vivo and multipoint detection could be realized at sub&#8208;micron resolution by shifting a nanoprobe among multiple positions. By using OCViM, the over&#8208;expression and heterogenous distribution of biomarkers in thrombus was studied in living zebrafish, which was further utilized for the evaluation of antithrombotic drugs. OCViM may provide a powerful tool for the mechanism study of thrombus progression and the evaluation of antithrombotic drugs.

         <title>Perovskite or Not Perovskite? A Deep&#8208;Learning Approach to Automatically Identify New Hybrid Perovskites from X&#8208;ray Diffraction Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep&#8208;learning approach is developed to automatically and accurately assign the structure type from the X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns of new hybrid lead halides. An accuracy of 92% is obtained and the new insights provided by the model allow the ability of scientists to discriminate manually between different structure types of new materials to be augmented.








Abstract
Determining the crystal structure is a critical step in the discovery of new functional materials. This process is time consuming and requires extensive human expertise in crystallography. Here, a machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based approach is developed, which allows it to be determined automatically if an unknown material is of perovskite type from&#160;powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. After training a deep&#8208;learning model on a dataset of known compounds, the structure types of new unknown compounds can be predicted using their experimental powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. This strategy is used to distinguish perovskite&#8208;type materials in a series of new hybrid lead halides. After validation, this approach is shown to accurately identify perovskites (accuracy of 92% with convolutional neural network). From the identification of the key features of the patterns used to discriminate perovskites versus nonperovskites, crystallographers can learn how to quickly identify low&#8208;dimensional perovskites from X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns.

         <title>Energy Interplay in Materials: Unlocking Next&#8208;Generation Synchronous Multisource Energy Conversion with Layered 2D Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered 2D crystals are exemplar energy conversion materials, able to convert light, heat, or motion to electricity. These energy conversion processes can also occur synchronously, leading to complex energy interplay networks during energy harvesting/transducing. This synchronous multisource energy conversion needs to be studied and understood to enable the fabrication of next&#8208;generation energy harvesting and conversion systems.








Abstract
Layered 2D crystals have unique properties and rich chemical and electronic diversity, with over 6000 2D crystals known and, in principle, millions of different stacked hybrid 2D crystals accessible. This diversity provides unique combinations of properties that can profoundly affect the future of energy conversion and harvesting devices. Notably, this includes catalysts, photovoltaics, superconductors, solar&#8208;fuel generators, and piezoelectric devices that will receive broad commercial uptake in the near future. However, the unique properties of layered 2D crystals are not limited to individual applications and they can achieve exceptional performance in multiple energy conversion applications synchronously. This synchronous multisource energy conversion (SMEC) has yet to be fully realized but offers a real game&#8208;changer in how devices will be produced and utilized in the future. This perspective highlights the energy interplay in materials and its impact on energy conversion, how SMEC devices can be realized, particularly through layered 2D crystals, and provides a vision of the future of effective environmental energy harvesting devices with layered 2D crystals.

         <title>The Third Dimension of Ferroelectric Domain Walls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tomographic microscopy techniques are applied to image the 3D&#160;network of ferroelectric domain walls in ErMnO3 with nanoscale spatial resolution. The study reveals how electrical currents propagate through the domain wall network and demonstrates the importance of local corrugation phenomena for the electronic transport behavior.








Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls are quasi&#8208;2D systems that show great promise for the development of nonvolatile memory, memristor technology, and electronic components with ultrasmall feature size. Electric fields, for example, can change the domain wall orientation relative to the spontaneous polarization and switch between resistive and conductive states, controlling the electrical current. Being embedded in a 3D&#160;material, however, the domain walls are not perfectly flat and can form networks, which leads to complex physical structures. In this work, the importance of the nanoscale structure for the emergent transport properties is demonstrated, studying electronic conduction in the 3D network of neutral and charged domain walls in ErMnO3. By combining tomographic microscopy techniques and finite element modeling, the contribution of domain walls within the bulk is clarified and the significance of curvature effects for the local conduction is shown down to the nanoscale. The findings provide insights into the propagation of electrical currents in domain wall networks, reveal additional degrees of freedom for their control, and provide quantitative guidelines for the design of domain&#8208;wall&#8208;based technology.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Casting&#8208;Assisted Liquid Additive Engineering for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot casting is shown to allow for reduced loading of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in perovskite precursor inks, and remnant DMSO in films. This suppresses formation of undesired byproducts. The resulting perovskite layers show fewer defects, while their solar cells exhibit superior operational stability under considerable UV&#8208;containing simulated solar exposure over 3000&#160;h.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance inorganic&#8211;organic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are often fabricated with a liquid additive such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which retards crystallization and reduces roughness and pinholes in the perovskite layers. However, DMSO can be trapped during perovskite film formation and induce voids and undesired reaction byproducts upon later processing steps. Here, it is shown that the amount of residual DMSO can be reduced in as&#8208;spin&#8208;coated films significantly through use of preheated substrates, or a so&#8208;called hot&#8208;casting method. Hot casting increases the perovskite film thickness given the same concentration of solutions, which allows for reducing the perovskite solution concentration. By reducing the amount of DMSO in proportion to the concentration of perovskite precursors and using hot casting, it is possible to fabricate perovskite layers with improved perovskite&#8211;substrate interfaces by suppressing the formation of byproducts, which increase trap density and accelerate degradation of the perovskite layers. The best&#8208;performing PSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.4% (23.0% stabilized efficiency) under simulated solar illumination. Furthermore, encapsulated devices show considerably reduced post&#8208;burn&#8208;in decay, retaining 75% and 90% of their initial and post&#8208;burn&#8208;in efficiencies after 3000&#160;h of operation with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under high power of ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;containing continuous light exposure.

         <title>Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficiency Exceeding 25% Realized by Co&#8208;Spacer Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By mixing m&#8208;F&#8208;PEA and NMAI to act as large organic cations in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, the phase distribution control and defect passivation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films are realized. As a result, excellent red light emission is achieved with recorded efficiency as high as 25.8% and the maximum luminance exceeding 1300 cd cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have received great attention in recent years due to their narrow emission bandwidth and tunable emission spectrum. Efficient red emission is one of most important parts for lighting and displays. Quasi&#8208;2D perovskites can deliver high emission efficiency due to the strong carrier confinement, while the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of red quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs are inefficient at present, which is due to the complex distribution of different n&#8208;value phases in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. In this work, the phase distribution of the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite is finely controlled by mixing two different large organic cations, which effectively reduces the amount of smaller n&#8208;index phases, meanwhile the passivation of lead and halide defects in perovskite films is realized. Accordingly, the PeLEDs show 25.8% EQE and 1300&#160;cd m&#8722;2 maximum brightness at 680&#160;nm, which exhibits the highest performance for red PeLEDs up to now.

Mixed&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskite compositions represent a promising route toward achieving stable and efficient solar cells. Here, the structural evolution of these absorber layers during full device operation is investigated via operando X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. A stabilizing compressive strain effect leading to the remixing of the halide population is unveiled, providing insight into new strategies toward increased device lifetimes and stability.








Mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskites are among the most promising perovskite compositions for application in a variety of optoelectronic devices due to their high performance, low cost, and bandgap&#8208;tuning capabilities. Instability pathways such as those driven by ionic migration, however, continue to hinder their further progress. Here, an operando variable&#8208;pitch synchrotron grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering technique is used to track the surface and bulk structural changes in mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation perovskite solar cells under continuous load and illumination. By monitoring the evolution of the material structure, it is demonstrated that halide remixing along the electric field and illumination direction during operation hinders phase segregation and limits device instability. Correlating the evolution with directionality&#8208; and depth&#8208;dependent analyses, it is proposed that this halide remixing is induced by an electrostrictive effect acting along the substrate out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. However, this stabilizing effect is overwhelmed by competing halide demixing processes in devices exposed to humid air or with poorer starting performance. The findings shed new light on understanding halide de&#8208; and re&#8208;mixing competitions and their impact on device longevity. These operando techniques allow real&#8208;time tracking of the structural evolution in full optoelectronic devices and unveil otherwise inaccessible insights into rapid structural evolution under external stress&#160;conditions.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>

A low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity rechargeable K&#8211;Te battery is successfully fabricated. The kinetic barrier in the thick Te cathode is knocked down by the in situ electrochemical self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous Cu1.4Te as a fast ionic pathway, and meanwhile, the K&#8208;metal anode is stabilized by electrolyte regulation. This approach could be extended to other low&#8208;temperature alkali&#8208;metal&#8211;chalcogen battery systems (Li&#8211;S, Li&#8211;Se, Na&#8211;S, Na&#8211;Se, etc.).








Abstract
High mass loading and high areal capacity are key metrics for commercial batteries, which are usually limited by the large charge&#8208;transfer impedance in thick electrodes. This can be kinetically deteriorated under low temperatures, and the realization of high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity batteries in cold climates remains challenging. Herein, a low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity rechargeable potassium&#8211;tellurium (K&#8211;Te) battery is successfully fabricated by knocking down the kinetic barriers in the cathode and pairing it with stable anode. Specifically, the in situ electrochemical self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous Cu1.4Te in a thick electrode is realized simply by coating micro&#8208;sized Te on the Cu collector, significantly improving its ionic conductivity. Meanwhile, the optimized electrolyte enables fast ion transportation and a stable K&#8208;metal anode at a large current density and areal capacity. Consequently, this K&#8211;Te battery achieves a high areal capacity of 1.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, which greatly exceeds those of most reported works. This work highlights the significance of electrode design and electrolyte engineering for high areal capacity at low temperatures, and represents a critical step toward practical applications of low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrostrictive Relaxors with Dispersive Endotaxial Nanoprecipitations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via the construction of novel local heterostructures of polar nanoregions and endotaxial nanoprecipitations with a nonpolar core in relaxor ferroelectric ceramics, an unprecedentedly large hysteresis&#8208;free strain is achieved under a low stimulated electric field, which is suitable for the application of ultrahigh precision actuator systems. The new strategy can open a new realm for the design of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric relaxors.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;precision manufacturing and detection have highlighted the importance of investigating electrostrictive materials with a weak stimulated extrinsic electric field and a simultaneous large hysteresis&#8208;free strain. In this study, a new type of electrostrictive relaxor ferroelectric is designed by constructing a complex inhomogeneous local structure to realize excellent electrostrictive properties. A remarkably large electrostrictive coefficient, M33 (8 &#215; 10&#8722;16 m2 V&#8722;2) is achieved. Through a combined atomic&#8208;scale scanning transmission electron microscopy and advanced in situ high&#8208;energy synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, it is observed that such superior electrostrictive properties can be ascribed to a special domain structure that consists of endotaxial nanoprecipitations embedded in a polar matrix at the phase boundary of the rhombohedral/tetragonal/cubic phases. The matrix contributes to the high strain response under the weak extrinsic electric field because of the highly flexible polarization and randomly dispersed endotaxial nanoprecipitations with a nonpolar central region, which provide a strong restoring force that reduces the strain hysteresis. The approach developed in this study is widely applicable to numerous relaxor ferroelectrics, as well as other dielectrics, for further enhancing their electrical properties, such as electrostriction and energy&#8208;storage capacity.

         <title>Efficient Electroreduction of Nitrate into Ammonia at Ultralow Concentrations Via an Enrichment Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoparticles encapsulated with porous carbon framework are developed as an efficient electrocatalyst for nitrate (NO3&#8722;) electroreduction at ultralow concentrations. Benefiting from the enrichment effect of porous carbon framework, the yield rate of NH3 for the electrocatalyst reached 469.5&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;.








Abstract
The electroreduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) pollutants to ammonia (NH3)&#160;offers an alternative approach for both wastewater treatment and NH3 synthesis. Numerous electrocatalysts have been reported for the electroreduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3, but most of them demonstrate poor performance at ultralow NO3&#8722; concentrations. In this study, a Cu&#8208;based catalyst for electroreduction of NO3&#8722; at ultralow concentrations is developed by encapsulating Cu nanoparticles in a porous carbon framework (Cu@C). At &#8722;0.3&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), Cu@C achieves Faradaic efficiency for NH3 of 72.0% with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;, which is 3.6 times higher than that of Cu nanoparticles. Notably, at &#8722;0.9&#160;V vs RHE, the yield rate of NH3 for Cu@C is 469.5&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, which is the highest value reported for electrocatalysts with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;. An investigation of the mechanism reveals that NO3&#8722; can be concentrated owing to the enrichment effect of the porous carbon framework in Cu@C, thereby facilitating the mass transfer of NO3&#8722; for efficient electroreduction into NH3 at ultralow concentrations.

         <title>Osteoimmunity&#8208;Regulating Biomimetically Hierarchical Scaffold for Augmented Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D printed scaffold with biomimetically hierarchical porous structure is constructed for augmented bone regeneration through the enhanced immunomodulatory, angiogenic, osteogenic, and weak osteoclastogenic abilities. Such osteoimmunity&#8208;regulating scaffold upregulates M2 macrophages by released carbon monoxide and&#160;Mn2+, enhances neovascularization through secreted vascular endothelial growth factor, and effectively stimulates osteoinductive activity while inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, offering positive enlightenment for promoting large&#8208;scale bone defect repair.








Abstract
Engineering a proper immune response following biomaterial implantation is essential to bone tissue regeneration. Herein, a biomimetically hierarchical scaffold composed of deferoxamine@poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) nanoparticles (DFO@PCL NPs), manganese carbonyl (MnCO) nanosheets, gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel, and a polylactide/hydroxyapatite (HA) matrix is fabricated to augment bone repair by facilitating the balance of the immune system and bone metabolism. First, a 3D printed stiff scaffold with a well&#8208;organized gradient structure mimics the cortical and cancellous bone tissues; meanwhile, an inside infusion of a soft hydrogel further endows the scaffold with characteristics of the extracellular matrix. A Fenton&#8208;like reaction between MnCO and endogenous hydrogen peroxide generated at the implant&#8208;tissue site triggers continuous release of carbon monoxide and Mn2+, thus significantly lessening inflammatory response by upregulating the M2 phenotype of macrophages, which also secretes vascular endothelial growth factor to induce vascular formation. Through activating the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; pathway, Mn2+ and DFO@PCL NP further promote angiogenesis. Moreover, DFO inhibits osteoclast differentiation and synergistically collaborates with the osteoinductive activity of HA. Based on amounts of data in vitro and in vivo, strong immunomodulatory, intensive angiogenic, weak osteoclastogenic, and superior osteogenic abilities of such an osteoimmunity&#8208;regulating scaffold present a profound effect on improving bone regeneration, which puts forward a worthy base and positive enlightenment for large&#8208;scale bone defect repair.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Rich MXene&#8208;Immobilized Ni Single Atoms as a High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalyst for the Hydrazine Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts on Ti defect&#8208;rich Ti3C2Tx MXene are fabricated via a combined defect&#8208;trapping and &#8220;self&#8208;reduction&#8221; process. The optimal Ni SACs on Ti3C2Tx MXene at a Ni loading of 2.93 wt% exhibit superior&#160;catalytic performance for the electrochemical hydrazine oxidation reaction, which is attributed to the optimal electronic density of states that enhances the adsorption energy and lowers the reaction energy barrier.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), on account of their outstanding catalytic potential, are currently emerging&#160;as high&#8208;performance materials in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Constructing a strong interaction between the single atom and its supporting matrix plays a pivotal role. Herein, Ti3C2Tx&#8208;MXene&#8208;supported Ni SACs are reported by using a self&#8208;reduction strategy via the assistance of rich Ti vacancies on the Ti3C2Tx MXene surface, which act as the trap and anchor sites for individual Ni atoms. The constructed Ni SACs supported by the Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ni SACs/Ti3C2Tx ) show an ultralow onset potential of &#8722;0.03 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and an exceptional operational stability toward the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Density functional theory calculations suggest a strong coupling of the Ni single atoms and their&#160;surrounding C atoms, which optimizes the electronic density of states, increasing the adsorption energy and decreasing the reaction activation energy, thus boosting the electrochemical activity. The results presented here will encourage a wider pursuit of 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;supported SACs designed by a vacancy&#8208;trapping strategy.

         <title>Controllable Heterogenous Seeding&#8208;Induced Crystallization for High&#8208;Efficiency FAPbI3&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells Over 24%</title>

         <dc:description>
Heterogenous seeding&#8208;induced crystallization is introduced to assist perovskite growth. Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl(methyl)phosphonium tetrafluoroborate is introduced into the precursor to form a low&#8208;solubility complex with PbI2, which serve as seed to induce perovskite crystallization during solvent evaporation. The hetero&#8208;SiC process is a proven effective way to manipulate the nucleation process and crystal growth, visualized by several in situ measurement tools.








Abstract
The addition of small seeding particles into a supersaturated solution is one among the most effective approaches to obtain high&#8208;quality semiconductor materials via increased crystallization rates. However, limited study is conducted on this approach for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Here, a new strategy&#8212;&#8220;heterogenous seeding&#8208;induced crystallization (hetero&#8208;SiC)&#8221; to assist the growth of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite&#160;is proposed. In this work, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl(methyl)phosphonium tetrafluoroborate is directly introduced into the precursor, which forms a low&#8208;solubility complex with PbI2. The low&#8208;solubility complex can serve as the seed to induce crystallization of the perovskite during the solvent&#8208;evaporation process. Various in situ measurement&#160;tools are used to visualize the hetero&#8208;SiC process, which is shown to be an effective way of manipulating the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites. The hetero&#8208;SiC process greatly improves the film quality, reduces film defects, and suppresses nonradiative recombination. A hetero&#8208;SIC proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device exhibits outstanding performance with 24.0% power conversion efficiency (PCE), well over the control device with 22.2% PCE. Additionally, hetero&#8208;SiC perovskite solar cell (PSC) stability under light illumination is enhanced and the PSC retains 84% of its initial performance after 1400 h of light illumination.

         <title>Visualizing Dynamic Mechanical Actions with High Sensitivity and High Resolution by Near&#8208;Distance Mechanoluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;sensitivity and high&#8208;resolution visualization of dynamic mechanical action is achieved by a proposed near&#8208;distance mechanoluminescence (ML) imaging scheme and an enhanced mechano&#8208;to&#8208;photon convertor. The developed portable ML stress sensor exhibits high sensitivity with a threshold of &#8776;kPa level, high spatial resolution with a pixel size &#8776;100&#160;&#181;m, and fast response of &#8776;3.3&#160;ms.








Abstract
Proportionally converting the applied mechanical energy into photons by individual mechanoluminescent (ML) micrometer&#8208;sized particles opens a new way to develop intelligent electronic skins as it promises high&#8208;resolution stress distribution visualization and fast response. However, a big challenge for ML sensing technology is its low sensitivity in detecting stress. In this work, a novel stress distribution sensor with the detection sensitivity enhanced by two orders of magnitude is developed by combining a proposed near&#8208;distance ML imaging scheme with an improved mechano&#8208;to&#8208;photon convertor. The enhanced sensitivity is the main contributor to the realization of a maximum photon harvesting rate of &#8776;80% in the near&#8208;distance ML imaging scheme. The developed near&#8208;distance ML sensor shows a high sensitivity with a detection limit down to &#8776;kPa level, high spatial resolution of 254&#160;dpi, and fast response with an interval of 3.3&#160;ms, which allows for high&#8208;resolution and real&#8208;time visualization of complex mechanical actions such as irregular solid contacts or fluid impacts, and thus enables use in intelligent electronic skin, structural health monitoring, and human&#8211;computer interaction.

The developed near-distance ML sensor shows a high sensitivity with a detection limit down to &#8776;kPa level, high spatial resolution of 254&#160;dpi, and fast response with an interval of 3.3&#160;ms, which allows for high-resolution and real-time visualization of complex mechanical actions such as irregular solid contacts or fluid impacts, and thus enables use in intelligent electronic skin, structural health monitoring, and human&#8211;computer interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Hydrogel Evaporator with Vertical Radiant Vessels Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off between Thermal Localization and Salt Resistance for Solar Desalination of High&#8208;Salinity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D hydrogel evaporator with vertical radiant vessels (VR&#8208;evaporator) is prepared to surmount the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between thermal localization and salt resistance for solar desalination of high&#8208;salinity, thereby achieving a groundbreaking overall performance.








Abstract
Delivering sufficient water to the evaporation surface/interface is one of the most widely adopted strategies to overcome salt accumulation in solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination. However, water transport and heat conduction loss are positively correlated, resulting in the trade&#8208;off between thermal localization and salt resistance. Herein, a 3D hydrogel evaporator with vertical radiant vessels is prepared to surmount the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off, thereby achieving high&#8208;rate and stable solar desalination of high&#8208;salinity. Experiments and numerical simulations reveal that the unique hierarchical structure, which consists of a large vertical vessel channel, radiant vessels, and porous vessel walls, facilitates strong self&#8208;salt&#8208;discharge and low longitudinal thermal conductivity. With the structure employed, a groundbreaking comprehensive performance, under one sun illumination, of evaporation rate as high as 3.53&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, salinity of 20&#160;wt%, and a continuous 8&#160;h evaporation is achieved, which thought to be the best reported result from a salt&#8208;free system. This work showcases the preparation method of a novel hierarchical microstructure, and also provides pivotal insights into the design of next&#8208;generation solar evaporators of high&#8208;efficiency and salt tolerance.

         <title>Periodic Nanoporous Inorganic Patterns Directly Made by Self&#8208;Ordering of Cracks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patterning nanoporous inorganic films by lithography remains a challenge for their integration into functional devices. Liquid deposition of aqueous inks can form patterns via self&#8208;ordering of cracks over several centimeters in both 2D and 3D. The method is chemically versatile and is shown to successfully pattern more than ten functional materials. Periodic arrays of cracks then serve as photonic sensors.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed inorganic nanoporous films are key components for the vast spectrum of applications ranging from dew harvesting to solar cells. Shaping them into complex architectures required for advanced functionality often needs time&#8208;consuming or expensive fabrication. In this work, crack formation is harnessed to pattern porous inorganic films in a single step and without using lithography. Aqueous inks, containing inorganic precursors and polymeric latexes enable evaporation&#8208;induced, defect&#8208;free periodic arrays of cracks with tunable dimensions over several centimeters. The ink formulation strategy is generalized to more than ten inorganic materials including simple and binary porous oxide and metallic films covering a whole spectrum of properties including insulating, photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, conductive, or electrochromic materials. Notably, this approach enables 3D self&#8208;assembly of cracks by stacking several layers of different compositions, yielding periodic assemblies of polygonal shapes and Janus&#8208;type patterns. The crack patterned periodic arrays of nanoporous TiO2 diffract light, and are used as temperature&#8208;responsive diffraction grating sensors. More broadly, this method represents a unique example of a self&#8208;assembly process leading to long&#8208;range order (over several centimeters) in a robust and controlled way.

         <title>A Reactive Superhydrophobic Platform for Living Photolithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach for single&#8208;step fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces with chemical reactivity is presented for photolithography in a living manner. The spatial and temporal controllability of the surface configuration under visible light enables the regulation of the location, density, and species of the functional molecules on the reactive surface, and formation of aqueous/oil microdroplets arrays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels, and integrated enzyme biochips.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces with regional functions have widespread applications in biotechnology, diagnostic applications, and micro&#8208;chemical synthesis and analysis. However, owing to their chemical inertness, superhydrophobic surfaces with chemical reactivity are difficult to achieve. Superhydrophobic surfaces that can be further modified with varied densities and expanded species of the functional moieties are not readily available. In this study, a single&#8208;step approach to achieve a reactive superhydrophobic surface is reported, on which chemical grafting of a library of molecules can be carried out through surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical addition or surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical polymerization. The excellent spatial and temporal controllability of these chemical processes under visible light enables us to take advantage of programmed liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;display (LCD) or Digital Light Processing (DLP) photolithography systems to effortlessly regulate the location, density, and species of the functional molecules on the reactive superhydrophobic surface. The distinctive properties of this surface will provide new insight into intelligent superhydrophobic material development and practical applications, such as aqueous/oil microdroplets array, multi&#8208;anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels and integrated microfluidic reactors with enzymes for chemical logic learning.

         <title>Cold&#8208;Starting All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries from Room Temperature by Thermally Modulated Current Collector in Sub&#8208;Minute</title>

         <dc:description>
A thermally modulated current collector is reported, which can rapidly cold&#8208;start all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8211;90&#160;&#176;C) in less than 1 min, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15&#8208;fold compared to one without heating.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) show great potential as high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power energy&#8208;storage devices but their attainable energy/power density at room temperature is severely reduced because of the sluggish kinetics of lithium&#8208;ion transport. Here a thermally modulated current collector (TMCC) is reported, which can rapidly cold&#8208;start ASSBs from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8211;90&#160;&#176;C) in less than 1 min, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15&#8208;fold compared to one without heating. This TMCC is prepared by integrating a uniform, ultrathin (&#8776;200&#160;nm) nickel layer as a thermal modulator within an ultralight polymer&#8208;based current collector. By isolating the thermal modulator from the ion/electron pathway of ASSBs, it can provide fast, stable heat control yet does not interfere with regular battery operation. Moreover, this ultrathin (13.2&#160;&#181;m) TMCC effectively shortens the heat&#8208;transfer pathway, minimizes heat losses, and mitigates the formation of local hot spots. The simulated heating energy consumption can be as low as &#8776;3.94% of the total battery energy. This TMCC design with good tunability opens new frontiers toward smart energy&#8208;storage devices in the future from the current collector perspective.

A single&#8208;molecule memristor with long&#8208;lasting retained memory states, high write&#8211;erase endurance, and adjustable on/off ratio is realized by a novel mechanism&#8212;dynamical structure reconfiguration in the Fries rearrangement. Precise manipulation of the potential energy surface of the reaction by external electric fields can retain and switch the corresponding desired species along the reaction coordinate to achieve a memory effect.








Abstract
A robust single&#8208;molecule memristor is prepared by covalently integrating one phenol molecule with multiple binding sites into nanogapped graphene electrodes. Multilevel resistance switching is realized by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;manipulated reconfiguration of the acyl moiety on the phenol center, that is, the Fries rearrangement. In situ measurements of the reaction trajectories with an initial single substrate and an intermediate break through the limitation of macroscopic experiments, therefore unveiling both intramolecular and intermolecular mechanistic pathways (a long&#8208;term controversy) as well as comprehensive dynamic information. Based on this advance, high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule memristors in both the solution and solid states are achieved successively, providing a new understanding of memristive systems and neural network computing.

         <title>An Initial Covalent Organic Polymer with Closed&#8208;F Edges Directly for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An initial F&#8208;decorated quasi&#8208;phthalocyanine covalent organic polymer is prepared, which delivers exceptional catalytic activity in the acidic oxygen reduction reaction and has capability to be directly applied into proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells devices, which is a stride forward among catalysts based on a pyrolysis&#8208;free conjugated&#8208;polymer network in device manner to date.








Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs) are a class of rising electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the atomically metrical control of the organic molecular components along with highly architectural robustness and thermodynamic stability even in acid or alkaline media. However, the direct application of pristine COPs as acidic ORR electrocatalysts, especially in device manner, e.g., in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), remains a big challenge. Currently, the decoration toward electronic structures of active sites is considered a vital pathway to enhancing the acidic ORR activity of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, an initial F&#8208;decorated fully closed &#960;&#8208;conjugated quasi&#8208;phthalocyanine COP (denoted as COPBTC&#8208;F) is reported. The introduction of the closed&#8208;F edges stepwise drags more electrons from FeN4 sites in COPBTC&#8208;F into the catalyst margin, which weakens the occupied numbers of bonding orbitals between COPBTC&#8208;F and OH* intermediates at the rate&#8208;determining step, exhibiting over five times intrinsic performance beyond the counterpart without F functionalities (termed as COPBTC). Significantly, the maximum power density utilizing COPBTC&#8208;F as a cathode catalyst in PEMFCs is remarkably increased by an order of magnitude compared with COPBTC, which is a stride forward among catalysts based on a pyrolysis&#8208;free conjugated&#8208;polymer network in device manner to date.

         <title>A Chiral Dual&#8208;Core Organoboron Structure Realizes Dual&#8208;Channel Enhanced Ultrapure Blue Emission and Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;core strategy, chiral organoboron structures are prepared by direct bonding of two multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) monocores, realizing superior chiroptical property and dual&#8208;channel enhanced ultrapure blue emission. Furthermore, highly efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with maximum external quantum efficiencies of 23.9% and 25.6% are achieved.








Abstract
The realization of luminescent materials with narrowband and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of great significance for the development of future optical and photonic devices. Herein, through a steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;core strategy, two pairs of chiral dual&#8208;core multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials (R/S&#8208;DOBN and R/S&#8208;DOBNT) are directly constructed by the bonding of two organoboron MR&#8208;TADF monocores (SOBN and SOBNT) with carbazole/3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and phenol derivative as donors, realizing obvious CPL and narrowband emissions. Furthermore, the dual&#8208;core effect in the prepared R/S&#8208;DOBN and R/S&#8208;DOBNT increases the transition oscillator strength two times more than that of a monocore structure, while maintaining the ultrapure blue emissions peaking at 453 and 459&#160;nm with a narrower full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 21&#160;nm through reorganization energy reduction. The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the enantiomers exhibit ultrapure blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.10) and (0.13, 0.12), high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 23.9% and 25.6%, and obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence with dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) &#8776; 10&#8722;3.

         <title>Releasable Water Charge&#8208;Trapping and Water&#8208;Resistant Photodetection using 1D Perovskitoid Hydrate Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Releasable water charge&#8208;trapping is observed from the transient absorption spectra in a quasi&#8208;1D perovskitoid single&#8208;crystal hydrate, and a dynamic model is proposed to interpret the charge trapping and release processes. Besides, water&#8208;resistant photodetection devices are fabricated based on this single crystal.








Abstract
Hydrates of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites have been discovered with MAPbI3 and are proved to be unstable in atmosphere. However, the influence of water molecules on the performance of optoelectronic devices is still not fully understood. Here, using a dication, 2&#8208;(dimethylamino) ethylamine (DMEN2+), a stable quasi&#8208;1D&#160;perovskitoid hydrate single crystal is designed and successfully synthesized, which is formulated as DMENPb2I6&#183;H2O. In this design, both corner&#8208;sharing and edge&#8208;sharing connectivity are adopted, and water molecules are connected with the crystal through hydrogen bonding. It is discovered that such water sites distributed along the inorganic chains function both as charge traps and as releasable charge stocks. Optical excitation that overcomes the potential wells formed on these water sites may release these stocked charges and facilitate enhanced transportable charge density. Meanwhile, exciton diffusion and charge transport are strongly confined in the 1D transport channels. Above mechanisms are verified both by the transient absorption spectroscopy and by the photodetection performance. This introduces a new design strategy with a trapping&#8211;stock&#8211;releasing&#8211;transport roadmap for perovskitoid materials. Excellent water resistance endows this material with more advantages in the development of a new generation of optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Reporting Fluorescent Salicylaldehyde&#8211;Chlorambucil Conjugate as a Type&#8208;II ICD Inducer for Cancer Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemotherapeutic type&#8208;II immunogenic cell death inducer. SA&#8208;Cbl. with fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ability is developed by simple conjugation of chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil with salicylaldehyde. The long&#8208;lasting effect of antitumor immunity of SA&#8208;Cbl is proved to be more effective than the non&#8208;endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeted drug doxorubicin via an in vivo model.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can activate the anticancer immune response and is highly attractive to improve cancer treatment efficacy. ICD is closely related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and a series of ICD inducers has recently been reported based on ER&#8208;targeted photodynamic/photothermal agents or metal complexes. However, these ER&#8208;targeted ICD inducers suffer from complicated synthesis and heavy&#8208;metal cytotoxicity. Inspired by the promising clinical potential of small organic molecules, herein, an ER&#8208;targeted fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ICD inducer, SA&#8208;Cbl, is developed by simple conjugation of the chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (Cbl) with salicylaldehyde (SA). SA&#8208;Cbl can selectively accumulate in the ER to induce rapid ROS generation and an unfolded protein response process, which leads to a fast release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and efficient dendritic cells maturation. Meanwhile, the ER&#8208;targeted accumulation and ER&#8208;stress&#8208;inducing process can be in situ monitored based on the turn&#8208;on fluorescence of SA&#8208;Cbl, which is highly pH&#8208; and polarity&#8208;sensitive and can selectively interact with ER proteins. Compared with the traditional chemotherapy drug doxorubicin, the superior anticancer immunity effect of SA&#8208;Cbl is verified via an in vivo tumor model.

&lt;p&gt;A chemotherapeutic type-II immunogenic cell death inducer. SA-Cbl. with fluorescent self-reporting ability is developed by simple conjugation of chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil with salicylaldehyde. The long-lasting effect of antitumor immunity of SA-Cbl is proved to be more effective than the non-endoplasmic reticulum-targeted drug doxorubicin via an in vivo model.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can activate the anticancer immune response and is highly attractive to improve cancer treatment efficacy. ICD is closely related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and a series of ICD inducers has recently been reported based on ER-targeted photodynamic/photothermal agents or metal complexes. However, these ER-targeted ICD inducers suffer from complicated synthesis and heavy-metal cytotoxicity. Inspired by the promising clinical potential of small organic molecules, herein, an ER-targeted fluorescent self-reporting ICD inducer, SA-Cbl, is developed by simple conjugation of the chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (Cbl) with salicylaldehyde (SA). SA-Cbl can selectively accumulate in the ER to induce rapid ROS generation and an unfolded protein response process, which leads to a fast release of damage-associated molecular patterns and efficient dendritic cells maturation. Meanwhile, the ER-targeted accumulation and ER-stress-inducing process can be in situ monitored based on the turn-on fluorescence of SA-Cbl, which is highly pH- and polarity-sensitive and can selectively interact with ER proteins. Compared with the traditional chemotherapy drug doxorubicin, the superior anticancer immunity effect of SA-Cbl is verified via an in vivo tumor model. This study thus provides a new strategy for developing fluorescent self-reporting ICD inducers by decoration of chemotherapeutic drugs with pH and polarity-sensitive organic fluorophores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination Symmetry Breaking of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Robust and Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking Cusingle&#8208;atom catalyst enables a good balance between catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability in nitrate electroreduction to ammonia. The catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than 2000 h, while an average ammonia production rate of 27.84 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an industrial level current density of 366 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved.








Abstract
Nitrate electrocatalytic reduction (NO3RR) for ammonia production is a promising strategy to close the N&#8208;cycle from nitration contamination, as well as an alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process with less energy consumption and carbon dioxide release. However, current long&#8208;term stability of NO3RR catalysts is usually tens of hours, far from the requirements for industrialization. Here, symmetry&#8208;broken Cusingle&#8208;atom catalysts are designed, and the catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than 2000 h, while an average ammonia production rate of 27.84&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an industrial level current density of 366&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved, obtaining a good balance between catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability. Coordination symmetry breaking is achieved by embedding one Cu atom in graphene nanosheets with two N and two O atoms in the cis&#8208;configuration, effectively lowering the coordination symmetry, rendering the active site more polar, and accumulating more NO3&#8722; near the electrocatalyst surface. Additionally, the cis&#8208;coordination splits the Cu 3d orbitals, which generates an orbital&#8208;symmetry&#8208;matched &#960;&#8208;complex of the key intermediate *ONH and reduces the energy barrier, compared with the &#963;&#8208;complex generated with other catalysts. These results reveal the critical role of coordination symmetry in single&#8208;atom catalysts, prompting the design of more coordination&#8208;symmetry&#8208;broken electrocatalysts toward possible industrialization.

         <title>A Van Der Waals Reconfigurable Multi&#8208;Valued Logic Device and Circuit Based on Tunable Negative&#8208;Differential&#8208;Resistance Phenomenon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reconfigurable, multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance device with an electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced tunability of multiple threshold voltages is proposed. Following the successful verification of the tunability of multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance phenomenon, the reconfigurability in terms of the function of multi&#8208;valued logic circuits, from ternary inverter to latch circuit, is demonstrated.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;valued logic (MVL) technology that utilizes more than two logic states has recently been reconsidered because of the demand for greater power saving in current binary logic systems. Extensive efforts have been invested in developing MVL devices with multiple threshold voltages by adopting negative differential transconductance and resistance. In this study, a reconfigurable, multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance (m&#8208;NDR) device with an electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced tunability of multiple threshold voltages is reported, which comprises a BP/ReS2 heterojunction and a ReS2/h&#8208;BN/metal capacitor. Tunability for the m&#8208;NDR phenomenon is achieved via the resistance modulation of the ReS2 layer by electrical pulses applied to the capacitor region. Reconfigurability is verified in terms of the function of an MVL circuit composed of a reconfigurable m&#8208;NDR device and a load transistor, wherein staggered&#8208;type and broken&#8208;type double peak&#8208;NDR device operations are adopted for ternary inverter and latch circuits, respectively.

         <title>Kirigami&#8208;Inspired Pressure Sensors for Wearable Dynamic Cardiovascular Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kirigami&#8208;inspired pressure sensor is developed for wearable dynamic cardiovascular monitoring. Utilizing the vertical kirigami&#8208;inspired structure and a simple fabrication process, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable bioelectronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring human pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement toward personalized cardiovascular monitoring in the era of the Internet of things.








Abstract
Continuously and accurately monitoring pulse&#8208;wave signals is critical to prevent and diagnose cardiovascular diseases. However, existing wearable pulse sensors are vulnerable to motion artifacts due to the lack of proper adhesion and conformal interface with human skin during body movement. Here, a highly sensitive and conformal pressure sensor inspired by the kirigami structure is developed to measure the human pulse wave on different body artery sites under various prestressing pressure conditions and even with body movement. COMSOL multiphysical field coupling simulation and experimental testing are used to verify the unique advantages of the kirigami structure. The device shows a superior sensitivity (35.2&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1) and remarkable stability (&gt;84&#160;000 cycles). Toward practical applications, a wireless cardiovascular monitoring system is developed for wirelessly transmitting the pulse signals to a mobile phone in real&#8208;time, which successfully distinguished the pulse waveforms from different participants. The pulse waveforms measured by the kirigami inspired pressure sensor are as accurate as those provided by the commercial medical device. Given the compelling features, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable electronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement toward personalized healthcare in the era of the Internet of Things.

         <title>Controllable Inverse Photoconductance in Semiconducting Nanowire Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interesting phenomenon in that Te nanowires (NWs) behave with&#160;a&#160;negative photoresponse to positive photoresponse under enlarged optical intensities from the UV to VIS&#8211;IR region is reported. The inverse photoconductance can be attributed to the competition between the photoconductive effect and oxygen desorption effect. Moreover, the influence of the size of Te NWs and their layers is also discussed.








Abstract
As a typical p&#8208;type semiconductor, tellurium (Te) has been widely studied for the construction of photodetectors. However, only the positive photoconductance of Te&#8208;based photodetectors based on the photoconductive effect has been observed in the reported literature. Herein, an unusual but interesting phenomenon, in&#160;that tellurium nanowires (NWs) behave with&#160;negative photoresponse to positive photoresponse under enlarged optical intensities from the UV to VIS&#8211;IR region is reported. According to the experiments and simulations, adsorbed oxygen on the surface of Te NWs plays a significant role in the abnormal photoresponse. The inverse photoconductance can be attributed to the competition between the photoconductive effect and the oxygen desorption effect. Moreover, the influence of the size and layers of Te NWs is also discussed. This inverse photoconductance phenomenon is further explored by introducing the Te&#8211;Au heterojunction system. Hot&#8208;electron injection at the Te&#8211;Au heterojunction interface induces a more obvious tendency to behave with a negative photoresponse. These findings will be beneficial for potential applications of Te&#8208;NW&#8208;based photodetectors.

         <title>Top&#8208;Layer Engineering Reshapes Charge Transfer at Polar Oxide Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polar discontinuity at the interface between ferromagnetic insulating double&#8208;perovskite La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) and SrTiO3 triggers the formation of Mn3+ at both LNMO interfaces. Such electron doping is detrimental to Ni/Mn ordering and Curie temperature of films thinner than 10 uc. Engineering the charge transfer with a LaNiO3 overlayer results in optimized ferromagnetic properties, only restricted by dimensionality effects.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer phenomena at heterointerfaces are a promising pathway to engineer functionalities absent in bulk materials but can also lead to degraded properties in ultrathin films. Mitigating such undesired effects with an interlayer reshapes the interface architecture, restricting its operability. Therefore, developing less&#8208;invasive methods to control charge transfer will be beneficial. Here, an appropriate top&#8208;interface design allows for remote manipulation of the charge configuration of the buried interface and concurrent restoration of the ferromagnetic trait of the whole film. Double&#8208;perovskite insulating ferromagnetic La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) thin films grown on perovskite oxide substrates are investigated as a model system. An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;assisted electronic reconstruction takes place initially at the LNMO polar interfaces. As a result, the magnetic properties of 2&#8211;5 unit cell LNMO films are affected beyond dimensionality effects. The introduction of a top electron&#8208;acceptor layer redistributes the electron excess and restores the ferromagnetic properties of the ultrathin LNMO films. Such a strategy can be extended to other interfaces and provides an advanced approach to fine&#8208;tune the electronic features of complex multilayered heterostructures.

         <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties of Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Micro&#8211;Nano Fibers via Thermal Drawing and Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8211;nano Bi2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectric fibers with an interfacial engineering effect are fabricated by thermal drawing. The 4 &#181;m&#8208;diameter fibers achieve a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value (ZT &#8776; 1.4) at 300 K and show a reversible bending radius smaller than 50 &#181;m, approaching the theoretical limit of elastic strain. This fabrication strategy works for large&#8208;scale inorganic thermoelectric materials and benefits the development of fiber&#8208;based thermoelectric devices.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance thermoelectric (TE) materials with great flexibility and stability are urgently needed to efficiently convert heat energy into electrical power. Recently, intrinsically crystalline, mechanically stable, and flexible inorganic TE fibers that show TE properties comparable to their bulk counterparts have been&#160;of interest to researchers. Despite remarkable progress in moving TE fibers toward room&#8208;temperature TE conversion, the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value (ZT) and bending stability still need enhancement. Herein, interfacial&#8208;engineering&#8208;enhanced TE properties of micro&#8211;nano polycrystalline TE fibers fabricated by thermally drawing Bi2Te3&#8208;based bulks in a glass&#8208;fiber template are reported. The interfacial engineering effect comes from generating stress&#8208;induced oriented nanocrystals to increase electrical conductivity and producing strain&#8208;distorted interfaces to decrease thermal conductivity. The 4 &#181;m&#8208;diameter fibers achieve a 40% higher ZT (&#8776;1.4 at 300&#160;K) than their bulk counterparts and show a reversible bending radius of 50&#160;&#181;m, approaching the theoretical elastic limit. This fabrication strategy works for a wide range of inorganic TE materials and benefits the development of fiber&#8208;based micro&#8208;TE devices.

         <title>Integrated Urinalysis Devices Based on Interface&#8208;Engineered Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Biosensors Incorporated With Electronic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;specificity electronic device based on an interface&#8208;engineered field&#8208;effect transistor biosensor is engineered for non&#8208;invasive urinalysis. The urinalysis device achieves the reliable identification of five bladder&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated proteins in urine samples. Integrated with a machine&#8208;learning algorithm, the device realizes a 95.0% bladder cancer diagnosis accuracy and can classify cancer stages with a 90.0% accuracy.








Abstract
Urinalysis is attractive in non&#8208;invasive early diagnosis of bladder cancer compared with clinical gold standard cystoscopy. However, the trace bladder tumor biomarkers in urine and the particularly complex urine environment pose significant challenges for urinalysis. Here, a clinically adoptable urinalysis device that integrates molecular&#8208;specificity indium gallium zinc oxide field&#8208;effect transistor (IGZO FET) biosensor arrays, a device control panel, and an internet terminal for directly analyzing five bladder&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated proteins in clinical urine samples, is reported for bladder cancer diagnosis and classification. The IGZO FET biosensors with engineered sensing interfaces provide high sensitivity and selectivity for identification of trace proteins in the complex urine environment. Integrating with a machine&#8208;learning algorithm, this device can identify bladder cancer with an accuracy of 95.0% in a cohort of 197 patients and 75 non&#8208;bladder&#160;cancer individuals, distinguishing cancer stages with an overall accuracy of 90.0% and assessing bladder cancer recurrence after surgical treatment. The non&#8208;invasive urinalysis device defines a robust technology for remote healthcare and personalized medicine.

         <title>Multimode Electron Tomography Sheds Light on Synthesis, Structure, and Properties of Complex Metal&#8208;Based Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 36, September 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced 3D characterization techniques for complex metal&#8208;based nanomaterials by multimode electron tomography are reviewed. Advancements in data acquisition and processing are discussed, in addition to case studies of complex nanomaterials where morphology, elemental distribution, and oxidation states must be understood in 3D to gain crucial insights and drive future design and synthesis of complex nanosystems.








Abstract
Electron tomography has become a cornerstone technique for the visualization of nanoparticle morphology in three dimensions. However, to obtain in&#8208;depth information about a nanoparticle beyond surface faceting and morphology, different electron microscopy signals must be combined. The most notable examples of these combined signals include annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF&#8208;STEM) with different collection angles and the combination of ADF&#8208;STEM with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray or electron energy loss spectroscopies. Here, the experimental and computational development of various multimode tomography techniques in connection to the fundamental materials science challenges that multimode tomography has been instrumental to overcoming are summarized. Although the techniques can be applied to a wide variety of compositions, the study is restricted to metal and metal oxide nanoparticles for the sake of simplicity. Current challenges and future directions of multimode tomography are additionally discussed.

Abstract
Owing to the rapid developments to improve the accuracy and efficiency of both experimental and computational investigative methodologies, the massive amounts of data generated have led the field of materials science into the fourth paradigm of data&#8208;driven scientific research. This transition requires the development of authoritative and up&#8208;to&#8208;date frameworks for data&#8208;driven approaches for material innovation. A critical discussion on the current advances in the data&#8208;driven discovery of materials with a focus on frameworks, machine&#8208;learning algorithms, material&#8208;specific databases, descriptors, and targeted applications in the field of inorganic materials is presented. Frameworks for rationalizing data&#8208;driven material innovation are described, and a critical review of essential subdisciplines is presented, including: i) advanced data&#8208;intensive strategies and machine&#8208;learning algorithms; ii) material databases and related tools and platforms for data generation and management; iii) commonly used molecular descriptors used in data&#8208;driven processes. Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth discussion on the broad applications of material innovation, such as energy conversion and storage, environmental decontamination, flexible electronics, optoelectronics, superconductors, metallic glasses, and magnetic materials, is provided. Finally, how these subdisciplines (with insights into the synergy of materials science, computational tools, and mathematics) support data&#8208;driven paradigms is outlined, and the opportunities and challenges in data&#8208;driven material innovation are highlighted.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to the rapid developments to improve the accuracy and efficiency of both experimental and computational investigative methodologies, the massive amounts of data generated have led the field of materials science into the fourth paradigm of data-driven scientific research. This transition requires the development of authoritative and up-to-date frameworks for data-driven approaches for material innovation. A critical discussion on the current advances in the data-driven discovery of materials with a focus on frameworks, machine-learning algorithms, material-specific databases, descriptors, and targeted applications in the field of inorganic materials is presented. Frameworks for rationalizing data-driven material innovation are described, and a critical review of essential subdisciplines is presented, including: i) advanced data-intensive strategies and machine-learning algorithms; ii) material databases and related tools and platforms for data generation and management; iii) commonly used molecular descriptors used in data-driven processes. Furthermore, an in-depth discussion on the broad applications of material innovation, such as energy conversion and storage, environmental decontamination, flexible electronics, optoelectronics, superconductors, metallic glasses, and magnetic materials, is provided. Finally, how these subdisciplines (with insights into the synergy of materials science, computational tools, and mathematics) support data-driven paradigms is outlined, and the opportunities and challenges in data-driven material innovation are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating the Coordination Environment of Mesopore&#8208;confined Single Atoms from Metalloprotein&#8208;MOFs for Highly Efficient Biocatalysis</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit unparalleled atomic utilization and catalytic efficiency, yet it is challenging to modulate SACs with highly dispersed single&#8208;atoms, mesopores and well&#8208;regulated coordination environment simultaneously and ultimately maximize their catalytic efficiency. Here, we successfully developed a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis. The results demonstrate that the constructed metalloprotein&#8208;MOF templated Fe&#8208;SACs achieve up to 23&#8208;fold and 47&#8208;fold higher activity compared to those using metal ions as the single atom source and those with large mesopores induced by Zn evaporation, respectively, as well as up to a 25&#8208;fold and 1900&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency compared to natural enzyme and natural enzyme&#8208;immobilized MOF. Furthermore, this strategy can be generalized to a variety of metal&#8208;containing metalloproteins and enzymes. The enhanced catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins. Furthermore, the developed Fe&#8208;SACs with superior peroxidase&#8208;like activity act as an excellent and effective therapeutic platform for suppressing tumor cell growth. This work advances the development of highly efficient SACs using metalloproteins&#8208;MOFs as a template with diverse biotechnological applications.

&lt;p&gt;Single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit unparalleled atomic utilization and catalytic efficiency, yet it is challenging to modulate SACs with highly dispersed single-atoms, mesopores and well-regulated coordination environment simultaneously and ultimately maximize their catalytic efficiency. Here, we successfully developed a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric-centered SACs (Fe-SACs) via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis. The results demonstrate that the constructed metalloprotein-MOF templated Fe-SACs achieve up to 23-fold and 47-fold higher activity compared to those using metal ions as the single atom source and those with large mesopores induced by Zn evaporation, respectively, as well as up to a 25-fold and 1900-fold higher catalytic efficiency compared to natural enzyme and natural enzyme-immobilized MOF. Furthermore, this strategy can be generalized to a variety of metal-containing metalloproteins and enzymes. The enhanced catalytic activity of Fe-SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores as well as the regulated coordination environment of single-atom active sites induced by metalloproteins.

         <title>Triple&#8208;function electrolyte regulation towards advanced aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The poor Zn reversibility has been criticized for limiting applications of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs); however, its behaviour in aqueous media is not fully uncovered yet. Here, we address this knowledge gap, indicating that Zn electrodes face a O2&#8208;involved corrosion besides H2 evolution and dendrite growth. Differing from aqueous Li/Na batteries, removing O2 cannot enhance ZIB performance because of the aggravated competing H2 evolution. To address Zn issues, a one&#8208;off electrolyte strategy is reported by introducing a triple&#8208;function C3H7Na2O6P, which can take effects during the shelf time of battery. It regulates H+ concentration and reduces free&#8208;water activity, inhibiting H2 evolution. A self&#8208;healing solid/electrolyte interphase (SEI) can be triggered before battery operation, which suppresses O2 adsorption corrosion and dendritic deposition. Consequently, a high Zn reversibility of 99.6% is achieved under a high discharge depth of 85%. The pouch full&#8208;cell with a lean electrolyte displays a record lifespan with capacity retention of 95.5% after 500 cycles. This study not only looks deeply into Zn behaviour in aqueous media but also underscores rules for design of active metal anodes, including Zn and Li metals, during shelf time towards real applications.

         <title>Challenges of Wafer&#8208;Scale Integration of 2D Semiconductors for High&#8208;Performance Transistor Circuits</title>

MX2&#8208;based devices for high&#8208;performance circuits are expected to be introduced in production after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET. A stacked&#8208;sheet MX2 device will look like that prepared by process simulation. The status of the process development needed to produce such a device in a fab environment, and the gaps to be overcome are described.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices may find applications as sensor or photonics devices or can be incorporated in the back end of line (BEOL) to provide additional functionality. The introduction of highly scaled 2D&#8208;based circuits for high&#8208;performance logic applications in production is projected to be implemented after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET devices. Here, a view on the requirements needed for full wafer integration of aggressively scaled 2D&#8208;based logic circuits, the status of developments, and the definition of the gaps to be bridged is provided. Today, typical test vehicles for 2D devices are single&#8208;sheet devices fully integrated in a lab environment, but transfer to a more scaled device in a fab environment has been demonstrated. This work reviews the status of the module development, including considerations for setting up fab&#8208;compatible process routes for single&#8208;sheet devices. While further development on key modules is still required, substantial progress is made for MX2 channel growth, high&#8208;k dielectric deposition, and contact engineering. Finally, the process requirements for building ultra&#8208;scaled stacked nanosheets are also reflected on.

         <title>Medium Bandgap Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptor Enabling Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 30% Efficiency Under Indoor Artificial Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The correlation between molecular structure and photovoltaic performance is lagging for constructing high&#8208;performance indoor organic photovoltaic (IOPV) cells. Herein, this relationship is investigated in depth by employing two medium bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). The newly synthesized NFA of FTCC&#8208;Br exhibits a similar optical gap and molecular energy level, but a much stronger dipole moment and larger average electrostatic potential (ESP) compared with the ITCC. After blending with the polymer donor PB2, the PB2:ITCC and PB2:FTCC&#8208;Br blends exhibit favorable bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphologies and the same driving force, but the PB2:FTCC&#8208;Br blend exhibits a large ESP difference. In organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, the PB2:ITCC&#8208;based device produces a decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.0%, whereas the PB2:FTCC&#8208;Br&#8208;based device gives a PCE of up to 14.8% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.05&#160;V, which is the highest value among organic photovoltaic cells with VOCs above 1.0&#160;V. When both acceptor&#8208;based devices work under 1000 lux of 3000 K light&#8208;emitting diode (LED), the PB2:ITCC&#8208;based 1 cm2 device yields a good PCE of 25.4%; in contrast, the PB2:FTCC&#8208;Br&#8208;based 1 cm2 device outputs an outstanding PCE of 30.2%, which is the best PCE among IOPV cells. These results suggest that a large ESP offset in photovoltaic materials is important for achieving high&#8208;efficiency OPV cells.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Socketed Sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Copper for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In&#8208;situ socketing metal nanoparticles onto perovskite oxides has shown great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but its employment in boosting ambient CO2 electroreduction (CER) is unexplored. Here we construct a CER catalyst of perovskite&#8208;socketed sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu equipped with strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSIs) to promote efficient and stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For such a catalyst, plentiful sub&#8208;3&#160;nm ellipsoid Cu particles are homogeneously and epitaxially anchored on the perovskite backbones, with concomitant creation of significant SMSIs. These SMSIs are able to not only modulate electronic structure of active Cu and facilitate adsorption/activation of key intermediates, but also strengthen perovskite&#8208;Cu adhesion and intensify resistance to structural degradation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In-situ&lt;/i&gt; socketing metal nanoparticles onto perovskite oxides has shown great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but its employment in boosting ambient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction (CER) is unexplored. Here we construct a CER catalyst of perovskite-socketed sub-3&#160;nm Cu equipped with strong metal-support interactions (SMSIs) to promote efficient and stable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; conversion. For such a catalyst, plentiful sub-3&#160;nm ellipsoid Cu particles are homogeneously and epitaxially anchored on the perovskite backbones, with concomitant creation of significant SMSIs. These SMSIs are able to not only modulate electronic structure of active Cu and facilitate adsorption/activation of key intermediates, but also strengthen perovskite-Cu adhesion and intensify resistance to structural degradation. Beneficial from these advantageous merits, when evaluated in CER, it performs comparably to or better than most reported Cu-based heteronanostructures. Relative to a physical-mixture counterpart, it features marked improvements (up to 6.2 folds) in activity and selectivity for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;, together with greatly boosted stability (&amp;gt; 80&#160;h). This work gives a new avenue to rationally design more advanced Cu-based heteronanostructures for CER.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tumor Selective Metabolic Reprogramming as a Prospective PD&#8208;L1 Depression Strategy to Reactivate Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the role of mitochondria in the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) regulation in tumors is newly revealed, making it possible to offer a prospective PD&#8208;L1&#160;regulation strategy. Moreover, multi&#8208;functional IR&#8208;LND@Alb platform&#8208;induced tumor&#8208;selective metabolic reprogramming can depress PD&#8208;L1 expression and alleviate tumor hypoxia to reactivate immunotherapy and sensitize photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Currently, the role of the lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, or dictyosome in the transcription and translation of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) is well revealed, but the role and function of mitochondria in the PD&#8208;L1&#160;expression in tumors is still not fully researched, making it hard to offer a novel PD&#8208;L1&#160;regulation strategy. In this research, it is newly revealed that mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) depression can be used as an effective PD&#8208;L1&#160;down&#8208;regulation method. To offer an ideal and high&#8208;effective tumor mitochondria&#8208;targeted OXPHOS depression nanosystem, IR&#8208;LND is prepared by conjugating mitochondria&#8208;targeted heptamethine cyanine dye IR&#8208;68&#160;with mitochondrial complexes I and II depression agent lonidamine (LND), which then further self&#8208;assembled with albumin (Alb) to form IR&#8208;LND@Alb nanoparticles. By doing this, PD&#8208;L1&#160;expression in tumors is selectively and effectively depressed by IR&#8208;LND@Alb nanoparticles. As expected, the anti&#8208;tumor efficacy of such a PD&#8208;L1&#160;depression strategy is superior to conventional anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#160;monoclonal antibodies. Interestingly, IR&#8208;LND can also be served as a novel ideal promising photodynamic therapy (PDT) drug with self&#8208;oxygen and self&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#160;regulation capacity. All in all, this tumor&#8208;selective metabolic reprogramming platform to reactivate immunotherapy and sensitize for PDT effect, would open a new window for mitochondrial immunotherapy for cancer patients.

         <title>A Silica&#8208;Reinforced Composite Electrolyte with Greatly Enhanced Interfacial Lithium&#8208;Ion Transfer Kinetics for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte composed of fumed silica and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene)&#8208;based gel polymer electrolyte is designed and fabricated. Benefiting from the high ionic conductivity, good mechanical strength, homogeneous Li+ flux regulation, and inorganic Li2S&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, the prepared solid&#8208;like electrolyte enables superb cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes with superior ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength is urgently desired to improve the safety and cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, a novel solid&#8208;like electrolyte (SLE) with enhanced Li+ interfacial transfer kinetics is rationally designed by soaking bulk nanostructured silica&#8211;polymer composites in liquid electrolytes. Benefiting from the high content of inorganic silica and abundant interfaces for fast Li+&#8208;transport channels, the prepared SLE exhibits superb ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength. Furthermore, fumed silica with a high specific area in the SLE can homogenize Li+ flux and electrical field gradient. More importantly, a Li2S&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is constructed on the lithium metal due to the intimate ion coordination in the SLE. Therefore, the lithium&#8208;metal anode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in symmetric Li&#8211;Li cells due to the merits of superior ionic conductivity, high modulus, Li2S&#8208;rich SEI, as well as the homogeneous Li+ flux. Full cells with LiFePO4 cathode can still display&#160;a capacity retention of 98% at 0.2&#8201;C after 400 cycles. The proposed strategy on quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes provides a promising avenue for next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Perovskite Wide&#8208;Angle Field&#8208;Of&#8208;View Camera</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wide&#8208;angle field&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOV) cameras (fish eye camera and compound eye camera) simultaneously exhibiting low distortion and high spatial resolution is still a huge challenge. To solve this problem, a new type of wide&#8208;angle FOV camera is developed by combining a single large&#8208;area flexible perovskite&#8208;based photodetector and computational technology.








Abstract
Researchers have attempted to create wide&#8208;angle field&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOV) cameras inspired by the structure of the eyes of animals, including fisheye and compound eye cameras. However, realizing wide&#8208;angle FOV cameras simultaneously exhibiting low distortion and high spatial resolution remains a significant challenge. In this study, a novel wide&#8208;angle FOV camera is developed by combining a single large&#8208;area flexible perovskite photodetector (FP&#8208;PD) using computational technology. With this camera, the proposed single&#8208;photodetector imaging technique can obtain high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution images using only a single detector, and the large&#8208;area FP&#8208;PD can be bent further to collect light from a wide&#8208;angle FOV. The proposed camera demonstrates remarkable features of an extraordinarily tunable wide FOV (greater than 150&#176;), high spatial resolution of 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixels, and low distortion. It is believed that the proposed compatible and extensible camera prototype will promote the development of high&#8208;performance versatile FOV cameras.

         <title>Single&#8208;crystal Perovskite Solar Cells Exhibit Close to Half A Millimeter Electron Diffusion Length</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal halide perovskites exhibit photogenerated carriers of high mobility and long lifetime, making them excellent candidate materials for applications that demand thick semiconductors, such as ionizing radiation detectors, nuclear batteries, and concentrated photovoltaics. However, charge collection depreciates with increasing thickness such that tens to hundreds of volts of external bias is required to extract charges from a thick perovskite layer, leading to a considerable amount of dark current and fast degradation of perovskite absorbers. However, extending the carrier diffusion length could mitigate many of the anticipated issues that prevent the practical utilization of perovskites in the abovementioned applications. Here we fabricate single&#8208;crystal MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells that are up to 400 times thicker than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite polycrystalline films, yet retain high charge collection efficiency in the absence of an external bias. Cells with thicknesses of 110, 214, and 290&#160;&#956;m displayed power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 20.0, 18.4, and 14.7%, respectively. The remarkable persistence of these high PCEs, despite the increase in thickness, is a result of a long electron diffusion length in those cells, which we estimated, from the thickness&#8208;dependent short&#8208;circuit current, to be &#8764;0.45&#160;mm under 1&#8208;sun illumination. These results pave the way for adapting perovskite devices to optoelectronic applications in which a thick active layer is essential, such as direct X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Tropocollagen&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Spiral Structure of Organic Fibers in Epoxy Bulk for 3D High Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully organic yet 3D thermoconductive bulk material is fabricated via weaving the hierarchical spiral poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole) fibers into an epoxy matrix. Significantly, not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral, and weaving structure of poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole), but also the bridging noncrystalline chains enable spatially phonon transport. This paves the way for fully organic materials in the fields of advanced thermal management.








Abstract
Polymers are usually considered thermal insulators; however, significant enhancements in thermal conductivity (k) have been observed in oriented fibers and films. Despite being advantageous in real&#8208;world applications, extending the linear thermal&#8208;transport advantage of polymers into the 3D space in bulk materials is still limited due to the spatially interfacial phonon&#8208;conduction barriers. Herein, inspired by the structure of tropocollagen, it is discovered that weaving hierarchically arranged poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers with a spiral configuration into an epoxy matrix can yield a 3D continuous thermal pathway. This achieves both a through&#8208;plane k of 10.85&#160;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 and an in&#8208;plane k of 7.15&#160;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1. Theoretical molecular simulations in combination with classical nonlinear modeling attribute the above spatially thermally conductive achievement to not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral and weaving structure of PBO, but also the noncrystalline chains that carry overlapping phonon density of states, thus thermally bridging adjacent high&#8208;k crystals in the PBO fiber. Consequently, the interfacial thermal resistance among high&#8208;k PBO crystals is suppressed to be on the order of 10&#8722;10&#8201;m2&#8201;K&#8201;W&#8722;1 in both the through&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane directions. Other advantages include being lightweight, mechanically strong, flexible, and non&#8208;combustible. This material creates opportunities for organic polymers in high&#8208;performance thermal management applications.

         <title>Reversibly controlled ternary polar states and ferroelectric bias promoted by boosting square&#8208;tensile&#8208;strain</title>

Abstract
Interaction between dipoles often emerges intriguing physical phenomena, such as exchange bias in the magnetic heterostructures and magnetoelectric effect in multiferroics, which lead to advances in multifunctional heterostructures. However, the defect&#8208;dipole tends to be considered the undesired to deteriorate the electronic functionality. Here, we report deterministic switching between the ferroelectric and the pinched states by exploiting a new substrate of cubic perovskite, BaZrO3, which boosts square&#8208;tensile&#8208;strain to BaTiO3 and promotes four&#8208;variants in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarization with oxygen vacancy creation. First&#8208;principles calculations propose a complex of an oxygen vacancy and two Ti3+ ions coins a charge&#8208;neutral defect&#8208;dipole. Cooperative control of the defect&#8208;dipole and the spontaneous polarization reveals ternary in&#8208;plane polar states characterized by biased/pinched hysteresis loops. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that three electrically controlled polar&#8208;ordering states lead to switchable and non&#8208;volatile dielectric states for application of non&#8208;destructive electro&#8208;dielectric memory. This discovery opens a new route to develop functional materials via manipulating defect&#8208;dipoles and offers a novel platform to advance heteroepitaxy beyond the prevalent perovskite substrates.

Abstract
Machine learning has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, often referred to as an &#8220;artificial intelligence revolution.&#8221; Biological systems inspire the fundamental approach for this new computing paradigm: using neural networks to classify large amounts of data into sorting categories. Current machine learning schemes implement simulated neurons and synapses on standard computers based on a von Neumann architecture. This approach is inefficient in energy consumption, and thermal management, motivating searching for hardware&#8208;based systems that imitate the brain. This tutorial describes the present state of thermal management of neuromorphic computing technology and describes the challenges and opportunities of the energy&#8208;efficient implementation of neuromorphic devices. The introduction is presented in chapter 1, where we briefly describe the main features of brain&#8208;inspired computing and quantum materials for implementing neuromorphic devices. In chapter 2 we discuss the brain criticality and resistive switching&#8208;based neuromorphic devices. Chapter 3 presents the energy and electrical considerations for spiking&#8208;based computation. We address the fundamental features of the brain's thermal regulation in chapter 4. Hereafter, we analyse the physical mechanisms for thermal management (chapter 5) and thermoelectric control of materials and neuromorphic devices (chapter 6). At the end we describe challenges and new avenues for implementing energy&#8208;efficient computing.

         <title>50C Fast&#8208;charge Li&#8208;ion Batteries Using Graphite Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) now have made inroads into the electric vehicle market with high energy densities, yet they still suffer from slow kinetics limited by the graphite anode. Here, we design electrolytes enabling extreme fast charging (XFC) of microsized graphite anode without Li plating. The comprehensive characterizations and simulations on the diffusion of Li+ in the bulk electrolyte, charge&#8208;transfer process, and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) demonstrate that high ionic conductivity, low desolvation energy of Li+ and protective SEI are essential for XFC. Based on the criterion, two fast&#8208;charging electrolytes are designed: low&#8208;voltage 1.8&#160;M LiFSI in 1,3&#8208;Dioxolane (DOL) (for LiFePO4||graphite cells) and high&#8208;voltage 1.0&#160;M LiPF6 in a mixture of 4&#8208;Fluoroethylene Carbonate (FEC) and Acetonitrile (AN) (7:3 by vol.) (for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||graphite cells). The former electrolyte enables the graphite electrode to achieve 180 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50C (1C = 370 mAh g&#8722;1), which is 10 times higher than that with conventional electrolyte. The latter electrolyte enables LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||graphite cells (2 mAh cm&#8722;2, N/P ratio = 1) to provide a record&#8208;breaking reversible capacity of 170 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4C charge and 0.3C discharge. This work unveils the key mechanisms for XFC and provides instructive electrolyte design principles for practical fast&#8208;charging LIBs with graphite anodes.

         <title>Hydro/Organo/Ionogels: &#8220;Controllable&#8221; Electromagnetic Wave Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Demand for electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbers continues to increase with technological advances in wearable electronics and military applications. In this study, we propose a new strategy to overcome the drawbacks of current absorbers by employing the co&#8208;contribution of functional polymer frameworks and liquids with strong EMW absorption properties. Strongly polar water, DMSO/water mixtures, and highly conductive 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate ([EMI][ES]) were immobilized in dielectrically inert polymer networks to form different classes of gels (hydrogels, organogels and ionogels). These gels demonstrate a high correlation between their dielectric properties and polarity/ionic conductivity/non&#8208;covalent interaction of immobilized liquids. Thus, the EMW absorption performances of the gels can be precisely tuned over a wide range due to the diversity and stability of the liquids. The prepared hydrogels show good shielding performance (shielding efficiency &gt; 20&#160;dB) due to the high dielectric constants, while organogels with moderate attenuation ability and impedance matching achieve full&#8208;wave absorption in X&#8208;band (8.2&#8208;12.4&#160;GHz) at 2.5 &#177; 0.5&#160;mm. The ionogels also offer a wide effective absorption bandwidth (10.79&#8208;16.38&#160;GHz at 2.2&#160;mm) via prominent ionic conduction loss. In short, this work provides a conceptually novel platform to develop high&#8208;efficient, customizable, and low&#8208;cost functional absorbers.

In this study, we propose a new strategy to overcome the drawbacks of current absorbers by employing the co-contribution of functional polymer frameworks and liquids with strong EMW absorption properties. Strongly polar water, DMSO/water mixtures, and highly conductive 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate ([EMI][ES]) were immobilized in dielectrically inert polymer networks to form different classes of gels (hydrogels, organogels and ionogels). These gels demonstrate a high correlation between their dielectric properties and polarity/ionic conductivity/non-covalent interaction of immobilized liquids. Thus, the EMW absorption performances of the gels can be precisely tuned over a wide range due to the diversity and stability of the liquids. The prepared hydrogels show good shielding performance (shielding efficiency &amp;gt; 20&#160;dB) due to the high dielectric constants, while organogels with moderate attenuation ability and impedance matching achieve full-wave absorption in X-band (8.2-12.4&#160;GHz) at 2.5 &#177; 0.5&#160;mm. The ionogels also offer a wide effective absorption bandwidth (10.79-16.38&#160;GHz at 2.2&#160;mm) via prominent ionic conduction loss. In short, this work provides a conceptually novel platform to develop high-efficient, customizable, and low-cost functional absorbers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Transfer Tattoo&#8208;Like Cell Sheet Delivery induced by Interfacial Cell Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We introduce a direct transfer of a cell sheet from a culture surface to a targeted tissue. We use commercially available, flexible parylene as the culture surface, and propose that the UV&#8208;treated parylene offers adequate and intermediate levels of cell adhesiveness, for both the stable cell binding during culture and for the efficient cell transfer to a target surface. The versatility of this cell transfer process is demonstrated with various cell types, including MRC&#8208;5, HDFn, HULEC&#8208;5a, MC3T3&#8208;E1, A549, C2C12 cells, and MDCK&#8208;II cells. The novel cell sheet engineering is based on a mechanism of interfacial cell migration between two surfaces with different adhesion preferences. Monitoring of cytoskeletal dynamics and drug treatments during the cell transfer process reveals that the interfacial cell migration occurs by utilizing the existing transmembrane proteins on the cell surface to bind to the target surface. We also identify the re&#8208;establishment and maintenance of cell polarity after the transfer process. We demonstrate its unique capabilities of 3D multi&#8208;layer stacking, freeform designing and curved surface application. Finally, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the cell sheet delivery system by applying it to cutaneous wound healing and skin tissue regeneration in mice models.

An holistic analysis on the recent developments of solid&#8208;state phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) for innovative thermal&#8208;energy storage (TES) applications. The phase&#8208;transition fundamentals of solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid (S&#8211;S) PCMs are introduced and discussed, developing strategies and molecular engineering design toward potential applications. The current challenges and future research directions on S&#8211;S PCMs in TES applications are also proposed.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) offer tremendous potential to store thermal energy during reversible phase transitions for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. The practicality of these materials is adversely restricted by volume expansion, phase segregation, and leakage problems associated with conventional solid&#8208;liquid PCMs. Solid&#8211;solid PCMs, as promising alternatives to solid&#8211;liquid PCMs, are gaining much attention toward practical thermal&#8208;energy storage (TES) owing to their inimitable advantages such as solid&#8208;state processing, negligible volume change during phase transition, no contamination, and long cyclic life. Herein, the aim is to provide a holistic analysis of solid&#8211;solid PCMs suitable for thermal&#8208;energy harvesting, storage, and utilization. The developing strategies of solid&#8211;solid PCMs are presented and then the structure&#8211;property relationship is discussed, followed by potential applications. Finally, an outlook discussion with momentous challenges and future directions is presented. Hopefully, this review will provide a guideline to the scientific community to develop high&#8208;performance solid&#8211;solid PCMs for advanced TES applications.

         <title>Molecular sieve electrolyte membrane enables separator&#8208;free zinc batteries with ultralong cycle life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The poor stability of zinc metal anode is a main bottleneck for practical application of aqueous zinc ion batteries. Herein, a series of molecular sieves with various channel sizes are investigated as electrolyte host to regulate the ionic environment of Zn2+ on the surface of zinc anode and to realize separator&#8208;free batteries. Based on the ZSM&#8208;5 molecular sieve, a solid&#8208;liquid mixed electrolyte membrane is constructed to uniformize the zinc ions transport and foster dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. Side reactions can also be suppressed through tailoring the solvation sheath and restraining the activity of water molecules in electrolyte. A V2O5||ZSM&#8208;5||Zn full cell shows significantly enhanced performance compared to cells using glass fiber separator. Specifically, it exhibits a high specific capacity of 300 mAh g&#8722;1, and a capacity retention of 98.67% after 1000 cycles and 82.67% after 3000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. It is attested that zeolites (ZSM&#8208;5, H&#8208;&#946;, and Bate) with channel sizes of 5&#8211;7 &#197; results in best cycle stability. Given the low cost and recyclability of the ZSM and its potent function, this work may further lower the cost and boost the industrial application of AZIBs.

         <title>Puffball&#8208;Inspired Microrobotic Systems with Robust Payload, Strong Protection, and Targeted Locomotion for On&#8208;Demand Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Microrobots have been recognized as transformative solutions for drug delivery systems (DDSs) because they can navigate through the body to specific locations and enable targeted drug release. However, their realization is substantially limited by insufficient payload capacity, unavoidable drug leakage/deactivation, and strict modification/stability criteria for drugs. Natural puffballs possess fascinating features that are highly desirable for DDSs, including a large fruitbody for storing spores, a flexible protective cap, and environmentally&#8208;triggered release mechanisms. This report presents a puffball&#8208;inspired microrobotic system which incorporates: an internal chamber for loading large drug quantities and spatial drug separation; and a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive top&#8208;sealing layer offering strong drug protection and on&#8208;demand release. These puffball&#8208;inspired microrobots (PIMs) display tunable loading capacities up to high concentrations and enhanced drug protection with minimal drug leakage. Upon near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, on&#8208;demand drug delivery with rapid release efficiency is achieved. The PIMs also demonstrate translational motion velocities, switchable motion modes, and precise locomotion under a rotating magnetic field. This work provides strong proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a DDS that combines the superior locomotion capability of microrobots with the unique characteristics of puffballs, thereby illustrating a versatile avenue for development of a new generation of microrobots for targeted drug delivery.

         <title>Catalase&#8208;Mimetic Artificial Biocatalysts with Ru Catalytic Centers for ROS Elimination and Stem&#8208;Cell Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;efficiency reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;elimination materials is of great importance for combating oxidative stress in diverse diseases, especially stem cell&#8208;based biotherapeutics. By mimicking the Fe&#8208;N active centers of natural catalase, and here we report an innovative concept to design ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts with Ru catalytic centers for stem&#8208;cell protection. The experimental studies and theoretical calculations have systematically disclosed the activity merits and structure diversities of different Ru sites when serving as ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts. Benefiting from the metallic electronic structures and synergetic effects of multiple sites, the artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers present exceptional ROS&#8208;elimination activity; notably, it shows much higher catalytic efficiency per Ru atom on decomposing H2O2 when compared to the isolated single&#8208;atom Ru sites, which is more efficient than that of the natural antioxidants and recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ROS&#8208;scavenging biocatalysts. The systematic stem&#8208;cell protection studies disclose that the catalase&#8208;like artificial biocatalysts can provide efficient rescue ability for the survival, adhesion, and differentiation functions of human mesenchymal stem cells in high ROS level conditions. We suggest that applying these artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers will offer a new pathway for engineering high&#8208;performance ROS&#8208;scavenging materials in stem cell&#8208;based therapeutics and many other ROS&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic PtRhBiSnSb Nanoplates for Highly Efficient Alcohol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>

Abstract
The control of multimetallic ensembles at the atomic&#8208;level is challenging, especially for the high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) possessing five or more elements. Herein, we report the one&#8208;pot synthesis of hexagonal close packed (hcp) PtRhBiSnSb high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoplates with intrinsically isolated Pt, Rh, Bi, Sn, and Sb atoms, to boost the electrochemical oxidation of liquid fuels. Taking advantage of these combined five metals, the well&#8208;defined PtRhBiSnSb HEI nanoplates exhibit a remarkable mass activity of 19.529, 15.558, and 7.535 A mg&#8722;1Pt+Rh towards the electrooxidation of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol in alkaline electrolytes, respectively, representing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multifunctional electrocatalyst for alcohol oxidation reactions. In particular, the PtRhBiSnSb HEI achieves the record&#8208;high methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity in the alkaline environment. Theoretical calculations have demonstrated the introduction of the fifth metal Rh enhances the electron transfer efficiency in PtRhBiSnSb HEI nanoplates, which contributes to the improved oxidation capability. Meanwhile, the robust electronic structures of active sites are achieved due to the synergistic protections from Bi, Sn, and Sb sites. This work has offered significant research advances in developing well&#8208;defined HEA with delicate control over compositions and properties.

         <title>Universal Metasurfaces for Complete Linear Control of Coherent Light Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent advances in metasurfaces and optical nanostructures have enabled complex control of incident light with optically thin devices. However, it has thus far been unclear whether it is possible to achieve complete linear control of coherent light transmission, i.e., independent control of polarization, amplitude, and phase for both input polarization states, with just a single, thin nanostructure array. Here we prove that it is possible and propose a universal metasurface, a bilayer array of high&#8208;index elliptic cylinders, that possesses a complete degree of optical freedom with fully designable chirality and anisotropy. We mathematically show the completeness of achievable light control with corresponding Jones matrices, experimentally demonstrate new types of three&#8208;dimensional holographic schemes that were formerly impossible, and present a systematic way of realizing any input&#8208;state&#8208;sensitive vector linear optical device. Our results unlock previously inaccessible degrees of freedom in light transmission control.

         <title>Local Diverse Polarization Optimized Comprehensive Energy Storage Performance in Lead&#8208;Free Superparaelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lead&#8208;free dielectric ceramics with ultrahigh energy storage performance are the core components used in next&#8208;generation advanced pulse power capacitors. However, the low energy storage density largely hinders their development towards miniaturization, lightweight, and integration. Here, an effective strategy of constructing local diverse polarization is designed in superparaelectrics to realize an ultrahigh energy storage density of &#8764;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 as well as a large efficiency of &#8764;87.6%. The excellent comprehensive energy storage performance is mainly attributed to the design of ultrasmall polar nanoregions with local diverse polarization configuration, confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, leading to the reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization and breakdown electric field compared to ceramics with single polarization configuration. Benefiting from these features, outstanding temperature/frequency/cycling stability and superior charge/discharge performance (power density &#8764;187.5 MW cm&#8722;3, discharge energy density &#8764;3.52 J cm&#8722;3, discharge rate &#8764;77&#160;ns) are also achieved. This work demonstrates that local diverse polarization is a super strategy to design new dielectric materials with high energy storage performance.

         <title>Nature&#8208;inspired design of molybdenum&#8211;selenium dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) is becoming an increasingly important technology for achieving carbon neutrality. Inspired by the structure of naturally occurring Mo&#8208;dependent enzymes capable of activating CO2, we demonstrate here a heteronuclear Mo&#8211;Se dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst (MoSA&#8211;SeSA) for ECR into CO with a Faradaic efficiency of above 90% over a broad potential window from &#8211;0.4 to &#8211;1.0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Both operando characterization and theoretical simulation results verify that MoSA acts as central atoms that directly interact with ECR feedstock and intermediates, whereas the SeSA adjacent to MoSA modulates the electronic structure of MoSA through the long&#8208;range electron delocalization for inhibiting MoSA poisoning caused by strong CO adsorption. In addition, the SeSAs far from MoSA help suppress the competing hydrogen evolution side reaction and accelerate the CO2 transport by repelling H2O. Our work provides new insight into the precise regulation and in&#8208;depth understanding of multisite synergistic catalysis at the atomic scale.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The realization of practical nonaqueous lithium&#8208;air batteries (LABs) calls for novel strategies to address their numerous theoretical and technical challenges. LiOH formation/decomposition has recently been proposed as a promising alternative route to cycling LABs via Li2O2. Herein, the progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous lithium&#8208;air batteries is reviewed. Various catalytic systems, either soluble or solid&#8208;state, that can activate a LiOH&#8208;based electrochemistry are compared in detail, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in nonaqueous media. We identify the key factors that can switch the cell chemistry between Li2O2 and LiOH and highlight the debate around these routes, as well as rationalizing potential causes for these opposing opinions. The identities of the reaction intermediates, activity of redox mediators and additives, location of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, as well as the effect of CO2 on the LiOH electrochemistry, all play a critical role in altering the relative rates of a series of interconnected reactions and all warrant further investigation.

         <title>Role of Interfaces in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are considered as one of the most promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology, because they simultaneously exhibit high safety, high energy density, and wide operating temperature range. The replacement of liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes produces numerous solid&#8208;solid interfaces within the SSBs. A thorough understanding on the roles of these interfaces is indispensable for the rational performance optimization. In this Review, we discuss the interface issues in the SSBs, including internal buried interfaces within solid electrolytes and composite electrodes, and planar interfaces between electrodes and solid electrolyte separators or current collectors. The challenges and future directions on the investigation and optimization of these solid&#8208;solid interfaces for the production of the SSBs are also assessed.

The challenges and future directions on the investigation and optimization of these solid-solid interfaces for the production of the SSBs are also assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Lattice Dynamics in Photo&#8208;Excited Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskites</title>

Abstract
Interplay between structural and photophysical properties of metal halide perovskites is critical to their utility in optoelectronics, but limited understanding of lattice response upon excitation exists. Here, we investigate two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites butylammonium lead iodide, (BA)2PbI4, and phenethylammonium lead iodide, (PEA)2PbI4, using ultrafast transient X&#8208;ray diffraction (TrXRD) as a function of optical excitation fluence to discern structural dynamics. Both powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (TrPL) linewidths exhibit narrowing over 1 ns following optical excitation for the fluence range studied, concurrent with slight red&#8208;shifting of the optical bandgaps. We attribute these observations to transient relaxation of distorted lead iodide octahedra stimulated mainly by electron&#8208;hole pair creation. The c axis expands up to 0.37% over hundreds of picoseconds; reflections sampling the a and b axes undergo one tenth of this expansion with the same timescale. Post&#8208;photo&#8208;excitation appearance of the (110) reflection in (BA)2PbI4 would suggest a transient phase transition; however, through new single crystal XRD we find reflections that violate glide plane conditions in the reported Pbca structure and reassign the static structure space group as P212121; with this we rule out non&#8208;equilibrium phase transition. These findings offer increased understanding of remarkable lattice response in 2D perovskites upon excitation.

         <title>Thermoformable Boron Nitride Based All&#8208;Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermoforming processing, traditionally reserved for thermoplastic polymers and sheet metals, has been extended here to boron&#8208;based all&#8208;ceramics. Specifically, sintered boron nitride composite sheets manufactured via a combined vibration and tape&#8208;casting photopolymerization process exhibited highly oriented microstructure which allowed these preform sheets to flow as viscous Bingham pseudoplastics during compression molding. These sintered all&#8208;ceramic preforms are thermoformed into thin, complex parts with features down to 200&#160;&#956;m. Further, a new workflow is leveraged to generate bespoke all&#8208;ceramic heat spreaders that can be press&#8208;fit onto printed circuit boards and outperform metal heat sinks as a low&#8208;profile thermal management solution. This work offers a route for other all&#8208;ceramics that may be thermoformed through first fabricating pre&#8208;forms with highly&#8208;ordered anisotropic microstructures.

         <title>An Irradiance&#8208;Adaptable Near&#8208;Infrared Vertical Heterojunction Phototransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared phototransistor using the graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel is fabricated. The device demonstrates an intense gate voltage&#8208;dependent photoresponse. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhabitation or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively.








Abstract
Bioinspired artificial visual perception devices with the optical environment&#8208;adaptable function have attracted significant attention for their promising potential in applications like robotics and machine vision. In this regard, a photodetector with in&#8208;sensor adaptability is longed for in terms of complexity, efficiency, and cost. Here, a near&#8208;infrared phototransistor with a benign light irradiance&#8208;adaptability is presented. The phototransistor uses a vertically stacking graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel. Compared with ordinary lead sulfide quantum dots&#8208;decorated graphene phototransistors, the present device demonstrates a faster photoresponse speed and an abnormal transfer characteristic. The latter characteristic is induced by the gate voltage&#8208;tunable Fermi level in the heterojunction and the abundant electron trap states in the quantum dot film, which jointly results in an intense dependence of the photoresponse on the gate voltage. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhabitation or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively. By providing an irradiance&#8208;adaptable photodetector with a spectral response beyond visible light, this work should inspire future research on artificial environment&#8208;adaptable perception devices.

         <title>In Situ Silver&#8208;based Electrochemical Oncolytic Bioreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor has been established to unlock anti&#8208;tumor Ag+ prodrugs for highly&#8208;efficient subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor recession via activating reactive oxygen species production, wherein reduced graphene oxide featuring 20&#8208;fold larger catalysis rate than graphene oxide allows intratumoral H2O2 as reductants to reduce Ag+ into silver nanoparticles especially after uniting with VitC&#8208;mediated H2O2 production.








Abstract
In this study, it is shown for the first time that a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) carrier has a 20&#8208;fold higher catalysis rate than graphene oxide in Ag+ reduction. Based on this, a tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor (SEOB) which switched Ag+ prodrugs into in situ therapeutic silver nanoparticles with and above 95% transition rate is constructed to inhibit the growths of various tumors. In this SEOB&#8208;enabled intratumoral nanosynthetic medicine, intratumoral H2O2 and rGO act as the reductant and the catalyst, respectively. Chelation of aptamers to the SEOB&#8208;unlocked prodrugs increases the production of silver nanoparticles in tumor cells, especially in the presence of Vitamin C, which is broken down in tumor cells to supply massive amounts of H2O2. Consequently, apoptosis and pyroptosis are induced to cooperatively contribute to the considerably&#8208;elevated anti&#8208;tumor effects on subcutaneous HepG2 and A549 tumors and orthotopic implanted HepG2 tumors in livers of nude mice. The specific aptamer targeting and intratumoral silver nanoparticle production guarantee excellent biosafety since it fails to elicit tissue damages in monkeys, which greatly increases the clinical translation potential of the SEOB system.

         <title>Unbreakable Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Recoverable 10&#8239;200% Stretchability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unbreakable networks are simply constructed in hydrogels via copolymerization of divinyl benzene micellar with acrylamide. The network provides both dynamic hydrophobic association for recoverable small deformations and homogeneous crosslinking for reversible alignment of polymer chains to resist ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;recoverable 102 times stretchability, and superior resistance of fracture and fatigue.








Abstract
Design of tough hydrogels maintaining structural integrity under multivariable mechanical loads remains hugely challenging because the anticipated characteristics such as stretchability, strength, toughness, and fracture resistance can hardly be compatible. Herein, a simple but robust hydrogel network formed by copolymerization of divinyl benzene with acrylamide in micellar solutions for ultra&#8208;high fracture resistance and self&#8208;recoverable stretchability is proposed. The network provides dynamic association of hydrophobic domains and homogeneous crosslinking of hydrophilic chains, which shows step&#8208;by&#8208;step deformation process. The dynamic associations allow recoverable small deformations, then the homogeneous crosslinking ensures reversible unfolding and alignment of polymer chains to self&#8208;strengthen for ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit comprehensive unbreakable feature with self&#8208;recoverable ultra&#8208;high stretchability (100% recovery from 10&#8239;200% strain), superior fracture resistance (toughness &gt; 26&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), and anticrack propagation and fatigue (fatigue threshold: &#8776;2.5&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Even the prenotched hydrogels can undergo tens cyclic loads at 10&#8239;200% strain and thousands cyclic loads at 200% strain without noticeable changes in mechanical performance. The robust network prepared from homogeneous hydrophobic crosslinking provides a facile approach and a new mechanism to explore tough hydrogels with superior antifracture and extreme self&#8208;recoverable deformability for diverse applications.

     alt="Unbreakable Hydrogels with Self-Recoverable 10&#8239;200% Stretchability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbreakable networks are simply constructed in hydrogels via copolymerization of divinyl benzene micellar with acrylamide. The network provides both dynamic hydrophobic association for recoverable small deformations and homogeneous crosslinking for reversible alignment of polymer chains to resist ultra-large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit self-recoverable 102 times stretchability, and superior resistance of fracture and fatigue.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design of tough hydrogels maintaining structural integrity under multivariable mechanical loads remains hugely challenging because the anticipated characteristics such as stretchability, strength, toughness, and fracture resistance can hardly be compatible. Herein, a simple but robust hydrogel network formed by copolymerization of divinyl benzene with acrylamide in micellar solutions for ultra-high fracture resistance and self-recoverable stretchability is proposed. The network provides dynamic association of hydrophobic domains and homogeneous crosslinking of hydrophilic chains, which shows step-by-step deformation process. The dynamic associations allow recoverable small deformations, then the homogeneous crosslinking ensures reversible unfolding and alignment of polymer chains to self-strengthen for ultra-large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit comprehensive unbreakable feature with self-recoverable ultra-high stretchability (100% recovery from 10&#8239;200% strain), superior fracture resistance (toughness &amp;gt; 26&#160;kJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and anticrack propagation and fatigue (fatigue threshold: &#8776;2.5&#160;kJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Even the prenotched hydrogels can undergo tens cyclic loads at 10&#8239;200% strain and thousands cyclic loads at 200% strain without noticeable changes in mechanical performance. The robust network prepared from homogeneous hydrophobic crosslinking provides a facile approach and a new mechanism to explore tough hydrogels with superior antifracture and extreme self-recoverable deformability for diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Novel Multi&#8208;Sulfur Source Collaborative Chemical Bath Deposition Technology Enables 8%&#8208;Efficiency Sb2S3 Planar Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sb2S3 planar solar cell with a power conversion efficiency first exceeding 8% is achieved based on the high&#8208;quality Sb2S3 absorber film fabricated using a novel multi&#8208;sulfur source collaborative chemical bath deposition technology.








Abstract
Sb2S3 as a light&#8208;harvesting material has attracted great attention for applications in both single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells. Such solar cell has been faced with current challenge of low power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has stagnated for 8 years. It has been recognized that the synthesis of high&#8208;quality absorber film plays a critical role in efficiency improvement. Here, using fresh precursor materials for antimony (antimony potassium tartrate) and combined sulfur (sodium thiosulfate and thioacetamide), a unique chemical bath deposition procedure is created. Due to the complexation of sodium thiosulfate and the advantageous hydrolysis cooperation between these two sulfur sources, the heterogeneous nucleation and the S2&#8208; releasing processes are boosted. As a result, there are noticeable improvements in the deposition rate, film morphology, crystallinity, and preferred orientations. Additionally, the improved film quality efficiently lowers charge trapping capacity, suppresses carrier recombination, and prolongs carrier lifetimes, leading to significantly improved photoelectric properties. Ultimately, the PCE exceeds 8% for the first time since 2014, representing the highest efficiency in all kinds of Sb2S3 solar cells to date. This study is expected to shed new light on the fabrication of high&#8208;quality Sb2S3 film and further efficiency improvement in Sb2S3 solar cells.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Homogeneous Ru&#63743;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic&#8208;scale homogeneous alloy of immiscible metals is first implemented in electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (NRR) by a unique carbothermal shock method. Atomic&#8208;scale mixing of ruthenium and copper facilitates pivotal reaction steps in NRR, showing high selectivity and formation rate to ammonia. This paves the way for developing numerous potential homogeneous alloys of immiscible metal combinations for future efficient NRR electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is the most widely used metal as an electrocatalyst for nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) because of the relatively high N2 adsorption strength for successive reaction. Recently, it has been well reported that the homogeneous Ru&#8208;based metal alloys such as Ru&#63743;Rh, Ru&#63743;Pt, and Ru&#63743;Co significantly enhance the selectivity and formation rate of ammonia (NH3). However, the metal combinations for NRR have been limited to several miscible combinations of metals with Ru, although various immiscible combinations have immense potential to show high NRR performance. In this study, an immiscible combination of Ru and copper (Cu) is first utilized, and homogeneous alloy nanoparticles (Ru&#63743;Cu NPs) are fabricated by the carbothermal shock method. The Ru&#63743;Cu homogeneous NP alloys on cellulose/carbon nanotube sponge exhibit the highest selectivity and NH3 formation rate of &#8776;31% and &#8722;73&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, respectively. These are the highest values of the selectivity and NH3 formation rates among existing Ru&#8208;based alloy metal combinations.

         <title>Fully Textured, Production&#8208;Line Compatible Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Approaching 29% Efficiency</title>

An ultrathin hybrid hole transporting layer&#160;employing NiOx/[2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid enables complete and uniform coverage on fully textured indium tin oxide (ITO)/silicon surface with pyramid structures of 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m sizes. As a result of the depleted shunt pathways between ITO and perovskite top cell, a certified record efficiency&#8212;28.84%&#8212;is achieved on perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible bottom silicon wafers.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising avenues for achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics with low costs. However, the highest certified efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem devices based on economically matured silicon heterojunction technology (SHJ) with fully textured wafer is only 25.2% due to incompatibility between the limitation of fabrication technology which is not compatible with the production&#8208;line silicon wafer. Here, a molecular&#8208;level nanotechnology is developed by designing NiOx/2PACz ([2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid) as an ultrathin hybrid hole transport layer (HTL) above indium tin oxide (ITO)&#160;recombination junction, to serve as a vital pivot for achieving a conformal deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite layer on top. The NiOx interlayer facilitates a uniform self&#8208;assembly of 2PACz molecules onto the fully textured surface, thus avoiding direct contact between ITO and perovskite top&#8208;cell for a minimal shunt loss. As a result of such interfacial engineering, the fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells obtain a certified efficiency of 28.84% on a 1.2&#8208;cm2 masked area, which is the highest performance to date based on the fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible SHJ. This work advances commercially promising photovoltaics with high performance and low costs by adopting a meticulously designed HTL/perovskite interface.

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles as Controllable Two&#8208;Way Adaptors to Activate Macrophage Phagocytosis for Improved Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An outer membrane vesicle (OMV)&#8208;based controllable PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb remarkedly increase the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activate tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM) phagocytosis of tumor cells via inducing M1 polarization and blocking &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.








Abstract
The most immune cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) closely resemble immunosuppressive M2&#8208;polarized macrophages. Moreover, tumor cells exhibit high expression of CD47 &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal, which obstructs macrophage phagocytosis. The precise and efficient activation of TAMs is a promising approach to tumor immunotherapy; however, re&#8208;education of macrophages remains a challenge. Bacteria&#8208;derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are highly immunogenic nanovesicles that can robustly stimulate macrophages. Here, an OMV&#8208;based controllable two&#8208;way adaptor is reported, in which a CD47 nanobody (CD47nb) is fused onto OMV surface (OMV&#8208;CD47nb), with the outer surface coated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer containing diselenide bonds (PEG/Se) to form PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb. The PEG/Se layer modification not only mitigates the immunogenicity of OMV&#8208;CD47nb, thereby remarkedly increasing the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection, but also equips the formulation with radiation&#8208;triggered controlled release of OMV&#8208;CD47nb. Application of radiation to tumors in mice injected with the nanoformulation results in remodeling of TME. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activates TAM phagocytosis of tumor cells via multiple pathways, including induction of M1 polarization and blockade of &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most immune cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) closely resemble immunosuppressive M2-polarized macrophages. Moreover, tumor cells exhibit high expression of CD47 &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal, which obstructs macrophage phagocytosis. The precise and efficient activation of TAMs is a promising approach to tumor immunotherapy; however, re-education of macrophages remains a challenge. Bacteria-derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are highly immunogenic nanovesicles that can robustly stimulate macrophages. Here, an OMV-based controllable two-way adaptor is reported, in which a CD47 nanobody (CD47nb) is fused onto OMV surface (OMV-CD47nb), with the outer surface coated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer containing diselenide bonds (PEG/Se) to form PEG/Se@OMV-CD47nb. The PEG/Se layer modification not only mitigates the immunogenicity of OMV-CD47nb, thereby remarkedly increasing the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection, but also equips the formulation with radiation-triggered controlled release of OMV-CD47nb. Application of radiation to tumors in mice injected with the nanoformulation results in remodeling of TME. As two-way adaptors, OMV-CD47nb activates TAM phagocytosis of tumor cells via multiple pathways, including induction of M1 polarization and blockade of &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell-mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Peritumorally Injected Immunomodulating Adjuvant Elicits Robust and Safe Metalloimmunotherapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet robust immunomodulating adjuvant of Zn2+&#8208;doped layered double hydroxide (Zn&#8208;LDH) is developed to potentiate cancer metalloimmunotherapy without using any cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists. Peritumorally injected Zn&#8208;LDH simultaneously modulates immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and induces tumor immunogenic cell death, eliciting robust antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Clinical immunotherapy of solid tumors elicits durable responses only in a minority of patients, largely due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although rational combinations of vaccine adjuvants with inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists that relieve immunosuppression represent an appealing therapeutic strategy against solid tumors, there are unavoidable nonspecific toxicities due to the pleiotropy of cytokines and undesired activation of off&#8208;target cells. Herein, a Zn2+ doped layered double hydroxide (Zn&#8208;LDH) based immunomodulating adjuvant, which not only relieves immunosuppression but also elicits robust antitumor immunity, is reported. Peritumorally injected Zn&#8208;LDH sustainably neutralizes acidic TME and releases abundant Zn2+, promoting a pro&#8208;inflammatory network composed of M1&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, and natural&#8208;killer cells. Moreover, the Zn&#8208;LDH internalized by tumor cells effectively disrupts endo&#8208;/lysosomes to block autophagy and induces mitochondrial damage, and the released Zn2+ activates the cGas&#8208;STING signaling pathway to induce immunogenic cell death, which further promotes the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to induce antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Unprecedentedly, merely injection of Zn&#8208;LDH adjuvant, without using any cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists, significantly inhibits the growth, recurrence, and metastasis of solid tumors in mice. This study provides a rational bottom&#8208;up design of potent adjuvant for cancer metalloimmunotherapy against solid tumors.

         <title>Crystalline Lattice&#8208;Confined Atomic Pt in Metal Carbides to Match Electronic Structures and Hydrogen Evolution Behaviors of Platinum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in metal carbides with &#8220;real&#8221; matched properties as metallic platinum are developed using Pt&#8208;centered polyoxometalate frameworks with strong Pt&#63743;O&#63743;W/Mo covalent bonds. The WC lattice&#8208;confined Pt atoms exhibit near&#8208;zero valence states, similar electronic structures, and matched hydrogen evolution behaviors as Pt(111) surface; remarkably, they offer 40 times greater mass activity than Pt@C&#8208;20% in alkaline conditions.








Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based catalysts occupy a pivotal position in diverse catalytic applications in hydrogen chemistry and electrochemistry, for instance, the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). While adsorbed Pt atoms on supports often cause severe mismatching on electronic structures and HER behaviors from metallic Pt due to the different energy level distribution of electron orbitals. Here, the design of crystalline lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in metal carbides using the Pt&#8208;centered polyoxometalate frameworks with strong Pt&#63743;O&#8208;metal covalent bonds is reported. Remarkably, the lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in the tungsten carbides (Ptdoped@WCx, both Pt and W have atomic radii of 1.3&#160;&#197;) exhibit near&#8208;zero valence states and similar electronic structures as metallic Pt, thus delivering matched energy level distributions of the Pt 5dz2 and H 1s orbitals and similar acidic hydrogen evolution behaviors. In alkaline conditions, the Ptdoped@WCx exhibits 40 times greater mass activity (49.5&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 at &#951;&#160;=&#160;150&#160;mV) than the Pt@C because of the favorable water dissociation and H* transport. These findings offer a universal pathway to construct urgently needed atomic&#8208;scale catalysts for broad catalytic reactions.

         <title>Multidimensional Perovskites for High Detectivity Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite thin films with a 2D&#8211;3D gradient result in graded electronic bandgap structures that are ideal for photodiode applications. Low&#8208;dimensional perovskite phases at the interface with the electron blocking layer increase the activation energy for thermal charge generation and thereby effectively lower the dark current density to a record&#8208;value of 10&#8211;9&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, resulting in maximized sensitivity.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional perovskites attract increasing interest due to tunable optoelectronic properties and high stability. Here, it is shown that perovskite thin films with a vertical gradient in dimensionality result in graded electronic bandgap structures that are ideal for photodiode applications. Positioning low&#8208;dimensional, vertically&#8208;oriented perovskite phases at the interface with the electron blocking layer increases the activation energy for thermal charge generation and thereby effectively lowers the dark current density to a record&#8208;low value of 5 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 without compromising responsivity, resulting in a noise&#8208;current&#8208;based specific detectivity exceeding 7 &#215; 1012 Jones at 600&#160;nm. These multidimensional perovskite photodiodes show promising air stability and a dynamic range over ten orders of magnitude, and thus represent a new generation of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost photodiodes.

         <title>Visible Light Induced Ag&#8211;Polyoxometalate Coassembly into Single&#8208;Cluster Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic diagram of single&#8208;cluster nanowires constructed by Ag&#8208;polyoxometalate (POM) coassembly is presented. Ag clusters are generated by visible light induced reduction, which are then connected with POM clusters to form 1D superstructures with alternative arrangement. Ag&#8208;P2W17 nanowires perform enhanced activities in both electrochemical sensing and catalytic gasoline desulfurization, due to the promoted electron transfer in nanowire heterojunctions.








Abstract
1D superlattices with long&#8208;ranged periodicity present extraordinary application properties due to their unique electronic structures. Here, the visible light driven synthesis of 1D single&#8208;cluster chains constructed by polyoxometalate (POM) and Ag clusters is reported, where two types of clusters align alternatively along the nanowire. Low symmetrical POM clusters of [P2W17O61]10&#8211;, [P2W15O56]12&#8211;, and [EuW10O36]9&#8211; can be used as building blocks. The directly bonding cluster units result in interactive electronic structures of Ag and POM clusters, as well as the greatly promoted electron transfer during the redox reaction. The Ag&#8211;P2W17 nanowires perform significantly enhanced activities in both electrochemical sensing and catalytic gasoline desulfurization compared with individual building blocks, demonstrating the extraordinary application properties and promising potentials of cluster&#8208;based heteroconstructions.

         <title>Realizing a 10&#160;&#176;C Cooling Effect in a Flexible Thermoelectric Cooler Using a Vortex Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a film&#8208;based FTEC, which shows outstanding cooling performance by using an innovative quadra&#8208;layered structure and a light vortex generator (VG). The FTEC consumes 68.5&#160;W to maintain a comfortable Tskin in the major hot spots of the walking human body, as strongly opposed to its ultrahigh counterpart (1.5&#160;kW) by traditional centralized cooling systems.








Abstract
In this study, flexible thermoelectric coolers (FTECs) are used to develop an alternative personalized cooling technology to achieve a large temperature drop of 10 &#176;C and cooling capacity of 256 W m&#8211;2. Such an excellent cooling performance is attributed to the innovative design of the quadra&#8208;layered Ag2Se/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate structure in FTECs and the induced air vortices by the vortex generator attached to the hot surface of the device. The applied pulse&#8208;width modulation technique guarantees human body comfort at inconsistent ambient temperature by modulating the duty ratio of the power source, which also saves 35% of the power consumption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared FTECs only consume 68.5&#160;W so as to maintain a comfortable skin temperature (32&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5 &#176;C) when the ambient temperature is at 31 &#176;C. This technology provides a reliable and adjustable solution for personalized cooling in environments where comfortable temperatures are exceeded.

         <title>Multi&#8208;functionality of Li2SrNb2O7: Memristivity, Tunable Rectification, Ferroelasticity, and Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We experimentally demonstrate that layered Li2SrNb2O7, an inorganic oxide in its bulk single&#8208;crystalline form, exhibits multiple structural facets such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and antiferroelectricity. The transition from a room&#8208;temperature centrosymmetric structure to a low&#8208;temperature out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectric structure and the low temperature ferroelectric domain configuration are unveiled in TEM, PFM, and polarization loop studies. Li2SrNb2O7 also exhibits highly tunable ferroelasticity and excellent Li+ in&#8208;plane conduction, which leads to a giant in&#8208;plane memristor behavior and an in&#8208;plane electronic conductivity increase by three orders of magnitude by electric poling at room temperature. The accumulation of Li+ vacancies at the crystal&#8208;electrode interface is visualized using in&#8208;situ optical microscopy. The Li&#8208;ionic biased state shows a clear in&#8208;plane rectification effect combined with a significant relaxation upon time at room temperature. Relaxation can be fully suppressed at low temperatures such as 200 K, and utilizing an electric field cooling, a stable rectification can be achieved at 200 K. Our results shed light on the selective control of multi&#8208;functionalities such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity and ionic&#8208;migration&#8208;mediated effects (a memristor effect and rectification) in a single&#8208;phase bulk material utilizing, e.g., different directions, temperatures, frequencies, and magnitudes of electric field.

         <title>Digital Keying Enabled by Reconfigurable Two&#8208;dimensional Modulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Energy, area, and bandwidth efficient communication primitives are essential to sustain the rapid increase in connectivity among IoT edge devices. While IoT edge&#8208;sensing, edge&#8208;computing, and edge&#8208;storage have witnessed innovation in materials and devices, IoT edge communication is yet to experience such transformation. The aging silicon (Si) based complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology continues to remain the mainstay of communication devices where they are used to implement amplitude, frequency, and phase shift keying (ASK/FSK/PSK). Keying allows digital information to be communicated over a radio channel. While CMOS&#8208;based keying devices have evolved over the years, their hardware footprint and energy consumption are major concerns for resource constrained IoT communication. Furthermore, separate circuit designs and hardware elements are needed for each keying scheme and achieving multi&#8208;bit modulation to improve bandwidth efficiency remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a reconfigurable modulator that exploits unique ambipolar transport and programmable Dirac voltage in ultra&#8208;thin MoTe2 field effect transistors to achieve ASK, FSK, and PSK modulation. Furthermore, by integrating two programmed MoTe2 FETs, we demonstrate multi&#8208;bit data modulation, which improves the bandwidth efficiency by 200%. Finally, a frequency quadrupler is also realized exploiting the unique &#8220;double&#8208;well&#8221; transfer characteristic. Our demonstration of multipurpose and reconfigurable MoTe2 modulators highlights the importance of material and device innovation to revolutionize future digital communication

         <title>Necklace&#8208;Like Nanostructures: From Fabrication, Properties to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their intriguing and specific appearance and architecture, necklace&#8208;like nanostructures carry some unique features over simple 1D nanogeometries. In this review, necklace&#8208;like structures by focusing on their diverse synthetic strategies, distinctive properties, and applications, as well as future directions for fabricating and capitalizing on necklace&#8208;like structures are summarized.








Abstract
The shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of nanocrystals remains a hot research topic in nanotechnology. Particularly, the fabrication of 1D structures such as wires, rods, belts, and tubes has been an interesting and important subject within nanoscience in the last few decades. 1D necklace&#8208;like micro/nanostructures are a sophisticated geometry that has attracted increasing attention due to their anisotropic and periodic structure, intrinsic high surface area, abundant transport channels, exposure of each component to the surface, and multiscale roughness of the surface. These characteristics enable their unique electrical, optical, and catalytic properties. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the advanced research progress on the fabrication strategies, novel properties, and various applications of necklace&#8208;like structures. It begins with the main fabrication methods of necklace&#8208;like structures and subsequently details a variety of their properties and applications. It concludes with the authors&#8217; perspectives on future research and development of the necklace&#8208;like structures.

         <title>Recent Progress in Smart Polymeric Gel&#8208;Based Information Storage for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials to deal with the endless phenomena of information leakage and misinformation are a very important and promising field. As one of the most attractive candidates, smart gels possess excellent modifiability and unique stimulus responsiveness. Moreover, elaborate polymeric gels with chemical or physical colors can display polychrome and multistage information through the synergy of multiple functions.








Abstract
Information security protection has a tremendous impact on human life, social stability and national security, leading to the rapid development of anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials and related techniques. However, the traditional stored information on hard or dry media is often static and lacks functions, which makes it challenging to deal with increasing and powerful counterfeiting technologies. Modified intelligent polymeric gels exhibit color changes and shape morphing under external stimuli, which give them great potential for applications in information storage. This paper provides an overview of the latest progress in polymeric gel&#8208;based information storage materials in relation to counterfeiting. Following a brief introduction of anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, the preparation methods for intelligent gels with adjustable colors (e.g., chemical colors and physical colors) and various encryption/decryption modes involving dimensions and diverse colors are outlined. Finally, the challenges and prospects for information storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting based on smart gels are discussed.

         <title>&#8220;Red Carbon&#8221;: A Rediscovered Covalent Crystalline Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon suboxide is a molecule spontaneously polymerizing into conjugated ladder oligomers composed of carbon and oxygen atoms only, and named &#8220;red carbon.&#8221; Herein, this partially forgotten chemistry is brought back to the attention of the community of covalent semiconductors. As&#8208;synthesized red carbon generates superoxide species upon light irradiation, acting as an efficient photocatalyst, with performance superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon nitrides.








Abstract
Carbon suboxide (C3O2) is a unique molecule able to polymerize spontaneously into highly conjugated light&#8208;absorbing structures at temperatures as low as 0&#160;&#176;C. Despite obvious advantages, little is known about the nature and the functional properties of this carbonaceous material. In this work, the aim is to bring &#8220;red carbon,&#8221; a forgotten polymeric semiconductor, back to the community's attention. A solution polymerization process is adapted to simplify the synthesis and control the structure. This allows one to obtain this crystalline covalent material at low temperatures. Both spectroscopic and elemental analyses support the chemical structure represented as conjugated ladder polypyrone ribbons. Density functional theory calculations suggest a crystalline structure of AB stacks of polypyrone ribbons and identify the material as a direct bandgap semiconductor with a medium bandgap that is further confirmed by optical analysis. The material shows promising photocatalytic performance using blue light. Moreover, the simple condensation&#8211;aromatization route described here allows the straightforward fabrication of conjugated ladder polymers and can be inspiring for the synthesis of carbonaceous materials at low temperatures in general.

         <title>Pivotal Routes for Maximizing Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Cell Performance: Photon Propagation Management and Carrier Kinetics Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) are ideal candidates for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and tandem solar cells (TSCs) owing to their tunable bandgap and high visible transparency. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ST&#8208;PSCs is close to 15% with an average visible transmittance of over 20%, which still lags far behind the PCE of normal opaque PSCs. This can be attributed to the poor light utilization efficiency (LUE) of ST&#8208;PSCs. Herein, we systematically rationalize the pivotal routes for maximizing LUE of ST&#8208;PSCs in terms of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation. First, we provide the fundamental theoretical analyses on optical processes and electronic properties. Then, we provide our insights on photon propagation management measures and carrier kinetics regulation strategies. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the promising commercial application of ST&#8208;PSCs in BIPV and TSCs. Finally, we briefly summarize the main progress of ST&#8208;PSCs and propose the directions for the commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Modular Nanostructures Facilitate Low Thermal Conductivity and Ultra&#8208;High Thermoelectric Performance in n&#8208;Type SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formation of 2D modular intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n nanostructures with periodicity of 1.2&#8211;2.6&#160;nm in the bulk SnSe matrix significantly scatters the phonons and reduces the lattice thermal conductivity&#160; drastically to an ultra&#8208;low value of &#8776;0.26&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Thereby, a record high thermoelectric figure of merit of 2.0 at &#8776;800 K is achieved in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe.








Abstract
Single crystals of SnSe have gained considerable attention in thermoelectrics due to their unprecedented thermoelectric performance. However, polycrystalline SnSe is more favorable for practical applications due to its facile chemical synthesis procedure, processability, and scalability. Though the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of p&#8208;type bulk SnSe polycrystals has reached &gt;2.5, zT of n&#8208;type counterpart is still lower and lies around &#8776;1.5. Herein, record high zT of 2.0 in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe0.92&#160;+ x mol% MoCl5 (x&#160;= 0&#8211;3) samples is reported, when measured parallel to the spark plasma sintering pressing direction due to the simultaneous optimization of n&#8208;type carrier concentration and enhanced phonon scattering by incorporating modular nano&#8208;heterostructures in SnSe matrix. Modular nanostructures of layered intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n like compounds embedded in SnSe matrix scatters the phonons significantly leading to an ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of &#8776;0.26&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 798 K in SnSe0.92&#160;+ 3 mol% MoCl5. The 2D layered modular intergrowth compound resembles the nano&#8208;heterostructure and their periodicity of 1.2&#8211;2.6&#160;nm in the SnSe matrix matches the phonon mean free path of SnSe, thereby blocking the heat carrying phonons, which result in low &#954;lat and ultra&#8208;high thermoelectric performance in n&#8208;type SnSe.

         <title>Antiferromagnetic inverse spin Hall effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) is one of accessible and reliable methods to detect spin current. The magnetization&#8208;dependent inverse spin Hall effect has been observed in magnets, expanding the dimension for spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. However, antiferromagnetic N&#233;el vector&#8208;dependent ISHE is still elusive, which has been long time highly pursued. Here we investigate ISHE in Mn2Au/[Co/Pd] heterostructures by terahertz emission and spin Seebeck effect measurements, where [Co/Pd] possesses perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) for out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized spin current generation and Mn2Au is a collinear antiferromagnet for the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization (&#963;z) is rotated towards in&#8208;plane by the N&#233;el vectors in Mn2Au, then the spin current is converted into charge current at two staggered spin sublattices. The ISHE signal is much stronger when the converted charge current is parallel to the N&#233;el vector compared with its orthogonal counterpart. We can switch the N&#233;el vector and resultant ISHE signals, which is termed as antiferromagnetic inverse spin Hall effect. Our finding not only adds a new member to the Hall effect family, but also makes antiferromagnetic spintronics more flexible.

         <title>Amplifying Molecular Scale Rotary Motion: The Marriage of Overcrowded Alkene Molecular Motor with Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amplifying the molecular rotary motion of photoresponsive overcrowded alkene molecular motor (OAMM) by liquid crystal provides great opportunities in design and fabrication of advanced materials and functional systems. This review summarizes the recent progress of the OAMM triggered light&#8208;directed systems and the challenges and outlooks in the development of OAMM&#8208;liquid crystal composite system are concluded.








Abstract
Design and fabrication of macroscopic functional devices by molecular engineering is an emerging and effective strategy in exploration of advanced materials. Photoresponsive overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motor (OAMM) is considered as one of the most promising molecular machines due to the unique rotary motion driven by light with high temporal and spatial precision. Amplifying the molecular rotary motions into macroscopic behaviors of photodirected systems links the molecular dynamics with macroscopic motions of materials, providing new opportunities to design novel materials and devices with a bottom&#8208;up strategy. In this review, recent developments of the light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal system triggered by OAMM will be summarized. The mechanism of amplification effect of liquid crystal matrix will be introduced first. Then progress of the OAMM&#8208;driven liquid crystal materials will be described including light&#8208;controlled photonic crystals, texture&#8208;tunable liquid crystal coating and microspheres, photoactuated soft robots, and dynamic optical devices. It is hoped that this review provides inspirations in design and exploration of light&#8208;driven soft matters and novel functional materials from molecular engineering to structural modification.

&lt;p&gt;Design and fabrication of macroscopic functional devices by molecular engineering is an emerging and effective strategy in exploration of advanced materials. Photoresponsive overcrowded alkene-based molecular motor (OAMM) is considered as one of the most promising molecular machines due to the unique rotary motion driven by light with high temporal and spatial precision. Amplifying the molecular rotary motions into macroscopic behaviors of photodirected systems links the molecular dynamics with macroscopic motions of materials, providing new opportunities to design novel materials and devices with a bottom-up strategy. In this review, recent developments of the light-responsive liquid crystal system triggered by OAMM will be summarized. The mechanism of amplification effect of liquid crystal matrix will be introduced first. Then progress of the OAMM-driven liquid crystal materials will be described including light-controlled photonic crystals, texture-tunable liquid crystal coating and microspheres, photoactuated soft robots, and dynamic optical devices. It is hoped that this review provides inspirations in design and exploration of light-driven soft matters and novel functional materials from molecular engineering to structural modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Universal Hopping Motion Protected by Structural Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Universal scaling behavior of hopping motion determined by the shape of the interface and its topology is discovered through the current&#8208;driven motion of magnetic skyrmions. This provides insights for implementing the skyrmionic devices and, for understanding the dynamics of moving bodies with a closed interface, which appears in a wide range of physical systems.








Abstract
A scaling law elucidates the universality in nature, presiding over many physical phenomena which seem unrelated. Thus, exploring the universality class of scaling law in a particular system enlightens its physical nature in relevance to other systems and sometimes unearths an unprecedented new dynamic phase. Here, the dynamics of weakly driven magnetic skyrmions are investigated, and its scaling law is compared with the motion of a magnetic domain wall (DW) creep. This study finds that the skyrmion does not follow the scaling law of the DW creep in 2D space but instead shows a hopping behavior similar to that of the particle&#8208;like DW in 1D confinement. In addition, the hopping law satisfies even when a topological charge of the skyrmion is removed. Therefore, the distinct scaling behavior between the magnetic skyrmion and the DW stems from a general principle beyond the topological charge. This study demonstrates that the hopping behavior of skyrmions originates from the bottleneck process induced by DW segments with diverging collective lengths, which is inevitable in any closed&#8208;shape spin structure in 2D. This work reveals that the structural topology of magnetic texture determines the universality class of its weakly driven motion, which is distinguished from the universality class of magnetic DW creep.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Observation of Grain Boundary Dominated Unsynchronized Phase Transition in Polycrystalline Cu2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second&#8208;order phase transition behavior of the grains in the polycrystalline system is highly dependent on the surrounding grain boundaries environment. Atomic&#8208;scale observations show that the dominating effect of different grain boundaries leads to coexistence of high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature phases of Cu2Se in one grain.








Abstract
Phase transition is a physical phenomenon that attracts great interest of researchers. Although the theory of second&#8208;order phase transitions is well&#8208;established, their atomic&#8208;scale dynamics in polycrystalline materials remains elusive. In this work, second&#8208;order phase transitions in polycrystalline Cu2Se at the transition temperature are directly observed by in situ aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy. Phase transitions in microcrystalline Cu2Se start at the grain boundaries and extend inside the grains. This phenomenon is more pronounced in nanosized grains. Analysis of phase transitions in nanocrystalline Cu2Se with different grain boundaries demonstrates that grain boundary energy dominates unsynchronized phase transition behavior. This suggests that the energy of grain boundaries is the key factor influencing the energetic barrier for initiation of phase transition. The findings advance atomic&#8208;scale understanding of second&#8208;order phase transitions, which is crucial for the control of this process in polycrystalline materials.

         <title>Multilevel Hollow Phenolic Resin Nanoreactors with Precise Metal Nanoparticles Spatial Location toward Promising Heterogeneous Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale chemical surgery is reported on phenolic resins based on a dissolution and repolymerization procedure, to construct multilevel hollow structures with well&#8208;defined functional groups. Those special architectures are useful in the fabrication of novel nanomaterials, Au@APF composites, with Au nanoparticles fully embedded within the spheres, which are well suited to architect the bimetallic catalyst with remarkable hydrogenation activity.








Abstract
Hollow nanostructures with fascinating properties have inspired numerous interests in broad research fields. Cell&#8208;mimicking complex hollow architectures with precise active components distributions are particularly important, while their synthesis remains highly challenging. Herein, a &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; chemical surgery strategy is introduced to engrave the 3&#8208;aminophenol formaldehyde resin (APF) spheres at nanoscale. Undergoing the cleavage of (Ar)C&#63743;N bonds with ethanol as chemical scissors and subsequent repolymerization process, the Solid APF transform to multilevel hollow architecture with precise nanospatial distribution of organic functional groups (e.g., hydroxymethyl and amine). The transformation is tracked by electron microscopy and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;techniques, the category and dosage of alcohol are pivotal for constructing&#160;multilevel hollow structures. Moreover, it is demonstrated the evolution of nanostructures accompanied with unique organic microenvironments is able to accurately confine multiple gold (Au) nanoparticles, leading to the formation of pomegranate&#8208;like particles. Through selectively depositing palladium (Pd) nanoparticles onto the outer shell, bimetallic Au@APF@Pd catalysts are formed, which exhibit excellent hydrogenation performance with turnover frequency (TOF) value up to 11257&#160;h&#8211;1. This work provides an effective method for precisely manipulating the nanostructure and composition of polymers at nanoscale and sheds light on the design of catalysts with precise spatial active components.

         <dc:description>
The enhancement&#8208;mode carbon nanotube complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) on paper substrates are first built through a printing&#8208;based process. As&#8208;fabricated CMOS inverters exhibit record low power dissipation (0.0124 pW &#181;m&#8722;1) and a superior radiation tolerance of a total ionizing dose exceeding 2 Mrad with a high dose rate of 365&#8201;rad&#8201;s&#8722;1.








Abstract
The development of eco&#8208;friendly, ultralow&#8208;power and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process electronics is facing dominant challenges in emerging off&#8208;the&#8208;grid applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) and extreme environment explorations at the south/north&#160;pole, in the deep sea, and in outer space. Eco&#8208;friendly, biodegradable, lightweight, and flexible paper&#8208;based electronics can provide many new possibilities for next&#8208;generation devices and circuits. Here, enhancement&#8208;mode (E&#8208;mode, remaining off state at zero gate voltages) carbon nanotube (CNT) complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) are built on paper substrates through a printing&#8208;based process. Benefitting from the CMOS circuit style and E&#8208;mode transistors, the fabricated CMOS inverters exhibit high voltage gains (more than 11) and noise margins (up to 75% 1/2 VDD at VDD of 0.4&#160;V), and rail&#8208;to&#8208;rail operation down to a VDD as low as 0.2&#160;V and record low power dissipation as low as 0.0124 pW &#181;m&#8722;1. Furthermore, the transistors and integrated circuits (ICs) show an excellent radiation tolerance of a total ionizing dose (TID) exceeding 2 Mrad with a high dose rate of 365&#8201;rad&#8201;s&#8722;1. The record power consumption and outstanding radiation tolerance behavior achieved in paper&#8208;based and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process CNT electronics are attractive for emerging energy&#8208;saving and environmentally friendly ICs in harsh environment (such as outer&#8208;space) applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Formation CoO Nanodots Catalyst in Co(TFSI)2&#8208;Modified Electrolyte for High Efficient Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoO nanodot (ND)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive for Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The highly dispersed CoO NDs integrate both the high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and the good wettability of soluble catalyst, which can make a contribution to promoting the formation and decomposition of Li2O2, achieving a superior cyclability.








Abstract
The major challenges for Li&#8208;O2 batteries are sluggish reaction kinetics and large overpotentials due to the cathode passivation resulting from insulative and insoluble Li2O2. Here, a novel nanodot (ND)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive. The Co(TFSI)2 additive can react with discharge intermediate LiO2 and product Li2O2 to form CoO NDs. The generated CoO NDs are well dispersed in electrolyte, which integrates both the high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and the good wettability of soluble catalyst. Under the catalytis of CoO NDs, Li2O2 is produced and deposits on the cathode together with them. At the recharge process, these well dispersed CoO NDs help to decompose solid Li2O2 at a lower overpotential. The Li&#8208;O2 cells with Co(TFSI)2 exhibit a long cycle life of 200 cycles at a current density of 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 under a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1, as well as a superior reversibility associated with the Li2O2 formation and decomposition. The study is expected to broaden the range of electrolyte additives and provide a new view to developing highly dispersed NDs&#8208;based catalysts for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <title>Unique NiOOH@FeOOH Hetero&#8208;architecture for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution in Saline Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of highly efficient non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in low&#8208;grade or saline water is currently of great importance for the large&#8208;scale hydrogen production. In this study, by using an electrochemical activation pretreatment, we successfully fabricated metal oxy(hydroxide) nanosheet structures derived from self&#8208;supported nickel&#8211;iron phosphide and nitride nanoarrays grown on Ni foam for OER catalysis in saline water. We demonstrate that the different NiOOH and NiOOH@FeOOH (NiOOH grown on FeOOH) structures are generated from nickel&#8211;iron nitride and phosphide, respectively, after the electrochemical activation. In particular, the NiOOH@FeOOH hetero&#8208;architecture shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 292&#160;mV to drive the current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. We propose an unconventional dual&#8208;sites mechanism (UDSM) to address the OER process on NiOOH@FeOOH and show that the FeOOH underlayer plays a critical role on the enhanced OER activity of NiOOH. The new possible UDSM involving two reaction sites presents a different understanding of OER process on the multi&#8208;OH layer complex, which is expected to guide the design of hetero&#8208;architecture electrocatalysts.

         <title>Super&#8208;reversible CuF2 Cathodes Enabled by Cu2+ Coordinated Alginate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Copper fluoride (CuF2) has the highest energy density among all metal fluoride cathodes owing to its high theoretical potential (3.55&#160;V) and high capacity (528 mAh/g). However, CuF2 can only survive for less than 5 cycles mainly due to serious Cu&#8208;ion dissolution during charge/discharge cycles. Herein, we successfully suppress copper dissolution by forming Cu2+&#8208;coordinated sodium alginate (Cu&#8208;SA) on the surface of CuF2 particles during the electrode fabrication process, by using water as a slurry solvent and sodium alginate (SA) as a binder. The trace dissolved Cu2+ in water from CuF2 can in situ crosslink with SA binder forming a conformal Cu&#8208;SA layer on CuF2 surface. After water evaporation during the electrode dry process, the Cu&#8208;SA layer is Li&#8208;ion conductor but Cu2+ insulator, which can effectively suppress the dissolution of Cu&#8208;ions in the organic 4&#160;M LiCO4/EC&#8208;PC electrolyte, enhancing the reversibility of CuF2. CuF2 electrode with SA binder delivered a reversible capacity of 420.4 mAh g&#8722;1 after 50 cycles at 0.05 C, reaching an energy density of 1009.1&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Cu2+ crosslink polymer coating on CuF2 opens the door to stabilizing the high&#8208;energy and low&#8208;cost CuF2 cathode for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Engineered Nonporous Copper(I) Coordination Polymer Nanoplatform for Cuproptosis&#8208;based Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cuproptosis, a newly identified form of regulated cell death that is copper&#8208;dependent, offers great opportunities for exploring the use of copper&#8208;based nanomaterials inducing cuproptosis for cancer treatment. Here, we develop a glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;engineered nonporous copper(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate ([Cu(tz)]) coordination polymer (CP) nanoplatform, denoted as GOx@[Cu(tz)], for starvation&#8208;augmented cuproptosis and photodynamic synergistic therapy. Importantly, the catalytic activity of GOx is shielded in the nonporous scaffold but can be &#8220;turned on&#8221; for efficient glucose depletion only upon glutathione (GSH) stimulation in cancer cells, thereby proceeding cancer starvation therapy. The depletion of glucose and GSH sensitizes cancer cells to the GOx@[Cu(tz)]&#8208;mediated cuproptosis, producing aggregation of lipoylated mitochondrial proteins, the target of copper&#8208;induced toxicity. The increased intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, due to the oxidation of glucose, activates the type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy of GOx@[Cu(tz)]. Our in vivo experiment results indicated that GOx@[Cu(tz)] produces negligible systemic toxicity and inhibits tumor growth by 92.4% in athymic mice bearing 5637 bladder tumors. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of a cupreous nanomaterial capable of inducing cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;based synergistic therapy in bladder cancer, which should invigorate studies pursuing rational design of efficacious cancer therapy strategies based on cuproptosis.

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Control Growth of Graphene Islands by Nonlinear Carbon Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling the morphology of graphene and other two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth is crucial because the morphology reflects the crystal quality of as&#8208;synthesized nanomaterials in a certain way, and consequently it indirectly represents the physical properties of 2D materials such as band gap, selective ion transportation, and impermeability. However, precise control of the morphology is limited by the complex formation mechanism and sensitive growth&#8208;environment factors of graphene. Therefore, the CVD synthesis of single&#8208;crystal hexagonal&#8208;shaped graphene islands with specific sizes is challenging. Herein, an unconventional nonlinear carbon supply growth strategy is proposed to realize controllable CVD growth of desired hexagonal graphene islands with specific sizes on Cu substrates. Large&#8208;area graphene films of isolated islands with desired densities, sizes, and distances between the islands were successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the direct growth of a planar&#8208;tunnel&#8208;junction structure based on two parallel gapped graphene islands was achieved by specific adjustment of the growth and etching processes of graphene CVD synthesis. We therefore demonstrated that the nonlinear carbon supply growth strategy is a reliable method for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene and can facilitate the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based nanodevices in the future.

         <title>A Biomolecular Toolbox for Precision Nanomotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The application of nanomotors for cancer diagnosis and therapy is a new and exciting area of research, which when combined with precision nanomedicine, promises to solve many of the issues encountered by previous development of passive nanoparticles. The goal of this article is to introduce nanomotor and nanomedicine researchers to the deep pool of knowledge available regarding cancer cell biology and biochemistry, as well as provide a greater appreciation of the complexity of cell membrane compositions, extracellular surfaces, and their functional consequences. We first provide a short description of the nanomotor state&#8208;of&#8208;art for cancer therapy and diagnosis, as well as recommendations for future directions of the field. Then, a biomolecular targeting toolbox has been collated for researchers looking to apply their nanomaterial of choice to a biological setting, as well as providing a glimpse into currently available clinical therapies and technologies. This toolbox contains an overview of different classes of targeting molecules available for high affinity and specific targeting and cell surface targets to aid researchers in the selection of a clinical disease model and targeting methodology. Biological systems are complex, and there is a steep learning curve for material scientists applying their skills to the fields of biochemistry and immunology. It is hoped that this review will provide biological context, inspiration, and direction to future nanomotor and nanomedicine research.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Membranes Prepared by Rapid Electrophoretic Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a disruptive material platform for various novel applications including nanofiltration for water purification due to their excellent physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the currently available approaches for preparing COF membranes need stringent synthesis conditions, prolonged fabrication time, and tedious post&#8208;processing, leading to poor productivity. Herein, we develop a simple and efficient layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking assembly strategy based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to rapidly generate ionic COF membranes due to the uniform driving force for nanosheet assembly. A new two&#8208;cell EPD design avoids the usual EPD problems such as bubbles and acidic/alkaline microenvironments in the near&#8208;electrode region in aqueous EPD processes. The ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures can be produced within several minutes. Consequently, the prepared COF membranes exhibit outstanding permselectivity and possess good stability and anti&#8208;pressure ability due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.

         <title>A Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery&#8208;Type Self&#8208;Powered Pressure Sensor with Long Service Life</title>

         <dc:description>
A zinc&#8208;ion battery (ZIB)&#160;pressuresensor where the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB is&#160;itself designed as a flexible pressure sensor has excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance, endowing it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs and ultrahigh stability. The sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.








Abstract
Accurate and continuous pressure signal detection without external power supply is a key technology to realize the miniaturization of wearable electronic equipment, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence. However, it is difficult to be achieved by using current sensor technologies. Here, a new one&#8208;body strategy, i.e., zinc&#8208;ion battery pressure (ZIB&#8208;P) sensor technology, which designs the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB itself as a flexible pressure sensor is reported. In the device, an isolation layer is introduced into the sandwich configuration solid&#8208;state battery to realize the change of device internal resistance by pressure during the transformation of the mechanical signal to the electrical signal. This battery pressure sensor possesses good flexibility, fast response/recovery time (76.0/88.0&#160;ms), stable long&#8208;term response, excellent cycle stability (100&#8239;000 times), and wide pressure detection range (2.0 to 3.68 &#215; 105&#160;Pa). Especially, the excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance in the ZIB&#8208;P sensor endows it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs (pulse, limb movement, etc.) and ultrahigh stability without degradation even under 100&#8239;000 times pressure stimulation. The ZIB&#8208;P sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.

         <title>Mechanically Induced Nanoscale Architecture Endows Titanium Carbide MXene Electrode with Integrated High Areal and Volumetric Capacitance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Complete utilization of electrochemically active materials while maintaining the high areal/volumetric packing density is a goal to be achieved in miniaturized supercapacitor devices, which therefore display both the high volumetric and areal energy density. Although critical, it is usually challenging to achieve this goal by optimizing the electrode architecture. Densely packing of active materials maximizes the volumetric capacitance whereas results in sluggish diffusion of electrolyte. Structurization of the electrode by forming large pores creates pathway for electrolyte penetration but reduces the volumetric energy density. Here we report densified electrodes with hierarchical porous architecture at nanoscale that provides an alternative solution. Worm&#8208;like expanded titanium carbide MXene powders are produced in highly viscous reaction media and assembled by mechanical compression. Expanded morphology of MXene powders translates into the buckling microstructure in electrodes, resulting in 28.2 &#177; 4.1% porosity mainly in the form of nanosized pores. At the sub&#8208;nanometer scale, the diffusion of electrolytes is enhanced in interlayer space of the bended lattice with pillared intercalants. These hierarchical structural features lead to both the high areal and volumetric capacitance (11.4 F cm&#8210;2 coupled with 770 F cm&#8210;3) in hundred&#8208;micrometres&#8208;thick electrodes, which inspires the design of high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage devices.

         <title>Implanting CoOx Clusters on Ordered Macroporous ZnO Nanoreactors for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite suffering from slow charge carrier mobility, photocatalysis is still an attractive and promising technology toward producing green fuels from solar energy. An effective approach is to design and fabricate advanced architectural materials as photocatalysts to enhance the performance of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Herein, metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (MOF)&#8208;derived hierarchically ordered porous nitrogen and carbon co&#8208;doped ZnO (N&#8208;C&#8208;ZnO) structures have been developed as nanoreactors with decorated CoOx nanoclusters for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion driven by visible light. Introduction of hierarchical nanoarchitectures with highly ordered interconnected meso&#8208;macroporous channels shows beneficial properties for photocatalytic reduction reactions, including enhanced mobility of charge carriers throughout the highly accessible framework, maximized exposure of active sites and inhibited recombination of photo&#8208;induced photons. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal the key role of CoOx nanoclusters with high affinity to CO2 molecules, and the Co&#8208;O bond formed on the surface of the composite exhibits stronger charge redistribution. As a result, the obtained CoOx/N&#8208;C&#8208;ZnO demonstrates enhanced photocatalysis performance in terms of high CO yield and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Wireless Miniature Magnetic Phase&#8208;Change Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed wireless miniature phase&#8208;change soft actuators exhibit enhancing output force and work capacity, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. This output performance enables the actuator to have the ability for angioplasty applications, locomotion in granular media, and programmable magnetic deformation, demonstrating its potential in medical and other robotic applications.








Abstract
Wireless miniature soft actuators are promising for various potential high&#8208;impact applications in medical, robotic grippers, and artificial muscles. However, these miniature soft actuators are currently constrained by a small output force and low work capacity. To address such challenges, a miniature magnetic phase&#8208;change soft composite actuator is reported. This soft actuator exhibits an expanding deformation and enables up to a 70&#160;N output force and 175.2&#160;J&#160;g&#8722;1 work capacity under remote magnetic radio frequency heating, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. To demonstrate its capabilities, a wireless soft robotic device is first designed that can withstand 0.24&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 fluid flows in an artery phantom. By integrating it with a thermally&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;memory polymer and bistable metamaterial sleeve, a wireless reversible bistable stent is designed toward future potential angioplasty applications. Moreover, it can additionally locomote inside and jump out of granular media. At last, the phase&#8208;change actuator can realize programmable bending deformations when a specifically designed magnetization profile is encoded, enhancing its shape&#8208;programming capability. Such a miniature soft actuator provides an approach to enhance the mechanical output and versatility of magnetic soft robots and devices, extending their medical and other potential applications.

         <title>Direct Exciton Harvesting from a Bound Triplet Pair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of using bound triplet pairs directly for electrical and chemical work is demonstrated. In support of this it is shown that triplet pairs can be directly harvested and&#160;that significant benefit in the achievable quantum efficiency is achieved by utilizing the triplet pair before annihilation processes occur.








Abstract
Singlet fission is commonly defined as the generation of two triplet excitons from a single absorbed photon. However, ambiguities within this definition arise due to the complexity of the various double triplet states that exist in SF chromophores and the corresponding interconversion processes. To clarify this process, singlet fission is frequently depicted as sequential two&#8208;step conversion in which a singlet exciton decays into a bound triplet&#8208;pair biexciton state that dissociates into two &#8220;free&#8221; triplet excitons. However, this model discounts the potential for direct harvesting from the coupled biexciton state. Here, it is demonstrated that individual triplet excitons can be extracted directly from a bound triplet pair. It is demonstrated that due to the requirement for geminate triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation in intramolecular singlet fission compounds, unique spectral and kinetic signatures can be used to quantify triplet&#8208;pair harvesting yields. An internal quantum efficiency for triplet exciton transfer from the triplet pair of &gt;50%, limited only by the solubility of the compounds is achieved. The harvesting process is not dependent on the net multiplicity of the triplet&#8208;pair state, suggesting that an explicit, independent dissociation step is not a requirement for using triplet pairs to do chemical or electrical work.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Zirconium&#8208;Based Perovskites for Large&#8208;Area and Ultra&#8208;Flexible X&#8208;Ray Scintillator Screens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Flexible scintillator screens with environmental stability, high sensitivity and low cost have emerged as candidates for X&#8208;ray imaging applications. Here, we demonstrated a large&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;efficient solution synthesis of vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite Cs2ZrCl6, which is characterized by thermal activation delay fluorescence (TADF) dominated by triplet emission under X&#8208;ray irradiation. The large Stokes shift and efficient luminescence collection of TADF effectively ensure the light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Further, flexible X&#8208;ray scintillator screens with an area of 400 cm2 were prepared using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the carrier, which exhibit excellent scintillation properties with light yields as high as 49&#8239;400 photons/MeV, spatial resolutions up to 18 lp/mm and detection limits as low as 65 nGy/s. Finally, we demonstrated the high&#8208;quality imaging results of non&#8208;planar and dynamic objects by such screens. We believe that the explored Cs2ZrCl6@PDMS flexible scintillator screens would offer a big step towards expanding the application range of scintillators in different environments.

         <title>A Polymeric Strategy Empowering Vascular Cell Selectivity and Potential Application Superior to Extracellular Matrix Peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Endothelialization of vascular implants plays a vital role in maintaining the long&#8208;term vascular patency. In situ endothelialization and re&#8208;endothelialization is generally achieved by selectively promoting endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and, meanwhile, suppressing smooth muscle cell (SMC) adhesion. Currently, such EC versus SMC selectivity is achieved and extensively used in vascular&#8208;related biomaterials utilizing extra cellular matrix derived EC&#8208;selective peptides, dominantly REDV and YIGSR. Nevertheless, the application of EC&#8208;selective peptides is limited due to their easy proteolysis, time&#8208;consuming synthesis and expensiveness. To address these limitations, we report a polymeric strategy in designing and finding EC&#8208;selective biomaterials using amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;peptide polymers by tuning serum protein adsorption. The optimal &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer displays EC versus SMC selectivity even superior to EC&#8208;selective REDV peptide regarding the cell adhesion, proliferation and migration of EC versus SMC. Mechanism study indicates that surface adsorption of bovine serum albumin, an abundant and anti&#8208;adhesive serum protein, plays a critical role in the EC versus SMC selectivity of &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer. In addition, surface modification of the optimal &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer effectively promotes the endothelialization of vascular implants and inhibits intimal hyperplasia. This study provides an alternative strategy in designing and finding EC&#8208;selective biomaterials, implying great potential in the vascular&#8208;related biomaterial study and application.

         <title>Mass Transfer Printing of Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Films and Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust transfer&#8208;printing method is developed using an ultrathin chemical bonding interfacial layer. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit similar performance as optimized spin&#8208;coated LEDs, and the transfer&#8208;printed nanostructure reaches a high resolution up to 1270 ppi. A white perovskite LED structure is finally demonstrated with laterally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes made by the multiple transfer&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Most methods of depositing perovskite films cannot meet the diverse requirements of real applications such as depositing films on various types of substrates, making patterns with different bandgaps for full&#8208;color display. Here, a robust mass transfer method of perovskite films and nanostructures is reported, meeting those requirements, by using an ultrathin branched polyethylenimine as interfacial chemical bonding layers. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite films exhibit comparable morphology, composition, optoelectronic properties, and device performances with the counterparts made by optimized spin&#8208;coating methods. The perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) using the transfer&#8208;printed films show decent external quantum efficiencies of 10.5% and 6.7% for red (680&#160;nm) and sky&#8208;blue (493&#160;nm) emissions, which are similar to the devices made by spin&#8208;coating. This robust transfer printing method also enables the the preparation of perovskite micropatterns with a high resolution up to 1270 pixels per inch. Horizontally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes are further obtained through multiple printing processes for white PeLEDs. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy for making perovskite films or micropatterns on various substrates for real applications in full&#8208;color display, white LEDs, lasing, etc.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Photoelectric Detection and Imaging Enhanced by the Pyro&#8208;Phototronic Effect Based on a Photoinduced Dynamic Schottky Effect in 4H&#8208;SiC</title>

A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered 4H&#8208;SiC ultraviolet photodetector is realized using a strong photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect, and the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect is first revealed in N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC, which is beneficial to further enhance the photodetection performance. Moreover, via delicate position designs of electrodes, the 4H&#8208;SiC chip reveals efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities.








Abstract
Silicon carbide (SiC), one of the third&#8208;generation semiconductor materials with excellent electrical and optoelectronic properties, is ideal for high light&#8208;sensing performance. Here, a self&#8208;powered SiC ultraviolet (UV) photodetector (PD) is constructed with wider applicability and higher commercialization potential. The great performance of the PD is realized by a remarkable photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect derived from the symbiotic modulation of Schottky and Ohmic contact. Using the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect that exists in the N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC single crystal PDs, a fast pyroelectric response time of 0.27 s is achieved, which is almost ten times shorter than that obtained from the steady&#8208;state signal under UV illumination. The maximal transient photoresponsivity reaches 9.12 nA mW&#8722;1, which is &#8776;20% higher than the conventional photoelectric signal. Moreover, different regions of the 4H&#8208;SiC centimeter&#8208;scale chip output distinct signals under UV illumination, demonstrating efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities of this device. This work not only reveals the fundamental optoelectronic physics lying in this vital third&#8208;generation semiconductor, but also sheds light on its potential photosensing applications for large&#8208;scale commercialization.

         <title>Anode Catalysts in Anion&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Electrolysis without Supporting Electrolyte: Conductivity, Dynamics, and Ionomer Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reach the required scale for green hydrogen, it must be produced with efficient, low&#8208;capital&#8208;expense electrolyzers using non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group catalysts. In this work, oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts in pure&#8208;water anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer devices are studied. Processes causing device failure are illustrated, nano&#8208;Co3O4 is shown to be a viable catalyst, and design rules for engineering catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability are proposed.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) in principle operate without soluble electrolyte using earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and cell materials and thus lower the cost of green H2. Current systems lack competitive performance and the durability needed for commercialization. One critical issue is a poor understanding of catalyst&#8208;specific degradation processes in the electrolyzer. While non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (non&#8208;PGM) oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts show excellent performance and durability in strongly alkaline electrolyte, this has not transferred directly to pure&#8208;water AEMWEs. Here, AEMWEs with five non&#8208;PGM anode catalysts are built and the catalysts&#8217; structural stability and interactions with the alkaline ionomer are characterized during electrolyzer operation and post&#8208;mortem. The results show catalyst electrical conductivity is one key to obtaining high&#8208;performing systems and that many non&#8208;PGM catalysts restructure during operation. Dynamic Fe sites correlate with enhanced degradation rates, as does the addition of soluble Fe impurities. In contrast, electronically conductive Co3O4 nanoparticles (without Fe in the crystal structure) yield AEMWEs from simple, standard preparation methods, with performance and stability comparable to IrO2. These results reveal the fundamental dynamic catalytic processes resulting in AEMWE device failure under relevant conditions, demonstrate a viable non&#8208;PGM catalyst for AEMWE operation, and illustrate underlying design rules for engineering anode catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability.

         <title>Volatile Organic Compound Sensing Array and Optoelectronic Filter System using Ion&#8208;Pairing Dyes with a Wide Visible Spectrum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief methodology to synthesize sensing materials (e.g., ion&#8208;paring dyes) with hydrophobicity, ease of color tunability, and a wide visible spectrum is suggested. This can simplify the sensing array, thereby producing a color map distinguishing functional groups as well as carbon chain lengths. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes will be extended to the electronic system promising the safety and health of the user.








Abstract
An ideal dye&#8208;based sensing array has essential design requirements, including facile preparation methodology, tolerance to water vapor, a broad range of color&#8208;responsive changes, and a simple readout system. Here, a brief synthetic route is developed for ion&#8208;pairing dyes exhibiting unusual chromatic changes across the entire visible spectrum. It requires only mixing and precipitation under mild conditions. The dyes are applied to a sensing array containing 12 sensing elements with different initial states. Owing to the numerous color variations of the dyes, the color map generated by the array is highly simple yet sufficiently accurate to distinguish among the different functional groups (such as amines, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) as well as carbon chain lengths. Principle component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be well classified according to the color changes of the sensing array. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes are embedded into&#160;3D&#160;stacked nanofibers via electrospinning, and function as effective harmful&#8208;gas (e.g., formaldehyde) sensors with sub&#8208;ppm theoretical detection limits (0.15&#160;ppm). Finally, the 3D stacked nanofibers can be employed in an optoelectronic filter system that automatically checks for formaldehyde in the surroundings and also confirms the effective removal of the detected formaldehyde by the gas filter cartridge.

         <title>Photoactivatable Silencing Extracellular Vesicle (PASEV) Sensitizes Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle is developed, which not only serves as a nanocarrier for packaging, tumor accumulation, and intracellular release of small interfering RNA against p21&#8208;activated kinase 4 to boost intratumoral&#160;immune infiltration, but also is able to initiate antitumor immunity through immunogenic phototherapy. The combined immunotherapy between boosted immune infiltration and immune activation elicits superior antitumor outcome.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has delivered impressive outcomes in combating tumor malignancies. However, insufficient immune infiltration and poor immunogenicity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) greatly compromise patient response rates. Here, a photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle (PASEV) is developed for sensitized cancer immunotherapy. p21&#8208;Activated kinase 4 (PAK4) is a newly identified tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;intrinsic &#8220;guard&#8221; associated with immune exclusion. Small interfering RNA against PAK4 (siPAK4) is designed and assembled with a photoactivatable reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer to form the nanocomplex core, which is further camouflaged by extracellular vesicles from M1 macrophages. The PASEV not only serves as a vehicle for packaging, tumor accumulation, and ROS&#8208;responsive release of siPAK4 for potent PAK4 silencing, but also primes the TME through immunogenic phototherapy, thereby simultaneously boosting intratumoral infiltration and immune activation. The combined immunotherapy elicits robust anticancer immunity, thus showing great promise for fighting cancers. This work opens a new avenue to simultaneously boost intratumoral infiltration and immune activation for sensitized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectric Resonant Tunneling Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors under external voltage in perovskite oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 quantum&#8208;well structures are reported. The NDR ratio can be modified by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the polarization states of the ferroelectric barrier, and a large OFF/ON resistance ratio up to 23 000 is obtained.








Abstract
Resonant tunneling is a quantum&#8208;mechanical effect in which electron transport is controlled by the discrete energy levels within a quantum&#8208;well (QW) structure. A ferroelectric resonant tunneling diode (RTD) exploits the switchable electric polarization state of the QW barrier to tune the device resistance. Here, the discovery of robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric&#8208;modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors in all&#8208;perovskite&#8208;oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 QW structures is reported. The resonant current amplitude and voltage are tunable by the switchable polarization of the BaTiO3 ferroelectric with the NDR ratio modulated by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude and an OFF/ON resistance ratio exceeding a factor of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;104. The observed NDR effect is explained an energy bandgap between Ru&#8208;t2g and Ru&#8208;eg orbitals driven by electron&#8211;electron correlations, as follows from density functional theory calculations. This study paves the way for ferroelectric&#8208;based quantum&#8208;tunneling devices in future oxide electronics.

&lt;p&gt;Robust room-temperature ferroelectric modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors under external voltage in perovskite oxide BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; quantum-well structures are reported. The NDR ratio can be modified by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the polarization states of the ferroelectric barrier, and a large OFF/ON resistance ratio up to 23 000 is obtained.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resonant tunneling is a quantum-mechanical effect in which electron transport is controlled by the discrete energy levels within a quantum-well (QW) structure. A ferroelectric resonant tunneling diode (RTD) exploits the switchable electric polarization state of the QW barrier to tune the device resistance. Here, the discovery of robust room-temperature ferroelectric-modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors in all-perovskite-oxide BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QW structures is reported. The resonant current amplitude and voltage are tunable by the switchable polarization of the BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ferroelectric with the NDR ratio modulated by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude and an OFF/ON resistance ratio exceeding a factor of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. The observed NDR effect is explained an energy bandgap between Ru-t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; and Ru-e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals driven by electron&#8211;electron correlations, as follows from density functional theory calculations. This study paves the way for ferroelectric-based quantum-tunneling devices in future oxide electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excimer Formation in the Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals 2D Semiconductor Bi2O2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excimer formation is unambiguously demonstrated in non&#8208;van der Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se via transient absorption spectroscopy. The excimer in Bi2O2Se nanosheets is diffusive and its formation can be described as excitons relax to an excimer geometry driven by the ultrafast photoscreening of the intrinsic built&#8208;in dipolar electric field.








Abstract
The layered semiconductor Bi2O2Se is a promising new&#8208;type 2D material that holds layered structure via electrostatic forces instead of van der Waals (vdW) attractions. Aside from the huge success in device performance, the non&#8208;vdW nature in Bi2O2Se with a built&#8208;in interlayer electric field has also provided an appealing platform for investigating unique photoexcited carrier dynamics. Here, experimental evidence for the observation of excimers in multilayer Bi2O2Se nanosheets via transient absorption spectroscopy is presented. It is found that the excimer formation is the primary decay pathway of photoexcited excitons and three&#8208;stage excimer dynamics with corresponding time scales are established. Excitation&#8208;fluence&#8208;dependent excimer dynamics further suggest that the excimer is diffusive and its formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work indicates the outstanding promise of unique excitonic processes in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device designs.

         <title>Instantaneous High&#8208;Resolution Visual Imaging of Latent Fingerprints in Water Using Color&#8208;Tunable AIE Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The instantaneous visualization of latent fingerprints (LFPs) is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water under UV light or ambient sunlight. Remarkably, LFPs can be visualized within seconds including details at the Level 3, shedding light on the potential security protection and criminal investigation in various scenarios.








Abstract
Instant visualization of latent fingerprints is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water, under UV light or ambient sunlight. By simply soaking, or spraying with an aqueous solution of the probe, bright yellow fluorescence images with high contrast and resolution are readily developed on various surfaces including tinfoil, glass, paper, steel, leather, and ceramic tile. Remarkably, latent fingerprints can be visualized within seconds including details of whorl and sweat pores. The color of emission can be tuned from blue to orange by modifying the pincer ligands, allowing direct imaging under sunlight. These inexpensive, water&#8208;resistant, and color&#8208;tunable probes provide a practical approach for latent fingerprints recording and analysis, security protection, as well as criminal investigation in different scenarios.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Magnetoactive and Electro&#8211;Ionic Soft Actuator Derived from a Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuator is presented by an engineering of unprecedented nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF). It can nurture the complex motion for relevant robotic interaction. The magneto&#8211;electro&#8208;ionic soft actuator obtained from the newly developed Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived active material is successfully utilized to demonstrate hovering motion of a hummingbird robot under magnetic and electrical stimuli.








Abstract
There is growing demand for multiresponsive soft actuators for the realization of natural, safe, and complex motions in robotic interactions. In particular, soft actuators simultaneously stimulated by electrical and magnetic fields are always under development owing to their simple controllability and reliability during operation. Herein, magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuators (MESAs) derived from novel nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C), are reported. Nanoscale Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C has excellent electrochemical and magnetic properties that allow it to be used as a multifunctional material under both magnetoactive and electro&#8208;ionic actuations. The dual&#8208;responsive MESA exhibits a bending displacement of 30&#160;mm and an ultrafast rising time of 1.5 s under a very low input voltage of 1&#160;V and also exerts a bending deflection of 12.5&#160;mm at 50 mT under a high excitation frequency of 5&#160;Hz. By utilizing a dual&#8208;responsive MESA, the hovering motion of a hummingbird robot is demonstrated under magnetic and electrical stimuli.

         <title>Semicrystalline Conjugated Polymers with Well&#8208;Defined Active Sites for Nitrogen Fixation in a Seawater Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface is well constructed by introducing a suitable semicrystalline structure in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers to significantly boost the nitrogen reduction reaction with a high Faradaic efficiency of 60.5% and a maximum NH3 yield rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte.








Abstract
Faradaic efficiency for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is often limited by low N2 solubility in the electrolyte, while a large number of intimate contacts between the electrolyte and solid catalyst can also inevitably sacrifice many active sites for the NRR. Here, it is reported that a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface formed in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers (CPs) is beneficial to boosting the NRR process and at the same time suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Of particular interest, it is found that a semicrystalline CP catalyst, SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT, exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of up to 60.5% with a maximum NH3 production rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte. Molecular dynamics and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations reveal the origin of the observed high NRR performance arising from the presence of desirable crystal regions to resist the penetration of H2O molecules, leading to the formation of a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface inside the catalyst for a favorable direct&#8208;contact between the catalyst and N2 molecules. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput computations, based on density functional theory, reveal the actual real active site for N2 adsorption and reduction in SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT. This work provides a new framework for optimizing NRR performance of metal&#8208;free catalysts by controlling their crystallinities.

         <title>Endocytosis&#8208;Independent and Cancer&#8208;Selective Cytosolic Protein Delivery via Reversible Tagging with LAT1 substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pro&#8208;protein approach is developed based on reversible tagging with l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) substrate, which enables carrier&#8208;free, cancer&#8208;selective, and endocytosis&#8208;independent cytosolic delivery via LAT1&#8208;mediated direct transport. It demonstrates high generality and robust efficiency for varieties of functional proteins, including enzymes, toxins, antibodies, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein. This facile and versatile platform holds transformative potentials in protein pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Protein drugs targeting intracellular machineries have shown profound therapeutic potentials, but their clinical utilities are greatly hampered by the lack of efficient cytosolic delivery techniques. Existing strategies mainly rely on nanocarriers or conjugated cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), which often have drawbacks such as materials complexity/toxicity, lack of cell specificity, and endolysosomal entrapment. Herein, a unique carrier&#8208;free approach is reported for mediating cancer&#8208;selective and endocytosis&#8208;free cytosolic protein delivery. Proteins are sequentially modified with 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 4&#8208;(4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzyl carbonate as the H2O2&#8208;responsive domain and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine as the substrate of l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). Thus, the pro&#8208;protein can be directly transported into tumor cells by overexpressed LAT1 on cell membranes, bypassing endocytosis and endolysosomal entrapment. In the cytosol, overproduced H2O2 restores the protein structure and activity. Using this technique, versatile proteins are delivered into tumor cells with robust efficiency, including toxins, enzymes, CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, and antibodies. Furthermore, intravenously injected pro&#8208;protein of saporin shows potent anticancer efficacy in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, without provoking systemic toxicity. Such a facile and versatile pro&#8208;protein platform may benefit the development of protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Multiscale Functional Metal Architectures by Antibody&#8208;Guided Metallization of Specific Protein Assemblies in Ex Vivo Multicellular Organisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of metallic structures mimicking the specific protein assemblies in multicellular organisms, such as human cells and animal tissue, is demonstrated via antibody&#8211;antigen interactions and electroless deposition. This work enables the use of diverse protein structures that are arranged in unique 3D geometries optimized for certain functions as scaffolds for biotemplating.








Abstract
Biological systems consist of hierarchical protein structures, each of which has unique 3D&#160;geometries optimized for specific functions. In the past decades, the growth of inorganic materials on specific proteins has attracted considerable attention. However, the use of specific proteins as templates has only been demonstrated in relatively simple organisms, such as viruses, limiting the range of structures that can be used as scaffolds. This study proposes a method for synthesizing metallic structures that resemble the 3D assemblies of specific proteins in mammalian cells and animal tissues. Using 1.4 nm nanogold&#8208;conjugated antibodies, specific proteins within cells and ex vivo tissues are labeled, and then the nanogold acts as nucleation sites for growth of metal particles. As proof of concept, various metal particles are grown using microtubules in cells as templates. The metal&#8208;containing cells are applied as catalysts and show catalytic stability in liquid&#8208;phase reactions due to the rigid support provided by the microtubules. Finally, this method is used to produce metal structures that replicate the specific protein assemblies of neurons in the mouse brain or the extracellular matrices in the mouse kidney and heart. This new biotemplating approach can facilitate the conversion of specific protein structures into metallic forms in ex vivo multicellular organisms.

         <title>Preparation of 2D Molybdenum Phosphide via Surface&#8208;Confined Atomic Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology and tunable crystallinity can be prepared from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface&#8208;confined atomic substitution. In contrast to the well&#8208;documented edge&#8208;dominated electrocatalytic performance of the MoS2 precusor, the entire basal plane of MoP demonstrates satisfying electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance owing to its coordination&#8208;unsaturated surface atoms with abundant dangling bonds.








Abstract
The emerging nonlayered 2D materials (NL2DMs) are sparking immense interest due to their fascinating physicochemical properties and enhanced performance in many applications. NL2DMs are particularly favored in catalytic applications owing to the extremely large surface area and low&#8208;coordinated surface atoms. However, the synthesis of NL2DMs is complex because their crystals are held together by strong isotropic covalent bonds. Here, nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology is synthesized from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface&#8208;confined atomic substitution. During the synthesis, the molybdenum dichalcogenide nanosheet&#160;functions as the host matrix where each layer of Mo maintains their hexagonal arrangement and forms isotropic covalent bonds with P that substitutes S, resulting in the conversion from layered van der Waals material to a covalently bonded NL2DM. The MoP nanosheets converted from few&#8208;layer MoS2 are single crystalline, while those converted from monolayers are amorphous. The converted MoP demonstrates metallic charge transport and desirable performance in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). More importantly, in contrast to MoS2, which shows edge&#8208;dominated HER performance, the edge and basal plane of MoP deliver similar HER performance, which is correlated with theoretical calculations. This work provides a new synthetic strategy for high&#8208;quality nonlayered materials with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology for future exploration.

         <title>The Energy Level Conundrum of Organic Semiconductors in Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photovoltaic gap measured by ultraviolet and low&#8208;energy photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS/LE&#8208;IPES) gives the best correlation to device properties, enabling the prediction of maximum Voc. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)&#8208;derived redox potentials are less meaningful for predicting the energetic landscape at the &#8220;donor&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;acceptor&#8221; interface.








Abstract
The frontier molecular energy levels of organic semiconductors are decisive for their fundamental function and efficiency in optoelectronics. However, the precise determination of these energy levels and their variation when using different techniques makes it hard to compare and establish design rules. In this work, the energy levels of 33 organic semiconductors via cyclic voltammetry (CV), density functional theory, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and low&#8208;energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy are determined. Solar cells are fabricated to obtain key device parameters and relate them to the significant differences in the energy levels and offsets obtained from different methods. In contrast to CV, the photovoltaic gap measured using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) correlates well with the experimental device VOC. It is demonstrated that high&#8208;performing systems such as PM6:Y6 and WF3F:Y6, which are previously reported to have negligible ionization energy (IE) offsets (&#916;IE), possess sizable &#916;IE of &#8776;0.5&#160;eV, determined by PES. Using various D&#8211;A blends, it is demonstrated that &#916;IE plays a key role in charge generation. In contrast to earlier reports, it is shown that a vanishing &#916;IE is detrimental to device performance. Overall, these findings establish a solid base for reliably evaluating material energetics and interpreting property&#8211;performance relationships in organic solar cells.

         <title>Emergent Magnetic Fan Structures in Manganite Homojunction Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese oxide homojunctions with gradually modulated doping level host surprisingly complex, long&#8208;range ordered magnetic superstructures whose spin alignment is tunable by low magnetic fields. Homojunctions can thus serve as a powerful design element of all&#8208;oxide spintronic devices.








Abstract
Devices with tunable magnetic noncollinearity are important components of superconducting electronics and spintronics, but they typically require epitaxial integration of several complex materials. The spin&#8208;polarized neutron reflectometry measurements on La1&#8722;xSrxMnO3 homojunction arrays with modulated Sr concentration reported herein have led to the discovery of magnetic fan structures with highly noncollinear alignment of Mn spins and an emergent periodicity twice as large as the array's unit cell. The neutron data show that these magnetic superstructures can be fully long&#8208;range ordered, despite the gradual modulation of the doping level created by charge transfer and chemical intermixing. The degree of noncollinearity can be effectively adjusted by low magnetic fields. Notwithstanding their chemical and structural simplicity, oxide homojunctions thus show considerable promise as a platform for tunable complex magnetism and as a powerful design element of spintronic&#160;devices.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline Perovskite p&#8211;n Junction Nanowire Arrays for Ultrasensitive Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of ultrasensitive photodetectors is demonstrated with single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays. The high crystallinity of the nanowire arrays enables efficient carrier transport and the formation of the built&#8208;in electric field in the p&#8211;n junction facilitates effective carrier separation. The photodetectors show excellent sensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with outstanding responsivities.








Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors play significant roles in modern optoelectronic integrated circuits. Constructing p&#8211;n junctions has been proven to be a particularly powerful approach to realizing sensitive photodetection due to their efficient carrier separation. Recently, p&#8211;n&#8208;junction photodetectors based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, which combine favorable optoelectronic performance with facile processability, hold great potential in practical applications. So far, these devices have generally been made of polycrystalline films, which exhibit poor carrier&#8208;transport efficiency, impeding the further improvement of their photoresponsivities. Here, a type of ultrasensitive photodetector based on single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays is demonstrated. The single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays not only possess high crystallinity that enables efficient carrier transport but also form a built&#8208;in electric field facilitating effective carrier separation. As a result, the devices show excellent photosensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with an outstanding responsivity of 2.65&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 532&#160;nm. These results will provide new insights into the design and construction of high&#8208;performance photodetectors for practical optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Exposing Single Ni Atoms in Hollow S/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni single atoms embedded S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) are fabricated through pyrolysis of rationally designed CdS&#8208;NiSx@PAN composite fibers. Benefiting from the abundant exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The development of efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for clean energy and fuel conversion. Herein, the facile preparation of Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) as efficient catalysts for OER through pyrolysis of designed CdS&#8208;NiSx/polyacrylonitrile composite fibers is reported. Specifically, CdS provides the sulfur source for the doping of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;derived carbon matrix and simultaneously creates the hollow macroporous structure, while NiSx is first reduced to nanoparticles and finally evolves into single Ni atoms through the atom migration&#8208;trapping strategy. Benefiting from the abundantly exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalysts deliver outstanding activity and stability for OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 285&#160;mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 50.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.

         <title>Experimental Realization of Atomic Monolayer Si9C15</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Si9C15 monolayer is fabricated on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates via the reaction between Si and graphene under high temperatures. The as&#8208;grown Si9C15 layer is micrometer&#8208;scale, high quality, and single crystalline with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9 eV. Combined measurements and density functional calculations confirm the buckled honeycomb structure. The novel 2D material also shows good air stability.








Abstract
Monolayer SixCy constitutes an important family of&#160;2D&#160;materials that is predicted to feature a honeycomb structure and appreciable bandgaps. However, due to its binary chemical nature and the lack of bulk polymorphs with a layered structure, the fabrication of such materials has so far been challenging. Here, the synthesis of atomic monolayer Si9C15 on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates is reported. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to infer that the 2D lattice of Si9C15 is a buckled honeycomb structure. Monolayer Si9C15 shows semiconducting behavior with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9&#160;eV. Remarkably, the Si9C15 lattice remains intact after exposure to ambient conditions, indicating good air stability. The present work expands the 2D&#8208;materials library and provides a promising platform for future studies in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.

         <title>SrTiO3/CuNi&#8208;Heterostructure&#8208;Based Thermopile for Sensitive Human Radiation Detection and Noncontact Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
SrTiO3/CuNi heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile, characterized by the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, exhibits high sensitivity to human radiation. Further integration of human radiation into a noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction system is experimentally demonstrated, and the real&#8208;time recognition of hand gestures and touchless input of Arabic numbers and English letters are implemented.








Abstract
Noncontact interactive technology provides an intelligent solution to mitigate public health risks from cross&#8208;infection in the era of COVID&#8208;19. The utilization of human radiation as a stimulus source is conducive to the implementation of low&#8208;power, robust noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction. However, the low radiation intensity emitted by humans puts forward a high demand for photodetection performance. Here, a SrTiO3&#8722;x/CuNi&#8208;heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile is constructed, which features the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, to realize the self&#8208;powered detection of human radiation. The response level of this thermopile to human radiation is orders of magnitude higher than those of low&#8208;dimensional&#8208;materials&#8208;based photothermoelectric detectors and even commercial thermopiles. Furthermore, a touchless input device based on the thermopile array is developed, which can recognize hand gestures, numbers, and letters in real&#8208;time.

     alt="SrTiO3/CuNi-Heterostructure-Based Thermopile for Sensitive Human Radiation Detection and Noncontact Human&#8211;Machine Interaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CuNi heterostructure-based thermopile, characterized by the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near-unity long-wave infrared absorption, exhibits high sensitivity to human radiation. Further integration of human radiation into a noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction system is experimentally demonstrated, and the real-time recognition of hand gestures and touchless input of Arabic numbers and English letters are implemented.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noncontact interactive technology provides an intelligent solution to mitigate public health risks from cross-infection in the era of COVID-19. The utilization of human radiation as a stimulus source is conducive to the implementation of low-power, robust noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction. However, the low radiation intensity emitted by humans puts forward a high demand for photodetection performance. Here, a SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/CuNi-heterostructure-based thermopile is constructed, which features the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near-unity long-wave infrared absorption, to realize the self-powered detection of human radiation. The response level of this thermopile to human radiation is orders of magnitude higher than those of low-dimensional-materials-based photothermoelectric detectors and even commercial thermopiles. Furthermore, a touchless input device based on the thermopile array is developed, which can recognize hand gestures, numbers, and letters in real-time. This work offers a reliable strategy to integrate the spontaneous human radiation into noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Percolated Plasmonic Superlattices of Nanospheres with 1 nm&#8208;Level Gap as High&#8208;Index Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroligand gold nanoparticles are stable in an oil phase but can be switched to stable Janus particles at the interface, which forms a 2D superlattice over square centimeters with nanometer&#8208;precision particle&#8208;to&#8208;particle gap. The percolated 2D superstructure exhibits the highest&#8208;ever refractive index (&#8776;7.8) on varying the size and interparticle gap of the NPs, which is explained by a new theoretical model based on &#8220;plasmonic percolation.&#8221;








Abstract
Nanophotonics relies on precise control of refractive index (RI) which can be designed with metamaterials. Plasmonic superstructures of nanoparticles (NPs) can suggest a versatile way of tuning RI. However, the plasmonic effects in the superstructures demand 1 nm&#8208;level exquisite control over the interparticle gap, which is challenging in a sub&#8208;wavelength NPs. Thus far, a large&#8208;area demonstration has been mostly discouraged. Here, heteroligand AuNPs are prepared, which are stable in oil but become Janus particles at the oil&#8211;water interface, called &#8220;adaptive Janus particles.&#8221; NPs are bound at the interface and assembled into 2D arrays over square centimeters as toluene evaporates, which distinctively exhibits the RI tunability. In visible and NIR light, the 2D superstructures exhibit the highest&#8208;ever RI (&#8776;7.8) with varying the size and interparticle gap of NPs, which is successfully explained by a plasmonic percolation model. Furthermore, fully solution&#8208;processable 2D plasmonic superstructures are proved to be advantageous in flexible photonic devices such as distributed Bragg reflectors.

         <title>Robust Piezoelectricity with Spontaneous Polarization in Monolayer Tellurene and Multilayer Tellurium Film at Room Temperature for Reliable Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust piezoelectricity with spontaneous polarization is detected in tellurene at room temperature due to the strong anisotropic property and dipoles induced by unique charity helical chain structure and strong intramolecular interactions. A charming memory window and high on switching current are realized in tellurene&#8208;based memory, providing a new platform to construct robust memory cells for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Robust neuromorphic computing in the Big Data era calls for long&#8208;term stable crossbar&#8208;array memory cells; however, the elemental segregation in the switch unit and memory unit that inevitably occurs upon cycling breaks the compositional and structural stability, making the whole memory cell a failure. Searching for a novel material without segregation that can be used for both switch and memory units is the major concern to fabricate robust and reliable nonvolatile cross&#8208;array memory cells. Tellurium (Te) is found recently to be the only peculiar material without segregation for switching, but the memory function has not been demonstrated yet. Herein, apparent piezoelectricity is experimentally confirmed with spontaneous polarization behaviors in elementary 2D Te, even in monolayer tellurene (0.4&#160;nm), due to the highly oriented polarization of the molecular structure and the non&#8208;centrosymmetric lattice structure. A large memory window of 7000, a low working voltage of 2&#160;V, and high on switching current up to 36.6 &#181;A&#8201;&#181;m&#8722;1 are achieved in the as&#8208;fabricated Te&#8208;based memory device, revealing the great promise of Te for both switching and memory units in one cell without segregation. The piezoelectric Te with spontaneous polarization provides a platform to build robust, reliable, and high&#8208;density logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory chips in neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Rapid Ultratough Topological Tissue Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving tough adhesion in wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. It is shown that combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix can achieve ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000 J m&#8722;2) without covalent bond formation. These properties open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving strong and tough adhesion in permeable wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. However, adhesion generated through covalent bond formation directly with the functional groups of tissues (i.e., &#63743;COOH and &#63743;NH2&#160;groups in collagen), or using non&#8208;covalent interactions can both be limited by weak, unstable, or slow adhesion. Here, it is shown that by combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix one can achieve unprecedented ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) in 5&#8211;10&#160;min without covalent bond formation. The strong non&#8208;covalent adhesion is shown to be stable under physiologically relevant conditions and strongly influenced by chitosan molecular weight, molecular weight of polymers in the matrix, and pH. The adhesion mechanism relies primarily on the topological entanglement between the chitosan chains and the permeable adherends. To further expand the applicability of the adhesives, adhesion time can be decreased by dehydrating the hydrogel matrix to facilitate rapid chitosan interpenetration and entanglement (&gt;1000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;in &#8804;1&#160;min). The unprecedented adhesive properties presented in this study open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives and numerous bioapplications.

         <title>Convection Driven Ultrarapid Protein Detection via Nanobody&#8208;Functionalized Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) at the sample incubation step accelerates the operation of an organic&#8208;electrochemical&#8208;transistor&#8208;based protein sensor with a limit of detection at the attomolar range. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits a sample&#8208;to&#8208;result time of 2 min, with better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation.








Abstract
Conventional biosensors rely on the diffusion&#8208;dominated transport of the target analyte to the sensor surface. Consequently, they require an incubation step that may take several hours to allow for the capture of analyte molecules by sensor biorecognition sites. This incubation step is a primary cause of long sample&#8208;to&#8208;result times. Here, alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) is integrated in an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)&#8208;based sensor to accelerate the device operation. ACET is applied to the gate electrode functionalized with nanobody&#8211;SpyCatcher fusion proteins. Using the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein in human saliva as an example target, it is shown that ACET enables protein recognition within only 2 min of sample exposure, supporting its use in clinical practice. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation. The performance of ACET integrated sensors is compared with two types of organic semiconductors in the channel and grounds for device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations are investigated. The results provide guidelines for the channel material choice in OECT&#8208;based biochemical sensors, and demonstrate that ACET integration substantially decreases the detection speed while increasing the sensitivity and selectivity of transistor&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Light&#8208;Soaking in MAPbI3: The Effect of H2O</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced photodamage and consequent self&#8208;healing inside MAPbI3 single crystals are investigated. Two photobrightening and one photodarkening process are identified,&#160;which&#160;are connected to trap&#8208;filling, methylamine&#8208;chemistry, and the lead&#8208;halide sublattice. H2O is&#160;found&#160;to&#160;strongly influence the overall photodamage and kinetics of the self&#8208;healing process, showing an important connection between self&#8208;healing and the presence of H2O. 








Abstract
The future of halide perovskites (HaPs) is beclouded by limited understanding of their long&#8208;term stability. While HaPs can be altered by radiation that induces multiple processes, they can also return to their original state by &#8220;self&#8208;healing.&#8221; Here two&#8208;photon (2P) absorption is used to effect light&#8208;induced modifications within MAPbI3 single crystals. Then the changes in the photodamaged region are followed by measuring the photoluminescence, from 2P absorption with 2.5&#160;orders of magnitude lower intensity than that used for photodamaging the MAPbI3. After photodamage, two brightening and one darkening process are found, all of which recover but on different timescales. The first two are attributed to trap&#8208;filling (the fastest) and to proton&#8208;amine&#8208;related chemistry (the slowest), while photodamage is attributed to the lead&#8208;iodide sublattice. Surprisingly, while after 2P&#8208;irradiation of crystals that are stored in dry, inert ambient, photobrightening (or &#8220;light&#8208;soaking&#8221;) occurs, mostly photodarkening is seen after photodamage in humid ambient, showing an important connection between the self&#8208;healing of a HaP and the presence of H2O, for long&#8208;term steady&#8208;state illumination, practically no difference remains between samples kept in dry or humid environments. This result suggests that photobrightening requires a chemical&#8208;reservoir that is sensitive to the presence of H2O, or possibly other proton&#8208;related, particularly amine, chemistry.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Conduction Channels in Memristive Devices Observed by X&#8208;ray Multimodal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
While neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations, the accuracy needs improvement by reducing the randomness of memristive behavior. The controlled formation of conduction channels is shown here, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. The results suggest an effective route for controlling the otherwise random electroforming process.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations than conventional digital computers for artificial intelligence (AI). However, its current accuracy is generally less than the dominant software&#8208;based AI. The key to improving accuracy is to reduce the intrinsic randomness of memristive devices, emulating synapses in the brain for neuromorphic computing. Here using a planar device as a model system, the controlled formation of conduction channels is achieved with high oxygen vacancy concentrations through the design of sharp protrusions in the electrode gap, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. Classical molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the controlled formation of conduction channels arises from confinement of the electric field, yielding a reproducible spatial distribution of oxygen vacancies across switching cycles. This work demonstrates an effective route to control the otherwise random electroforming process by electrode design, facilitating the development of more accurate memristive devices for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Ultrafine Silver Nanoparticle Encapsulated Porous Molecular Traps for Discriminative Photoelectrochemical Detection of Mustard Gas Simulants by Synergistic Size&#8208;Exclusion and Site&#8208;Specific Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process affords nanocomposite materials comprising sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) encapsulated in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic framework materials, the AgNPs@HOFs exhibit significantly enhanced photocurrent. A portable photoelectrochemical (PEC) device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 detects chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants with both nanomolar sensitivity and excellent selectivity.








Abstract
The rapid, discriminative, and portable detection of highly toxic chemical warfare agents is extremely important for response to public security emergencies but remains a challenge. One plausible solution involves the integration of porous molecular traps onto a photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor. Here, a fast and facile protocol is developed to fabricate sub&#8208;1&#160;nm AgNPs encapsulated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanocomposite materials through an in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process. Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) materials, these AgNPs@HOFs show significantly enhanced photocurrent. Most importantly, the portable PEC device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 can selectively recognize 13 different mustard gas simulants, including 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), based on synergistic size&#8208;exclusion and specific recognition. The extremely low detection limit for CEES (15.8&#160;nmol L&#8722;1), reusability (at least 30 cycles), and long&#8208;term working stability (at least 30 d) of the portable PEC device warrant its use as a chemical warfare agents (CWAs) sensor in practical field settings. More broadly, this work indicates that integrating porous molecular traps onto PEC sensors offers a promising strategy to further develop portable devices for CWAs detection with both ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity.

         <title>A New Polymer Donor Enables Binary All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells with 18% Efficiency and Excellent Mechanical Robustness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational molecular design, a polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed. Optimal power conversion efficiencies of 18.0% and 16.5% are achieved in rigid and flexible all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells, respectively. This work demonstrates that PQM&#8208;Cl is a promising polymer donor and the design of new polymer donors is essential for further improving the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.








Abstract
The development of polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors has boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells to 17%. However, the polymer donors suitable for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells are still lacking, restricting the further improvement of their PCEs. Herein, a new polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed and its photovoltaic performance is explored. The negative electrostatic potential and low average local ionization energy distribution of the PQM&#8208;Cl surface enable efficient charge generation and transfer process. When blending with a well&#8208;used polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;IT, the PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based devices deliver an impressive PCE of 18.0% with a superior fill factor of 80.7%, both of which are the highest values for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells. The relevant measurements demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based films possess excellent mechanical and flexible properties. As such, PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based flexible photovoltaic cells are fabricated and an excellent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability is displayed. These results demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl is a potential candidate for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells and provide insights into the design of polymer donors for high&#8208;efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

Organic Semiconductors
In article number 2202575, Anirudh Sharma, Derya Baran, and co&#8208;workers unravel the inconsistencies of the determination of the absolute energy levels in organic semiconductors and their implication, particularly in the field of organic solar cells. In the cover image, the charges generated by the excitation of the materials by light are represented by the energy balls with feet and hands: electrons are represented in green and holes in red. The charges are jumping down a staircase, representing the energy levels of different organic semiconductor materials.

Visualization of Fingerprints
Visualization of fingerprints plays a crucial role in personal identification, security, and criminal investigation. In article number 2202540, Tao Tu and co&#8208;workers report the instantaneous high&#8208;resolution visualization of latent fingerprints in water using color&#8208;tunable aggregation&#8208;induced emission pincer complexes under UV or even ambient light. This work provides an excellent example for practical recording and analysis of latent fingerprints in different scenarios.

Bismuth Oxyselenide
Novel photoinduced quasiparticles, excimers, in the non&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se are unambiguously by Jianbo Hu and co&#8208;workers in article number 2204227, identified through analyzing the emerging dynamic features by transient absorption spectra. Excimers in the Bi2O2Se nanosheets are diffusive and their formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work advances the fundamental understanding of carrier dynamics in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device design.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells are cpomprehensively reviewed regarding the key design parameters, the current performances, and recent advances on failure analysis and promotion strategies on cathode, electrolyte, and anode.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries promise great potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Evaluation and analysis on practical Li&#8211;S pouch cells are essential for achieving actual high energy density under working conditions and affording developing directions for practical applications. This review aims to afford a comprehensive overview of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S pouch cells regarding 7&#160;years of development and to point out further research directions. Key design parameters to achieve actual high energy density are addressed first, to define the research boundaries distinguished from coin&#8208;cell&#8208;level evaluation. Systematic analysis of the published literature and cutting&#8208;edge performances is then conducted to demonstrate the achieved progress and the gap toward practical applications. Following that, failure analysis as well as promotion strategies at the pouch cell level are, respectively, discussed to reveal the unique working and failure mechanism that shall be accordingly addressed. Finally, perspectives toward high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S pouch cells are presented regarding the challenges and opportunities of this field.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Nanomedicine for the Treatment of Ischemic Heart Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current developments, achievements, challenges, and future directions of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging nanomedicine for the treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD), as well as their risk factors, are reviewed. The properties, generation, and physiological roles of ROS in the process of IHD development and progression are discussed.








Abstract
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play key roles in the progression of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, which are independent risk factors that lead to atherosclerosis and the development of IHD. Engineered biomaterial&#8208;based nanomedicines are under extensive investigation and exploration, serving as smart and multifunctional nanocarriers for synergistic therapeutic effect. Capitalizing on cell/molecule&#8208;targeting drug delivery, nanomedicines present enhanced specificity and safety with favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Herein, the roles of ROS in both IHD and its risk factors are discussed, highlighting cardiovascular medications that have antioxidant properties, and summarizing the advantages, properties, and recent achievements of nanomedicines that have ROS scavenging capacity for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion, and myocardial infarction. Finally, the current challenges of nanomedicines for ROS&#8208;scavenging treatment of IHD and possible future directions are discussed from a clinical perspective.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Exfoliation of Nonlayered Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Crystals into Nanoplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research progress on the use of liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation beyond layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals is summarized. Questions remain unanswered on how these 3D strongly bonded nonlayered crystals exfoliate into nanoplatelets, and on the insight of the exfoliation mechanism. The answer to the questions helps in revealing the future direction of this newly grown sub&#8208;family of 2D&#8208;class of materials.








Abstract
For nearly 15 years, researchers have been using liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) to produce 2D nanosheets from layered crystals. This has yielded multiple 2D materials in a solution&#8208;processable form whose utility has been demonstrated in multiple applications. It was&#160;believed that the exfoliation of such materials is enabled by the very large bonding anisotropy of layered materials where the strength of intralayer chemical bonds is very much larger than that of interlayer van der Waals bonds. However, over the last five years, a number of papers have raised questions about our&#160;understanding of exfoliation by describing the LPE of nonlayered materials. These results are extremely surprising because, as no van der Waals gap is present to provide an easily cleaved direction, the exfoliation of such compounds requires the breaking of only chemical bonds. Here the progress in this unexpected new research area is examined. The structure and properties of nanoplatelets produced by LPE of nonlayered materials are reviewed. A number of unexplained trends are found, not least the preponderance of isotropic materials that have been exfoliated to give high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanoplatelets. Finally, the applications potential of this new class of 2D materials are considered.

         <title>Doping Engineering in the MoS2/SnSe2 Heterostructure towards High Rejection Ratio Solar&#8208;blind UV Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The intentionally designed band alignment of heterostructures and doping engineering are keys to implement device structure design and device performance optimization. According to the theoretical prediction of several typical materials among the TMDs and group IV metal chalcogenides, MoS2 and SnSe2 present the largest staggered band offset. The large band offset is conducive to the separation of photogenerated carriers, thus MoS2/SnSe2 is a theoretically ideal candidate for fabricating photodetector, which is also verified in our experiment. Furthermore, in order to extend the photoresponse spectrum to solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (SBUV), doping engineering is adopted to form an additional electron state, which provides an extra carrier transition channel. In this work, pure MoS2/SnSe2 and doped MoS2/SnSe2 heterostructures are both fabricated. In terms of the photoelectric performance evaluation, the rejection ratio R254/R532 of the photodetector based on doped MoS2/SnSe2 is five orders of magnitude higher than that of pure MoS2/SnSe2, while the response time is obviously optimized by 3 orders. Our results demonstrate that the combination of band alignment and doping engineering provides a new pathway for constructing SBUV photodetectors.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Anode&#8208;Less All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries via the Conversion Reaction of Metal Fluorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature anode&#8208;less all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery is reported by utilizing the conversion reaction of metal fluorides. Silver fluoride is identified as a seed component to induce uniform and reversible lithium plating via a conversion reaction that produces metallic silver nanodomains. These nanodomains, together with the lithium fluoride formed during the conversion reaction, enable sustainable cycling with an extremely high areal capacity.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) that employ anode&#8208;less electrodes have drawn attention from across the battery community because they offer competitive energy densities and a markedly improved cycle life. Nevertheless, the composite matrices of anode&#8208;less electrodes impose a substantial barrier for lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and inhibit operation at room temperature. To overcome this drawback, here, the conversion reaction of metal fluorides is exploited because metallic nanodomains formed during this reaction induce an alloying reaction with lithium ions for uniform and sustainable lithium (de)plating. Lithium fluoride (LiF), another product of the conversion reaction, prevents the agglomeration of the metallic nanodomains and also protects the electrode from fatal lithium dendrite growth. A systematic analysis identifies silver (I) fluoride (AgF) as the most suitable metal fluoride because the silver nanodomains can accommodate the solid&#8208;solution mechanism with a low nucleation overpotential. AgF&#8208;based full cells attain reliable cycling at 25 &#176;C even with an exceptionally high areal capacity of 9.7 mAh cm&#8722;2 (areal loading of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#160;= 50&#160;mg cm&#8211;2). These results offer useful insights into designing materials for anode&#8208;less electrodes for sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs.

Abstract

The IPBSC shows cascade&#8208;like energy level alignment between the charge&#8208;extractionlayer/perovskite/BHJ and efficient passivation effect of BHJ on perovskite. Thanks to the well&#8208;matched energy level alignment and high&#8208;quality ideal bandgap&#8208;based perovskite film, an efficient charge transfer occurs between the charge&#8208;extraction&#8208;layer/perovskite/BHJ. Moreover, the NIR polymer DTBTI on the perovskite film leads to an improved NIR light response for the IPBSC. In addition, the O, S and N atoms in the DTBTI polymer yield a strong interaction with perovskite, which is conducive to reducing the defects of the perovskite and suppressing charge recombination. As a result, the solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.27% (certificated value at 23.4% with 0.283&#8208;volt voltage loss), currently the recorded efficiency for both IPBSCs and Pb&#8208;Sn alloyed PSCs, and which is over the highest efficiency of perovskite&#8211;organic tandem solar cell. Moreover, the thermal, humidity and long&#8208;term operational stabilities of the IPBSCs are also significantly improved compared with the control PSCs.

         <title>Spleen&#8208;Targeted Glabridin&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles Regulate Polarization of Monocyte/Macrophage (Mo/M&#966;) for the Treatment of Cerebral Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>

         <dc:description>
Glabridin (Gla)&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPGla&#8208;5k) can selectively deliver Gla to the spleen and regulate the polarization of monocyte/macrophages (Mo/M&#966;). By inhibiting Mo/M&#966; mediated inflammatory damage and enhancing its repairing effect, NPGla&#8208;5k treatment improves nervous system function in mice with cerebral I&#8208;R injury.








Abstract
During cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion (I&#8208;R) injury, the infiltration of monocyte/macrophages (Mo/M&#966;) into the ischemic penumbra causes inflammatory damage but also regulates tissue repair in the penumbra. The regulation and balance of Mo/M&#966; polarization is considered as a potential therapeutic target for treating cerebral I&#8208;R injury. Herein, these findings demonstrate that glabridin (Gla)&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (i.e., NPGla&#8208;5k) can effectively inhibit M1&#8208;polarization and enhance M2&#8208;polarization of Mo/M&#966;. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging shows that NPGla&#8208;5k can selectively accumulate in the spleen following intravenous injection. Spleen&#8208;targeted Cy5&#8208;NPGla&#8208;5k can co&#8208;localize with peripheral macrophages in the penumbra at 24&#160;h after tail&#8208;vein injection. Interestingly, NPGla&#8208;5k treatment can reduce inflammatory damage, protect dying neurons, and improve nervous system function. The protective effect of spleen&#8208;targeted NPGla&#8208;5k against cerebral I&#8208;R injury in mice encourages an exploration of their use for clinical treatment of patients with cerebral I&#8208;R injury.

         <title>Molecularly Distorted Local Structure in Bi2CuO4 Oxide to Stabilize Lattice Oxygen for Efficient Formate Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi2CuO4 oxide precatalyst delivers high&#8208;efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion electrocatalysis. Benefiting from the molecularly distorted local structure with [CuO4]6&#8722; square&#8208;planar units rotation, more lattice oxygen can be retained during theelectrochemical CO2 reduction process. The retained local lattice oxygen can optimize the adsorption of *OCHO intermediate, thereby promoting the CO2 reduction efficiency.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an economically feasible way for converting green energy into valuable chemical feedstocks and fuels. Great progress has been achieved in the understanding and synthesis of oxidized&#8208;based precatalysts; however, their dynamical changes of local structure under operando conditions still hinder their further applications. Here a molecularly distorted Bi2CuO4 precatalyst for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion is reported. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) results and theoretical calculations suggest that the distorted structure with molecularly like [CuO4]6&#8722; unit rotation is more conducive to the structural stability of the sample. Operando XAFS and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) results prove that quite a bit of lattice oxygen can remain in the distorted sample after CO2RR. Electrochemical measurements of the distorted sample show an excellent activity and selectivity with a high formate partial current density of 194.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an extremely low overpotential of &#8722;400&#160;mV. Further in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the retained oxygen can optimize the adsorption of *OCHO intermediate for the enhanced CO2RR performance.

X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) results and theoretical calculations suggest that the distorted structure with molecularly like [CuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; unit rotation is more conducive to the structural stability of the sample. Operando XAFS and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) results prove that quite a bit of lattice oxygen can remain in the distorted sample after CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. Electrochemical measurements of the distorted sample show an excellent activity and selectivity with a high formate partial current density of 194.6&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at an extremely low overpotential of &#8722;400&#160;mV. Further in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the retained oxygen can optimize the adsorption of *OCHO intermediate for the enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetic Alignment for Plasmonic Control of Gold Nanorods Coated with Iron Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembly of spherical, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles on gold nanorods yields magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) that align in applied magnetic fields. Magnetic manipulation of the surface plasmon resonance of MagGNRs is comprehensively investigated through structural and optical characterization, and an analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment behavior. Dynamic alignment of MagGNRs is demonstrated in rotating magnetic fields.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles that can be manipulated with magnetic fields are of interest for advanced optical applications, diagnostics, imaging, and therapy. Alignment of gold nanorods yields strong polarization&#8208;dependent extinction, and use of magnetic fields is appealing because they act through space and can be quickly switched. In this work, cationic polyethyleneimine&#8208;functionalized superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are deposited on the surface of anionic gold nanorods coated with bovine serum albumin. The magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) obtained through mixing maintain the distinct optical properties of plasmonic gold nanorods that are minimally perturbed by the magnetic overcoating. Magnetic alignment of the MagGNRs arising from magnetic dipolar interactions on the anisotropic gold nanorod core is comprehensively characterized, including structural characterization and enhancement (suppression) of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance and suppression (enhancement) of the transverse surface plasmon resonance for light polarized parallel (orthogonal) to the magnetic field. The MagGNRs can also be driven in rotating magnetic fields to rotate at frequencies of at least 17&#160;Hz. For suitably large gold nanorods (148&#160;nm long) and Fe3O4 NPs (13.4&#160;nm diameter), significant alignment is possible even in modest (&lt;500&#160;Oe) magnetic fields. An analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment of MagGNRs.

         <title>An Electret&#8208;Powered Skin&#8208;Attachable Auditory Sensor that Functions in Harsh Acoustic Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electret&#8208;powered skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor operating without a bulky battery is presented. The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragm array with elastomer nanodroplets facilitates high sensing performance and clear voice detection in a harsh acoustic environment. The acoustic sensor shows a strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications.








Abstract
Auditory sensors have shortcomings with respect to not only personalization with wearability and portability but also detecting a human voice clearly in a noisy environment or when a mask covers the mouth. In this work, an electret&#8208;powered and hole&#8208;patterned polymer diaphragm is exploited into a skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor. The optimized charged electret diaphragm induces a voltage bias of &gt;400&#160;V against the counter electrode, which reduces the necessity of a bulky power source and enables the capacitive sensor to show high sensitivity (2.2&#160;V&#160;Pa&#8722;1) with incorporation of an elastomer nanodroplet seismic mass. The sophisticated capacitive structure with low mechanical damping enables a flat frequency response (80&#8211;3000&#160;Hz) and good linearity (50&#8211;80&#160;dBSPL). The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragms help the skin&#8208;attachable sensor detect only neck&#8208;skin vibration rather than dynamic air pressure, enabling a person's voice to be detected in a harsh acoustic environment. The sensor operates reliably even in the presence of surrounding noise and when the user is wearing a gas mask. Therefore, the sensor shows strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications such as cough monitoring and voice dosimetry.

         <title>Lattice Mismatch Driven Small Angle Moir&#233; Twists in Epitaxially&#8208;Grown 2D Vertical Layered Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Artificially introduced small twist angles at the interfaces of vertical layered heterostructures (VLHs) have allowed deterministic tuning of electronic and optical properties such as strongly&#8208;correlated electronic phases and Moir&#233; excitons. But creating Moir&#233; twist in van der Waals (vdWs) systems by manual stacking is challenging in reproducibility, uniformity and accuracy of the twist angle, which hinders future studies. Here, we demonstrate that, contrary to the commonly believed 0&#176;&#8208;orientation in vdWs epitaxy, these VLHs show small twist angles controlled by the low&#8208;order commensurate phase with low energy and local atomic relaxation. A commensurate multilevel map was proposed to predict possible orientations. Remarkably, high&#8208;mismatch VLHs show discrete and sometimes non&#8208;zero twist angles dependent on their natural mismatch value. Such framework was experimentally confirmed in five epitaxially&#8208;grown VLHs under high&#8208;angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), and could provide significant insights for large&#8208;scale engineering of twist angle in VLHs.

         <title>A review on regulating Li+ solvation structures in carbonate electrolytes for lithium metal batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation battery systems due to their high energy density. However, commercialized carbonate electrolytes cannot be used in LMBs due to their poor compatibility with lithium metal anodes. While increasing cut&#8208;off voltage is an effective way to boost the energy density of LMBs, conventional ethylene carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes undergo a number of side reactions at high voltages. It is therefore critical to upgrade conventional carbonate electrolytes, the performance of which is highly influenced by the solvation structure of lithium ions (Li+). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the strategies to regulate the solvation structure of Li+ in carbonate electrolytes for LMBs by better understanding the science behind the Li+ solvation structure and Li+ behavior. We systematically compare different strategies to help select better electrolytes for specific applications. Remaining scientific and technical problems are pointed out, and directions for future research on carbonate electrolytes for LMBs are proposed.

         <title>Observation of Coexisting Dirac Bands and Moir&#233; Flat Bands in Magic&#8208;Angle Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices that consist of two or more layers of two&#8208;dimensional materials stacked together with a small twist angle have emerged as a tunable platform to realize various correlated and topological phases, such as Mott insulators, unconventional superconductivity and quantum anomalous Hall effect. Recently, the magic&#8208;angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has shown both robust superconductivity similar to magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) and other unique properties, including the Pauli&#8208;limit violating and re&#8208;entrant superconductivity. These rich properties are deeply rooted in its electronic structure under the influence of distinct moir&#233; potential and mirror symmetry. Here, combining nanometer&#8208;scale spatially resolved angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (nano&#8208;ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we systematically measure the yet unexplored band structure of MATTG near charge neutrality. Our measurements reveal the coexistence of the distinct dispersive Dirac band with the emergent moir&#233; flat band, showing nice agreement with the theoretical calculations. These results serve as a stepstone for further understanding of the unconventional superconductivity in MATTG.

         <title>Super&#8208;Linear&#8208;Threshold&#8208;Switching Selector with Multiple Jar&#8208;Shaped Cu&#8208;Filaments in the Amorphous Ge3Se7 Resistive Switching Layer in a Cross&#8208;Point Synaptic Memristor Array</title>

         <dc:description>
An artificial neural network consisting of a hardware&#8208;based cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array should employ selectors with two&#8208;terminal electrodes to prevent an undesired sneak current and to improve learning and inference efficiencies. Here, a highly reliable super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped Cu&#8208;filaments in the amorphous Ge3Se7 resistive switching layer by controlling the Cu ion concentration depth profile is developed.








Abstract
The learning and inference efficiencies of an artificial neural network represented by a cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array can be achieved using a selector, with high selectivity (Ion/Ioff) and sufficient death region, stacked vertically on a synaptic memristor. This can prevent a sneak current in the memristor array. A selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped conductive Cu filaments in the resistive switching layer is precisely fabricated by designing the Cu ion concentration depth profile of the CuGeSe layer as a filament source, TiN diffusion barrier layer, and Ge3Se7 switching layer. The selector performs super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching with a selectivity of &gt; 107, death region of &#8722;0.70&#8211;0.65 V, holding time of 300 ns, switching speed of 25 ns, and endurance cycle of &gt;&#160;106. In addition, the mechanism of switching is proven by the formation of conductive Cu filaments between the CuGeSe and Ge3Se7 layers under a positive bias on the top Pt electrode and an automatic rupture of the filaments after the holding time. Particularly, a spiking deep neural network using the designed one&#8208;selector&#8208;one&#8208;memory cross&#8208;point array improves the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology classification accuracy by &#8776;3.8% by eliminating the sneak current in the cross&#8208;point array during the inference process.

         <title>Role of Moisture and Oxygen in Defect Management and Orderly Oxidation Boosting Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI2Br Solar Cells to a New Record Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orderly oxidation of CsPbI2Br film in moist air leads to more efficient defect passivation in film by grain boundary oxidation, and higher hole extraction efficiency in device via the energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and oxidation product CsPbIBr2. The champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Large energy loss (Eloss) caused&#160;by defect&#8208;assisted recombination makes the photovoltaic performance of carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) inferior to that of metal&#8208;electrode ones. Herein, the influence of environmental factors (moisture and oxygen) on defect management during re&#8208;annealing process of CsPbI2Br crystalline films is systematically studied. Density functional theory and experimental results indicate that moisture in the air can significantly reduce the oxidation kinetics of crystalline films, resulting in orderly oxidation. Concomitantly, the oxidation decomposition products PbO and CsPbIBr2 are enriched at grain boundaries, passivating surface defects efficiently. Simultaneously, energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 improves the hole extraction efficiency. The photovoltage of corresponding C&#8208;PSCs is increased from 1.05 to 1.32&#160;V, indicating a reduced Eloss derived from orderly oxidation strategy. Correspondingly, the champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a new record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>A Meta&#8208;Device for Intelligent Depth Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the magic stairs, an innovative and complementary integration of light&#8208;field and structured&#8208;light depth mapping and imaging system using a size of 1.2 &#215; 1.2 mm2 meta&#8208;lens array to measure the depth over a 30 cm range is shown. This compact, lightweight, low power consumption system can be used for autonomous systems in all light levels conditions.








Abstract
The optical illusion affects depth&#8208;sensing due to the limited and specific light&#8208;field information acquired by single&#8208;lens imaging. The incomplete depth information or visual deception would cause cognitive errors. To resolve this problem, an intelligent and compact depth&#8208;sensing meta&#8208;device that is miniaturized, integrated, and applicable for diverse scenes in all light levels is demonstrated. The compact and multifunction stereo vision system adopts an array with 3600 achromatic meta&#8208;lenses and a size of 1.2 &#215; 1.2 mm2 to measure the depth over a 30&#160;cm range with deep&#8208;learning support. The meta&#8208;lens array can act as multiple imaging lenses to collect light field information. It can also work with a light source as an active optical device to project a structured light. The meta&#8208;lens array can serve as the core functional component of a light&#8208;field imaging system under bright conditions or a structured&#8208;light projection system in the dark. The depth information in both ways can be analyzed and extracted by the convolutional neural network. This work provides a new avenue for the applications such as autonomous driving, machine vision, human&#8211;computer interaction, augmented reality, biometric identification, etc.

         <title>Large Room Temperature Anomalous Transverse Thermoelectric Effect in Kagome Antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 exhibits a maximum transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776; 2.4 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 200 K. More importantly, a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) of &#8776; 2 &#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 at 300 K is observed, which is the highest value for any antiferromagnetic material. This large ANE value can be attributed to the presence of a Dirac point and flat band close to the Fermi level with intrinsic Berry curvature.








Abstract
Kagome magnets possess several novel nontrivial topological features owing to the strong correlation between topology and magnetism that extends to their applications in the field of thermoelectricity. Conventional thermoelectric (TE) devices use the Seebeck effect to convert heat into electrical energy. In contrast, transverse thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect are attracting recent attention due to their unique transverse geometry, which uses a single material to eliminate the need for a multitude of electrical connections compared to conventional TE devices. Here, a large anomalous transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776;2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in a kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 single crystal is obtained. The obtained value is larger than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials and comparable with ferromagnetic systems. The large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) can be attributed to the net Berry curvature near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the ANE of the AFM YMn6Sn6 exceeds the magnetization scaling relationship of conventional ferromagnets. The results clearly illustrate that AFM material YMn6Sn6 is an ideal topological material for room&#8208;temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.

         <title>Balanced Interfacial Ion Concentration and Migration Steric Hindrance Promoting High&#8208;Efficiency Deposition/Dissolution Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The important influence of interfacial ion effect on aqueous zinc&#8211;manganese batteries is proposed. The interfacial ion concentration and steric hindrance in the electric double layer are comprehensively balanced from the perspective of thermodynamics and kinetics, respectively, to achieve both high specific capacity and long cycle stability simultaneously.








Abstract
The solid&#8211;liquid transition reaction lays the foundation of electrochemical energy storage systems with high capacity, but realizing high efficiency remains a challenge. Herein, in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics, this work demonstrates the significant role of both interfacial H+ concentration and Mn2+ migration steric hindrance for the high&#8208;efficiency deposition/dissolution chemistry of zinc&#8211;manganese batteries. Specially, the introduction of formate anions can buffer the generated interfacial H+ to stabilize interfacial potential according to the Nernst equation, which stimulates high capacity. Compared with acetate and propionate anions, the formate anion&#160;also provides high adsorption density on the cathode surface to shield the electrostatic repulsion due to the small spatial hindrance. Particularly for the solvated Mn2+, the formate&#8208;anion&#8208;induced lower energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step during the step&#8208;by&#8208;step desolvation process results in lower polarization and higher electrochemical reversibility. In&#160;situ tests and theoretical calculations verify that the electrolyte with formate anions achieve a good balance between ion concentration and ion&#8208;migration steric hindrance. It exhibits both the high energy density of 531.26&#160;W&#160;h&#160;kg&#8208;1&#160;and long cycle life of more than 300&#160;cycles without obvious decay.

         <title>Recent Progress in 1D Contacts for 2D&#8208;Material&#8208;Based Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals gap&#8208;free 1D contacts to 2D materials, toward their large&#8208;scale application to 2D electronic and quantum devices, are reviewed. 1D edge contacts enable low contact resistivity, scattering&#8208;free carrier transport, high&#8208;density transistor integration, and double&#8208;gate transistor operation. In addition, an outlook of the 1D contact methods is presented.








Abstract
Recent studies have intensively examined 2D materials (2DMs) as promising materials for use in future quantum devices due to their atomic thinness. However, a major limitation occurs when 2DMs are in contact with metals: a van der Waals (vdW) gap is generated at the 2DM&#8208;metal interfaces, which induces metal&#8208;induced gap states that are responsible for an uncontrollable Schottky barrier (SB), Fermi&#8208;level pinning (FLP), and high contact resistance (RC), thereby substantially lowering the electronic mobility of 2DM&#8208;based devices. Here, vdW&#8208;gap&#8208;free 1D edge contact is reviewed for use in 2D devices with substantially suppressed carrier scattering of 2DMs with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation. The 1D contact further enables uniform carrier transport across multilayered 2DM channels, high&#8208;density transistor integration independent of scaling, and the fabrication of double&#8208;gate transistors suitable for demonstrating unique quantum phenomena of 2DMs. The existing 1D contact methods are reviewed first. As a promising technology toward the large&#8208;scale production of 2D devices, seamless lateral contacts are reviewed in detail. The electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices developed via 1D contacts are subsequently discussed. Finally, the challenges regarding the reliability of 1D contacts are addressed, followed by an outlook of 1D contact methods.
