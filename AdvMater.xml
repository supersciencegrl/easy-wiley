         <title>Interfacial Engineering of MoxSy via Boron&#8208;Doping for Electrochemical N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed boron&#8208;doped molybdenum sulfide (B&#8208;Mo&#8208;MoxSy) electrocatalyst demonstrates improved N2 reduction at an onset potential of &#8722;0.15 V versus. RHE, achieving Faradaic efficiencies of 78% and an NH3 yield of 5.83 &#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in 0.05 m H2SO4(aq). The outstanding NRR performance is attributed to the phase transition of MoxSy, Mo sites, and B doping, which promotes N2 reduction to NH3.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3) through the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient temperature and pressure is emerging as an alternative approach to the conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, it remains a significant challenge due to poor kinetics, low nitrogen (N2) solubility in aqueous electrolytes, and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which can significantly impact NH3 production rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, a rationally designed boron&#8208;doped molybdenum sulfide (B&#8208;Mo&#8208;MoxSy) electrocatalyst is reported that effectively enhances N2 reduction to &#160;NH3 with an onset potential of &#8722;0.15&#160;V versus RHE, achieving a FE of 78% and an NH3 yield of 5.83&#160;&#181;g h&#8315;&#185; cm&#8315;2 in a 0.05&#160;m H2SO4(aq). Theoretical studies suggest that the effectiveness of NRR originates from electron density redistribution due to boron (B) doping, which provides an ideal pathway for nitrogenous species to bind with electron&#8208;deficient B sites. This work demonstrates a significant exploration, showing that Mo&#8208;based electrocatalysts are capable of facilitating artificial N2 fixation.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Thermally Superinsulating Polyhexahydrotriazine Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple one&#8208;step synthesis of closed&#8208;loop recyclable PHT aerogels is presented, which are made from commercially available aromatic amines and PFA. These PHT aerogels display thermal superinsulation, pronounced thermal stability, great mechanical performance, and intrinsic hydrophobicity. Furthermore, PHT aerogels can be depolymerized under acidic aqueous conditions, allowing the monomers to be reused to prepare fresh aerogels.








Abstract
Organic aerogels are an advanced class of materials renowned for their ultralow thermal conductivity and highly porous architecture, making them ideal for applications in thermal insulation, catalysis, and chemical absorption. However, these polymeric networks pose environmental concerns as their permanently crosslinked scaffold makes recycling back to the original monomers virtually impossible. To tackle this issue and develop next&#8208;generation organic aerogel, a set of polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT)&#160;aerogels specifically designed for closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling are prepared. Remarkably, these innovative materials can selectively be synthesized in a one&#8208;step condensation reaction using commercially available aromatic amines. They showcase outstanding thermally insulating performance, along with strong mechanical performance, pronounced thermal stability, and intrinsic hydrophobicity, all achieved without the need for additional modifications. More importantly, these aerogels exhibit quantitative depolymerization under acidic aqueous conditions, achieving high yields and purities of the recovered monomers. The successful preparation of fresh organic aerogels from recycled monomers with nearly identical material properties underscores the efficiency and reliability of this recycling process. The facile one&#8208;step synthesis process, combined with the high&#8208;performance properties and excellent recyclability of these PHT aerogels, accelerates the advancement of sustainable thermally superinsulating materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Multiple Microscopic Stresses Through Tunable Microcapsule Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a method for detecting localized stress variations with micrometer resolution. It utilizes embedded microcapsule arrays that fluoresce in distinct colors at specific stress thresholds. First, microfluidic synthesis creates fluorescent dye&#8208;filled microcapsules with precise stress response. Afterward, these microcapsules are organized into arrays and embedded in elastomer films via a capillary assembly process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;reporting materials have emerged as a promising tool for real&#8208;time monitoring of stress and damage in structural materials. When critical stress is applied to these materials, an optical response is triggered &#8211; for example by dye release, or molecular cleavage. A key challenge is to extend these systems to respond to multiple different stress levels. To achieve this, a novel microcapsule&#8208;based assembly strategy is presented. Microfluidic synthesis is used to create microcapsules that release dye at a precise level of applied force. Subsequently, capillary assembly is used to combine microcapsules with different stress&#8208;responsiveness and different fluorescent dyes into chains, which are uniformly patterned into regular arrays, and embed these into the self&#8208;reporting materials. Through indentation experiments, it is shown that these materials can distinguish and record spatially resolved local stresses based on the fluorescence emitted upon microcapsule rupture. Crucially, the technique's accuracy is significantly improved when microcapsules are spatially organized within the material. This versatile technique can be applied to a range of different materials, via the use of thin coatings containing the regularly patterned microcapsule chains.

         <title>Hydronium&#8208;Crosslinked Inorganic Hydrogel Comprised of 1D Lepidocrocite Titanate Nanofilaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently discovered, 1D lepidocrocite titanate nanofilaments (1DL) represent a highly scalable &#8220;truly 1D&#8221; material, featuring a cross&#8208;section 2&#160;x&#160;2 TiO6 octahedra thick. Given its extreme dimensionality, 1DL can be considered a TiO&#8208;based analog to polymeric strands and possesses unique self&#8208;assembly properties. Ion exchange with hydronium produces a crosslinked network of the first ever 1&#8208;D titanate&#8208;based, robust, biocompatible hydrogel.








Abstract
When a few drops of acid (hydrochloric, acrylic, propionic, acetic, or formic) are added to a colloid comprised of 1D lepidocrocite titanate nanofilaments (1DLs)&#8211;2 &#215; 2 TiO6 octahedra in cross&#8208;section&#8211;a hydrogel forms, in many cases, within seconds. The 1DL synthesis process requires the reaction between titanium diboride with tetramethylammonium (TMA+), hydroxide. Using quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the mass percent of TMA+ after synthesis is determined to be &#8776; 13.1&#160;&#177;&#160;0.1%. The TMA+ is completely removed from the gels after 2 water soak cycles, resulting in the first completely inorganic, TiO2&#8208;based hydrogels. Ion exchanging the TMA+ with hydronium results in gels with relatively strong hydrogen bonds. The hydrogels' compression strengths increased linearly with 1DL colloid concentration. At a 1DL concentration of 45&#160;g&#160;L&#8722;1, the compressive strength, at 80% deformation when acrylic acid is used, is &#8776;325&#160;kPa. The strengths are &#8776; 50% greater after the TMA+ is removed. The removal of all residual organic components in the hydrogels, including TMA+, is confirmed by qNMR, Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and TGA/DSC. The 1DL phase is retained after gelation, TMA+ removal, and 80% compression.

         <dc:description>
Bacterial cellulose, a type of biopolymer, demonstrates considerable potential as a raw material for the development of electrochemical energy storage devices. This review offers a comprehensive overview of bacterial cellulose, focusing on its applications in electrolytes, binders, and separators, as well as its role as a derived host for anodes and cathodes.








Abstract
Bacterial cellulose (BC) is produced via the fermentation of various microorganisms. It has an interconnected 3D porous network structure, strong water&#8208;locking ability, high mechanical strength, chemical stability, anti&#8208;shrinkage properties, renewability, biodegradability, and a low cost. BC&#8208;based materials and their derivatives have been utilized to fabricate advanced functional materials for electrochemical energy storage devices and flexible electronics. This review summarizes recent progress in the development of BC&#8208;related functional materials for electrochemical energy storage devices. The origin, components, and microstructure of BC are discussed, followed by the advantages of using BC in energy storage applications. Then, BC&#8208;related material design strategies in terms of solid electrolytes, binders, and separators, as well as BC&#8208;derived carbon nanofibers for electroactive materials are discussed. Finally, a short conclusion and outlook regarding current challenges and future research opportunities related to BC&#8208;based advanced functional materials for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices suggestions are proposed.

         <title>Ultraflexible Vertical Corbino Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Epidermal Signal Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultraflexible vertical Corbino organic electrochemical transistors with a novel 4&#8208;terminal design are successfully developed on a 1&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick parylene film. This ultraflexible device with high transconductance successfully detects epidermal bio&#8208;signals such as ECG, EMG, and EOG at a low voltage of 10 mV.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;conformal organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have attracted significant attention for real&#8208;time physiological signal monitoring and are vital for health diagnostics and treatments. However, mechanical harmonization amid the inherent dynamic nature of the skin surface and the acquisition of intrinsic physiological signals are significant challenges that hinder the integration of the ultimate skin interface. Thus, this study proposes a novel 4&#8208;terminal (4&#8208;T) vertical Corbino OECT, exhibiting high transconductance (&gt;400 mS) and offering remarkable resilience and operational stability at an extremely low voltage of 10&#160;mV (1.9% of minimal current change after 104 biasing cycles and endurance up to 103 cycles of repetitive deformation with a 5&#160;&#181;m bending radius). Consequently, ultralow&#8208;power, motion&#8208;resistant epidermal electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and electrooculogram sensors are developed with an exceptional signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 40.1&#160;dB. The results of this study present a significant stride in non&#8208;invasive, skin&#8208;interfaced health&#8208;monitoring technologies and herald a new era in integrative health technologies.

         <title>Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite for Ferroelectric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics offer structural flexibility and diverse catalytic applications by using metal nodes and organic groups as active sites. This study presents [3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium]2CuCl4 (Cu&#8208;DFCBA) as the first molecular perovskite ferroelectric catalyst for alkane oxidation. It achieves a turnover number of 2402, demonstrating a 1200&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity compared to Barium titanate (BaTiO3) under ultrasound.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelectric has gained significant attention for its structural flexibility and diversity. They can directly utilize metal nodes and organic groups as active sites in catalysis. Additionally, their ferroelectric polarization occurs around these active sites, significantly enhancing catalytic activity and demonstrating immense potential for applications. However, their catalytic applications remain underexplored. This work marks the first utilization of the molecular perovskite ferroelectric [3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium]2CuCl4 (Cu&#8208;DFCBA) as a catalyst for alkane oxidation. Under ultrasonic stimulation, it achieved a remarkable turnover number as high as 2402. Compared to inorganic ferroelectrics like lithium niobate (LiNbO3), the molecular ferroelectric exhibited a 1200&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity. This highlights Cu&#8208;DFCBA's robust ferroelectric properties and underscores the vast potential of molecular ferroelectrics in catalysis, guiding future system designs.

         <title>Augmenting Protein Degradation Capacity of PROTAC through Energy Metabolism Regulation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is presented to augment the protein degradation capability of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) by modulating external nutrient supply and employing nanocarrier&#8208;based targeted delivery. The results demonstrate that a reduction in nutrient supply can enhance protein metabolism and significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs when combined with nanocarriers.








Abstract
The ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for degrading over 70&#8211;80% of cellular proteins. Consequently, proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are developed to induce the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins of interest (POIs) by the UPS. To amplify the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs, energy metabolism regulation is first harnessed to boost UPS function in tumor cells. Proteomic and ubiquitinome analyzes reveal that total ubiquitinated proteins and proteasome activity are significantly increased in 143B and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumor cells following fasting&#8208;mimicking diet (FMD) treatment. As a result, the degradation efficiency of PROTACs targeting focal adhesion kinase (FAK&#8208;P) or bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4&#8208;P) is significantly enhanced in FMD&#8208;treated 143B and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumor cells. Then, silica&#8208;coated iron oxide nanoparticles are developed modified with tumor cell membranes for targeted delivery of PROTACs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence imaging confirm that nanocarriers significantly improve the delivery efficiency of PROTACs in FMD&#8208;treated 143B or MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumors. In vivo studies demonstrate that the antitumor efficacy of FAK&#8208;P and BRD4&#8208;P is greatly augmented when combined with targeted delivery and FMD treatment. Overall, this study presents a strategy to enhance the efficacy of PROTACs in cancer therapy.

         <title>Photoreceptor&#8208;Like Signal Transduction Between Polymer&#8208;Based Protocells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents polymer&#8208;based protocells containing light&#8208;sensitive and catalytic artificial organelles (AOs), forming a communicating protocellular system. Light&#8208;triggered substrate release from AOs in sender protocells is used to relay a signal to a receiver protocell where its conversion takes place in catalytic AOs. This system, modulated by environmental calcium, can enhance the understanding of cellular communication networks.








Abstract
Deciphering inter&#8208; and intracellular signaling pathways is pivotal for understanding the intricate communication networks that orchestrate life's dynamics. Communication models involving bottom&#8208;up construction of protocells are emerging but often lack specialized compartments sufficiently robust and hierarchically organized to perform spatiotemporally defined signaling. Here, the modular construction of communicating polymer&#8208;based protocells designed to mimic the transduction of information in retinal photoreceptors is presented. Microfluidics is used to generate polymeric protocells subcompartmentalized by specialized artificial organelles. In one protocell population, light triggers artificial organelles with membrane&#8208;embedded photoresponsive rotary molecular motors to set off a sequence of reactions starting with the release of encapsulated signaling molecules into the lumen. Intercellular communication is mediated by signal transfer across membranes to protocells containing catalytic artificial organelles as subcompartments, whose signal conversion can be modulated by environmental calcium. Signal propagation also requires selective permeability of the diverse compartments. By segregating artificial organelles in distinct protocells, a sequential chain of reactions mediating intercellular communication is created that is further modulated by adding extracellular messengers. This connective behavior offers the potential for a deeper understanding of signaling pathways and faster integration of proto&#8208; and living cells, with the unique advantage of controlling each step by bio&#8208;relevant signals.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Electron Polarons Featured InSnRuO2 Oxides: Orderly and Concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn Substructures for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>

Polymetallic oxides have extraordinary electrons/geometry structure ensembles, trimmed electron bands. Herein, well&#8208;defined rutile InSnRuO2 oxides with density&#8208;controllable oxygen vacancy (Ov) free electron polarons are firstly fabricated by in situ isomorphic substitution, using trivalent In species as Ov generators and the adjacent metal ions as electron donors to form orderly and concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn substructures in the tetravalent oxides.








Abstract
Polymetallic oxides with extraordinary electrons/geometry structure ensembles, trimmed electron bands, and way&#8208;out coordination environments, built by an isomorphic substitution strategy, may create unique contributing to concertedly catalyze water oxidation, which is of great significance for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Herein, well&#8208;defined rutile InSnRuO2 oxides with density&#8208;controllable oxygen vacancy (Ov)&#8208;free electron polarons are firstly fabricated by in situ isomorphic substitution, using trivalent In species as Ov generators and the adjacent metal ions as electron donors to form orderly and concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn substructures in the tetravalent oxides. For acidic water oxidation, the obtained InSnRuO2 displays an ultralow overpotential of 183 mV (versus RHE) and a mass activity (MA) of 103.02 A mgRu&#8722;1, respectively. For a long&#8208;term stability test of PEMWE, it can run at a low and unchangeable cell potential (1.56 V) for 200 h at 50 mA cm&#8722;2, far exceeding current IrO2||Pt/C assembly in 0.5 m H2SO4. Accelerated degradation testing results of PEMWE with pure water as the electrolyte show no significant increase in voltage even when the voltage is gradually increased from 1 to 5 A cm&#8722;2. The remarkably improved performance is associated with the concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn substructures stabilized by the dense Ov&#8208;electron polarons, which synergistically activates band structure of oxygen species and adjacent Ru sites and then boosting the oxygen evolution kinetics. More importantly, the self&#8208;trapped Ov&#8208;electron polaron induces a decrease in the entropy and enthalpy, and efficiently hinder Ru atoms leaching by increasing the lattice atom diffusion energy barrier, achieves long&#8208;term stability of the oxide. This work may open a door to design next&#8208;generation Ru&#8208;based catalysts with polarons to create orderly and asymmetric substructures as active sites for efficient electrocatalysis in PEMWE application.

A &#8220;phosphor&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic&#8221; route from the glass counterparts toward the NIR&#8208;emitting ceramic film for laser&#8208;driven NIR light source is demonstrated. The composite film with high external quantum yield (57.7%) is obtained, and a preeminent NIR output power of beyond 5 W. The electrically driven pc&#8208;LD device based on PiC delivers 1.6 W of NIR light, enabling night vision imaging over distances of up to 200 m.








Abstract
Ultrabright broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted laser diode (pc&#8208;LD) as a light source is increasingly essential for improving the sensitivity and spatial resolution of intelligent NIR spectroscopy technologies. However, the performance of NIR pc&#8208;LD is greatly hindered by the low external quantum efficiency (EQE) and poor thermal resistance of phosphor materials. Herein, a highly stable phosphor&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic (PiC) film deposited on high thermal conductivity substrate, in which the NIR&#8208;emitting Ca3MgHfGe3O12:Cr3+ phosphor is incorporated into a glass&#8208;crystallized Ca3Ga2Ge3O12 ceramic matrix, along with the formation of a new type PiC composite material with high efficiency, absorbance, and thermal conductivity, is designed and prepared. The obtained PiC exhibits an impressive EQE of 57.7%, high thermal conductivity of 17.1 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, and the PiC wheel demonstrates a broadband NIR emission exceeding 5 W when excited by a 450 nm laser. Finally, a groundbreaking electrically driven pc&#8208;LD device based on PiC achieves 1.6 W of NIR output, enabling multiple intelligent spectroscopy applications in archaeology and night vision imaging. This work paves the way for advancing broadband NIR light sources in a diverse range of photonic applications.

         <title>Vacancies Engineering in Molybdenum Boride MBene Nanosheets to Activate Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental realization of 2D Mo&#8208;vacancy molybdenum boride (Mo4/3B2) MBene nanosheets is demonstrated with intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic character by selectively etching bulk MAB phase (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2. The Mo4/3B2 nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K.








Abstract
The rapid development of low energy dissipation spintronic devices has stimulated the search for air&#8208;stable 2D nanomaterials possessing room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism. Here the experimental realization of 2D Mo4/3B2 nanosheets is reported with intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic characteristics by vacancy engineering. These nanosheets are synthesized by etching the bulk MAB phase (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2 into Mo4/3B2 nanosheets in ZnCl2 molten salt. The Mo4/3B2 nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties, with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K, while vacancy&#8208;free MoB MBene exhibits paramagnetism. It is elucidated that the Mo&#8208;vacancy defect generates large density of states near the Fermi surface and spontaneously spin&#8208;split bands through first&#8208;principles calculations, which contributes to the non&#8208;zero magnetic moment in Mo4/3B2 nanosheets. This work lays the groundwork for activating the magnetic properties of MBene nanosheets by vacancy engineering, offering the possibilities for development of practical spintronic devices.

         <title>Anomalously High Apparent Young's Modulus of Ultrathin Freestanding PZT Films Revealed by Machine Learning Empowered Nanoindentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neural network machine learning model is developed to accurately determine the Young's modulus, pretension, and thickness of freestanding films from nanoindentation force&#8211;displacement curves, with which anomalously high Young's modulus is discovered of ultrathin PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) film as large as 229.4 &#177; 12.1 GPa. The enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric effect, and the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient is estimated to be &#8776; 200 nC&#160;m&#8722;1.








Abstract
The mechanical properties at small length scales are not only significant for understanding the intriguing size&#8208;dependent behaviors but also critical for device applications. Nanoindentation via atomic force microscopy is widely used for small&#8208;scale mechanical testing, yet determining the Young's modulus of quasi&#8208;2D films from freestanding force&#8211;displacement curve of nanoindentation remains challenging, complicated by both bending and stretching that are highly nonlinear. To overcome these difficulties, a machine learning model is developed based on the back propagation (BP) neural network and finite element training to accurately determine the Young's modulus, pretension, and thickness of freestanding films from nanoindentation force&#8211;displacement curves simultaneously, improving the computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude over conventional brute force curve fitting. Using this technique, anomalously high apparent Young's modulus is discovered of 2.8&#160;nm thick PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) film as large as 229.4&#160;&#177;&#160;12.1&#160;GPa, much higher than the bulk value. The enhancement can be attributed to the strain gradient&#8208;induced flexoelectric effect, and the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient is estimated to be &#8776;200&#160;nC&#160;m&#8722;1. The method is developed to enable an artificial intelligence (AI) system to study the mechanical properties of a wide range of low&#8208;dimensional materials.

The proposed &#181;LED pixel circuit utilizes IGZO/Te CFETs, which exhibits symmetrical ambipolar behavior. The IGZO/Te heterostructure is confirmed to consist of an amorphous IGZO layer and a hexagonal Te layer using HR&#8208;TEM and GIXRD. The circuit, based on PWM, achieved 8&#8208;bit gray level control and stable &#181;LED luminance, confirming its suitability for high&#8208;quality &#181;LED displays.








Abstract
This study investigates a micro light&#8208;emitting diode (&#181;LED) pixel circuit using the heterogeneous integration of complementary field&#8208;effect transistors (CFETs). The CFETs are fabricated using a semiconductor layer composed of tellurium (Te) and indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (IGZO) layers. Te and IGZO layers in the heterostructure IGZO/Te film exhibit hexagonal and amorphous phases, respectively, indicating that each layer maintains independent material characteristics. The fabricated IGZO/Te CFETs exhibit ambipolar behavior with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.0&#160;V and field&#8208;effect mobility of 0.74 and 1.42 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type channels, respectively. Inverters comprising IGZO/Te CFET and IGZO TFT exhibit inverting behavior. A &#181;LED pixel circuit is designed using IGZO/Te CFETs based on pulse width modulation (PWM). The proposed circuit uses an inverter structure with IGZO/Te and IGZO to control the emission time, suppressing the wavelength shift of &#181;LEDs depending on the &#181;LED current levels. The operation of the proposed pixel circuit is investigated through simulation and measurement of the fabricated circuit. The fabricated &#181;LED pixel circuit successfully exhibits PWM operation, controlling the emission time and luminance. Consequently, IGZO/Te CFETs show promise as devices for high&#8208;quality &#181;LED displays.

         <title>Three&#8208;Level Chirality Transfer and Amplification in Liquid Crystal Supramolecular Assembly for Achieving Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;level chirality transfer and amplification from point chirality of small molecules to helical chirality of helical polymers and finally to supramolecular chirality of cholesteric liquid crystals consisting of chiral nonfluorescent polymers and nematic liquid crystals is constructed. Full&#8208;color and white CPL are realized via further introducing achiral fluorophores. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting security, information encryption, and chiral logic gate applications are developed.








Abstract
Chiral liquid crystal supramolecular assembly provides an ideal strategy for constructing excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. However, the chirality transfer in chiral liquid crystals normally occurs at two levels from the configurational chirality to the supramolecular phase chirality. The more precise and more levels of chirality transmission are fascinating but remain challenging. The present work reports the first success of three&#8208;level chirality transfer and amplification from configurationally point chirality of small molecules to conformationally helical chirality of helical polymers and finally to supramolecular phase chirality of cholesteric liquid crystals composed of chiral nonfluorescent polymers (P46) and nematic liquid crystals. Noticeably, the helical twisting power of P46 is five&#8208;fold larger than its monomer. Full&#8208;color and white CPL with maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor up to 1.54 and photoluminescence quantum yield up to 63.8% are realized utilizing helical supramolecular assembly combined with selective reflection mechanism. Also significantly, the electrically stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL switching device as well as anti&#8208;counterfeiting security, information encryption, and chiral logic gate applications are developed. This study deepens the understanding of chirality transfer and amplification across different hierarchical levels.

         <title>Biomimetic Structural Hydrogels Reinforced by Gradient Twisted Plywood Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural design of natural structural hydrogels in crustacean exoskeletons, this work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels with gradient twisted plywood structure. The structural hydrogels achieve an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength, modulus, and toughness, coupled with recorded high fatigue threshold, superior impact resistance, and programmable shape morphing capability.








Abstract
Naturally structural hydrogels such as crustacean exoskeletons possess a remarkable combination of seemingly contradictory properties: high strength, modulus, and toughness coupled with exceptional fatigue resistance, owing to their hierarchical structures across multiple length scales. However, replicating these unique mechanical properties in synthetic hydrogels remains a significant challenge. This work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels by employing cholesteric liquid crystal self&#8208;assembly followed by nanocrystalline engineering. The resulting hydrogels exhibit a long&#8208;range ordered gradient twisted plywood structure with high crystallinity to mimic the design of crustacean exoskeletons. Consequently, the structural hydrogels achieve an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength (46&#160;&#177;&#160;3&#160;MPa), modulus (496&#160;&#177;&#160;25&#160;MPa), and toughness (170&#160;&#177;&#160;14&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), together with recorded high fatigue threshold (32.5&#160;kJ m&#8722;2) and superior impact resistance (48&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;kJ m&#8722;1). Additionally, through controlling geometry and compositional gradients of the hierarchical structures, a programmable shape morphing process allows for the fabrication of complex 3D hydrogels. This study not only offers valuable insights into advanced design strategies applicable to a broad range of promising hierarchical materials, but also pave the ways for load&#8208;bearing applications in tissue engineering, wearable devices, and soft robotics.

         <title>Tuning Lipid Nanoparticles for RNA Delivery to Extrahepatic Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bottleneck in expanding the clinical applications of lipid nanoparticles (LNP)&#8208;based RNA therapeutics lies in the tendency of these nanoparticles to preferentially accumulate in the liver. This perspective summarizes the recent progress in developing strategies for designing LNPs to deliver RNA to extrahepatic organs and provides an outlook of shaping the next&#8208;generation LNP delivery platforms.








Abstract
RNA therapeutics have been successfully transitioned into clinical applications. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely employed as nonviral delivery vehicles for RNA therapeutics in commercial vaccine and gene therapy products. However, the bottleneck in expanding the clinical applications of LNP&#8208;based RNA therapeutics lies in the tendency of these nanoparticles to preferentially accumulate in the liver. This challenge underscores the need to design LNPs capable of delivering RNA to organs beyond the liver. In this perspective, recent progress is discussed in developing strategies for designing LNPs to deliver RNA to extrahepatic organs. Organ&#8208;selective targeting capability is achieved by either altering the composition of the LNP formulation or chemically modifying the ionizable lipid component. Both approaches result in changes in the physicochemical properties of the LNPs, which subsequently alters the composition of the biomolecular corona that adsorbs onto its surface following administration. The biomolecular corona is a known mechanism that mediates organ&#8208;selective LNP delivery. Furthermore, this perspective aims to provide an outlook on shaping the next&#8208;generation LNP delivery platforms. Potential efforts include targeting specific cell types, improving the safety profile of LNPs, and developing strategies to overcome physiological barriers against organ&#8208;specific delivery.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic water splitting has become a popular subject, and there have been increasing reports on this subject. One challenge in such a situation is reporting appropriately standardized experimental data, so that each researcher can properly understand the others&#8217; results. This paper provides basic information concerning the experimental setup, data acquisition and processing methods, and standardized denotation of photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting has become a very popular research subject in recent years. Consequently, it is important to report appropriately standardized experimental data, so that each researcher can properly understand the results generated by others. However, experimental methods and measures of photocatalytic performance are not yet sufficiently systematic. In the present manuscript, experimental procedures and standardization of photocatalytic performance are described in relation to the basic theory of photocatalytic water splitting.

         <title>Nanomechanical Crystalline AlN Resonators with High Quality Factors for Quantum Optoelectromechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;Q nanomechanical resonators enable low&#8208;noise sensing and quantum technology applications. This work realizes high&#8208;Q nanomechanical resonators in a crystalline and piezoelectric material by exploiting dissipation dilution in a tensile&#8208;strained AlN thin film. This achievement paves the way for hybrid quantum optoelectromechanical devices operating at room temperature.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality factor (Qm) mechanical resonators are crucial for applications where low noise and long coherence time are required, as mirror suspensions, quantum cavity optomechanical devices, or nanomechanical sensors. Tensile strain in the material enables the use of dissipation dilution and strain engineering techniques, which increase the mechanical quality factor. These techniques have been employed for high&#8208;Qm mechanical resonators made from amorphous materials and, recently, from crystalline materials such as InGaP, SiC, and Si. A strained crystalline film exhibiting substantial piezoelectricity expands the capability of high&#8208;Qm nanomechanical resonators to directly utilize electronic degrees of freedom. In this work, nanomechanical resonators with Qm up to 2.9 &#215; 107 made from tensile&#8208;strained 290&#8201;nm&#8208;thick AlN are realized. AlN is an epitaxially&#8208;grown crystalline material offering strong piezoelectricity. Nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution and strain engineering to reach a Qm &#215; fm&#8208;product approaching 1013 Hz at room temperature are demonstrated. A novel resonator geometry is realized, triangline, whose shape follows the Al&#8211;N bonds and offers a central pad patterned with a photonic crystal. This allows to reach an optical reflectivity above 80% for efficient coupling to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane light. The presented results pave the way for quantum optoelectromechanical devices at room temperature based on tensile&#8208;strained&#160;AlN.

         <title>Continuous Homogeneous Thin Liquid Film on a Single Cross&#8208;Shaped Profiled Fiber with High Off&#8208;Circularity: Toward Quick&#8208;Drying Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous homogeneous thin liquid film on a single fiber is achieved by using cross&#8208;shaped profiled fiber with high off&#8208;circularity. The asymmetric liquid film works synergistically with capillary effect to overcome PRI and maintains a homogeneous liquid film on a single fiber. Using such a facile strategy, quick&#8208;drying fabrics could be realized, offering new prospects for fluid coatings and functional textiles.








Abstract
Quick&#8208;drying fabrics, renowned for their rapid sweat evaporation, have witnessed various applications in strenuous exercise. Profiled fiber textiles exhibit enhanced quick&#8208;drying performance, which is attributed to the excellent wicking effect within fibrous bundles, facilitating the rapid transport of sweat. However, the evaporation process is not solely influenced by macroscopic liquid transport but also by microscopic liquid spreading on the fibers where periodic liquid knots induced by spontaneous fluidic instability significantly reduce the evaporation area. Here, a cross&#8208;shaped profiled fiber with high off&#8208;circularity, featured as multiple concavities along the fibrous longitude&#8208;axis, which enables the formation of a homogeneous thin liquid film on a single fiber without any periodic liquid knots, is developed. The high off&#8208;circularity cross&#8208;sections help overcoming Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh instability by tuning the Laplace pressure difference, further facilitated by capillary flow along the concave surface. The homogeneous thin liquid film on a single fiber is responsible for maximizing the evaporation area, resulting in excellent overall evaporation capacity. Consequently, fabrics made from such fibers exhibit rapid evaporation behavior, with evaporation rates &#8776;50% higher than those of cylindrical fabrics. It is envisioned that profiled fibers may provide inspiration for the manipulating homogeneous liquid films for applications in fluid coatings and functional textiles.

         <title>The Effect of Organic Semiconductor Electron Affinity on Preventing Parasitic Oxidation Reactions Limiting Performance of n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;type electrochemical transistors generally exhibit lower performance than their p&#8208;type analogs. The origins of the lower charge carrier mobility in electron&#8208;transporting organic semiconducting polymers are explored and observed that parasitic reactions involving ambient oxygen are a contributing factor. It is shown that a molecular design strategy to increase the polymer electron affinity successfully eliminates these reactions.








Abstract
A key challenge in the development of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting materials (OMIEC) for high performance electrochemical transistors is their stable performance in ambient. When operating in aqueous electrolyte, potential reactions of the electrochemically injected electrons with air and water could hinder their persistence, leading to a reduction in charge transport. Here, the impact of deepening the LUMO energy level of a series of electron&#8208;transporting semiconducting polymers is evaluated, and subsequently rendering the most common oxidation processes of electron polarons thermodynamically unfavorable, on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) performance. Employing time resolved spectroelectrochemistry with three analogous polymers having varying electron affinities (EA), it is found that an EA below the thermodynamic threshold for oxidation of its electron polarons by oxygen significantly improves electron transport and lifetime in air. A polymer with a sufficiently large EA and subsequent thermodynamically unfavorable oxidation of electron polarons is reported, which is used as the semiconducting layer in an OECT, in its neutral and N&#8208;DMBI doped form, resulting in an excellent and air&#8208;stable OECT performance. These results show a general design methodology to avoid detrimental parasitic reactions under ambient conditions, and the benefits that arise in electrical performance.

         <title>A Multifunctional Anisotropic Patch Manufactured by Microfluidic Manipulation for the Repair of Infarcted Myocardium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional anisotropic cardiac patch based on microfluidic manipulation is easily and rapidly prepared through microfluidic focusing, ion&#8208;photocrosslinking, and parallelly packing processes without involving complex machining and strong field stimulation. The multifunctional hydrogel patch can be a promising candidate for cardiac tissue repair and provide a new paradigm for expanding microfluidic technology to solve tissue engineering challenges.








Abstract
Engineered hydrogel patches have shown promising therapeutic effects in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI), especially anisotropic patches that mimic the characteristics of native myocardium have attracted widespread attention. However, it remains a great challenge to develop cardiac patches with long&#8208;range and orderly electrical conduction based on an effective, mild, and rapid strategy. Here, a multifunctional anisotropic cardiac patch is presented based on microfluidic manipulation. The anisotropic alginate&#8208;gelatin methacrylate hydrogel patches are easily and rapidly prepared through microfluidic focusing, ion&#8208;photocrosslinking, and parallel packing processes. The fluid&#8208;based anisotropic realization process does not involve complex machining and strong field stimulation and is compatible with the loading of macromolecular biological agents. The anisotropic hydrogel patch can mimic the anisotropy of the myocardium and guide the directional polarization of cardiomyocytes. In animal model experiments, it also exhibits significant effects in inhibiting ventricular remodeling, fibrosis, and enhancing cardiac function recovery after MI. These comprehensive features make the multifunctional hydrogel patch a promising candidate for cardiac tissue repair and future provide a new paradigm for expanding microfluidic technology to solve tissue engineering challenges.

         <title>Carrier&#8211;Carrier Repulsion Limits the Conductivity of N&#8208;Doped Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combined dependence of the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient on the carrier density shows that the electrical conductivity at high doping is limited by the repulsion of electrons by other electrons. The carrier density nx corresponding to the maximum electrical conductivity coincides with the carrier density at which the Seebeck coefficient collapses onto Heike's law.









Abstract
Molecular doping is a key strategy to enhance the electrical conductivity of organic semiconductors.

&lt;p&gt;The combined dependence of the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient on the carrier density shows that the electrical conductivity at high doping is limited by the repulsion of electrons by other electrons. The carrier density &lt;i&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; corresponding to the maximum electrical conductivity coincides with the carrier density at which the Seebeck coefficient collapses onto Heike's law.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular doping is a key strategy to enhance the electrical conductivity of organic semiconductors. Typically, the electrical conductivity shows a maximum value upon increased doping, after which the conductivity decreases. This decrease in conductivity is commonly attributed to unfavorable changes in the morphology. However, in recent simulation work, has shown, that the conductivity&#8212;at high doping&#8212;is instead limited by electron&#8211;electron repulsion rather than by morphology, at least for some material combinations. Based on the simulations, this limitation is expected to show up in the dependence of the Seebeck coefficient versus carrier density: the Seebeck coefficient will follow Heike's formula if carrier&#8211;carrier repulsion limits the conductivity. Here, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are measured as a function of doping for a series of n-type organic semiconductors. Additionally, the resulting carrier density is measured using metal-insulator-semiconductor diodes, which link dopant loading and the number of charge carriers. At high carrier densities, the Seebeck coefficient indeed follows Heike's formula, confirming that the conductivity is limited by carrier&#8211;carrier repulsion rather than by morphological effects. This study shows that current models of hopping transport in organic semiconductors may be incomplete.

         <title>Decoupled High&#8208;Mobility Graphene on Cu(111)/Sapphire via Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth via chemical vapor deposition of decoupled graphene on crystalline Cu(111) films deposited on sapphire is introduced. The resulting graphene is lying atop a thin Cu2O layer and is charge neutral, low strained, and easy to transfer. Electrical transport measurements reveal excellent room temperature carrier mobilities, exceeding 105&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 upon encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride, thus opening realistic pathways for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation applications.








Abstract
The growth of high&#8208;quality graphene on flat and rigid templates, such as metal thin films on insulating wafers, is regarded as a key enabler for technologies based on 2D materials. In this work, the growth of decoupled graphene is introduced via non&#8208;reducing low&#8208;pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) on crystalline Cu(111) films deposited on sapphire. The resulting film is atomically flat, with no detectable cracks or ripples, and lies atop of a thin Cu2O layer, as confirmed by microscopy, diffraction, and spectroscopy analyses. Post&#8208;growth treatment of the partially decoupled graphene enables full and uniform oxidation of the interface, greatly simplifying subsequent transfer processes, particularly dry&#8208;pick up &#8212; a task that proves challenging when dealing with graphene directly synthesized on metallic Cu(111). Electrical transport measurements reveal high carrier mobility at room temperature, exceeding 104&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 on SiO2/Si and 105&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 upon encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The demonstrated growth approach yields exceptional material quality, in line with micro&#8208;mechanically exfoliated graphene flakes, and thus paves the way toward large&#8208;scale production of pristine graphene suitable for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation applications.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Latticed Microneedle Array Patches for Tunable and Versatile Intradermal Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed latticed microneedle array patches (L&#8208;MAPs) have unique geometries capable of delivering both solid&#8208;state and liquid&#8208;state cargo on a single platform. This technology enables tunable delivery kinetics from the order of minutes to hours for small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. The modularity introduced by L&#8208;MAPs opens up drug delivery profiles for multiple payloads while enabling ease of administration.








Abstract
Using high&#8208;resolution 3D printing, a novel class of microneedle array patches (MAPs) is introduced, called latticed MAPs (L&#8208;MAPs). Unlike most MAPs which are composed of either solid structures or hollow needles, L&#8208;MAPs incorporate tapered struts that form hollow cells capable of trapping liquid droplets. The lattice&#160;structures can also be coated with traditional viscous coating formulations, enabling both liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;state cargo delivery, on a single patch. Here, a library of 43 L&#8208;MAP designs is generated and in&#8208;silico modeling is used to down&#8208;select optimal geometries for further characterization. Compared to traditionally molded and solid&#8208;coated MAPs, L&#8208;MAPs can load more cargo with fewer needles per patch, enhancing cargo loading and drug delivery capabilities. Further, L&#8208;MAP cargo release kinetics into the skin can be tuned based on formulation and needle geometry. In this work, the utility of L&#8208;MAPs as a platform is demonstrated for the delivery of small molecules, mRNA lipid nanoparticles, and solid&#8208;state ovalbumin protein. In addition, the production of programmable L&#8208;MAPs is demonstrated with tunable&#160;cargo release profiles, enabled by combining needle geometries on a single patch.

         <title>Concave Grain Boundaries Stabilized by Boron Segregation for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave grain boundaries in platinum nanomaterials are identified as highly active sites for the four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their unique geometric and electronic structures. The intentional segregation of boron at these grain boundaries significantly enhances their structural stability, establishing them as robust and efficient catalysts for the four&#8208;electron ORR.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a critical process that limits the efficiency of fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries due to its slow kinetics, even when catalyzed by platinum (Pt). To reduce Pt usage, enhancing both the specific activity and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of Pt catalysts is essential. Here, ultrafine, grain boundary (GB)&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticle assemblies are proposed as efficient ORR catalysts. These nanowires offer a large ECSA and a high density of concave GB sites, which improve specific activity. Atoms at these GB sites exhibit increased coordination and lattice distortion, leading to a favorable reduction in oxygen binding energy and enhanced ORR performance. Furthermore, boron segregation stabilizes these GBs, preserving active sites during catalysis. The resulting boron&#8208;stabilized Pt nanoassemblies demonstrate ORR specific and mass activities of 9.18 mA cm&#8722;2 and 6.40 A mg&#8722;1Pt (at 0.9 V vs. RHE), surpassing commercial Pt/C catalysts by over 35&#8208;fold, with minimal degradation after 60&#160;000 potential cycles. This approach offers a versatile platform for optimizing the catalytic performance of a wide range of nanoparticle systems.

         <title>Stepwise Stiffening/Softening of and Cell Recovery from Reversibly Formulated Hydrogel Interpenetrating Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials that can dynamically change stiffnesses are essential in further understanding the role of extracellular matrix mechanics. Using independently formulated and subsequently degradable interpenetrating hydrogel networks, the stiffening/softening of cell&#8208;laden matrices is reversibly and spatiotemporally triggered. Terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single&#8208;cell analysis is permitted in a near &#8220;biologically invisible&#8221; manner.








Abstract
Biomechanical contributions of the extracellular matrix underpin cell growth and proliferation, differentiation, signal transduction, and other fate decisions. As such, biomaterials whose mechanics can be spatiotemporally altered&#8208; particularly in a reversible manner&#8208; are extremely valuable for studying these mechanobiological phenomena. Herein, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;based hydrogel model consisting of two interpenetrating step&#8208;growth networks is introduced that are independently formed via largely orthogonal bioorthogonal chemistries and sequentially degraded with distinct recombinant sortases, affording reversibly tunable stiffness ranges that span healthy and diseased soft tissues (e.g., 500&#160;Pa&#8211;6&#160;kPa) alongside terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single&#8208;cell analysis in a near &#8220;biologically invisible&#8221; manner. Spatiotemporal control of gelation within the primary supporting network is achieved via mask&#8208;based and two&#8208;photon lithography; these stiffened patterned regions can be subsequently returned to the original soft state following sortase&#8208;based secondary network degradation. Using this approach, the effects of 4D&#8208;triggered network mechanical changes on human mesenchymal stem cell morphology and Hippo signaling, as well as Caco&#8208;2 colorectal cancer cell mechanomemory using transcriptomics and metabolic assays are investigated. This platform is expected to be of broad utility for studying and directing mechanobiological phenomena, patterned cell fate, and disease resolution in softer matrices.

Terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single-cell analysis is permitted in a near &#8220;biologically invisible&#8221; manner.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomechanical contributions of the extracellular matrix underpin cell growth and proliferation, differentiation, signal transduction, and other fate decisions. As such, biomaterials whose mechanics can be spatiotemporally altered- particularly in a reversible manner- are extremely valuable for studying these mechanobiological phenomena. Herein, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogel model consisting of two interpenetrating step-growth networks is introduced that are independently formed via largely orthogonal bioorthogonal chemistries and sequentially degraded with distinct recombinant sortases, affording reversibly tunable stiffness ranges that span healthy and diseased soft tissues (e.g., 500&#160;Pa&#8211;6&#160;kPa) alongside terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single-cell analysis in a near &#8220;biologically invisible&#8221; manner. Spatiotemporal control of gelation within the primary supporting network is achieved via mask-based and two-photon lithography; these stiffened patterned regions can be subsequently returned to the original soft state following sortase-based secondary network degradation. Using this approach, the effects of 4D-triggered network mechanical changes on human mesenchymal stem cell morphology and Hippo signaling, as well as Caco-2 colorectal cancer cell mechanomemory using transcriptomics and metabolic assays are investigated. This platform is expected to be of broad utility for studying and directing mechanobiological phenomena, patterned cell fate, and disease resolution in softer matrices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chain Friction and Lubrication Balanced Ultra&#8208;Tough Polyacrylates With Wide&#8208;Span Switchable Stiffness for Strain&#8208;Programmable Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneously incorporating long alkyl chains and nano&#8208;eutectics in the polymer matrix achieves polyacrylate composites with ultra&#8208;stretchability and high resilience. These properties, along with a wide&#8208;span stiffness variation triggered by the room&#8208;temperature glass transition, enable polyacrylate composites to exhibit biomimetic and time&#8208; or temperature&#8208;programmable deformations. Furthermore, polyacrylate composite artificial muscles can transform thermal energy into mechanical energy to perform work.








Abstract
Natural mollusks perform complex mechanical actions through reversible large&#8208;strain deformation and stiffness switching, which are challenging to achieve simultaneously in synthetic materials. Herein, it is shown that a set of polyacrylates designed according to a chain friction and lubrication balanced strategy shows&#160;ultra&#8208;stretchability (&#955; up to 324), high resilience (near 100% recovery at strain &#8805; 100), and wide&#8208;span stiffness switching (up to 2073 times). The typical emulsion polymerization method and casting technique are adopted to fabricate the polyacrylate films. Quaternary ammonium surfactants are used as the emulsifier and reserved in the polymer matrix to enhance the chain segment lubrication with their long alkyl group but improve the whole chain friction through the formation of nano&#8208;eutectics. These polyacrylates undergo multimodal mechanical responses, including temperature&#8208; or time&#8208;programmed deformation and load&#8208;bearing like artificial muscles. This molecular design principle and synthetic method provide a robust platform for the fabrication of ultra&#8208;tough polymers for soft robots with multiple customized functions.

         <title>Stable and Highly Emissive Infrared Yb&#8208;Doped Perovskite Quantum Cutters Engineered by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents stable, highly emissive Yb&#8208;doped perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) synthesized with zwitterionic C3&#8208;sulfobetaine ligands through a novel method. The Yb&#8208;doped NCs, optimized by machine learning, achieved an infrared photoluminescence quantum yield of 190% approaching the quantum cutting limit. They also exhibit exceptional long&#8208;term stability against heat, humidity, and light, indicating their potential for fundamental research and practical applications.








Abstract
Quantum cutting (QC) allows the conversion of high&#8208;energy photons into lower&#8208;energy photons, exhibiting great potential for infrared communications. Yb&#8208;doped perovskite nanocrystals can achieve an efficient QC process with extremely high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) thanks to the favorable Yb3+ incorporation in the perovskite structure. However, conventionally used oleic acid&#8211;oleylamine&#8208;based ligand pairs cause instability issues due to highly dynamic binding to surface states that have curbed their potential applications. Herein, zwitterionic type C3&#8208;sulfobetaine 3&#8208;(N,N&#8208;Dimethylpalmitylammonio)propanesulfonate molecule is utilized to build a strong binding state on the nanocrystals&#8217; surface through a new phosphine oxide synthesis route. Leveraging machine learning and Bayesian Optimization workflow to determine optimal synthesis conditions, near&#8208;infrared PLQY above 190% is achieved. The high PLQY is well maintained after over three months of aging, under high&#8208;flux continuous UV irradiation, and long continuous annealing. This is the first report of highly efficient and stable perovskite quantum cutters, which will drive the study of fundamental physics phenomena and near&#8208;infrared quantum communications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Interfacial Layer Enabled by Gating&#8208;Shielding Effects for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stable Zn metal anode with beyond 9000&#160;h cycling lifespan is developed by introducing trace D&#8208;pantothenate calcium as electrolyte additives. The additives enable dual&#8208;functional interfacial layer with a gating effect from pantothenate molecular layer for switching off active water while selectively transporting target Zn2+, and a dynamically electrostatic shielding effect from Ca2+ cations for suppressing dendrites and side reactions.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale application of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety and environment&#8208;compatible aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs) is hindered by Zn dendrite failure and side reactions. Herein, highly reversible ZMBs are obtained by addition of trace D&#8208;pantothenate calcium additives to engineer a dual&#8208;functional interfacial layer, which is enabled by a bioinspired gating effect for excluding competitive free water near Zn surface due to the trapping and immobilization of water by hydroxyl groups, and guiding target Zn2+ transport across interface through carboxyl groups of pantothenate anions, as well as a dynamic electrostatic shielding effect around Zn protuberances from Ca2+ cations to ensure uniform Zn2+ deposition. In consequence, interfacial side reactions are perfectly inhibited owing to reduced water molecules reaching Zn surface, and the uniform and compact deposition of Zn2+ is achieved due to promoted Zn2+ transport and deposition kinetics. The ultra&#8208;stable symmetric cells with beyond 9000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 0.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and over 5000&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, are amazingly realized. The regulated&#8208;electrolyte demonstrates high compatibility with verified cathodes for stable full cells. This work opens a brand&#8208;new pathway to regulate Zn/electrolyte interface to promise reversible ZMBs.

         <title>Supercapacitively Liquid&#8208;Solid Dual&#8208;State Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supercapacitively dual&#8208;state phototransistor is developed with microporous liquid&#8208;solid interface. A supercapacitively photogating effect greatly enhances responsivity up to 4.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, and realizes high&#8208;contrast scotopic neuromorphic imaging, holding promise for constructing optoelectronic systems with performance beyond conventional solid&#8208;state optoelectronics.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;transduction of solid&#8208;state optoelectronics occurs in semiconductors or their interfaces. Considering the confined active area and interfacial capacitance of solid&#8208;state materials, solid&#8208;state optoelectronics faces inherent limitations in photo&#8208;transduction, especially for bionic vision, and the performance is lower than that of living systems. For example, a photoreceptor generates pA&#8208;level photocurrent when absorbing a single photon. Here, a liquid&#8208;solid dual&#8208;state phototransistor is demonstrated, in which photo&#8208;transduction and modulation take place at the microporous interface between semiconductors and water, mimicking principles of the photoreceptor. When operating in the water, an orderly stacked photo&#8208;harvesting covalent organic framework layer generates supercapacitively photogating modulation of the channel conductivity via a dual&#8208;state interface, achieving responsivity of 4.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010 A&#160;W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 1.62&#160;&#215;&#160;1016 Jones at room temperature, several orders of magnitude higher than other photodetectors. Such bio&#8208;inspired dual&#8208;state optoelectronics enables high&#8208;contrast scotopic neuromorphic imaging with responsivity greater than photoreceptors, holding promise for constructing optoelectronic systems with performance beyond conventional solid&#8208;state optoelectronics.

When operating in the water, an orderly stacked photo-harvesting covalent organic framework layer generates supercapacitively photogating modulation of the channel conductivity via a dual-state interface, achieving responsivity of 4.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and detectivity of 1.62&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at room temperature, several orders of magnitude higher than other photodetectors. Such bio-inspired dual-state optoelectronics enables high-contrast scotopic neuromorphic imaging with responsivity greater than photoreceptors, holding promise for constructing optoelectronic systems with performance beyond conventional solid-state optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Ordering in Ultrasmall Multicomponent Chalcogenides: The Case of Quaternary Cu&#8208;Zn&#8208;In&#8208;Se Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study of ultrasmall quaternary chalcogenide nanocrystals is presented and a correlation between their composition, structural ordering, and optical properties is established. The work starts from the synthesis of Cu&#8208;Zn&#8208;In&#8208;Se nanocrystals, followed by multipronged characterization of their structural and optical properties, and supported by theory calculation approaches. It is concluded that Copper atoms and cationic vacancies work in pairs to emit light from the I&#8208;III&#8208;VI group nanocrystals.








Abstract
The compositional tunability of non&#8208;isovalent multicomponent chalcogenide thin films and the extent of atomic ordering of their crystal structure is key to the performance of many modern technologies. In contrast, the effects of ordering are rarely studied for quantum&#8208;confined materials, such as colloidal nanocrystals. In this paper, the possibilities around composition tunability and atomic ordering are explored in ultrasmall ternary and quaternary quantum dots, taking I&#8208;III&#8208;VI&#8208;group Cu&#8208;Zn&#8208;In&#8208;Se semiconductor as a case study. A quantitative synthesis for 3.3&#160;nm quaternary chalcogenide nanocrystals is developed and shown that cation and cationic vacancy ordering can be achieved in these systems consisting of only 100s of atoms. Combining experiment and theoretical calculations, the relationship between structural ordering and optical properties of the materials are demonstrated. It is found that the arrangement and ordering of cationic sublattice plays an important role in the luminescent efficiency. Specifically, the concentration of Cu&#8208;vacancy couples in the nanocrystal correlates with luminescence quantum yield, while structure ordering increases the occurrence of such optically active Cu&#8208;vacancy units. On the flip side, the detrimental impact of cationic site disorder in I&#8208;III&#8208;VI nanocrystals can be mitigated by introducing a cation of intermediate valence, such as Zn (II).

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Zinc Anode Enabled by a Recyclable Biomass Bamboo Membrane Separator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomass bamboo membrane separator with oxygen functional groups is proposed for dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes. Benefitting from the restrained activity of water molecules and anions, as well as the unique structure of the bamboo membrane, this separator enables Zn electrode to work at high capacity and current density with satisfying coulombic efficiency and lifespan.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries have gained attention as viable energy storage systems, yet the occurrence of detrimental side reactions and Zn dendrite formation undermines the efficiency of Zn anodes. Controlling water activity have proven to be an effective strategy in mitigating these challenges. However, strategies such as electrolyte design and electrode protection layer show weakness to varying degrees. Here, a new oxygen&#8208;functionalized biomass bamboo membrane separator (denoted as BM) is proposed to restrain the activity of water molecules. This BM separator features a unique, multi&#8208;tiered 2D interlayer that facilitates rapid ion diffusion. Additionally, the oxygen functional groups of the BM separator can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, effectively transforming water molecules from a free state to a bound state. Consequently, the Zn/Zn asymmetric coin cell using BM can work at the ultrahigh rate and capacity of 30 mA cm&#8722;2 and 30&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 for more than 80&#160;h while its counterparts using glass fiber&#160;can barely work. Moreover, full cells using BM separator exhibited a capacity retention of 89.7% after 1000 cycles at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This study reveals the important influence of water&#8208;limited activity on Zn anode protection and provides an avenue for the design of novel separator.

         <title>Squid&#8208;Inspired Anti&#8208;Salt Skin&#8208;Like Elastomers With Superhigh Damage Resistance for Aquatic Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of reflectin proteins in cephalopod skins, the introduction of cation&#8208;&#960; interaction into polyurethane constructs a skin&#8208;like elastomer with extraordinary damage resistance properties (103.7 &#177; 45.7 kJ m&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term anti&#8208;salt&#160;performance. The combined advantages render the present elastomer highly promising for aquatic applications, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by sweat, in vivo, and&#160;harsh oceanic environments.








Abstract
Cephalopod skins evolve multiple functions in response to environmental adaptation, encompassing nonlinear mechanoreponse, damage tolerance property, and resistance to seawater. Despite tremendous progress in skin&#8208;mimicking materials, the integration of these desirable properties into a single material system remains an ongoing challenge. Here, drawing inspiration from the structure of reflectin proteins in cephalopod skins, a long&#8208;term anti&#8208;salt elastomer with skin&#8208;like nonlinear mechanical properties and extraordinary damage resistance properties is presented. Cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is incorporated to induce the geometrically confined nanophases of hydrogen bond domains, resulting in elastomers with exceptional true tensile strength (456.5 &#177; 68.9&#160;MPa) and unprecedently high fracture energy (103.7 &#177; 45.7&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Furthermore, the cation&#8208;&#960; interaction effectively protects the hydrogen bond domains from corrosion by high&#8208;concentration saline solution. The utilization of the resultant skin&#8208;like elastomer has been demonstrated by aquatic soft robotics capable of grasping sharp objects. The combined advantages render the present elastomer highly promising for salt enviroment applications, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by sweat, in vivo, and harsh oceanic environments.

         <title>Toughening and Imparting Deconstructability to 3D&#8208;Printed Glassy Thermosets with &#8220;Transferinker&#8221; Additives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transferinkers are cross&#8208;linkers capable of undergoing degenerative chain transfer and new strand growth. Incorporating transferinkers into 3D printable photopolymer resins leads to improved tensile toughness and triggered chemical deconstructability. These properties result from a transferinker&#8208;driven topological transition in network structure into one that can more effectively bear stress yet is also more easily depercolated via solvolysis.








Abstract
Thermoset toughness and deconstructability are often opposing features; simultaneously improving both without sacrificing other mechanical properties (e.g., stiffness and tensile strength) is difficult, but, if achieved, could enhance the usage lifetime and end&#8208;of&#8208;life options for these materials. Here, a strategy that addresses this challenge in the context of photopolymer resins commonly used for 3D printing of glassy, acrylic thermosets is introduced. It is shown that incorporating bis&#8208;acrylate &#8220;transferinkers,&#8221; which are cross&#8208;linkers capable of undergoing degenerative chain transfer and new strand growth, as additives (5&#8211;25 mol%) into homemade or commercially available photopolymer resins leads to photopolymer thermosets with substantially improved tensile toughness and triggered chemical deconstructability with minimal impacts on Young's moduli, tensile strengths, and glass transition temperatures. These properties result from a transferinker&#8208;driven topological transition in network structure from the densely cross&#8208;linked long, heterogeneous primary strands of traditional photopolymer networks to more uniform, star&#8208;like networks with few dangling ends; the latter structure more effectively bear stress yet is also more easily depercolated via solvolysis. Thus, transferinkers represent a simple and effective strategy for improving the mechanical properties of photopolymer thermosets and providing a mechanism for their triggered deconstructability.

         <title>Engineered Regenerative Isolated Peripheral Nerve Interface for Targeted Reinnervation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered regenerative isolated peripheral nerve interface (eRIPEN) is developed using 3D bioprinting of myoblasts and skeletal&#8208;muscle&#8208;derived decellularized extracellular matrix bioink, along with direct electrospinning to create a nanofiber membrane envelope for in vivo host nerve implantation. After regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) surgery, the eRIPEN demonstrates long&#8208;term contractility for skeletal muscle tissue and positive effect on pain alleviation through innervation.








Abstract
A regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) offers a therapeutic solution for nerve injury through reconstruction of the target muscle. However, implanting a transected peripheral nerve into an autologous skeletal muscle graft in RPNI causes donor&#8208;site morbidity, highlighting the need for tissue&#8208;engineered skeletal muscle constructs. Here, an engineered regenerative isolated peripheral nerve interface (eRIPEN) is developed using 3D skeletal cell printing combined with direct electrospinning to create a nanofiber membrane envelop for host nerve implantation. In this in vivo study, after over 8 months of RPNI surgery, the eRIPEN exhibits a minimum Feret diameter of 15&#8211;20&#160;&#181;m with a cross&#8208;sectional area of 100&#8211;500 &#181;m2, representing the largest distribution of myofibers. Furthermore, neuromuscular junction formation and muscle contraction with a force of &#8776;28 N are observed. Notably, the decreased hypersensitivity to mechanical/thermal stimuli and an improved tibial functional index from &#8722;77 to &#8722;56 are found in the eRIPEN group. The present novel concept of eRIPEN paves the way for the utilization and application of tissue&#8208;engineered constructs in RPNI, ultimately realizing neuroprosthesis control through synaptic connections.

         <title>Bidirectional Vectorial Holography Using Bi&#8208;Layer Metasurfaces and Its Application to Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material&#160;systems with direction&#8208;asymmetric transport properties are scientifically intrguing with various potential applications. This study presents optical bi&#8208;layer metasurfaces that achieve generalized asymmetric transmission for any input polarization. Experimental results demonstrate polarization&#8208;direction&#8208;multiplexed vectorial holograms, enabling advanced optical encryption and paving the way for future applications in optical computation, sensing, and imaging.








Abstract
The field of optical systems with asymmetric responses has grown significantly due to their various potential applications. Janus metasurfaces are noteworthy for their ability to control light asymmetrically at the pixel level within thin films. However, previous demonstrations are restricted to the partial control of asymmetric transmission for a limited set of input polarizations, focusing primarily on scalar functionalities. Here, optical bi&#8208;layer metasurfaces that achieve a fully generalized form of asymmetric transmission for any input polarization are presented. The designs owe much to the theoretical model of asymmetric transmission in reciprocal systems, which elucidates the relationship between front&#8208; and back&#8208;side Jones matrices in general cases. This model reveals a fundamental correlation between the polarization&#8208;direction channels of opposing sides. To circumvent this constraint, partitioning the transmission space is utilized&#160;to realize four distinct vector functionalities within the target volume. As a proof of concept, polarization&#8208;direction&#8208;multiplexed Janus vectorial holograms generating four vectorial holographic images are experimentally demonstrated. When integrated with computational vector polarizer arrays, this approach enables optical encryption with a high level of obscurity. The proposed&#160;mathematical framework and novel material systems for generalized asymmetric transmission may pave the way for applications such as optical computation, sensing, and imaging.

         <title>Atomic Confinement Empowered CoZn Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanotubes for H2O2 Production in Sequential Dual&#8208;Cathode Electro&#8208;Fenton Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed catalyst with CoZn heteronuclear dual&#8208;metal species confined in defect&#8208;rich N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) is synthesized for driving highly&#8208;selective two&#8208;electron ORR to H2O2 over the entire pH range and direct conversion to solid products for storage/transportation, as well as sequential activation via a regent&#8208;free sequential dual&#8208;cathode electro&#8208;Fenton process for pollutant degradation and detoxification.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are flourishing in various fields because of their 100% atomic utilization. However, their uncontrollable selectivity, poor stability and vulnerable inactivation remain critical challenges. According to theoretical predictions and experiments, a heteronuclear CoZn dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom confined in N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) is synthesized via spatial confinement growth. CoZnSA@CNTs exhibit superior performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis over the entire pH range due to dual&#8208;confinement of atomic sites and O2 molecule. CoZnSA@CNTs is favorable for H2O2 production mainly because the synergy of adjacent atomic sites, defect&#8208;rich feature and nanotube reactor promoted O2 enrichment and enhanced H2O2 reactivity/selectivity. The H2O2 selectivity reaches &#8764;100% in a range of 0.2&#8211;0.65&#160;V versus RHE and the yield achieves 7.50&#160;M gcat&#8722;1 with CoZnSA@CNTs/carbon fiber felt, exceeding most of the reported SACs in H&#8208;type cells. The obtained H2O2 is converted directly to sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate in a safe way for H2O2 storage/transportation. The sequential dual&#8208;cathode electron&#8208;Fenton process promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species (&#8226;OH, 1O2 and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by activating the generated H2O2, enabling accelerated degradation of various pollutants and Cr(VI) detoxification in actual wastewater. This work proposes a promising confinement strategy for catalyst design and selectivity regulation of complex reactions.

         <title>Polyfunctional and Multisensory Bio&#8208;Ionoelastomers Enabled by Covalent Adaptive Networks With Hierarchically Dynamic Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With dynamic covalent and supramolecular design, a bio&#8208;ionoelastomer featuring covalent adaptive networks with hierarchically dynamic bonding is obtained via melt building approach. The multifunction and multisensory capability endow the bio&#8208;ionoelastomer with comprehensive roadmap toward soft ionotronic devices in the field of remotely monitoring, diagnosing multi&#8208;metric, and complex physiological information.








Abstract
Developing versatile ionoelastomers, the alternatives to hydrogels and ionogels, will boost the advancement of high&#8208;performance ionotronic devices. However, meeting the requirements of bio&#8208;derivation, high toughness, high stretchability, autonomous self&#8208;healing ability, high ionic conductivity, reprocessing, and favorable recyclability in a single ionoelastomer remains a challenging endeavor. Herein, a dynamic covalent and supramolecular design, lipoic acid (LA)&#8208;based dynamic covalent ionoelastomer (DCIE), is proposed via melt building covalent adaptive networks with hierarchically dynamic bonding (CAN&#8208;HDB), wherein lithium bonds aid in the dissociation of ions and the integration of dynamic disulfide metathesis, lithium bonds, and binary hydrogen bonds enhances the mechanical performances, self&#8208;healing capability, reprocessing, and recyclability. Therefore, the trade&#8208;off among mechanical versatility, ionic conductivity, self&#8208;healing capability, reprocessing, and recyclability is successfully handled. The obtained DCIE demonstrates remarkable stretchability (1011.7%), high toughness (3877&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), high ionic conductivity (3.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), outstanding self&#8208;healing capability, reprocessing for 3D printing, and desirable recyclability. Significantly, the selective ion transport endows the DCIE with multisensory feature capable of generating continuous electrical signals for high&#8208;quality sensations towards temperature, humidity, and strain. Coupled with the straightforward methodology, abundant availability of LA and HPC, as well as multifunction, the DCIEs present new concept of advanced ionic conductors for developing soft ionotronics.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Optically Configurable Synaptic Transistors With Cluster&#8208;Induced Photoactive Dielectric Layer for Visual Simulation and Biomotor Stimuli</title>

         <dc:description>
Insulating poly (1,8&#8208;octanediol&#8208;co&#8208;citrate (POC)) with clusterization&#8208;triggered photoactive can be employed as dielectric layer to develop electro&#8208;optically configurable transistors. By enhancing photoactivity of POC layer after 200&#160;&#176;C annealing, devices realize multiwavelength optical synaptic memory properties exceeding 3&#8208;bits. The optical synaptic plasticity, biologically degradable dielectrics, and motion&#8208;activation functions within a single device open new avenues at the intersection of optoelectronics and bioengineering.








Abstract
The integration of visual simulation and biorehabilitation devices promises great applications for sustainable electronics, on&#8208;demand integration and neuroscience. However, achieving a multifunctional synergistic biomimetic system with tunable optoelectronic properties at the individual device level remains a challenge. Here, an electro&#8208;optically configurable transistor employing conjugated&#8208;polymer as semiconductor layer and an insulating polymer (poly(1,8&#8208;octanediol&#8208;co&#8208;citrate) (POC)) with clusterization&#8208;triggered photoactive properties as dielectric layer is shown. These devices realize adeptly transition from electrical to optical synapses, featuring multiwavelength and multilevel optical synaptic memory properties exceeding 3 bits. Utilizing enhanced optical memory, the images learning and memory function for visual simulation are achieved. Benefiting from rapid electrical response akin to biological muscle activation, increased actuation occurs under increased stimulus frequency of gate voltage. Additionally, the transistor on POC substrate can be effectively degraded in NaOH solution due to degradation of POC. Pioneeringly, the electro&#8208;optically configurability stems from light absorption and photoluminescence of the aggregation cluster in POC layer after 200&#160;&#176;C annealing. The enhancement of optical synaptic plasticity and integration of motion&#8208;activation functions within a single device opens new avenues at the intersection of optoelectronics, synaptic computing, and bioengineering.

         <title>A High&#8208;Rate and Ultrastable Re2Te5/MXene Anode for Potassium Storage Enabled by Amorphous/Crystalline Heterointerface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterointerface engineering strategy is proposed to prepare a novel superstructure composed of amorphous/crystalline Re2Te5 strongly anchored on MXene substrate (A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene) for fast and stable potassium storage performance. The engineered A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene anode demonstrates high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability, and superb cyclability, as well as reliable operation in flexible potassium ion full cell.








Abstract
The pursuit of anode materials capable of rapid and reversible potassium storage performance is a challenging yet fascinating target. Herein, a heterointerface engineering strategy is proposed to prepare a novel superstructure composed of amorphous/crystalline Re2Te5 anchored on MXene substrate (A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene) as an advanced anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs). The A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene anode exhibits outstanding reversible capacity (350.4 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (162.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1), remarkable long&#8208;term cycling capability (186.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 over 5000 cycles), and reliable operation in flexible full KIBs, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal chalcogenides&#8208;based devices. Experimental and theoretical investigations attribute this high performance to the synergistic effect of the A/C&#8208;Re2Te5 with a built&#8208;in electric field and the elastic MXene, enabling improved pseudocapacitive contribution, accelerated charge transfer behavior, and high K+ ion adsorption/diffusion ability. Meanwhile, a combination of intercalation and conversion reactions mechanism is observed within A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene. This work offers a new approach for developing metal tellurides&#8208; and MXene&#8208;based anodes for achieving stable cyclability and fast&#8208;charging KIBs.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Nano&#8208;Antibiotics Enhanced Survival in Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Escherichia coli Sepsis by Precise Periplasmic EcDsbA Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise targeting of potential targets in bacterial periplasm is significant for the development of new antibacterial drugs. A class of heterogenization&#8208;phase&#8208;separated nano&#8208;antibiotics is developed to overcome multidrug resistance by targeting DsbA. Its cross&#8208;bacterial outer membrane barriers, triggers deformation in situ to inhibit DsbA activity. It further inhibits &#946;&#8208;lactamase activity, thereby restoring antibiotic sensitivity to kill bacteria.








Abstract
Disulfide bond (Dsb) proteins, especially DsbA, represent a promising but as&#8208;yet&#8208;unrealized target in combating multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria because their precise subcellular targeting through multibarrier remains a significant challenge. Here, a novel heterogenization&#8208;phase&#8208;separated nano&#8208;antibiotics (NCefoTs) is proposed, through the co&#8208;assembly of enzyme&#8208;inhibiting lipopeptides (ELp component), membrane&#8208;recognizing and disrupting lipopeptides (MLp component), and cefoperazone. The self&#8208;sorting components of MLp&#160;&#8220;concentrated island&#8208;liked clusters&#8221;&#160;on the surface of NCefoTs promote the efficient penetration of NCefoTs through the outer membrane. Triggered by the DsbA, the precisely spatiotemporal engineered NCefoTs transform to nanofibers in&#160;situ and further significantly enhance the inhibition of DsbA. The hydrolytic activity of &#946;&#8208;lactamase and the motility function of flagella are thereby impeded, confirming the efficacy of NCefoTs in restoring susceptibility to antibiotics and inhibiting infection dissemination. By these synergistic effects of NCefoTs, the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics&#160;decreases from over 300 &#181;M to 1.56 &#181;M for clinically isolated E. coli MDR. The survival rate of sepsis&#8208;inflicted mice is significantly enhanced from 0% to 92% upon encapsulation of cefoperazone in NCefoTs, which rapidly eliminates invading pathogens and mitigates inflammation. The universally applicable delivery system, based on an &#8220;on demands&#8221; strategy, presents a promising prospect for undruggable antibiotic targets in the periplasm to combat MDR bacteria.

         <title>Open&#8208;Source Throttling of CD8+ T Cells in Brain with Low&#8208;Intensity Focused Ultrasound&#8208;Guided Sequential Delivery of CXCL10, IL&#8208;2, and aPD&#8208;L1 for Glioblastoma Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An &#8220;open&#8208;source throttling&#8221; strategy for CD8+ T cells aims to enhance immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM). Low&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) guids the sequential delivery of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) to recruit CD8+ T cells and interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) to reduce T cell exhaustion (Tex), offering a promising strategy for brain tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Improving clinical immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM) relies on addressing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Enhancing CD8+ T cell infiltration and preventing its exhaustion holds promise for effective GBM immunotherapy. Here, a low&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)&#8208;guided sequential delivery strategy is developed to enhance CD8+ T cells infiltration and activity in the GBM region. The sequential delivery of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) to recruit CD8+ T cells and interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) to reduce their exhaustion is termed an &#8220;open&#8208;source throttling&#8221; strategy. Consequently, up to 3.39&#8208;fold of CD8+ T cells are observed with LIFU&#8208;guided sequential delivery of CXCL10, IL&#8208;2, and anti&#8208;programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (aPD&#8208;L1), compared to the free aPD&#8208;L1 group. The immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapeutic efficacy is substantially enhanced by the reversed immunosuppressive TME due to the expansion of CD8+ T cells, resulting in the elimination of tumor, prolonged survival time, and long&#8208;term immune memory establishment in orthotopic GBM mice. Overall, LIFU&#8208;guided sequential cytokine and ICIs delivery offers an &#8220;open&#8208;source throttling&#8221; strategy of CD8+ T cells, which may present a promising strategy for brain&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

The sequential delivery of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) to recruit CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) to reduce their exhaustion is termed an &#8220;open-source throttling&#8221; strategy. Consequently, up to 3.39-fold of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are observed with LIFU-guided sequential delivery of CXCL10, IL-2, and anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (aPD-L1), compared to the free aPD-L1 group. The immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapeutic efficacy is substantially enhanced by the reversed immunosuppressive TME due to the expansion of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, resulting in the elimination of tumor, prolonged survival time, and long-term immune memory establishment in orthotopic GBM mice. Overall, LIFU-guided sequential cytokine and ICIs delivery offers an &#8220;open-source throttling&#8221; strategy of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, which may present a promising strategy for brain-tumor immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic&#8208;Microbial Biohybrid for Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrochemical&#8208;microbial biohybrid is proposed with Azotobacter Vinelandii (A. Vinelandii) interfaced directly on polydopamine encapsulated nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheets (NiO@PDA) for artificial N2 fixation. The rationally designed biohybrid of NiO@PDA/A. Vinelandii biohybrid achieves a record&#8208;high NH3 production yield of 4.14 &#181;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2.








Abstract
Nitrogen (N2) conversion to ammonia (NH3) in a mild condition is a big chemical challenge. The whole&#8208;cell diazotrophs based biological NH3 synthesis is one of the most promising strategies. Herein, the first attempt of photoelectrochemical&#8208;microbial (PEC&#8208;MB) biohybrid is contributed for artificial N2 fixation, where Azotobacter vinelandii (A. vinelandii) is interfaced directly with polydopamine encapsulated nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheets (NiO@PDA). By virtue of excellent bio&#8208;adhesive activity, high conductivity, and good biocompatibility of PDA layer, abundant A. vinelandii are effectively adsorbed on NiO@PDA to form NiO@PDA/A. vinelandii biohybrid, and the rationally designed biohybrid achieved a record&#8208;high NH3 production yield of 1.85&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1/108 cells (4.14&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2). In addition, this biohybrid can operate both under illumination with a PEC model or in dark with an electrocatalytic (EC) model to implement long&#8208;term and successional NH3 synthesis. The enhancement mechanism of NH3 synthesis in NiO@PDA/A. vinelandii biohybrid can be ascribed to the increase of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&#8208;hydrogen (NADH) and adenosine 5&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) concentrations and over expression of nitrogen&#8208;fixing genes of nifH, nifD and nifK in nitrogenase. This innovative PEC&#8208;MB biohybrid strategy sheds light on the fundamental mechanism and establishes proof of concept of biotic&#8208;abiotic photosynthetic systems for sustainable chemical production.

         <title>Coacervation&#8208;Driven Semipermeable Nanoreactors for Enzymatic Cascade&#8208;Mediated Cancer Combination Therapy with Enhanced Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, a novel type of lactobionic acid&#8208;modified tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte complex vesicle nanoreactors driven by coacervation, targeting hepatic cancer for delivery of enzyme drugs and sorafenib, which promotes cancer cell ferroptosis and apoptosis, is prepared. This approach not only curbes tumor growth but also activates immune responses, presenting a potent, multipronged cancer therapy strategy.








Abstract
Utilizing enzyme cascades as a promising approach for targeted cancer therapies holds significant potential, yet its clinical effectiveness is substantially hindered by functional losses during delivery. Complex coacervation emerges as an intriguing strategy for designing functional nanoreactors. In this study, a noteworthy achievement is presented in the development of lactobionic acid&#8208;modified tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte complex vesicles (HGS&#8208;PCVs) based on bioinspired homopolypeptoids, which serve as a facile, intelligent, and highly efficient nanoreactor tunable for glucose oxidase, hemoglobin,&#160;and sorafenib (SRF) to hepatic cancer cells. The TME&#8208;responsive permeability of HGS&#8208;PCVs enables the selective entry of glucose into their interior, triggering an enzymatic cascade reaction within the tumor. This intricate process generates toxic hydroxyl radicals while concurrently lowering the pH. Consequently, this pH shift enhances the SRF release, effectively promoting ferroptosis and apoptosis in the target cancer cells. Further, the administration of the HGS&#8208;PCVs not only initiates immunogenic cell death but also plays a crucial role in inducing the maturation of dendritic cells within lymph nodes. It stimulates an adaptive T&#8208;cell response, a crucial mechanism that contributes to impeding the growth of distant tumors in vivo, demonstrating the promising potential of PCVs for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Weakening the Space Charge Layer Effect Through Tethered Anion Electrolyte and Piezoelectric Effect Toward Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the space charge layer dilemma, a physical (PbTiO3)/chemical (AMPS&#8208;Zn) barrier is designed to construct stable zinc ion flow and disrupt the gradient of anion concentration by coupling the ferroelectric effect with tethered anion electrolyte. Through numerical simulations and analyses, it is discovered that a high Zn2+ transference number can effectively weaken the SCL.








Abstract
The space charge layer (SCL) dilemma, caused by mobile anion concentration gradient and the rapid consumption of cations, is the fundamental reason for the generation of zinc dendrites, especially under high&#8208;rate discharge conditions. To address the issue, a physical (PbTiO3)/chemical (AMPS&#8208;Zn) barrier is designed to construct stable zinc ion flow and disrupt the gradient of anion concentration by coupling the ferroelectric effect with tethered anion electrolyte. The ferroelectric materials PbTiO3 with extreme&#8208;high piezoelectric constant can spontaneously generate an internal electric field to accelerate the movement of zinc ions, and the polyanionic polymer AMPS&#8208;Zn can repel mobile anions and disrupt the anions concentration gradient by tethering anions. Through numerical simulations and analyses, it is discovered that a high Zn2+ transference number can effectively weaken the SCL, thus suppressing the occurrence of zinc dendrites and parasitic side reactions. Consequently, an asymmetric cell using the PbTiO3@Zn demonstrates a reversible plating/stripping performance for 2900&#160;h, and an asymmetric cell reaches a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art runtime of 3450&#160;h with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98%. Furthermore, the PbTiO3@Zn/I2 battery demonstrated an impressive capacity retention rate of 84.0% over 65000 cycles by employing a slender Zn anode.

         <title>A Recyclable Ionogel with High Mechanical Robustness Based on Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contradictory requirements of recyclability and robustness of ionogels are resolved by incorporating covalent adaptable networks (CANs), resulting in a closed&#8208;loop recyclable, elastic, tough, durable, and solvent&#8208;resistant ionogel. This ionogel demonstrates robust strain sensing performance under harsh mechanical conditions and is applied for reconfigurable multimodal sensing due to its recyclability.








Abstract
Ionogels are an emerging class of soft materials for flexible electronics, with high ionic conductivity, low volatility, and mechanical stretchability. Recyclable ionogels are recently developed to address the sustainability crisis of current electronics, through the introduction of non&#8208;covalent bonds. However, this strategy sacrifices mechanical robustness and chemical stability, severely diminishing the potential for practical application. Here, covalent adaptable networks (CANs) are incorporated into ionogels, where dynamic covalent crosslinks endow high strength (11.3&#160;MPa tensile strength), stretchability (2396% elongation at break), elasticity (energy loss coefficient of 0.055 at 100% strain), and durability (5000 cycles of 150% strain). The reversible nature of CANs allows the ionogel to be closed&#8208;loop recyclable for up to ten times. Additionally, the ionogel is toughened by physical crosslinks between conducting ions and polymer networks, breaking the common dilemma in enhancing mechanical properties and electrical conductivity. The ionogel demonstrates robust strain sensing performance under harsh mechanical treatments and is applied for reconfigurable multimodal sensing based on its recyclability. This study provides insights into improving the mechanical and electrical properties of ionogels toward functionally reliable and environmentally sustainable bioelectronics.

Here, covalent adaptable networks (CANs) are incorporated into ionogels, where dynamic covalent crosslinks endow high strength (11.3&#160;MPa tensile strength), stretchability (2396% elongation at break), elasticity (energy loss coefficient of 0.055 at 100% strain), and durability (5000 cycles of 150% strain). The reversible nature of CANs allows the ionogel to be closed-loop recyclable for up to ten times. Additionally, the ionogel is toughened by physical crosslinks between conducting ions and polymer networks, breaking the common dilemma in enhancing mechanical properties and electrical conductivity. The ionogel demonstrates robust strain sensing performance under harsh mechanical treatments and is applied for reconfigurable multimodal sensing based on its recyclability. This study provides insights into improving the mechanical and electrical properties of ionogels toward functionally reliable and environmentally sustainable bioelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling Contact&#8208;Electrification Effect on Interfacial Water Oscillation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydration layers near solid surfaces are essential in physicochemical reactions. Contact electrification can alter the hydration layer structure through electrostatic interactions. The oscillation of interfacial water induced by contact electrification resembles that caused by electrochemical processes, offering new insights and evidence for chemically induced changes.








Abstract
Water is crucial for various physicochemical processes at the liquid&#8211;solid interfaces. In particular, the interfacial water, mediating the electric field and solvation effect along with the solid, corporately determine the electrochemical properties. Understanding the interaction between solid properties and the interface water holds significant importance in interfacial dynamics. However, the impact of alterations in the charged state of solid surfaces induced by contact electrification on interfacial water remains unknown. Here, the evolution of atomic&#8208;level resolution maps of hydration layers are reported on charged surfaces using 3D atomic force microscopy (3D&#8208;AFM). These findings demonstrate that electrostatic interactions can reinforce, distort, or collapse the characteristic structure of hydration layers. More importantly, these interactions exhibit interlayer differences and sample specificity in hydration layer structures of different substrates. In addition, similar oscillations of the hydration layer are observed at the electrochemical interface under different voltage biases. This suggests that contact&#8208;electrification has the potential to serve as a novel method for manipulating and regulating chemical reactions at the interface.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Structuring of Silica&#8208;Based Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Multicomponent Glasses with Adjustable Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemically curable silicate&#8208;based nanocomposites containing photoreactive precursors allow transparent multicomponent glasses with adjustable properties to be fabricated. After lithographic structuring, the doped nanocomposites are thermally debinded and sintered in order to achieve full densification. This enables the production of complex structured, transparent multicomponent glasses that are difficult to realize using conventional methods.








Abstract
Silicate&#8208;based multicomponent glasses are of high interest for technical applications due to their tailored properties, such as an adaptable refractive index or coefficient of thermal expansion. However, the production of complex structured parts is associated with high effort, since glass components are usually shaped from high&#8208;temperature melts with subsequent mechanical or chemical postprocessing. Here for the first time the fabrication of binary and ternary multicomponent glasses using doped nanocomposites based on silica nanoparticles and photocurable metal oxide precursors as part of the binder matrix is presented. The doped nanocomposites are structured in high resolution using UV&#8208;casting and additive manufacturing techniques, such as stereolithography and two&#8208;photon lithography. Subsequently, the composites are thermally converted into transparent glass. By incorporating titanium oxide, germanium oxide, or zirconium dioxide into the silicate glass network, multicomponent glasses are fabricated with an adjustable refractive index nD between 1.4584&#8211;1.4832 and an Abbe number V of 53.85&#8211;61.13. It is further demonstrated that by incorporating 7&#160;wt% titanium oxide, glasses with ultralow thermal expansion can be fabricated with so far unseen complexity. These novel materials enable for the first time high&#8208;precision lithographic structuring of multicomponent silica glasses with applications from optics and photonics, semiconductors as well as sensors.

         <title>Fluid&#8208;Induced Piezoelectric Field Enhancing Photo&#8208;Assisted Zn&#8211;Air Batteries Based on a Fe@P(V&#8208;T) Microhelical Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the piezoelectric effect of the microhelical cathode poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)@ferric oxide(Fe@P(V&#8208;T)) under the weak force of water flow, the built&#8208;in electric field can continuously promote the carrier separation and transfer of photocathode through the periodic piezoelectric potential, and effectively accelerate the ORR/OER kinetics, providing a constructive guidance for the development of piezoelectric&#8208;photo coupled assisted Zn&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air batteries can accelerate the kinetics of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER); however, challenges such as rapid charge carrier recombination and continuous electrolyte evaporation remain. Herein, for the first time, piezoelectric catalysis is introduced in a photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air battery to improve carrier separation capability and accelerate the ORR/OER kinetics of the photoelectric cathode. The designed microhelical catalyst exploits simple harmonic vibrations to regenerate the built&#8208;in electric field continuously. Specifically, in the presence of the low&#8208;frequency kinetic energy that occurs during water flow, the piezoelectric&#8211;photocoupling catalyst of poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)@ferric oxide(Fe@P(V&#8208;T)) is periodically deformed, generating a constant reconfiguration of the built&#8208;in electric field that separates photogenerated electrons and holes continuously. Further, on exposure to microvibrations, the gap between the charge and discharge potentials of the Fe@P(V&#8208;T)&#8208;based photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air battery is reduced by 1.7 times compared to that without piezoelectric assistance, indicating that piezoelectric catalysis is highly effective for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. This study provides a thorough understanding of coupling piezoelectric polarization and photo&#8208;assisted strategy in the field of energy storage and opens a fresh perspective for the investigation of multi&#8208;field coupling&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Drug&#8208;Free &#8220;Triboelectric Immunotherapy&#8221; Activating Immunity for Osteomyelitis Treatment and Recurrence Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A drug &#8208;free strategy, namely &#8220;triboelectric immunotherapy&#8221; based on pulsed direct&#8208;current output triboelectric nanogenerators (DC&#8208;TENG) is developed, based on coupling tribological charging effect and electrostatic breakdown effect, performing antibacterial, osteogenic, and immune activation effects for osteomyelitis. This triboelectric immunotherapy features efficient infection elimination and specific secondary recurrence prevention, with innate and adaptive immune&#8208;response activation, and prolonged immunological memory production.








Abstract
Treatment of osteomyelitis is clinically challenging with low therapeutic efficacy and high risk of recurrence owing to the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Existing therapies are limited by drug concentration and single regulatory effect on the immune network, and emphasize the role of anti&#8208;inflammatory effects in reducing osteoclast rather than the role of proinflammatory effects in accelerating infection clearance, which is not conducive to complete bacteria elimination and recurrence prevention. Herein, a direct&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerator (DC&#8208;TENG) is established to perform antibacterial effects and modulate immunological properties of infectious microenvironments of osteomyelitis through electrical stimulation, namely triboelectric immunotherapy. Seeing from the results, the triboelectric immunotherapy successfully activates polarization to proinflammatory (M1) macrophages in vitro, accompanied by satisfying direct antibacterial effects. The antibacterial and osteogenic abilities of triboelectric immunotherapy are verified in rat cranial osteomyelitis models. The effects on the polarization and differentiation of immune&#8208;related cells in vivo are investigated by establishing in situ tibial osteomyelitis models and immunosurveillance models in C57 mice respectively, indicating the ability of activating immunity and producing immunological memory for in situ infection and secondary recurrence, thus accelerating healing and preventing relapse. This study provides an efficient, long&#8208;acting, multifunctional, and wearable triboelectric immunotherapy strategy for drug&#8208;free osteomyelitis treatment systems.

This study introduces GLOWi&#946;, a closed&#8208;loop insulin&#8208;release system combining optogenetics and synthetic biology for diabetes management. Alginate microbeads encapsulating engineered i&#946;&#8208;cells and a probe that emits glucose&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent blue fluorescence enable precise control of insulin release. Successfully tested in a T1D mouse model, this approach has potential for personalized diabetes treatment.








Abstract
Closed&#8208;loop control systems for precise control of therapeutic gene expression are promising candidates for personalized treatment of chronic ailments such as diabetes. Pancreatic i&#946;&#8208;cells are engineered with blue&#8208;light&#8208;inducible melanopsin to drive rapid insulin release by vesicular secretion from intracellular stores. In this work, a glucose&#8208;operated widget (GLOW) is designed as a component of a closed&#8208;loop control system for diabetes treatment by employing a probe that emits blue fluorescence in a glucose&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent manner as a real&#8208;time glucose sensor to precisely control insulin release from these i&#946;&#8208;cells. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the complete control system, the probe is encapsulated together with i&#946;&#8208;cells in alginate&#8208;poly&#8208;(L&#8208;lysine) hydrogel&#8208;microbeads(400&#160;&#181;m in diameter and containing about 500 cells) called GLOWi&#946; (GLOW with i&#946;&#8208;cells), are subcutaneously implanted into type&#8208;1&#8208;diabetic (T1D) mice. Illumination by UV&#8208;A light at 390&#160;nm results in glucose&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent blue&#8208;light emission from the probe at 445&#160;nm that in turn induces glucose&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent insulin release from the i&#946;&#8208;cells in a fully reversible manner. Activation of the injected GLOWi&#946; at 390&#160;nm for 15 min effectively restores normoglycemia within 60&#8211;120 min in a closed&#8208;loop manner in these diabetic mice. The system is robust, as normoglycemia is well maintained by daily activation for at least 7 days.

         <title>Hole Polaron&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Electron&#8211;Hole Recombination Triggers Efficient Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced carrier&#8211;phonon effect in a locally disordered structure near the pores in KTaO3 ultrathin nanosheets accelerates the formation of active hole polarons, effectively preventing the recombination of photogenerated electrons under mild conditions. The atomic&#8208;disordered pore KTaO3 ultrathin nanosheets demonstrate superior nitrogenoxidation performance, producing nitrate at a rate of 2.1 mg g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
In the pursuit of successful photocatalytic transformations, challenges persist due to limitations in charge carrier utilization and transfer efficiency, which stemming from rapid recombination. Overcoming these limitations necessitates the exploration of novel mechanisms that enhance the effective separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs. Herein, deviating from the conventional approach of enhancing carrier migration to separate photogenerated charges and extend their lifetime, the proposal is to directly prevent the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes by forming hole polarons. Specifically, disordered pores are introduced on the surface of KTaO3 ultrathin sheets, and the clear&#8208;cut evidences in electron paramagnetic resonance, photoluminescence, and ultrafast spectroscopy unambiguously confirm the enhanced carrier&#8211;phonon coupling, which results in the formation of hole polarons to impede the recombination of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs. Taking the challenging nitrogen oxidation reaction as an example, it is found that the hole polarons in atomic&#8208;disordered pore KTaO3 ultrathin nanosheets trigger outstanding photo&#8208;oxidation performance of&#160; nitrogen (N2)to nitrate, with a nitrate&#8208;producing rate of 2.1 mg g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This scenario is undoubtedly applicable to a wide variety of photocatalytic reactions due to the common challenge of charge carrier recombination in all photocatalytic processes, manifesting broad implications for promoting photocatalysis performance.

         <title>Low&#8208;Hysteresis and Tough Ionogels via Low&#8208;Energy&#8208;Dissipating Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a chemical design of low&#8208;hysteresis and tough ionogels by utilizing low&#8208;energy&#8208;dissipating yet strong hierarchical nanoarchitectures as cross&#8208;linkers formed via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is proposed. A fundamental understanding of the mechanism underlying the low&#8208;hysteresis features can serve as a guiding principle for the molecular design of high&#8208;performance ionogels and will facilitate their advancement and application in many burgeoning fields.








Abstract
Low&#8208;hysteresis merits can help polymeric gel materials survive from consecutive loading cycles and promote life span in many burgeoning areas. However, it is a big challenge to design low&#8208;hysteresis and tough polymeric gel materials, especially for ionogels. This can be attributed to the fact that higher viscosities of ionic liquids (ILs) would increase chain friction of polymeric gels and eventually dissipate large amounts of energy under deformation. Herein, a chemical design of ionogels is proposed to achieve low&#8208;hysteresis characteristics in both mechanical and electric aspects via hierarchical aggregates formed by supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of quadruple H&#8208;bonds in a soft IL&#8208;rich polymeric matrix. These self&#8208;assembled nanoaggregates not only can greatly reinforce the polymeric matrix and enhance resilience, but also exhibit low&#8208;energy&#8208;dissipating features under stress conditions, simultaneously benefiting for low&#8208;hysteresis properties. These aggregates can also promote toughness and subsequent anti&#8208;fatigue properties in response to external cyclic mechanical stimuli. More importantly, these ionogels are presented as a model system to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the low hysteresis and fatigue resistance. Based on these findings, it is further demonstrated that the supramolecular low&#8208;hysteresis strategy is universal.

         <title>Porous Magnetic Soft Grippers for Fast and Gentle Grasping of Delicate Living Objects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous magnetic soft gripper (PMSG) is designed to address the inherent trade&#8208;off between shape adaptability and payload capacity. The porous structure imparts low impact force and high surface friction, enabling swift yet gentle grasping. PMSGs are integrated with robotic arms and UAVs for the remote gripping and transportation of small animals.








Abstract
Magnetic soft grippers have attracted intensive interest due to their untethered controllability, rapid response, and biological safety. However, manipulating living objects requires a simultaneous increase in shape adaptability and gripping force, which are typically mutually exclusive. Increasing the magnetic particle content enhances the magnetic strength but also increases the elastic modulus, leading to low adaptability and high impact force. Here, a porous magnetic soft gripper (PMSG) is developed by integrating a porous structure into a magnetic silicone elastomer. The design of porous hard magnetic composite is characterized by high magnetization, low modulus, and rough surface. It offers the PMSG good compliance, high gripping force, and low impact force at fast gripping. The PMSG is capable of performing a variety of tasks, including the fast and gentle grasping of delicate living objects. The study provides insight into the design of novel magnetic grippers and may offer a promising outlook for biomedical or scientific applications in the manipulation of delicate organisms.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Single&#8208;Crystal Mesoporous TiO2 Supported CuW6O24 Clusters as Photocatalytic Cascade Nanoreactor for Boosting Reduction of CO2 to CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;dimensional mesoporous single&#8208;crystal TiO2 based nanoreactors are prepared via the droplet interfacial oriented assembly and crystallisation strategy. The CuW6O24 &#160;cluster incorporated cascade nanoreactor are further constructed and achieved two&#8208;step CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction with a high CH4 electron selectivity up to 94.3%. 








Abstract
Constructing nanoreactors with multiple active sites in well&#8208;defined crystalline mesoporous frameworks is an effective strategy for tailoring photocatalysts to address the challenging of CO2 reduction. Herein, one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D) mesoporous single&#8208;crystal TiO2 nanorod (MS&#8208;TiO2&#8208;NRs, &#8776;110&#160;nm in length, high surface area of 117 m2 g&#8722;1, and uniform mesopores of &#8776;7.0&#160;nm) based nanoreactors are prepared via a droplet interface directed&#8208;assembly strategy under mild condition. By regulating the interfacial energy, the 1&#8208;D mesoporous single&#8208;crystal TiO2 can be further tuned to polycrystalline fan&#8208; and flower&#8208;like morphologies with different oxygen vacancies (Ov). The integration of single&#8208;crystal nature and mesopores with exposed oxygen vacancies make the rod&#8208;like TiO2 nanoreactors exhibit a high&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 reduction selectivity to CO (95.1%). Furthermore, photocatalytic cascade nanoreactors by in situ incorporation of CuW6O24 (W&#8211;Cu) clusters onto MS&#8208;TiO2&#8208;NRs via Ov are designed and synthesized, which improved the CO2 adsorption capacity and achieved two&#8208;step CO2&#8211;CO&#8211;CH4 photoreduction. The second step CO&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reaction induced by W&#8211;Cu sites ensures a high generation rate of CH4 (420.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), along with an enhanced CH4 selectivity (&#8776;94.3% electron selectivity). This research provides a platform for the design of mesoporous single&#8208;crystal materials, which potentially extends to a range of functional ceramics and semiconductors for various applications.

&lt;p&gt;One-dimensional mesoporous single-crystal TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; based nanoreactors are prepared via the droplet interfacial oriented assembly and crystallisation strategy. The CuW&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; &#160;cluster incorporated cascade nanoreactor are further constructed and achieved two-step CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction with a high CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electron selectivity up to 94.3%. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing nanoreactors with multiple active sites in well-defined crystalline mesoporous frameworks is an effective strategy for tailoring photocatalysts to address the challenging of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Herein, one-dimensional (1-D) mesoporous single-crystal TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanorod (MS-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NRs, &#8776;110&#160;nm in length, high surface area of 117 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and uniform mesopores of &#8776;7.0&#160;nm) based nanoreactors are prepared via a droplet interface directed-assembly strategy under mild condition. By regulating the interfacial energy, the 1-D mesoporous single-crystal TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be further tuned to polycrystalline fan- and flower-like morphologies with different oxygen vacancies (O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;). The integration of single-crystal nature and mesopores with exposed oxygen vacancies make the rod-like TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoreactors exhibit a high-photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction selectivity to CO (95.1%). Furthermore, photocatalytic cascade nanoreactors by in situ incorporation of CuW&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; (W&#8211;Cu) clusters onto MS-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NRs via O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; are designed and synthesized, which improved the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity and achieved two-step CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;CO&#8211;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction. The second step CO-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; reaction induced by W&#8211;Cu sites ensures a high generation rate of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (420.4&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), along with an enhanced CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (&#8776;94.3% electron selectivity).

         <title>Planar Deposition via In Situ Conversion Engineering for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;dual&#8208;layer&#8221; coating is fabricated via an in situ conversion strategy, consisting of a VSe2/ZnSe outer layer with low lattice mismatch and a nano metallic V inner layer with corrosion resistance. This design not only facilitates interfacial ion transfer and electric field homogenization but also enables planar deposition, thereby achieving reversible and uniform zinc deposition.








Abstract
Owing to the considerable capacity, high safety, and abundant zinc resources, zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been garnering much attention. Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory cyclic lifespan and poor reversibility originate from side reactions and dendrite obstacles to their practical applications. In addition to inhibiting the corrosion of aqueous electrolytes, regulating planar deposition is a key strategy to enhance their long&#8208;term stability. Herein, an in situ conversion strategy is reported to construct a protective &#8220;dual&#8208;layer&#8221; structure (VZSe/V@Zn) on zinc metal, consisting of the VSe2&#8208;ZnSe outer layer with low lattice mismatch to Zn (002) plane, and corrosion&#8208;resistant nanometallic V inner layer. Such design integrates superior interfacial ionic/electronic transfer, corrosion resistance, and unique planar deposition regulation capability. The as&#8208;prepared VZSe/V@Zn demonstrates remarkable durability of 238&#160;h at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a high depth of discharge (68.3% DOD) in the Zn||Zn symmetric cell. Even in the anode&#8208;free system, the as&#8208;prepared protective layer can extend the cycle life up to 2000 cycles, with an outstanding capacity retention of 93.1% and ultra&#8208;high average coulombic efficiency of 99.998%. This work delineates an effective strategy for fabricating lattice&#8208;matching protective layers, with profound implications for elucidating zinc deposition mechanisms and paving the way for the development of high&#8208;performance zinc batteries.

         <title>Manipulating the Electronic Properties of an Fe Single Atom Catalyst via Secondary Coordination Sphere Engineering to Provide Enhanced Oxygen Electrocatalytic Activity in Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an approach to access atomically dispersed Fe sites over a defect&#8208;containing nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix via secondary coordination sphere engineering is reported on. This Fe catalyst presents extraordinary oxygen bifunctional activity in alkaline environments. In situ characterizations and theoretical studies manifest that the unique geometric and coordination structures reshape the electronic properties of Fe sites to afford such high performance.








Abstract
Oxygen reduction and evolution reactions are two key processes in electrochemical energy conversion technologies. Synthesis of nonprecious metal, carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high oxygen bifunctional activity and stability is a crucial, yet challenging step to achieving electrochemical energy conversion. Here, an approach to address this issue: synthesis of an atomically dispersed Fe electrocatalyst (Fe1/NCP) over a porous, defect&#8208;containing nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support, is described. Through incorporation of a phosphorus atom into the second coordination sphere of iron, the activity and durability boundaries of this catalyst are pushed to an unprecedented level in alkaline environments, such as those found in a zinc&#8208;air battery. The rationale is to delicately incorporate P heteroatoms and defects close to the central metal sites (FeN4P1&#8208;OH) in order to break the local symmetry of the electronic distribution. This enables suitable binding strength with oxygenated intermediates. In situ characterizations and theoretical studies demonstrate that these synergetic interactions are responsible for high bifunctional activity and stability. These intrinsic advantages of Fe1/NCP enable a potential gap of a mere 0.65&#160;V and a high power density of 263.8&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 when incorporated into a zinc&#8208;air battery. These findings underscore the importance of design principles to access high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for green energy technologies.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Toward Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;free mesoporous NiO catalyst with a favorable local reaction environment is reported to catalyze selective CO2 reduction toward ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 75.2%. The C&#8722;C bond forms via the direct coupling of *CO2&#8208;COOH on NiO, which transforms to ethanol energetically through the *COCOH and *OC2H5 pathway. The findings provide a new perspective of C&#8722;C coupling toward C2+ synthesis, distinctive from that on Cu catalysts.








Abstract
The electroreduction of CO2 offers a sustainable route to generate synthetic fuels. Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been developed to produce value&#8208;added C2+ alcohols; however, the limited understanding of complex C&#8722;C coupling and reaction pathway hinders the development of efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ alcohols catalysts. Herein, a Cu&#8208;free, highly mesoporous NiO catalyst, derived from the microphase separation of a block copolymer,&#160;is reported, which achieves selective CO2 reduction toward ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 75.2% at &#8722;0.6&#160;V versus RHE. The dense mesopores create a favorable local reaction environment with CO2&#8208;rich and H2O&#8208;deficient interfaces, suppressing hydrogen evolution and maximizing catalytic activity of NiO for CO2 reduction. Importantly, the C1&#8208;feeding experiments, in situ spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations consistently show that the direct coupling of *CO2 and *COOH is responsible for C&#8722;C bond formation on NiO, and subsequent reduction of *CO2&#8208;COOH to ethanol is energetically facile through the *COCOH and *OC2H5 pathway. The unconventional C&#8722;C coupling mechanism on NiO, in contrast to the *CO dimerization on Cu, is triggered by strong CO2 adsorption on the polarized Ni2+&#8208;O2&#8722; sites. The work not only demonstrates a highly selective Cu&#8208;free Ni&#8208;based alternative for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ alcohols transformation but also provides a new perspective on C&#8722;C coupling toward C2+ synthesis.

         <title>Five Volts Lithium Batteries with Advanced Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolytes: A Rational Design via a Trio&#8208;Functional Addon Materials</title>

An advanced electrolyte is designed via trio&#8208;functional additives to carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes with hierarchical DFOB&#8208; and PF6&#8208; dual anion structure in the solvation sheath, leading to a faster de&#8208;solvation of the Li cation, thus forming a robust and highly stable SEI and CEI. A 5V Li||LNMO cell with advanced electrolyte achieves&#160;88.3% capacity retention after 500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries paired with high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathodes are a promising energy storage source for achieving enhanced high energy density. Forming durable and robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI) and the ability to withstand oxidation at high potentials are essential for long&#8208;lasting performance. Herein, advanced electrolytes are designed via trio&#8208;functional additives to carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes for 5&#160;V Li||LNMO and graphite||LNMO cells achieving 88.3% capacity retention after 500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. Theoretical calculations reveal that adding adiponitrile facilitates the presence of more hierarchical DFOB&#8722; and PF6&#8722; dual anion structure in the solvation sheath, leading to a faster de&#8208;solvation of the Li cation. By combining both fluorine and nitrile additives, an efficient synergistic effect is obtained, generating robust thin inorganic SEI and CEI films, respectively. These films enhance microstructural stability; Li dendrite growth on the Li electrode is being suppressed at the anode side and transition&#8208;metals dissolution from the cathode is being mitigated, as evidenced by cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron studies.

         <title>Engineered Nanoparticles for Enhanced Antitumoral Synergy Between Macrophages and T Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD&#8208;1)&#8208;transfected macrophage membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (PMMNPs) enable tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of dual immune checkpoint inhibitors for both T cells and macrophages. Consequently, PMMNPs not only enhance the antitumoral immunity of macrophages and T cells but also foster antitumoral synergy between these cells. This synergy is achieved by promoting tumor antigen presentation and subsequent T cell activation, and inducing the reprogramming of macrophages toward an antitumoral phenotype.








Abstract
T cells and macrophages have the potential to collaborate to eliminate tumor cells efficiently. Macrophages can eliminate tumor cells through phagocytosis and subsequently activate T cells by presenting tumor antigens. The activated T cells, in turn, can kill tumor cells and redirect tumor&#8208;associated macrophages toward an antitumoral M1 phenotype. However, checkpoint molecules expressed on tumor cells impede the collaborative action of these immune cells. Meanwhile, monotherapy with a single immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for either macrophages or T cells yields suboptimal efficacy in cancer patients. To address this challenge, here a nanoparticle capable of efficiently delivering dual ICIs to tumors for both macrophages and T cells is developed. These programmed cell death protein 1 (PD&#8208;1)&#8208;transfected macrophage membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (PMMNPs) can target tumors and provide signal&#8208;regulatory protein alpha and PD&#8208;1 to block CD47 and programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), respectively, on tumor cells. PMMNPs enhance macrophage&#8208;mediated cancer cell phagocytosis and antigen presentation, promote T cell activation, and induce the reprogramming of macrophages toward an antitumoral phenotype. In syngeneic tumor&#8208;bearing mice, PMMNPs demonstrate superior therapeutic efficacy compared to nanoparticles delivering single ICIs and non&#8208;targeted delivery of anti&#8208;CD47 and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibodies. PMMNPs capable of augmenting the antitumoral interplay between macrophages and T cells may offer a promising avenue for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Closed&#8208;Loop Nanosystem Based on Piezoelectric Sensor and Pd&#8208;Nanoshell Photothermal Ablation for Renal Denervation to Treat Hypertension</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Performing precise, effective, and safe renal denervation (RDN) is crucial for hypertension treatment. Here, the authors construct a closed&#8208;loop system based on a sensing unit of piezoelectric thin&#8208;film sensors and a therapeutic unit of photothermal Pd&#160;nanoparticle shell. This nanosystem is capable of monitoring, targeting, and guiding ablation to safely achieve long&#8208;term control of renal sympathetic nerve&#8208;related hypertension.








Abstract
Renal sympathetic nerves play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, and renal denervation (RDN) is a new solution for patients with refractory hypertension. However, current RDN techniques show inconsistent results in clinical application probably owing to incomplete endovascular ablation of the sympathetic nerves and a lack of measures to localize and assess efficacy. In this study, a closed&#8208;loop RDN system consisting of a sensing unit with a piezoelectric thin&#8208;film sensor (PTFS) and a treatment unit with a hollow Pd nanoparticle shell (PdNPS) with a diameter of 202.0&#160;nm for photothermal neural ablation is constructed. The PTFS can monitor and collect arterial pulsation and blood pressure (BP) and direct PdNPS to maximize RDN. PdNPS maintains a local temperature of 58&#8211;62&#160;&#176;C under near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II irradiation (1,064&#160;nm) to achieve effective RDN within a range of 90&#8211;120&#160;s treatment window. Photothermal ablation significantly inhibits the activities of renal sympathetic nerves post&#8208;procedure and after one month and reduces the elevation of BP by &gt; 50%. The novel closed&#8208;loop system enables safe and efficient targeting, dynamic monitoring, and ablation of the renal sympathetic nerves. This closed&#8208;loop system provides a new strategy for RDN technology and even for treating sympathetic nerve&#8208;related chronic diseases.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Molecular Dipole Enables Tunable Interfacial Field Toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of fluorine terminated dual&#8208;site organic dipole molecules is investigated to engineer interfacial properties. Through the tunable interfacial field via tailored side&#8208;chain, a gradient energy level alignment with more favorable energetics is established, and the resulting N&#8208;i&#8208;P perovskite solar cell demonstrates a record high efficiency value of 25.47% together with enhanced long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
The interfacial management in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), including mitigating the carrier transport barrier and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination, still remains a significant challenge for efficiency and stability enhancement. Herein, by screening a family of fluorine (F) terminated dual&#8208;site organic dipole molecules, the study aims to gain insight into the molecular dipole array toward tunable interfacial field. Both experimental and theoretical results reveal that these functional interfacial dipole molecules can effectively anchor on perovskite surface through Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction. In addition, the tailored side&#8208;chain with terminated F atoms allows for altering and constructing a well matched perovskite/Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD interfacial contact. As a result, the inserting dual&#8208;site organic dipole array effectively modulates the interface to deliver a gradient energy level alignment, facilitating carrier extraction and transport. The optimal dual&#8208;site dipole trifluoro&#8208;methanesulfonamide mediated N&#8208;i&#8208;P PSCs achieve the highest efficiency of 25.47%, together with enhanced operational stability under 1000&#160;h of the simulated 1&#8208;sun illumination exposure. These findings are believed to provide insight into the design of dual&#8208;site molecular dipole with sufficient interfacial tunability for perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

ReSCUE (Recoverable&#8208;Spheroid&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip with Unrestricted External Shape), a multi&#8208;layer microfluidic platform that facilitates the generation and selective release of uniformly sized soft matter structures, including organoids and tumoroids is introduced. This platform allows for targeted recovery and in&#8208;depth analysis of breast cancer patient&#8208;derived organoids (PDOs), enabling investigations into how tumor morphology influences tumor growth and cancer cell proliferation.








Abstract
Multicellular spheroids and patient&#8208;derived organoids find many applications in fundamental research, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine. Advances in the understanding and recapitulation of organ functionality and disease development require the generation of complex organoid models, including organoids with diverse morphologies. Microfluidics&#8208;based cell culture platforms enable time&#8208;efficient confined organoid generation. However, the ability to form organoids with different shapes with a subsequent transfer from microfluidic devices to unconstrained environments for studies of morphology&#8208;dependent organoid growth is yet to be demonstrated. Here, a microfluidic platform is introduced that enables high&#8208;fidelity formation and addressable release of breast cancer organoids with diverse shapes. Using this platform, the impact of organoid morphology on their growth in unconstrained biomimetic hydrogel is explored. It is shown that proliferative cancer cells tend to localize in high positive curvature organoid regions, causing their faster growth, while the overall growth pattern of organoids with diverse shapes tends to reduce interfacial tension at the organoid&#8208;hydrogel interface. In addition to the formation of organoids with diverse morphologies, this platform can be integrated into multi&#8208;tissue micro&#8208;physiological systems.

         <title>Sliding Ferroelectricity Induced Ultrafast Switchable Photovoltaic Response in &#949;&#8208;InSe Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>

This work demonstrates the odd&#8208;even layer&#8208;dependence of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity in &#949;&#8208;InSe. The device based on the &#949;&#8208;InSe achieves an on/off ratio of 10&#8308; in ferroelectric tunneling junction and ultrafast bulk photovoltaic response in photodetector in the near&#8208;infrared band. Moreover, the photoresponse in &#949;&#8208;InSe can even exceed graphene in the same conditions, confirming the possibility of application in multifunctional devices.








Abstract
2D sliding ferroelectric semiconductors have greatly expanded the ferroelectrics family with the flexibility of bandgap and material properties, which hold great promise for ultrathin device applications that combine ferroelectrics with optoelectronics. Besides the induced different resistance states for non&#8208;volatile memories, the switchable ferroelectric polarizations can also modulate the photogenerated carriers for potentially ultrafast optoelectronic devices. Here, it is demonstrated that the room temperature sliding ferroelectricity can be used for ultrafast switchable photovoltaic response in &#949;&#8208;InSe layers. By first&#8208;principles calculations and experimental characterizations, it is revealed that the ferroelectricity with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) polarization only exists in even layer &#949;&#8208;InSe. The ferroelectricity is also demonstrated in &#949;&#8208;InSe&#8208;based vertical devices, which exhibit high on&#8208;off ratios (&#8776;104) and non&#8208;volatile storage capabilities. Moreover, the OOP ferroelectricity enables an ultrafast (&#8776;3&#160;ps) bulk photovoltaic response in the near&#8208;infrared band, rendering it a promising material for self&#8208;powered reconfigurable and ultrafast photodetector. This work reveals the essential role of ferroelectric polarization on the photogenerated carrier dynamics and paves the way for hybrid multifunctional ferroelectric and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Minimalist Pathogen&#8208;Like Sugar Nanovaccine for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon chain&#8208;modified mannan, derived from yeast, demonstrates exceptional capabilities in antigen encapsulation and cross&#8208;presentation, coupled with enhanced activation of dendritic cells through the TLR4 and Dectin&#8208;2 pathways, which leads to robust activation of antigen&#8208;specific T cells. When combined with anti&#8208;PD L1, this nanovaccine can unleash formidable antitumor immune responses, working synergistically to inhibit the growth of established tumors.








Abstract
Pathogen&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles have emerged at the forefront of vaccine delivery technology, offering potent immune activation and excellent biocompatibility. Among these innovative carriers, mannan, a critical component of yeast cell walls, shows promise as an exemplary vaccine carrier. Nevertheless, it faces challenges like unpredictable immunogenicity, rapid elimination, and limited antigen loading due to high water solubility. Herein, mannan with varying carbon chain ratios is innovatively modified, yielding a series of dodecyl chains modified mannan (Mann&#8208;C12). Through meticulous screening, a mannan variant with a 40% grafting ratio is pinpointed as the optimal vaccine carrier. Further RNA sequencing confirms that Mann&#8208;C12 exhibits desired immunostimulatory characteristics. Coupled with antigen peptides, Mann&#8208;C12/OVA257&#8208;280 nanovaccine initiates the maturation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells by activating the TLR4 and Dectin&#8208;2 pathways, significantly boosting antigen utilization and sparking antigen&#8208;specific immune responses. In vivo, experiments utilizing the B16&#8208;OVA tumor model underscore the exceptional preventive capabilities of Mann&#8208;C12/OVA257&#8208;280. Notably, when combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, it displays a profound synergistic effect, leading to marked inhibition of tumor growth. Thus, the work has yielded a pathogen&#8208;like nanovaccine that is both simple to prepare and highly effective, underscoring the vast potential of mannan&#8208;modified nanovaccines in the realm of cancer immunotherapy.

A &#8220;two&#8208;pronged&#8221; strategy is proposed to construct highly active oxygen deficient Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;Fe coordinate structures in NiFe (oxy)hydroxide (NFM&#8208;OVR/NF), which simultaneously reduces the energy barrier of Volmer and Heyrovsky steps during alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process and significantly accelerate the reaction kinetics. Benefiting from excellent HER and oxygen evolution reaction activity, NFM&#8208;OVR/NF exhibits feasibility and practicability for industrial applications.








Abstract
NiFe (oxy)hydroxides have been regarded as one of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Unfortunately, the sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics limit its application as bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline overall water splitting (OWS). Herein, a &#8220;two&#8208;pronged&#8221; strategy is proposed to construct highly active oxygen deficient Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;Fe coordinate structures in NiFe (oxy)hydroxide (NFM&#8208;OVR/NF), which simultaneously reduces the energy barrier of Volmer and Heyrovsky steps during alkaline HER process and significantly accelerate the reaction kinetics. Consequently, NFM&#8208;OVR/NF delivers overpotentials as low as 25 and 234&#160;mV to achieve 10 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#160;M KOH, respectively. Furthermore, benefiting from excellent HER and OER activity, NFM&#8208;OVR/NF exhibits a remarkable OWS activity with cell voltages of 1.44&#160;V and 1.77&#160;V at 10 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#160;M KOH, and displays ultralong&#8208;term stability for 600&#160;h at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, while remaining durable for 300&#160;h in an alkaline water electrolyzer in 30% KOH at 80&#160;&#176;C. The calculated price per gallon of gasoline equivalent for the produced H2 is $ 0.92, which is much lower than 2026 U.S. Department of Energy target ($ 2.00), demonstrating feasibility and practicability of NFM&#8208;OVR/NF for industrial applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Multichannel Silk Nerve Conduits With Multicellular Spatiotemporal Distributions for Spinal Cord Injury Repair</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the ingenious anatomy of natural spinal cords, a biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduit (BNC@MSCs/SCs) with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions in its hierarchical channel structures is presented. It is further demonstrated in rats that the BNC@MSCs/SCs can facilitate nerve regeneration and function recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI).








Abstract
Bioengineered nerve conduits have shown great promise for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair, while their practical values are limited by poor regenerative efficacy and lack of multi&#8208;level structural design. Here, inspired by the ingenious anatomy of natural spinal cords, a biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduit (namely BNC@MSCs/SCs) with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions for effective SCI repair is presented. The biomimetic silk nerve conduit (BNC) with hierarchical channels and aligned pore structures is prepared via a modified directional freeze&#8208;casting strategy. Such hierarchical structures provide appropriate space for the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Schwann cells (SCs) settled in specific channels, which contributes to the generation of BNC@MSCs/SCs resembling the cellular spatiotemporal distributions of natural spinal cords. The in vitro results reveal the facilitated SC migration and MSC differentiation in such BNC@MSCs/SCs multicellular system, which further promotes the tube formation and cell migration of endothelial cells as well as M2 polarization of macrophages. Moreover, BNC@MSCs/SCs can effectively promote the tissue repair and function recovery in SCI rats by attenuating glial scar formation while promoting neuron regeneration and myelin sheath reconstruction. Thus, it is believed that the biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduits with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions are valuable for SCI repair and other neural tissue regeneration.

         <title>Tyrosinase&#8208;Woven Melanin Nets for Melanoma Therapy through Targeted Mitochondrial Tethering and Enhanced Photothermal Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polysaccharide dually&#8208;tagged with tyrosine and triphenylphosphine is designed for targeted cross&#8208;linking of mitochondria in melanoma cells, effectively slowing down tumor metabolism and growth. Additionally, it promoted the production of artificial melanin and enhanced the photothermal conversion efficiency. These findings introduce a catalytic cross&#8208;linking strategy, offering a new avenue for controlling cellular metabolism combined with photothermal therapy for cancer treatment.








Abstract
Manipulating intracellular biological processes and organelles has emerged as a pivotal strategy to influence cellular physiological functions. Mitochondria, recognized as the powerhouse of cells, play a crucial role in tumorigenesis and progression. Inspired by the Nature's tyrosinase&#8208;catalyzed melanin formation within melanoma cells, here an approach is developed using a polysaccharide dually&#8208;functionalized with tyrosine and triphenylphosphine (TPP) for targeted mitochondria cross&#8208;linking in melanoma cells. This technique intricately weaves melanin nets within the cells, serving as a tether for the mitochondria and effectively decelerating tumor metabolism through nanoparticle&#8208;net transformation. Tyrosinase acts as the &#8220;needle&#8221;, while the functionalized polysaccharide serves as the &#8220;string&#8221; successfully constructing nets within the cell. Furthermore, the tyrosinase&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;linking of tyrosine not only facilitates the production of artificial melanin but also enhances the photothermal conversion efficiency of melanoma cells, leading to decrease of the tumor growth. This study unveils a non&#8208;drug method for regulating organelle physiological activity and introduces photothermal treatment. This work not only sheds light on the manipulation of cellular functions but also holds promise for advancing cancer therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Sea Cucumber&#8208;Inspired Polyurethane Demonstrating Record&#8208;Breaking Mechanical Properties in Room&#8208;Temperature Self&#8208;Healing Ionogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sea cucumber&#8208;inspired polyurethane containing multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors is synthesized, which is instrumental in the creation of self&#8208;healing ionogels. The polyurethane forms dynamic hard&#8208;phase regions within the ionogels, driven by multiple hydrogen bonds. This unique phase separation structure not only significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the ionogels but also ensures their self&#8208;healing capability at room temperature.








Abstract
Practical applications of existing self&#8208;healing ionogels are often hindered by the trade&#8208;off between their mechanical robustness, ionic conductivity, and temperature requirements for their self&#8208;healing ability. Herein, this challenge is addressed by drawing inspiration from sea cucumber. A polyurethane containing multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors is synthesized and used to fabricate room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing ionogels with excellent mechanical properties, high ionic conductivity, puncture resistance, and impact resistance. The hard segments of polyurethane, driven by multiple hydrogen bonds, coalesce into hard phase regions, which can efficiently dissipate energy through the reversible disruption and reformation of multiple hydrogen bonds. Consequently, the resulting ionogels exhibit record&#8208;high tensile strength and toughness compared to other room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing ionogels. Furthermore, the inherent reversibility of multiple hydrogen bonds within the hard phase regions allows the ionogels to spontaneously and efficiently self&#8208;heal damaged mechanical properties and ionic conductivity multiple times at room temperature. To underscore their application potential, these ionogels are employed as electrolytes in the fabrication of electrochromic devices, which exhibit excellent and stable electrochromic performance, repeatable healing ability, and satisfactory impact resistance. This study presents a novel strategy for the fabrication of ionogels with exceptional mechanical properties and room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing capability.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Yet Sustainable Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Sulfur&#8208;Rich Polymer Composite with MXene Segregated Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental sulfur&#160;generated from petroleum refining as a huge waste&#160;is upcycled to sulfur&#8208;rich polymer (SRP)&#160;and this new polymer is applied to construct a sustainable and high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). TENG output performance is maximized by introducing MXene segregated&#160;structure integrated sulfur&#8208;rich polymer/MXene composite. This TENG demonstrated 8.4 times higher peak power density than that of the previous record from SRP&#8208;based TENGs.









Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) typically employ fluoropolymers, highly negative chargeable materials in triboelectric series. However, many researchers nowadays are concerned about environmental pollution caused by poly&#8208;and per&#8208;fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) due to their critical immunotoxicity as fluoropolymers are likely to release PFAS into the ecosystem during their life cycle. Herein, a sulfur&#8208;rich polymer (SRP)/MXene composite, offering high&#8208;performance yet sustainable TENG is developed. Value&#8208;addition of sulfur into SRP&#8208;based TENG has huge advantages since sulfur is abundant waste from petroleum refining and possesses the highest electron affinity (&#8722;200&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1) among polymerizable atoms. MXene segregated structure is introduced into SRP to achieve homogeneous distribution without electrical percolation by utilizing below 0.5&#160;wt% of MXene, resulting in a significantly enhanced dielectric constant without a drastic increase of dielectric loss. Due to homogeneous MXene distribution, SRP/MXene composite&#8208;based TENG demonstrates 2.9 times and 19.5 times enhances peak voltage and peak current compared to previous SRP&#8208;based TENGs. Additionally, it exhibits reusability without critical reduction of modulus and TENG performance due to dynamically exchangeable disulfide bonds. Finally, after the corona discharging and scaling&#8208;up process to a 4&#8208;inch wafer size, SRP/MXene composite&#8208;based TENG exhibits an 8.4 times improvement in peak power density, reaching 3.80&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 compared to previous SRP&#8208;based TENGs.

         <title>Cu/CuxO/Graphdiyne Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst of Cu/CuxO nanoparticles on graphdiyne (Cu/CuxO/GDY) with tandem catalytic mechanism is successfully designed. The Cu/CuxO/GDY catalyst exhibits high NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), revealing the enormous potentials of graphdiyne as a tandem catalyst to improve NO3RR kinetics and providing a new direction for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the low yield rate and poor selectivity toward NH3 product is a technical challenge. Here a graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based tandem catalyst featuring Cu/CuxO nanoparticles anchored to GDY support (termed Cu/CuxO/GDY) for efficient electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction is presented. A high NH3 yield rate of 25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 (25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.8% at an applied potential of &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE using the designed catalyst is achieved. These performance metrics outperform most reported NO3&#8722; to NH3 catalysts in the alkaline media. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory reveal that the NO3&#8722; preferentially attacks Cu/CuxO, and the GDY can effectively catalyze the reduction of NO2&#8722; to NH3. This work highlights the efficacy of GDY as a new class of tandem catalysts for the artificial nitrogen cycle and provides powerful guidelines for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.

&lt;/i&gt;O nanoparticles on graphdiyne (Cu/Cu&lt;i&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the low yield rate and poor selectivity toward NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; product is a technical challenge. Here a graphdiyne (GDY)-based tandem catalyst featuring Cu/Cu&lt;i&gt;

These performance metrics outperform most reported NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Probiotics Vesicles Coating for Titanium Implant Infections Through Bacterial Cuproptosis&#8208;Like Death and Immunoregulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers develop an innovative coating for titanium implants that combats infections and promotes healing. By combining ultrasound&#8208;activated metal&#8208;organic frameworks and probiotics, the coating triggers bacterial death and immune responses, enhancing antibacterial and bone regeneration effects. This method shows promise for preventing implant&#8208;related infections and promoting recovery, representing a significant advancement in medical implants.








Abstract
Implant&#8208;associated infections (IAIs) are the main cause of prosthetic implant failure. Bacterial biofilms prevent antibiotic penetration, and the unique metabolic conditions in hypoxic biofilm microenvironment may limit the efficacy of conventional antibiotic treatment. Escaping survival bacteria may not be continually eradicated, resulting in the recurrence of IAIs. Herein, a sonosensitive metal&#8208;organic framework of Cu&#8208;TCPP (tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) nanosheets and tinidazole doped probiotic&#8208;derived membrane vesicles (OMVs) with high&#8208;penetration sonodynamic therapy (SDT), bacterial metabolic state interference, and bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death to eradicate IAIs is proposed. The Cu&#8208;TCPP can convert O2 to toxic 1O2 through SDT in the normoxic conditions, enhancing the hypoxic microenvironment and activating the antibacterial activity of tinidazole. The released Cu(II) under ultrasound can be converted to Cu(I) by exogenous poly(tannic acid) (pTA) and endogenous glutathione. The disruption of the bacterial membrane by SDT can enhance the Cu(I) transporter activity. Transcriptomics indicate that the SDT&#8208;enhanced Cu(I) overload and hypoxia&#8208;activated therapy hinder the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), leading to bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death. Moreover, the OMVs&#8208;activated therapy can polarize macrophages to a M2&#8208;like phenotype and facilitate bone repair. The sonodynamic biofilm microenvironment modulation strategy, whereby the hypoxia&#8208;enhanced microenvironment is potentiated to synergize SDT with OMVs&#8208;activated therapy, provides an effective strategy for antibacterial and osteogenesis performance.

         <title>High Throughput Characterization of Organic Thin Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective article provides a comprehensive overview of how the research group has adopted &#8220;hybrid automation&#8221; by using simple automatic electrical testers (autotesters) as a tool to increase productivity and enhance reproducibility in organic thin film transistor (OTFT) research. The autotester enables OTFT research acceleration within the large parameter spaces created by both diverse material roles and device architectures.








Abstract
Automation is vital to accelerating research. In recent years,&#160;the application of self&#8208;driving labs to materials discovery and device optimization has highlighted many benefits and challenges inherent to these new technologies. Successful automated workflows offer tangible benefits to fundamental science and industrial scale&#8208;up by significantly increasing productivity and reproducibility all while enabling entirely new types of experiments. However, it's implemtation is often time&#8208;consuming and cost&#8208;prohibitive and necessitates establishing multidisciplinary teams that bring together domain&#8208;specific knowledge with specific skillsets in computer science and engineering. This perspective article provides a comprehensive overview of how the research group has adopted &#8220;hybrid automation&#8221; over the last 8 years by using simple automatic electrical testers (autotesters) as a tool to increase productivity and enhance reproducibility in organic thin film transistor (OTFT) research. From wearable and stretchable electronics to next&#8208;generation sensors and displays, OTFTs have the potential to be a key technology that will enable new applications from health to aerospace. The combination of materials chemistry, device manufacturing, thin film characterization and electrical engineering makes OTFT research challenging due to the large parameter space created by both diverse material roles and device architectures. Consequently, this research stands to benefit enormously from automation. By leveraging the multidisciplinary team and taking a user&#8208;centered design approach in the design and continued improvement of the autotesters, the group has meaningfully increased productivity, explored research avenues impossible with traditional workflows, and developed as scientists and engineers capable of effectively designing and leveraging automation to build the future of their fields to encourage this approach, the files for replicating the infrastructure are included, and questions and potential
collaborations are welcomed.

         <title>High Sensitivity X&#8208;Ray Detectors with Low Degradation Based on Deuterated Halide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to achieve ultrasensitive and stable X&#8208;ray detectors through isotope engineering is developed. The ion migration of organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite single crystals is significantly suppressed, achieving five times higher stability and X&#8208;ray detection performance. The progress of this paper provides a new route to accelerate the adoption of perovskites in X&#8208;ray imaging and medical applications.








Abstract
Methylammonium lead single crystal (MAPbI3 SC) possesses superior optoelectronic properties and low manufacturing cost, making it an ideal candidate for X&#8208;ray detection. However, the ionic migration of the perovskites usually leads to instability, dark current drift, and hysteresis of the detector, limiting their applications in well&#8208;established technologies. Here, a series of X&#8208;ray detectors of MAPbI3 SCs are reported with different degrees of deuteration (DxMAPbI3, x = 0, 0.15, 0.75, 0.99). By controlling the content of deuterium (D) in organic cations, the sensitivity, detection limits, ion migration, and resistivity of the detector can be controlled, thereby improving its performance. Due to stronger hydrogen bonds (N&#9472;D&#183;&#183;&#183;I), the ion activation energy significantly increases to 886 meV. Consequently, the D0.99MAPbI3 SC detector shows more than five&#8208;fold enhancement, achieving a record&#8208;high mobility&#8211;lifetime (&#181;&#964;) product of 5.39&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;2&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1, with an ultrahigh sensitivity of 2.18 &#215; 106 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 under 120&#160;keV hard X&#8208;ray and a low detection limit of 4.8 nGyair s&#8722;1, as well as long&#8208;term stability. The study provides a straightforward strategy for constructing ultrasensitive X&#8208;ray detection and imaging systems based on perovskite SCs.

         <title>Scalable Layer&#8208;Controlled Oxidation of Bi2O2Se for Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristor Arrays With sub&#8208;pA Sneak Currents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving controllable oxidation of single&#8208;crystal Bi2O2Se through the development of large&#8208;scale UV&#8208;assisted intercalative oxidation allowed for the construction of &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se heterostructures. The &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se memristor exhibited remarkable self&#8208;rectifying memristive performance, including ultra&#8208;high ON/OFF and rectification ratios, and nonlinearity. The scalable production of self&#8208;rectifying memristor arrays is successfully demonstrated, showcasing sub&#8208;pA sneak currents, desirable to minimize cross&#8208;talk effects in high&#8208;density memristor arrays.








Abstract
Smart memristors with innovative properties are crucial for the advancement of next&#8208;generation information storage and bioinspired neuromorphic computing. However, the presence of significant sneak currents in large&#8208;scale memristor arrays results in operational errors and heat accumulation, hindering their practical utility. This study successfully synthesizes a quasi&#8208;free&#8208;standing Bi2O2Se single&#8208;crystalline film and achieves layer&#8208;controlled oxidation by developing large&#8208;scale UV&#8208;assisted intercalative oxidation, resulting &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se heterostructures. The resulting &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se memristor demonstrates remarkable self&#8208;rectifying resistive switching performance (over 105 for ON/OFF and rectification ratios, as well as nonlinearity) in both nanoscale (through conductive atomic force microscopy) and microscale (through memristor array) regimes. Furthermore, the potential for scalable production of self&#8208;rectifying &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se memristor, achieving sub&#8208;pA sneak currents to minimize cross&#8208;talk effects in high&#8208;density memristor arrays is demonstrated. The memristors also exhibit ultrafast resistive switching (sub&#8208;100&#160;ns) and low power consumption (1.2 pJ) as characterized by pulse&#8208;mode testing. The findings suggest a synergetic effect of interfacial Schottky barriers and oxygen vacancy migration as the self&#8208;rectifying switching mechanism, elucidated through controllable &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5 thickness modulation and theoretical ab initio calculations.

         <title>Precisely Tunable Instantaneous Carbon Rearrangement Enables Low&#8208;Working&#8208;Potential Hard Carbon Toward Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Enhanced Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable hard carbon (HC) with precisely tunable graphitic micro&#8208;domains and closed nanopores is achieved through a transient sintering&#8208;involved kinetically controlled synthesis. This advancement realizes HC anodes with significantly prolonged low&#8208;voltage plateaus below 0.1&#160;V, with the optimal sample exhibiting a plateau capacity of 325&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. The energy density of the assembled HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 full battery is therefore increased by 20.7%.








Abstract
As the preferred anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hard carbon (HC) confronts significant obstacles in providing a long and dominant low&#8208;voltage plateau to boost the output energy density of full batteries. The critical challenge lies in precisely enhancing the local graphitization degree to minimize Na+ ad&#8208;/chemisorption, while effectively controlling the growth of internal closed nanopores to maximize Na+ filling. Unfortunately, traditional high&#8208;temperature preparation methods struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously. Herein, a transient sintering&#8208;involved kinetically&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy is proposed that enables the creation of metastable HCs with precisely tunable carbon phases and low discharge/charge voltage plateaus. By optimizing the temperature and width of thermal pulses, the high&#8208;throughput screened HCs are characterized by short&#8208;range ordered graphitic micro&#8208;domains that possess accurate crystallite width and height, as well as appropriately&#8208;sized closed nanopores. This advancement realizes HC anodes with significantly prolonged low&#8208;voltage plateaus below 0.1&#160;V, with the best sample exhibiting a high plateau capacity of up to 325&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. The energy density of the HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 full battery can therefore be increased by 20.7%. Machine learning study explicitly unveils the &#8220;carbon phase evolution&#8722;electrochemistry&#8221; relationship. This work promises disruptive changes to the synthesis, optimization, and commercialization of HC anodes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Enabled Tomographic Imaging of Chemical Short&#8208;Range Atomic Ordering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning enhanced approach is introduced to break the inherent resolution limitation of atom probe tomography, and precisely image multiple arrangements of atoms associated with (non&#8208;) statistical chemical short&#8208;range order, in three dimensions, in CoCrNi medium&#8208;entropy alloys with no prior knowledge of the presence of chemical short&#8208;range order or which type.








Abstract
In solids, chemical short&#8208;range order (CSRO) refers to the self&#8208;organization of atoms of certain species occupying specific crystal sites. CSRO is increasingly being envisaged as a lever to tailor the mechanical and functional properties of materials. Yet quantitative relationships between properties and the morphology, number density, and atomic configurations of CSRO domains remain elusive. Herein, it is showcased how machine learning&#8208;enhanced atom probe tomography (APT) can mine the near&#8208;atomically resolved APT data and jointly exploit the technique's high elemental sensitivity to provide a 3D quantitative analysis of CSRO in a CoCrNi medium&#8208;entropy alloy. Multiple CSRO configurations are revealed, with their formation supported by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations. Quantitative analysis of these CSROs allows establishing relationships between processing parameters and physical properties. The unambiguous characterization of CSRO will help refine strategies for designing advanced materials by manipulating atomic&#8208;scale architectures.

         <dc:description>
The CIP solvated structure models with the faster kinetic process are established by introducing a multifunctional tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate initiator/additive in pDOL polymer system. A robust anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich interphase is constructed for excellent reversibility of Li plating/stripping and superior quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer lithium metal batteries are an important strategy for achieving high safety and high energy density. However, the issue of Li dendrites and inherent inferior interface greatly restricts practical application. Herein, this study introduces tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate solvent with moderate solvation ability, which can not only complex with Li+ to promote the in&#8208;situ ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL), but also build solvated structure models to explore the effect of different solvation structures in the polymer electrolyte. Thereinto, it is dominated by the contact ion pair solvated structure with pDOL chain segments forming less lithium bonds, exhibiting faster kinetic process and constructing a robust anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich interphase, which significantly improves the utilization rate of active Li and the high&#8208;voltage resistance of pDOL. As a result, it exhibits stable cycling at ultra&#8208;high areal capacity of 20 mAh cm&#8722;2 in half cells, and an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 2000&#160;h in symmetric cells can be realized. Furthermore, matched with LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 cathode, the capacity retention after 60 cycles is as high as 96.8% at N/P value of 3.33. Remarkably, 0.7 Ah Li||LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 pouch cell with an energy density of 461&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 can be stably cycled for five cycles at 100% depth of discharge.

         <title>Multidentate Fullerenes Enable Tunable and Robust Interfacial Bonding for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four well&#8208;defined multidentate fullerenes on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Due to favorable energy level alignment and interface interactions, devices based on FM5 achieved a PCE of 15.05%, ranking among the top&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Improving the efficiency of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) is significantly hindered by energy level mismatch and weak interactions at the interface between the tin&#8208;based perovskite and fullerene&#8208;based electron transport layers (ETLs). In this study, four well&#8208;defined multidentate fullerene molecules with 3, 4, 5, and 6 diethylmalonate groups, labeled as FM3, FM4, FM5, and FM6 are synthesized, and employed as interfacial layers in TPSCs. It is observed that increasing the number of functional groups in these fullerenes leads to shallower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and enhance interfacial chemical interactions. Notably, FM5 exhibits a suitable energy level and robust interaction with the perovskite, effectively enhancing electron extraction and defect passivation. Additionally, the unique molecular structure of FM5 allows the exposed carbon cage to be tightly stacked with the upper fullerene cage after interaction with the perovskite, facilitating efficient charge transfer and protecting the perovskite from moisture and oxygen damage. As a result, the FM5&#8208;based device achieves a champion efficiency of 15.05%, significantly surpassing that of the PCBM&#8208;based (11.77%), FM3&#8208;based (13.54%), FM4&#8208;based (14.34%), and FM6&#8208;based (13.75%) devices. Moreover, the FM5&#8208;based unencapsulated device exhibits excellent stability, maintaining over 90% of its initial efficiency even after 300 h of air exposure.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via Thermodynamic Crystallization Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional crystallization control strategy by ingenious vapor design is developed for preparing high&#8208;quality perovskite films. The target perovskite films exhibit efficient energy transfer and minimized charge loss. Consequently, a series of red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with record peak external quantum efficiency over 32%, along with remarkable half&#8208;lifetime are obtained.








Abstract
Efficient and stable red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) demonstrate promising potential in high&#8208;definition displays and biomedical applications. Although significant progress has been made in device performance, meeting commercial demands remains a challenge in the aspects of long&#8208;term stability and high external quantum efficiency (EQE). Here, an in situ crystallization regulation strategy is developed for optimizing red perovskite films through ingenious vapor design. Mixed vapor containing dimethyl sulfoxide and carbon disulfide (CS2) is incorporated to conventional annealing, which contributes to thermodynamics dominated perovskite crystallization for well&#8208;aligned cascade phase arrangement. Additionally, the perovskite surface defect density is minimized by the CS2 molecule adsorption. Consequently, the target perovskite films exhibit smooth exciton energy transfer, reduced defect density, and blocked ion migration pathways. Leveraging these advantages, spectrally stable red PeLEDs are obtained featuring emission at 668, 656, and 648&#160;nm, which yield record peak EQEs of 30.08%, 32.14%, and 29.04%, along with prolonged half&#8208;lifetimes of 47.7, 60.0, and 43.7&#160;h at the initial luminances of 140, 250, and 270&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides a universal strategy for optimizing perovskite crystallization and represents a significant stride toward the commercialization of red PeLEDs.

         <title>Robust Imidazole&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Enabling Crystallization Regulation and Bulk Defect Passivation for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D porous channels and high crystalline orientation of imidazole&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (PyPor&#8208;COF) facilitate the crystallization and defect elimination of the perovskite film. The recombination of photogenerated carriers is thus reduced and the perovskite solar cells exhibit excellent efficiency and high stability.








Abstract
The low crystallinity of the perovskite layers and many defects at grain boundaries within the bulk phase and at interfaces are considered huge barriers to the attainment of high performance and stability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a robust photoelectric imidazole&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (PyPor&#8208;COF) is introduced to precisely control the perovskite crystallization process and effectively passivate defects at grain boundaries through a sequential deposition method. The 1D porous channels, abundant active sites, and high crystallization orientation of PyPor&#8208;COF offer advantages for regulating the crystallization of PbI2 and eliminating defects. Moreover, the intrinsic electronic characteristics of PyPor&#8208;COF endow a more closely matched energy level arrangement within the perovskite layer, which promotes charge transport and thereby suppresses the recombination of photogenerated carriers. The champion PSCs containing PyPor&#8208;COF achieved power conversion efficiencies of 24.10% (0.09 cm2) and 20.81% (1.0 cm2), respectively. The unpackaged optimized device is able to maintain its initial efficiency of 80.39% even after being exposed to air for 2000 h. The device also exhibits excellent heating stability and light stability. This work gives a new impetus to the development of highly efficient and stable PSCs via employing COFs.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Inspired, Self&#8208;Healing, Highly Effective Fully Polymeric Fire&#8208;Retardant Coatings Enabled by Group Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the multifunctions of mussel's catechol groups, here a pioneering &#8220;group synergy&#8221; design strategy has been proposed to create a waterborne fully polymeric fire&#8208;retardant coating that exhibits self&#8208;healing, strong adhesion, and superior fire protection for various substrates from polymer foams to steel structures. These results offer a promising design principle for creating high&#8208;performance fire&#8208;retardant coatings.









Abstract
Fire&#8208;retardant coatings represent a universal cost&#8208;effective approach to providing fire protection for various substrates without compromising substrates&#8217; bulk properties. However, it has been attractive yet highly challenging to create waterborne polymeric fire&#8208;retardant coatings combining high&#8208;efficiency, generally strong adhesion, and self&#8208;repairability due to a lack of rational design principles. Inspired by mussel's unique adhesive, self&#8208;healing, and char&#8208;forming mechanisms, herein, a &#8220;group synergy&#8221; design strategy is proposed to realize the combination of self&#8208;healing, strong adhesion, and high efficiency in a fully polymeric fire&#8208;retardant coating via multiple synergies between catechol, phosphonic, and hydroxyethyl groups. As&#8208;created fire&#8208;retardant coating exhibits a rapid room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing ability and strong adhesion to (non)polar substrates due to multiple dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions enabled by these groups. Because these functional groups enable the formation of a robust structurally intact yet slightly expanded char layer upon exposure to flame, a 200&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick such coating can make extremely flammable polystyrene foam very difficult to ignite and self&#8208;extinguishing, which far outperforms previous strategies. Moreover, this coating can provide universal exceptional fire protection for a variety of substrates from polymer foams, and timber, to fabric and steel. This work presents a promising material design principle to create next&#8208;generation sustainable high&#8208;performance fire&#8208;retardant coatings for general fire protection.

Engineered Regenerative Isolated Peripheral Nerve Interface
An engineered regenerative isolated peripheral nerve interface (eRIPEN) is developed using 3D bioprinting of myoblasts and skeletal muscle&#8208;derived decellularized extracellular matrix bioink, along with direct electrospinning to create a nanofiber membrane&#8208;envelope for in vivo host nerve implantation. More details can be found in article number 2406652 by Dong&#8208;Woo Cho, Dong Sung Kim, Junesun Kim, and co&#8208;workers.

3D&#8208;Printed Latticed Microneedles
3D&#8208;printed latticed microneedle array patches (L&#8208;MAPs) are a modular platform for minimally invasive drug delivery into the skin. L&#8208;MAPs can deliver diverse payloads, with multiple cargo release profiles on a single patch. Release kinetics can be tuned as a function of needle geometry and cargo formulation. This platform opens up opportunities to scale up transdermal drug delivery. More details can be found in article number 2404606 by Netra Rajesh, Jillian Perry, Joseph DeSimone, and co&#8208;workers.

Quantum Cutting
Quantum cutting (QC) allows the conversion of high&#8208;energy photons into lower&#8208;energy photons, exhibiting great potential for infrared communications. In article number 20245973, Tze Chien Sum, Annalisa Bruno, Subodh G. Mhaisalkar, and co&#8208;workers report stable and highly emissive Yb&#8208;doped perovskite quantum cutters engineered by machine learning. They develop a ligands engineering method through a newly phosphine oxide synthesis route, driving the study of fundamental physics phenomena and near&#8208;infrared quantum communications.

         <title>Quantitative in Vivo Molecular MRI</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative molecular MRI is essential in preclinical research and drug development. This review aims to provide guidance to chemists developing MR imaging probes in terms of in vitro and in vivo validation to accelerate the translation of new tools for non&#8208;invasive quantitative imaging of biological processes.








Abstract
Molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combines chemistry, chemical biology, and imaging techniques to track molecular events non&#8208;invasively. Quantitative molecular MRI aims to provide meaningful, reproducible numerical measurements of molecular processes or biochemical targets within the body. In this review, the classifications of molecular MRI probes based on their signal&#8208;generating mechanism and functionality are first described. From there, the primary considerations for in vitro characterization and in vivo validation of molecular MRI probes, including how to avoid pitfalls and biases are discussed. Then, recommendations on imaging acquisition protocols and analysis methods to establish quantitative relationships between MRI signal change induced by the probes and the molecular processes of interest are provided. Finally, several representative case studies are highlighted that incorporate these features. Quantitative molecular MRI is a multidisciplinary research area incorporating expertise in chemical biology, inorganic chemistry, molecular probes, imaging physics, drug development, pathobiology, and medicine. The purpose of this review is to provide guidance to chemists developing MR imaging probes and methods in terms of in vitro and in vivo validation to accelerate the translation of these new quantitative tools for non&#8208;invasive imaging of biological processes.

         <title>Affinity&#8208;Controlled Partitioning of Biomolecules at Aqueous Interfaces and Their Bioanalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, an in&#8208;depth exploration of all&#8208;aqueous phase separation systems and their potential applications in bioanalytics is provided. The key concepts, such as affinity&#8208;induced interfacial phenomena,&#160; and associated applications including interfacial chemical reactions, bioprinting, and biosensing, are comprehensively discussed. Challenges, particularly in stabilizing all&#8208;aqueous interfaces and handling low&#8208;volume samples, as well as future directions, including optimizing material compositions and refining protocols to advance the field, are also presented.








Abstract
All&#8208;aqueous phase separation systems play essential roles in bioanalytical and biochemical applications. Compared to conventional oil and organic solvent&#8208;based systems, these systems are characterized by their rich bulk and interfacial properties, offering superior biocompatibility. In particular, phase separation in all&#8208;aqueous systems facilitates the creation of compartments with specific physicochemical properties, and therefore largely enhances the accessibility of the systems. In addition, the all&#8208;aqueous compartments have diverse affinities, with an important property known as partitioning, which can concentrate (bio)molecules toward distinct immiscible phases. This partitioning affinity imparts all&#8208;aqueous interfaces with selective permeability, enabling the controlled enrichment of target (bio)molecules. This review introduces the basic principles and applications of partitioning&#8208;induced interfacial phenomena in a typical all&#8208;aqueous system, namely aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPSs); these applications include interfacial chemical reactions, bioprinting, and assembly, as well as bio&#8208;sensing and detection. The primary challenges associated with designing all&#8208;aqueous phase separation systems and several future directions are also discussed, such as the stabilization of aqueous interfaces, the handling of low&#8208;volume samples, and exploration of suitable ATPSs compositions with the efficient protocol.

         <title>Surface Defects Control Bulk Carrier Densities in Polycrystalline Pb&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping, the controlled addition of imperfections or impurities to a material, is crucial for semiconductors. This study shows that for&#160;Halide Perovskites, which have (very) low (intrinsic) defect densities because of&#160;effective self&#8208;healing and defect tolerance,&#160;the title's statement holds in an unprecedented fashion.








Abstract
The (opto)electronic behavior of semiconductors depends on their (quasi&#8208;)free electronic carrier densities. These are regulated by semiconductor doping, i.e., controlled &#8220;electronic contamination&#8221;. For metal halide perovskites (HaPs), the functional materials in several device types, which already challenge some of the understanding of semiconductor properties, this study shows that doping type, density and properties derived from these, are to a first approximation controlled via their surfaces. This effect, relevant to all semiconductors, and already found for some, is very evident for lead (Pb)&#8208;HaPs because of their intrinsically low electrically active bulk and surface defect densities. Volume carrier densities for most polycrystalline Pb&#8208;HaP films (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m grain diameter) are below those resulting from even &lt; 0.1% of surface sites being electrically active defects. This implies and is consistent with interfacial defects controlling HaP devices in multi&#8208;layered structures with most of the action at the two HaP interfaces. Surface and interface passivation effects on bulk electrical properties are relevant to all semiconductors and are crucial for developing those used today. However, because bulk dopant introduction in HaPs at controlled ppm levels for electronic&#8208;relevant carrier densities is so difficult, passivation effects are vastly more critical and dominate, to first approximation, their optoelectronic characteristics in devices.

     alt="Surface Defects Control Bulk Carrier Densities in Polycrystalline Pb-Halide Perovskites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doping, the controlled addition of imperfections or impurities to a material, is crucial for semiconductors. This study shows that for&#160;Halide Perovskites, which have (very) low (intrinsic) defect densities because of&#160;effective self-healing and defect tolerance,&#160;the title's statement holds in an unprecedented fashion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The (opto)electronic behavior of semiconductors depends on their (quasi-)free electronic carrier densities. These are regulated by semiconductor doping, i.e., controlled &#8220;electronic contamination&#8221;. For metal halide perovskites (HaPs), the functional materials in several device types, which already challenge some of the understanding of semiconductor properties, this study shows that doping type, density and properties derived from these, are to a first approximation controlled via their surfaces. &lt;i&gt;This effect, relevant to all semiconductors&lt;/i&gt;, and already found for some, is very evident for lead (Pb)-HaPs because of their intrinsically low electrically active bulk and surface defect densities. &lt;i&gt;Volume&lt;/i&gt; carrier densities for most polycrystalline Pb-HaP films (&amp;lt;1&#160;&#181;m grain diameter) are below those resulting from even &amp;lt; 0.1% of surface sites being electrically active defects. This implies and is consistent with interfacial defects controlling HaP devices in multi-layered structures with most of the action at the two HaP interfaces. Surface and interface passivation effects on bulk electrical properties are relevant to all semiconductors and are crucial for developing those used today. However, because bulk dopant introduction in HaPs at controlled ppm levels for electronic-relevant carrier densities is so difficult, passivation effects are vastly more critical and dominate, to first approximation, their optoelectronic characteristics in devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Nematic Graphene Films with a mesoporous Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition method is presented for the precise fabrication of chiral nematic graphene film, which exhibits uniform Na plating without dendrite formation and noteworthy thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding performance. This work paves the way for creating a large family of chiral nematic materials in various applications of photoelectric conversion, energy storage, electromagnetism, and separation.








Abstract
Ordering a crucial material like pure&#8208;graphene into the chiral nematic structure can potentially revolutionize the fields of photonics, chiral separation, and energy storage. However, the controlled fabrication of highly ordered graphene films with a long&#8208;range chiral nematic mesoporous structure is very challenging and as such, has not been achieved. Here, a chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition growth strategy is presented for the precise fabrication of mesoporous chiral nematic graphene films by using nanocrystalline cellulose as templates. It is evidenced that such graphene films possess the left&#8208;hand helical ordering, chiral nematic mesoporous structure with adjustable pore sizes (6.4&#8211;13.1&#160;nm), tailored pitch, excellent electrical conductivity (556 S cm&#8722;1), high specific surface area (1508 m2&#160;g&#8722;1) and mechanical flexibility. By coating Na anode with this film, uniform Na plating is achieved with no dendrite formation, resulting from its unique chiral nematic structure and tunable physicochemical properties. The films also achieved impressive thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding, i.e., 35&#8211;63&#160;dB, demonstrating their potentially multi&#8208;disciplinary applications.

         <title>Unlocking Electrostrain in Plastically Deformed Barium Titanate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dislocation engineering strategy is introduced to unlock electrostrains and piezoelectric properties in lead&#8208;free BaTiO3 single crystals, achieving a record&#8208;high strain energy density and large piezoelectric coefficient through domain structure design and controlled switching, with broad implications for advanced actuator applications.








Abstract
Achieving substantial electrostrain alongside a large effective piezoelectric strain coefficient (d33*) in piezoelectric materials remains a formidable challenge for advanced actuator applications. Here, a straightforward approach to enhance these properties by strategically designing the domain structure and controlling the domain switching through the introduction of arrays of ordered {100}&lt;100&gt; dislocations is proposed. This dislocation engineering yields an intrinsic lock&#8208;in steady&#8211;state electrostrain of 0.69% at a low field of 10&#160;kV&#160;cm&#8722;1 without external stress and an output strain energy density of 5.24&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 in single&#8208;crystal BaTiO3, outperforming the benchmark piezoceramics and relaxor ferroelectric single&#8208;crystals. Additionally, applying a compression stress of 6&#160;MPa fully unlocks electrostrains exceeding 1%, yielding a remarkable d33* value over 10&#160;000&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 and achieving a record&#8208;high strain energy density of 11.67&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3. Optical and transmission electron microscopy, paired with laboratory and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, is employed to rationalize the observed electrostrain. Phase&#8208;field simulations further elucidate the impact of charged dislocations on domain nucleation and domain switching. These findings present an effective and sustainable strategy for developing high&#8208;performance, lead&#8208;free piezoelectric materials without the need for additional chemical elements, offering immense potential for actuator technologies.

         <title>A Synergistically Enhanced Triboelectric&#8208;Electromagnetic Hybrid Generator Enabled by Multifunctional Amorphous Alloy for Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Powered System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating multifunctional Fe72Si8B20 into the hybrid generator not only increases the output current and current retention of TENG by 28.75% and 85.24%, respectively, but also boosts the output power of EMG by 51.05%. Additionally, the variable impedance system effectively utilizes the output characteristics of TENG and EMG, resulting in a 198% improvement in energy utilization efficiency compared to conventional constant impendence systems.








Abstract
Triboelectric&#8208;electromagnetic hybrid generator (TEHG) has emerged as an effective technology for mechanical energy harvesting. However, the independent operation of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and electromagnetic generator (EMG), along with tribo&#8208;materials wear and magnetic field divergence, constrain the device's overall performance. To address these challenges, a synergistically enhanced TEHG (SE&#8208;TEHG) is proposed based on the multifunctional amorphous alloy. Following detailed material analyses, Fe72Si8B20 is selected as the synergistic layer for its low surface roughness, high Vickers&#8208;hardness, amorphous structure, and high magnetization. Compared to Al, this material not only boosts TENG's output current and current retention rate by 28.75% and 85.24%, but also improves EMG's output power by 51.05%. In constructing a self&#8208;powered system with TEHG, a significant impedance discrepancy exists between the energy harvester (with matched impendence of 16 M&#937; for TENG and 110 k&#937; for EMG) and the application end. Without power management circuits, the demonstrated self&#8208;powered variable impedance system achieves an energy utilization efficiency that is 2.98 times greater than the conventional constant impedance system. The integration of multifunctional materials to realize strong&#8208;coupling hybrid generators, combined with the customization of variable impedance systems, set a milestone in efficient mechanical energy harvesting and utilization.

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Switched Microwave Response of MXene in Organic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible electrochemically adjustable electromagnetic interference shielding devices are developed based on the tunable charging states and surface chemistry of Ti3C2Tx MXene. By integrating the electromagnetic switching device with Salisbury screen and double&#8208;layer resonant cavity structure, dynamic camouflage and wave&#8208;absorbing switch are achieved, respectively. This versatile device holds promise for future advanced electromagnetic protection, stealth, camouflage, and other applications.








Abstract
The increasingly complex electromagnetic (EM) environment necessitates advanced electrically controllable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials that can adapt to varying EM conditions. This study develops a flexible electrochemically tunable EMI shielding device based on ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene films, exhibiting reversible shielding effectiveness (SE) modulation from 18.9 to 26.2&#160;dB in X band at 0.1 and &#8722;1.5&#160;V. Unlike the previously reported mechanism relying on interlayer spacing adjustments, the work leverages transformations of charging state and surface chemistry for tunability during the electrochemical process. The Ti3C2Tx flake size is also evidenced to play a crucial role, with smaller flakes offering higher absorption modulation despite lower SE modulation, enabling the device with high designability. When integrated with Salisbury screen structure, the device achieves adjustable absorption from 93.560% at 0.1&#160;V to 99.996% at &#8722;1&#160;V, showing a tunable reflection suppression ratio up to 32&#160;dB with an effective bandwidth of 4.2&#160;GHz. Additionally, incorporating resonant cavity structure enables absorption&#8208;dominated (over 90%) microwave&#8208;responsive switching at 0.1 and &#8722;1.5&#160;V. This work highlights significant potential of adaptive EMI shielding materials for applications in smart electronic protection, EM switch, and radar camouflage.

         <title>Impact of Dilute DIO Additive on Local Microstructure of Fluorinated, pNDI&#8208;Based Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of PBDBT: N2200&#8208;based all&#8208;polymer solar cells can be enhanced by processing with dilute diiodooctane solvent additive. This study reveals the microstructural mechanisms that drive charge transport enhancements in these solar cells by combining X&#8208;ray techniques with electron microscopy. Ultimately, the study finds that processing with dilute diiodooctane promotes efficient vertical charge transport pathways while preserving donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial connectivity.








Abstract
The performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells is often enhanced by incorporating solvent additives during solution processing. In particular, blends based on the model all&#8208;polymer system PBDBT:N2200 have been shown to have increased short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor when processed with dilute diiodooctane (DIO). However, the morphological mechanism that drives the increase in performance is often not well understood due to limitations in common characterization techniques. In this study, it is shown that a combination of X&#8208;ray techniques with cryogenic high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis can provide a quantitative and spatially resolved picture of polymer chain orientation and alignment in all&#8208;polymer blends. It is found that DIO induces vertical phase separation in PBDBT&#8208;2F:F&#8208;N2200 and increases donor crystallite thickness in the pi&#8208;stacking direction leading to an acceptor&#8208;rich film surface. However, it is also shown that DIO does not disrupt the formation of face&#8208;on donor&#8211;acceptor interfaces. These findings suggest that dilute DIO primarily affects crystalline domain formation in single component regions as opposed to mixed regions; thus, dilute DIO can impact vertical charge transport pathways without sacrificing donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial connectivity.

         <title>Microenvironment Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanomedicine Promotes Spinal Cord Repair by Suppressing Inflammation Cascade and Neural Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanomedicine (RHNP&#8208;Cur) is capable of consistently crossing the blood spinal cord barrier and selectively targeting inflammatory cells and neural cells based on different stages of spinal cord injury through changes of surface structure and targeted peptide modification, promoting spinal cord repair by suppressing inflammation cascade and neural apoptosis.








Abstract
Despite various biomaterial&#8208;based strategies are tried in spinal cord injury (SCI), developing safe and effective microinvasive pharmacotherapy strategies is still an unmet clinical need. Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomedicine has emerged as a promising non&#8208;invasion technology, which enhances drug delivery and promotes functional recovery following SCI. Considering the multiple progressive pathological events and the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) associating SCI, a microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanoparticle (custom&#8208;designed with rabies virus glycoprotein 29&#8208;RVG29 and hyaluronic acid&#8208;HA, RHNP) capable of consistently crossing the BSCB and selectively targeting inflammatory cells and neural cells based on different stages of SCI are developed. The data indicated that RHNP can effectively traverse the BSCB through RVG29, and adaptively modulate cellular internalization by selectively exposing either HA or RVG29 through diselenide bonds, depending on pathological reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals. Furthermore, curcumin is loaded into RHNP (RHNP&#8208;Cur) to improve motor function and coordination of hind&#8208;limbs in a traumatic SCI mouse model. This study finds that RHNP&#8208;Cur exhibited inhibitory effects on the inflammatory cascade originating from M1 microglia/macrophages and neurotoxic astrocytes, and protected neural cells from inflammation&#8208;induced apoptosis during nerve regeneration. Collectively, the work provides a microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanomedicine which enables efficient microinvasive treatment of SCI.

         <title>Tillandsia&#8208;Inspired Ultra&#8208;Efficient Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hygroscopic Nanofibers for Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Tillandsia, a thermo&#8208;responsive hygroscopic nanofiber called PCP@LiCl is prepared for atmospheric water harvesting. PCP@LiCl exhibits unique kinetics due to the porous structure, capable of adsorbing moisture to saturation within 2&#160;h at 25&#160;&#176;C and 15%&#8211;30% relative humidity and oozing liquid water within 5&#160;min under sunlight.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) is a promising approach for supplying water in off&#8208;grid arid regions. However, it is difficult to improve the SAWH efficiency because water undergoes multiple phase transformations, such as water vapor&#8211;water (desorption and condensation) in the desorption phase. To address this issue, an ultrahygroscopic temperature&#8208;responsive hydrogel nanofiber inspired by Tillandsia is developed, comprising poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide, poly N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, and carbon nanotubes and impregnated with lithium chloride (PCP@LiCl). The hydrophobicity of the nanofiber membrane is enhanced with increasing temperature, facilitating water separation from the hydrogel in liquid form. Moreover, PCP@LiCl exhibits unique kinetics at 25 &#176;C and 15%&#8211;30% relative humidity, capable of adsorbing moisture to saturation within 2&#160;h, and oozing liquid water within 5&#160;min under sunlight. Through global potential modeling, it is demonstrated that PCP@LiCl has potential applications in arid and semiarid regions. This study provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance composites for solar&#8208;powered atmospheric water harvesting.

         <title>High Performance and Colorful Polymer Thermoelectrics with Imprinted Porous Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer films featuring highly ordered periodic porous structures not only demonstrate exceptional thermoelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit, reaching up to 0.52, but also exhibit captivating structural colors and remarkable stretchability.








Abstract
The rapid development of the Internet of Things and wearable electronics has generated growing interest in creating high&#8208;performance and visually striking polymer thermoelectric (TE) devices. However, existing polymer TE materials have yet to fully meet these diverse demands. In this study, imprinted porous polymer films are introduced that exhibit both high TE performance and a spectrum of structural colors. The porous architecture not only preserves excellent charge transport properties but also significantly enhances phonon&#8208;like scattering, resulting in a more than 50% reduction in thermal conductivity for the PDPPSe&#8208;12 film. This leads to a 170% increase in the figure of merit (ZT), achieving a peak value of 0.52 at 363&#160;K. Furthermore, the highly ordered porous structure imparts the PDPPSe&#8208;12 films with both a wide range of structural colors and remarkable stretchability, making them ideal for wearable TE generators. This approach is widely applicable to various polymeric systems, offering a novel strategy for advancing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art plastic TE materials through microstructural engineering.

         <title>Tailorable Fluorescent Perovskite Quantum Dots for Multiform Manufacturing via Two&#8208;Step Thiol&#8208;Ene Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel UV&#8208;induced two&#8208;step thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; is introduced for the tailorable fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (T&#8208;PQDs). A protective shell is formed around the PQDs in the first step, while chemical cross&#8208;linking between PQD and thiol&#8208;ene polymer occurs in the second step. The T&#8208;PQDs offer high efficiency, stability, and processability, facilitating their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.








Abstract
In practical applications, fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) must exhibit high efficiency, stability, and processibility. So far, it remains a challenge to synthesize PQDs with stable dispersibility in tailorable monomers both before and after photocuring. In this work, a novel strategy of UV&#8208;induced two&#8208;step thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; is proposed to prepare PQDs with these attributes. The first step aims to epitaxially grow a shell around the PQD core to ensure stable dispersibility in a thiol&#8208;ene monomer solution. The second step is to achieve stable dispersibility in the photocured thiol&#8208;ene matrixes for multiform manufacturing processes. The tailorable PQDs (T&#8208;PQDs) not only have the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;100% for green emission and over 96% for red emission, but also exhibit remarkable stability under severe conditions, including &#8220;double 85&#8221; aging, water exposure, and mechanical stress. Moreover, their exceptional processability allows for various processing techniques, including slot&#8208;die coating, inkjet printing, direct&#8208;laser writing, UV&#8208;light 3D printing, nanoimprinting, and spin coating. The high efficiency and stability of T&#8208;PQDs facilitate their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.

The tailorable PQDs (T-PQDs) not only have the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;100% for green emission and over 96% for red emission, but also exhibit remarkable stability under severe conditions, including &#8220;double 85&#8221; aging, water exposure, and mechanical stress. Moreover, their exceptional processability allows for various processing techniques, including slot-die coating, inkjet printing, direct-laser writing, UV-light 3D printing, nanoimprinting, and spin coating. The high efficiency and stability of T-PQDs facilitate their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge Generation and Enhancement of Key Components of Triboelectric Nanogenerators: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review classifies and summarizes innovative approaches to enhance the charge density of charge generation, charge trapping, and charge collection layers. The milestone of high charge density TENG is reviewed based on material selection and innovative mechanisms.








Abstract
The past decade has witnessed remarkable progress in high&#8208;performance Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) with the design and synthesis of functional dielectric materials, the exploration of novel dynamic charge transport mechanisms, and the innovative design of architecture, making it one of the most crucial technologies for energy harvesting. High output charge density is fundamental for TENG to expand its application scope and accelerate industrialization; it depends on the dynamic equilibrium of charge generation, trapping, de&#8208;trapping, and migration within its core components. Here, this review classifies and summarizes innovative approaches to enhance the charge density of the charge generation, charge trapping, and charge collection layers. The milestone of high charge density TENG is reviewed based on material selection and innovative mechanisms. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art principles and techniques for generating high charge density and suppressing charge decay are discussed and highlighted in detail, and the distinct charge transport mechanisms, the technologies of advanced materials preparation, and the effective charge excitation strategy are emphatically introduced. Lastly, the bottleneck and future research priorities for boosting the output charge density are summarized. A summary of these cutting&#8208;edge developments intends to provide readers with a deep understanding of the future design of high&#8208;output TENG.

         <title>Engineering Radiocatalytic Nanoliposomes with Hydrophobic Gold Nanoclusters for Radiotherapy Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoliposomes containing hydrophobic gold nanoclusters are engineered, characterized, and evaluated for their radiocatalytic properties for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. These nanoliposomes exhibit promising radiotherapy&#8208;enhancing properties, potential for radiotherapy&#8208;controlled drug delivery, and improved chemoradiotherapy outcomes on 3D pancreatic microtumors. The nanoliposomes exhibit excellent tumor accumulation and also identify further innovations to pave the way toward more effective chemoradiotherapy strategies.








Abstract
Chemoradiation therapy is on the forefront of pancreatic cancer care, and there is a continued effort to improve its safety and efficacy. Liposomes are widely used to improve chemotherapy safety, and may accurately deliver high&#8208;Z element&#8208; radiocatalytic nanomaterials to cancer tissues. In this study, the interaction between X&#8208;rays and long&#8208;circulating nanoliposome formulations loaded with gold nanoclusters is explored in the context of oxaliplatin chemotherapy for desmoplastic pancreatic cancer. Hydrophobic gold nanoclusters stabilized with dodecanethiol (AuDDT) are efficiently incorporated in nanoliposomal bilayers. AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes significantly augmented radiation&#8208;induced &#8226;OH production, which is most effective with monochromatic X&#8208;rays at energies that exceed the K&#8208;shell electron binding energy of Au (81.7&#160;keV). Cargo release assays reveal that AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes can permeabilize lipid bilayers in an X&#8208;ray dose&#8208; and formulation&#8208;dependent manner. The radiocatalytic effect of AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes significantly augments radiotherapy and oxaliplatin&#8208;chemoradiotherapy outcomes in 3D pancreatic microtumors. The PEGylated AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes display high tumor accumulation in an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer, showing promise for nanoliposomes as carriers for radiocatalytic nanomaterials. Altogether, compelling proof for chemo&#8208;radiation dose&#8208;enhancement using AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes is presented. Further improving the nanoliposomal loading of high&#8208;Z elements will advance the safety, efficacy, and translatability of such chemoradiation dose&#8208;enhancement approaches.

         <title>Synthesis Strategies for High Entropy Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for high entropy materials nanoparticles preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms.








Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) of high entropy materials (HEMs) have attracted significant attention due to their versatility and wide range of applications. HEM NPs can be synthesized by fragmenting bulk HEMs or disintegrating and recrystallizing them. Alternatively, directly producing HEMs in NP form from atomic/ionic/molecular precursors presents a significant challenge. A widely adopted strategy involves thermodynamically driving HEM NP formation by leveraging the entropic contribution but incorporating strategies to limit NP growth at the elevated temperatures used for maximizing entropy. A second approach is to kinetically drive HEM NP formation by promoting rapid reactions of homogeneous reactant mixtures or using highly diluted precursor dissolutions. Additionally, experimental evidence suggests that enthalpy plays a significant role in driving HEM NP formation processes at moderate temperatures, with the high energy cost of generating additional surfaces and interfaces at the nanoscale stabilizing the HEM phase. This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for HEM NP preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms. Such insights are critical for fine&#8208;tuning experimental conditions to achieve specific outcomes, ultimately enabling the effective synthesis of optimized generations of these advanced materials for both current and emerging applications across various scientific and technological fields.

         <title>Durable Organic Coating&#8208;Free Superhydrophobic Metal Surface by Paracrystalline State Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic coating&#8208;free durable self&#8208;superhydrophobic metal surface is achieved by a strategy of femtosecond laser element doping microstructuring on Al alloys followed by repetitive low&#8208;temperature annealing in this work. This novel design, which endows the metal surface with properties of unique air storage nanostructures, low free energy, and high chemical stability, can effectively avoid disadvantages of traditional sticking organic modifiers to long&#8208;termly keep the extreme water repellency.








Abstract
The chemical instability of traditional organically&#8208;decorated superhydrophobic metal surfaces is a significant issue, severely limiting practical applications. This is due to the susceptibility of low surface energy coatings to ion permeation, decomposition, and exfoliation, especially in harsh environments. Here, organic coating&#8208;free, durable superhydrophobic surfaces on Al alloys by developing the paracrystalline state of a bionic anthill tribe structure is successfully achieved, using femtosecond laser element&#8208;doping microstructuring followed by repetitive annealing processes. Remarkably, the inherent superhydrophobic properties of the sample are maintained for &#8776;2000 h in a corrosive 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution, significantly surpassing the performance of traditional organic coatings. Moreover, this inherent superhydrophobicity remains nearly unchanged, even after rigorous electrochemical reaction measurements. Additional tests involving UV irradiation (&gt;100 h), freezing cycles (&gt;100 cycles), and acid/alkali resistance (&gt;65 h) further demonstrate that the environmental adaptability of the surface far exceeds that of silane&#8208;coated surfaces. Ab initio calculations reveal that the formation of the paracrystalline state reduces surface energy and enhances chemical stability, thereby extending the durability of the superhydrophobic metal. These findings offer a powerful strategy for utilizing atomic&#8208;level structural rearrangements to design inherent superhydrophobic surfaces without the need for organic coatings.

         <title>In Situ Encapsulation of Atomically Precise Nanoclusters in Reticular Frameworks via Mechanochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical synthesis approach to encapsulate atomically precise nanoclusters (APNCs) in reticular frameworks in a controlled manner is proposed. This method significantly broadens the range of APNC@framework composites, facilitating the on&#8208;demand construction and regulation of component&#8208;specific nanocomposites.








Abstract
The combination of atomically precise nanoclusters (APNCs) and reticular frameworks is promising for generating component&#8208;specific nanocomposites with emergent properties. However, traditional liquid&#8208;phase synthesis often hampers this potential by damaging APNCs and limiting combination diversity. Here, mechanochemical synthesis to explore the encapsulation of diverse oil&#8208; and water&#8208;soluble APNCs within various reticular frameworks is employed, establishing a database of 21 unique APNC&#8722;framework combinations, including metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8722;organic frameworks (COFs), hydrogen&#8722;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), and multivariate MOFs. These framework coatings not only spatially immobilize APNCs but also secure their structures, preventing aggregation and degradation while enhancing stability and activity. Encapsulating Au25 in HOFs resulted in a remarkable 315&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity compared to Au25 homogeneous catalyst, highlighting the framework's crucial role in catalytic enhancement. The mechanochemical synthesis strategy facilitates tailored support screening, catering to specific needs, and shows promise for developing multifunctional systems, including enzyme&#8722;APNC@frameworks material for cascade reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of atomically precise nanoclusters (APNCs) and reticular frameworks is promising for generating component-specific nanocomposites with emergent properties. However, traditional liquid-phase synthesis often hampers this potential by damaging APNCs and limiting combination diversity. Here, mechanochemical synthesis to explore the encapsulation of diverse oil- and water-soluble APNCs within various reticular frameworks is employed, establishing a database of 21 unique APNC&#8722;framework combinations, including metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8722;organic frameworks (COFs), hydrogen&#8722;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), and multivariate MOFs. These framework coatings not only spatially immobilize APNCs but also secure their structures, preventing aggregation and degradation while enhancing stability and activity. Encapsulating Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; in HOFs resulted in a remarkable 315-fold increase in catalytic activity compared to Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; homogeneous catalyst, highlighting the framework's crucial role in catalytic enhancement. The mechanochemical synthesis strategy facilitates tailored support screening, catering to specific needs, and shows promise for developing multifunctional systems, including enzyme&#8722;APNC@frameworks material for cascade reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Configurations of 3&#8208;Coordinate and 4&#8208;Coordinate Boron Stabilize Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni Cathodes with Superior Cycling Stability for Practical Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

This work demonstrates a Li2SiO3&#8208;coated Li(Ni0.95Co0.04Mn0.01)0.99B0.01O2 ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode, delivering a high reversible capacity and superior cycling stability. This is the first time to realize the real B&#8208;doping, which exists in terms of 3&#8208;coordinate and 4&#8208;coordinate configurations with high electrochemical reversibility during de&#8208;/lithiation, greatly stabilizing oxygen anions and impeding Ni&#8208;ion migration with high structure stability and rapid Li&#8208;ion diffusion.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathodes are the leading candidate for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and ultrahigh capacity. However, the increased Ni content causes larger volume variations and worse lattice oxygen stability during cycling, resulting in capacity attenuation and kinetics hysteresis. Herein, a Li2SiO3&#8208;coated Li(Ni0.95Co0.04Mn0.01)0.99B0.01O2 ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode that well&#8208;addresses all the above issues, which is also the first time to realize the real doping of B ions is demonstrated. The as&#8208;obtained cathode delivers a reversible capacity of up to 237.4 mAh g&#8722;1 (924 Wh kg&#8722;1cathode) and a superior capacity retention of 84.2% after 500 cycles at 1C in pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cells. Advanced characterizations and calculations verify that the boron&#8208;doping is existed in terms of 3&#8208;coordinate and 4&#8208;coordinate configurations and their high electrochemical reversibility during de&#8208;/lithiation, which greatly stabilizes oxygen anions and impedes Ni&#8208;ion migration to Li layer. Furthermore, the B&#8208;doping engineers the primary particle microstructure for better relaxing the lattice strain and accelerating Li&#8208;ion diffusion. This work advances the energy density of cathode materials into the domain of above 900&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and the concept will inspire more intensive study on ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes.

         <title>Industrial Scale Sea&#8208;Island Melt&#8208;Spun Continuous Ultrafine Fibers for Highly Comfortable Insulated Aerogel Felt Clothing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Industrial&#8208;scale sea&#8208;island melt spinning technology is demonstrated to construct 3D porous thermal insulating aerogels with corrugated lamellar structure through freeze&#8208;shaping technology. This aerogel is only 1/3 the thickness of down but performs similarly. It also has excellent mechanical properties to meet fabric elasticity and comfort needs, while also exhibiting versatility, making it suitable for applications in extreme environments.









Abstract
Aerogels are most attractive for thermal clothing. However, mechanical fragility and structural instability restrict their practical applications. These issues are overcome by developing industrial scale sea&#8208;island melt&#8208;spun ultrafine fibers with large and uniform length&#8208;to&#8208;diameter as building blocks, which are assembled into aerogel felts with corrugated lamellar structure through freeze&#8208;shaping technology. These aerogels possess excellent mechanical properties to meet fabric elasticity and comfort needs, including super&#8208;flexibility (25% tensile strain, 95% compression, 180&#176; bending performance) and fatigue resistance of over 10,000 cycles. The aerogels are also self&#8208;cleaning, waterproof, breathable, and flame&#8208;retardant, making them suitable for application requirements in extreme environments. Moreover, the obtained aerogel felt clothing exhibits excellent thermal insulation properties close to that of dry air, and is only one&#8208;third as thick as down clothing with similar insulating properties. Expanding sea&#8208;island melt&#8208;spun fiber to construct aerogel in this strategy provides scalable potential for developing multifunctional insulating aerogel clothing.

         <title>Dirac&#8208;Like Fermions Anomalous Magneto&#8208;Transport in a Spin&#8208;Polarized Oxide 2D Electron System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous magneto&#8208;transport dominated by non&#8208;trivial Berry curvature and Dirac&#8208;like fermions is exhibited by an engineered 2D electron system (2DES) at (111) LaAlO3/EuTiO3/SrTiO3 interface, where structural and electronic properties are tailored to mimic that of magnetic gapped topological insulators.









Abstract
In a 2D electron system (2DES) the breaking of the inversion, time&#8208;reversal and bulk crystal&#8208;field symmetries is interlaced with the effects of spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) triggering exotic quantum phenomena. Here, epitaxial engineering is used to design and realize a 2DES characterized simultaneously by ferromagnetic order, large Rashba SOC and hexagonal band warping at the (111) interfaces between LaAlO3, EuTiO3, and SrTiO3 insulators. The 2DES displays anomalous quantum corrections to the magneto&#8208;conductance driven by the time&#8208;reversal&#8208;symmetry breaking occurring below the magnetic transition temperature. The results are explained by the emergence of a non&#8208;trivial Berry phase and competing weak anti&#8208;localization/weak localization back&#8208;scattering of Dirac&#8208;like fermions, mimicking the phenomenology of gapped topological insulators. These findings open perspectives for the engineering of novel spin&#8208;polarized functional 2DES holding promises in spin&#8208;orbitronics and topological&#160;electronics.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Shearing Chemistry Directed Closed&#8208;Pore Regeneration in Biomass&#8208;Derived Hard Carbons for Ultrafast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative DES cell&#8208;shearing strategy to tailor the closed&#8208;pore structure in bamboo&#8208;derived hard carbons. The optimized structure with appropriate closed&#8208;pore size (&#8764;2nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) walls exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. This work significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.








Abstract
The closed&#8208;pore structure of hard carbons holds the key to high plateau capacity and rapid diffusion kinetics when applied as sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) anodes. However, understanding and establishing the structure&#8208;electrochemistry relationship still remains a significant challenge. This work, for the first time, introduces an innovative deep eutectic solvent (DES) cell&#8208;shearing strategy to precisely tailor the cell structure of natural bamboo and consequently the closed&#8208;pore in its derived hard carbons. The DES shearing force effectively modifies the pore architecture by simultaneously shearing and dissolving amorphous components to form closed pore cores with adjustable sizes, as well as disintegrating crystalline cellulose through generation of competing hydrogen bonds to elaborately tune the pore wall thickness and ordering. The optimized closed&#8208;pore structure featuring appropriate pore size (&#8764;2 nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) disordered pore walls, exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. Consequently, a high reversible capacity of 422 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 mA g&#8722;1 along with an exceptional rate capability (318.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 6 A g&#8722;1) are achieved, outperforming almost all previous reported hard carbons. The new concept of cell&#8208;shearing chemistry for closed&#8208;pore regeneration significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.

         <title>Omics&#8208;Enhanced Nanomedicine for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the integration of omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, with nanomedicine for cancer therapy. Leveraging advanced next&#8208;generation sequencing techniques, it explores how these synergistic approaches enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize therapeutic strategies, and assess nanomedicine&#8208;mediated biological responses, offering insights into future development in personalized cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer nanomedicine has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the limitations of conventional cancer therapies, offering enhanced efficacy and safety in cancer management. However, the inherent heterogeneity of tumors presents increasing challenges for the application of cancer nanomedicine in both diagnosis and treatment. This heterogeneity necessitates the integration of advanced and high&#8208;throughput analytical techniques to tailor nanomedicine strategies to individual tumor profiles. Omics technologies, encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and more, provide unparalleled insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cancer. By dissecting tumor heterogeneity across multiple levels, these technologies offer robust support for the development of personalized and precise cancer nanomedicine strategies. In this review, the principles, techniques, and applications of key omics technologies are summarized. Especially, the synergistic integration of omics and nanomedicine in cancer therapy is explored, focusing on enhanced diagnostic accuracy, optimized therapeutic strategies and the assessment of nanomedicine&#8208;mediated biological responses. Moreover, this review addresses current challenges and outlines future directions in the field of omics&#8208;enhanced nanomedicine. By offering valuable insights and guidance, this review aims to advance the integration of omics with nanomedicine, ultimately driving improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cancer.

         <title>Magnetic Field&#8208;Induced Polar Order in Monolayer Molybdenum Disulfide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field (B)&#8208;induced giant electric hysteretic responses to back&#8208;gate voltages in monolayer (ML) MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) below 20 Kelvin are observed and attributed to asymmetric lattice expansion with increasing |B| in ML&#8208;MoS2 FETs on rigid SiO2/Si substrates, leading to mirror symmetry breaking in ML&#8208;MoS2 and the emergence of a tunable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric&#8208;like polar order.








Abstract
In semiconducting monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML&#8208;TMDs), broken inversion symmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling result in spin&#8208;valley lock&#8208;in effects so that the valley degeneracy may be lifted by external magnetic fields, potentially leading to real&#8208;space structural transformation. Here, magnetic field (B)&#8208;induced giant electric hysteretic responses to back&#8208;gate voltages are reported in ML&#8208;MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) on SiO2/Si at temperatures &lt;&#160;20 K. The observed hysteresis increases with |B| up to 12 T and is tunable by varying the temperature. Raman spectroscopic and scanning tunneling microscopic studies reveal significant lattice expansion with increasing |B| at 4.2 K, and this lattice expansion becomes asymmetric in ML&#8208;MoS2 FETs on rigid SiO2/Si substrates, leading to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane mirror symmetry breaking and the emergence of a tunable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric&#8208;like polar order. This broken symmetry&#8208;induced polarization in ML&#8208;MoS2 shows typical ferroelectric butterfly hysteresis in piezo&#8208;response force microscopy, adding ML&#8208;MoS2 to the single&#8208;layer material family that exhibits out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar order&#8208;induced ferroelectricity, which is promising for such technological applications as cryo&#8208;temperature ultracompact non&#8208;volatile memories, memtransistors, and ultrasensitive magnetic field sensors. Moreover, the polar effect induced by asymmetric lattice expansion may be further generalized to other ML&#8208;TMDs and achieved by nanoscale strain engineering of the substrate without magnetic fields.

         <title>An Antagonistic Photovoltaic Memristor for Bioinspired Active Contrast Adaptation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired optoelectronic memristor incorporating two antagonistic photovoltaic junctions can autonomously adjust its response to varying light stimuli, enabling the amplification of shadows and inhibition of highlight saturation. The memristor arrays are capable of capturing a high&#8208;contrast scene up to 94 dB with a faster active adaptation speed (less than 1.2 s) than that of biological systems.








Abstract
Machine vision systems that consist of cameras and image&#8208;processing components for visual inspection and identification tasks play a critical role in various intelligent applications, including pilotless vehicles and surveillance systems. However, current systems usually possess a limited dynamic range and fixed photoresponsivity, restricting their capability of gaining high&#8208;fidelity images when encoding a high&#8208;contrast scene. Here, it is shown that a photovoltaic memristor incorporating two antagonistic photovoltaic junctions can autonomously adjust its response to varying light stimuli, enabling the amplification of shadows and inhibition of highlight saturation. Due to the dynamic photodoping effect at the p&#8208;n junction with an asymmetrical profile, the photocurrent polarities of the antagonistic memristor can be changed as the light intensity increases. The light&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent switchable photovoltaic behaviors match Weber's law where photosensitivity is inversely proportional to the light stimuli. An 11&#160;&#215;&#160;11 memristor array is used to detect a high&#8208;contrast scene with light intensities ranging from 1 to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;104 &#181;W cm&#8722;2, achieving a similar active contrast adaptation performance compared with the human visual systems (less than 1.2 s at 94 dB). This work paves the way for innovative neuromorphic device designs and may lead to the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art active visual adaptation photosensors.

         <title>A DNAzyme&#8208;Based Nanohybrid for Ultrasound and Enzyme Dual&#8208;Controlled mRNA Regulation and Combined Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled DNAzyme nanohybrid is developed for ultrasound&#8208;controlled, enzyme&#8208;activatable mRNA regulation and combined tumor treatment. This system enables ultrasound&#8208;enhanced endosomal escape and specific enzyme activation of DNAzyme function, thereby improving efficacy and cell&#8208;type specificity in target gene silencing and combinational tumor therapy.








Abstract
Despite the significant potential of RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes for gene regulation, their application is limited by low therapeutic efficacy and lack of cell&#8208;specific control. Here, a DNAzyme&#8208;based nanohybrid designed for ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled, enzyme&#8208;activatable mRNA regulation is presented, enabling tumor cell&#8208;selective combination therapy. The nanohybrid is constructed by coordination&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly of an enzymatically&#8208;triggerable therapeutic DNAzyme (En&#8208;Dz) and natural sonosensitizer hemoglobin (Hb). Controlled US exposure induces reactive oxygen species generation from Hb units, which not only facilitates efficient endosomal escape of En&#8208;Dz, but also promotes the translocation of specific enzyme from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby enhancing gene regulation efficacy. Notably, the enzyme&#8208;triggered, spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled activation of En&#8208;Dz's catalytic activity results in enhanced cancer&#8208;cell selectivity in the therapeutic treatment. Furthermore, the combination of enzyme&#8208;activated mRNA regulation and sonodynamic therapy significantly enhances anti&#8208;tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the potential of integrating a sonodynamic strategy to overcome the current limitations of DNAzyme&#8208;based gene regulators, providing a spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled approach for precise tumor treatment.

         <title>Solution Processable Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Synthesis Strategy and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in design strategies for synthesizing solution&#8208;processable metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and MOF&#8208;based systems, including methods such as direct dispersion in ionic liquids, direct synthesis, etc. It emphasizes their applications in fabricating structured objects, membranes, and/or films for molecular storage, separation, and chemical sensing. The review also discusses future challenges and perspectives. 








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by inorganic secondary building units with organic linkers via reticular chemistry, inherently suffer from poor solution processability due to their insoluble nature, resulting from their extensive crystalline networks and structural rigidity. The ubiquitous occurrence of precipitation and agglomeration of MOFs upon formation poses a significant obstacle to the scale&#8208;up production of MOF&#8208;based monolith, aerogels, membranes, and electronic devices, thus restricting their practical applications in various scenarios. To address the previously mentioned challenge, significant strides have been achieved over the past decade in the development of various strategies aimed at preparing solution&#8208;processable MOF systems. In this review, the latest advance in the synthetic strategies for the construction of solution&#8208;processable MOFs, including direct dispersion in ionic liquids, surface modification, controllable calcination, and bottom&#8208;up synthesis, is comprehensively summarized. The respective advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Additionally, the intriguing applications of solution&#8208;processable MOF systems in the fields of liquid adsorbent, molecular capture, sensing, and separation are systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities about the continued advancement of solution&#8208;processable MOFs and their potential applications are outlooked.

&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by inorganic secondary building units with organic linkers via reticular chemistry, inherently suffer from poor solution processability due to their insoluble nature, resulting from their extensive crystalline networks and structural rigidity. The ubiquitous occurrence of precipitation and agglomeration of MOFs upon formation poses a significant obstacle to the scale-up production of MOF-based monolith, aerogels, membranes, and electronic devices, thus restricting their practical applications in various scenarios. To address the previously mentioned challenge, significant strides have been achieved over the past decade in the development of various strategies aimed at preparing solution-processable MOF systems. In this review, the latest advance in the synthetic strategies for the construction of solution-processable MOFs, including direct dispersion in ionic liquids, surface modification, controllable calcination, and bottom-up synthesis, is comprehensively summarized. The respective advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Additionally, the intriguing applications of solution-processable MOF systems in the fields of liquid adsorbent, molecular capture, sensing, and separation are systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities about the continued advancement of solution-processable MOFs and their potential applications are outlooked.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full van der Waals Ambipolar Ferroelectric Configurable Optical Hetero&#8208;Synapses for In&#8208;Sensor Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper proposes an optical synapse based on van der Waals heterojunction. Based on this device, an optical reservoir neural network and a visible light communication system were developed, which successfully imitated the signal preprocessing and data transmission process of the human visual system for color images. This provides new ideas for the development of intelligent imaging systems.








Abstract
The rapid development of visual neuromorphic hardware can be attributed to their ability to capture, store and process optical signals from the environment. The main limitation of existing visual neuromorphic hardware is that the realization of complex functions is premised on the increase of manufacturing cost, hardware volume and energy consumption. In this study, we demonstrated an optical synaptic device based on a three&#8208;terminal van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction that can realize the sensing functions of light wavelength and intensity as well as short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. In the image recognition task, we constructed an optical reservoir neural network (ORNN) and a visible light communication system (VLC) composed of this optical synaptic device. The ORNN has a recognition rate of up to 84.9% for 50 000 color images in 10 categories in the CIFAR&#8208;10 color image dataset, and the VLC system can achieve high&#8208;speed transmission with an ultra&#8208;low power consumption of only 0.4 nW. This work shows that through reasonable design, vdW heterojunction structures have great application potential in low&#8208;power multifunctional fusion application tasks such as visual bionics.

         <title>Nanobodies Outperform Antibodies &#8211; Rapid Functionalization with Equal In Vivo Targeting Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocarrier system functionalized with nanobodies for the targeting of dendritic cells is presented. The system possesses a highly specific targeting in vivo and can be synthesized at low cost over the course of a few hours. The combination of these properties suggests a better performance compared to antibody&#8208;based systems in current literature.








Abstract
Highly specific targeting of dendritic cells in vivo is crucial for the development of effective tumor nanovaccines. This group recently presented an antibody&#8208;functionalized nanocarrier system able to maintain its targeting properties when transferred from in vitro to in vivo studies. However, producing this system requires long synthesis times and involves high expenses due to the involved site&#8208;specific enzymatic multi&#8208;step modification procedure of the antibody. Consequently, improving the previously proposed system is necessary in order to accelerate the development. Here, a novel system utilizing nanobodies for the targeting of dendritic cells is presented. A C&#8208;terminal cysteine tag facilitates an easy attachment of the nanobody to the nanocarrier via a thiol&#8208;maleimide conjugation technique. This reduces the functionalization time from several days to mere hours. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, it is shown that the optimized system possesses equal targeting properties as the antibody&#8208;based system. As a result, nanobodies and the coupling chemistry are found to be a superior strategy for the in vivo targeting of dendritic cells when compared to antibodies, due to their rapid attachment to nanocarriers and equal targeting specificity. This would replace antibodies as the current &#8220;gold standard&#8221; of targeting moieties.

         <title>Wearable Haptics for Orthotropic Actuation Based on Perpendicularly Nested Auxetic SMA Knotting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable haptics for orthotropic actuation (WHOA) can be used for teleoperation of drones and robots with directional sensory perception in 3D space. The perpendicularly nested auxetic pattern with parylene coating provide orthotopically decoupled tactile feedback and wearable multimodal haptics.








Abstract
Smart wearable tactile systems, designed to deliver different types of touch feedback on human skin, can significantly improve engagement through diverse actuation patterns in virtual or augmented reality environments. Here, a perpendicularly nested auxetic wearable haptic interface is reported for orthotropically decoupled multimodal actuation (WHOA), capable of producing diverse tactile feedback modes with 3D sensory perception. WHOA incorporates shape memory alloy wires that are intricately knotted into an auxetic structure oriented along orthotropic dual axes. Its perpendicularly nested auxetic structure enables orthotropic actuation, allowing independent expansion and contraction along both x and y&#8208;axes, as confirmed by force&#8208;strain and displacement&#8208;time performance tests. Additionally, the perylene coating provides orthogonal electrical isolation to WHOA, allowing for stripe&#8208;specific localized actuation and enabling multiple tactile feedback modes. As an orthotropic wearable haptic interface, WHOA distinguishes between x&#8208;axis and y&#8208;axis directions and ultimately delivers multi&#8208;dimensional information regarding movements in 3D space through tactile feedback. As a result, when worn on the foot or arm, WHOA naturally delivers spatiotemporal tactile information to the user, facilitating navigation and teleoperation with 3D sensory perception.

         <title>Digital Light Process 3D Printing of Magnetically Aligned Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Free&#8211;forms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the use of a Halbach array to magnetically align a novel liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) ink which can be used for vat&#8208;based digital light process (DLP) 3D printing. This approach enables 3D printing of geometrically complex LCE free&#8211;forms with tailorable alignment, enabling exciting possibilities for designing advanced biomedical devices, soft robotics, or energy&#8208;damping structures.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) are anisotropic soft materials capable of large dimensional changes when subjected to a stimulus. The magnitude and directionality of the stimuli&#8208;induced thermomechanical response is associated with the alignment of the LCE. Recent reports detail the preparation of LCEs by additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, predominately using direct ink write printing. Another AM technique, digital light process (DLP) 3D printing, has generated significant interest as it affords LCE free&#8208;forms with high fidelity and resolution. However, one challenge of printing LCEs using vat polymerization methods such as DLP is enforcing alignment. Here, we document the preparation of aligned, main&#8208;chain LCEs via DLP 3D printing using a 100 mT magnetic field. Systematic examination isolates the contribution of magnetic field strength, alignment time, and build layer thickness on the degree of orientation in 3D printed LCEs. Informed by this fundamental understanding, DLP is used to print complex LCE free&#8208;forms with through&#8208;thickness variation in both spatial orientations. The hierarchical variation in spatial orientation within LCE free&#8208;forms is used to produce objects that exhibit mechanical instabilities upon heating. DLP printing of aligned LCEs opens new opportunities to fabricate stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in form factors optimized for functional use in soft robotics and energy absorption.

         <title>Designing Impact Resistance and Robustness into Slippery Lubricant Infused Porous Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slippery lubricant infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) are presented which seek to address the lubricant drainage issue that impairs such surfaces. The strong lubricant retention achieved enables the SLIPS to maintain their slipperiness under high&#8208;speed liquid impact and other dynamic/flow conditions. These findings should widen the practical applications of SLIPS.








Abstract
Slippery lubricant infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have the potential to address daunting challenges such as undesirable surface fouling/biofouling, icing, etc. However, the depletion of lubricants hampers their practical utility. As a solution, here a rational strategy is introduced that operates synergistically in three parts. First, ultra&#8208;high capillary pressure is exploited from the reticular structure of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with sub&#8208;nanometer pores. Second, the need for geometric compatibility is demonstrated; the lubricant chain diameter must be smaller than the MOF pore to enable lubricant chain intercalation. Lastly, the MOF pore chemistry is tailored to achieve a strong intermolecular interaction for any given MOF/lubricant combination. The strategy is investigated through experiments and quantum/molecular simulations, which show that the approach helps lock the intercalated lubricant chains inside the MOF pores and forms a non&#8208;conventional supramolecular structure. The resulting SLIPS (including those with fluorine&#8208;free chemistry) not only show typical low wetting hysteresis, friction, and ice adhesion but are uniquely resistant to more stringent tests such as continuous dripping and sliding of water droplets (up to 50&#160;hrs), repeated impacts of high&#8208;speed water jets (liquid impact Weber number &gt;&#160;4&#160;&#215;&#160;104) and prevent bacterial biofilm formation even in dynamic flow conditions. The findings may widen the practical applications of SLIPS.

As a solution, here a rational strategy is introduced that operates synergistically in three parts. First, ultra-high capillary pressure is exploited from the reticular structure of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with sub-nanometer pores. Second, the need for geometric compatibility is demonstrated; the lubricant chain diameter must be smaller than the MOF pore to enable lubricant chain intercalation. Lastly, the MOF pore chemistry is tailored to achieve a strong intermolecular interaction for any given MOF/lubricant combination. The strategy is investigated through experiments and quantum/molecular simulations, which show that the approach helps lock the intercalated lubricant chains inside the MOF pores and forms a non-conventional supramolecular structure. The resulting SLIPS (including those with fluorine-free chemistry) not only show typical low wetting hysteresis, friction, and ice adhesion but are uniquely resistant to more stringent tests such as continuous dripping and sliding of water droplets (up to 50&#160;hrs), repeated impacts of high-speed water jets (liquid impact Weber number &amp;gt;&#160;4&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) and prevent bacterial biofilm formation even in dynamic flow conditions. The findings may widen the practical applications of SLIPS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex evolutionary pressures result in unique protein fiber designs for silks. This includes multi&#8208;domain features and novel amino acid content that accommodate aqueous processing environments with remarkable functional properties. Bioengineering approaches inform new material formats and functions realized with silks. These design features provide a blueprint for future polymer designs with robust functions and sustainability as guideposts.








Abstract
This is a Perspective on nature as a story&#8208;teller, where inputs of evolution drove the remarkable protein designs found in silks. This selection process has resulted in silk materials with novel chemistry and properties to support organism survival in nature, yet with newfound utility in everything from comic books and automobiles to medicine. With growing global concerns related to environmental health, silks also serve as an invaluable instructional guide to the future of sustainable material designs.

         <title>Disrupting Intracellular Homeostasis by Copper&#8208;Based Nanoinducer with Multiple Enzyme&#8208;Mimicking Activities to Induce Disulfidptosis&#8208;Enhanced Pyroptosis for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;based nanoinducer (CGBH NNs) aimed to disrupt intracellular metabolism and redox homeostasis for inducing tumor cells disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced immunogenic pyroptosis. The combination of these two cell death modes could promote the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and inflammatory cytokines, reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME and enhancing immune cells infiltration. The evoked robust immune responses helped to suppress tumor progression.








Abstract
Given the crucial role of abnormal homeostasis in tumor cells for maintaining their growth, it may be more efficient with less effort to develop anti&#8208;tumor strategies that target multiple combined mechanisms by disrupting intracellular homeostasis. Here, a copper&#8208;based nanoinducer (CGBH NNs) with multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities is designed and constructed to induce disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis through disrupting multiple intracellular homeostasis for effective tumor immunotherapy. Within the tumor microenvironment (TME), CGBH NNs can disrupt intracellular glucose homeostasis and inhibit NADPH production, leading to accumulation of cystine, which further blocked the substrate and key enzyme for synthesizing glutathione. Subsequently, through cascade catalytic reactions involving enzyme activities (glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like, glucose oxidase and peroxidase&#8208;like activities), CGBH NNs can produce massive reactive oxygen species&#160;(ROS) and further disrupt intracellular redox homeostasis, resulting in the disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis. The tumor cells undergoing immunogenic pyroptosis can release various cytosolic contents and inflammatory factors, eliciting robust immune responses by facilitating immune cell infiltration, and reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME. After the combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, CGBH NNs can effectively suppress the tumor growth and prolong the survival time of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This work presents a novel paradigm to trigger disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis by destroying intracellular homeostasis for anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Recent Advances in High&#8208;Entropy Layered Oxide Cathode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The basic concepts, design principles, synthetic methods, advanced characterization, and theoretical calculations of high&#8208;entropy layered oxides are summarized here for alkali metal&#8208;ion battery (AMIB) cathodes. It highlights the recent advances in high&#8208;entropy strategies for improving the electrochemical performance of layered oxide cathodes, and existing problems and possible solutions, providing guidance for the development of layered oxides for highly efficient AMIB cathodes.








Abstract
Since the electrochemical de/intercalation behavior is first detected in 1980, layered oxides have become the most promising cathode material for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (Li+/Na+/K+; AMIBs) owing to their facile synthesis and excellent theoretical capacities. However, the inherent drawbacks of unstable structural evolution and sluggish diffusion kinetics deteriorate their electrochemical performance, limiting further large&#8208;scale applications. To solve these issues, the novel and promising strategy of high entropy has been widely applied to layered oxide cathodes for AMIBs in recent years. Through multielement synergy and entropy stabilization effects, high&#8208;entropy layered oxides (HELOs) can achieve adjustable activity and enhanced stability. Herein, the basic concepts, design principles, and synthesis methods of HELO cathodes are introduced systematically. Notably, it explores in detail the improvements of the high&#8208;entropy strategy on the limitations of layered oxides, highlighting the latest advances in high&#8208;entropy layered cathode materials in the field of AMIBs. In addition, it introduces advanced characterization and theoretical calculations for HELOs and proposes potential future research directions and optimization strategies, providing inspiration for researchers to develop advanced HELO cathode materials in the areas of energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Scalable Synaptic Transistor Memory from Solution&#8208;Processed Carbon Nanotubes for High&#8208;Speed Neuromorphic Data Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable synaptic transistor memory from solution&#8208;processed carbon nanotubes, exhibiting&#160;reconfigurable weights and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity, enables parallel neuromorphic data processing with a speed of 1 M bit per second per input channel.








Abstract
Neural networks as a core information processing technology in machine learning and artificial intelligence demand substantial computational resources to deal with the extensive multiply&#8208;accumulate operations. Neuromorphic computing is an emergent solution to address this problem, allowing the computation performed in memory arrays in parallel with high efficiencies conforming to the neural networks. Here, scalable synaptic transistor memories are developed from solution&#8208;sorted carbon nanotubes. The transistors exhibit a large switching ratio of over 105, a significant memory window of &#8776;12&#160;V arising from charge trapping, and low response delays down to tens of nanoseconds. These device characteristics endow highly stabilized reconfigurable conductance states, successful emulation of synaptic functions, and a high data processing speed. Importantly, the devices exhibit uniform characteristic metrics, e.g., with a 1.8% variation in the memory window, suggesting an industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing capability of the fabrication. Using the memories, a hardware convolution kernel is designed and parallel image processing is demonstrated at a speed of 1&#160;M bit per second per input channel. Given the efficacy of the convolution kernel, a promising prospect of the memories in implementing neuromorphic computing is envisaged. To explore the potential, large&#8208;scale convolution kernels are simulated and high&#8208;speed video processing is realized for autonomous driving.

         <title>Voxel Interface Control in Multimaterial Extrusion 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfaces are vital in natural and synthetic systems, enhancing performance and functionality, but are difficult to control in manufacturing. Voxel&#8208;Interface 3D Printing (VI3DP) is introduced, enabling precise control of voxel&#8208;to&#8208;voxel interfaces in extrusion 3D&#8208;printed objects. With interface thicknesses significantly smaller than voxel size, VI3DP unlocks applications in data encoding, mechanisms, bio&#8208;inspired composites, and capacitive touch sensors, among others.








Abstract
Interfaces are crucial in natural and engineered systems, dictating essential biological, ecological, and technological properties that augment performance, functionality, and user experience. Yet, achieving precise interfacial control poses significant challenges in both conventional and additive manufacturing, where scalability constraints impede the controlled deposition of quasi&#8208;2D layers within 3D objects. This paper introduces Voxel&#8208;Interface 3D Printing (VI3DP), which enables comprehensive control over extruded voxel interfaces irrespective of the printhead diameter that conventionally dictates feature size. Various optical, mechanical, and electrical functionalizations, attaining interface thicknesses up to three orders of magnitude smaller than the voxel size are reported. Notable applications include encoding data in soft matter through fluorescent interfaces, creating tight fits and movable mechanisms through non&#8208;adhesive interfaces, fabricating bio&#8208;inspired composites with tailored failure modes, and developing a single filament capacitive touch sensor. VI3DP opens new avenues for enhanced functionality and efficiency across multiple fields, including biomedical technology, electronics, optics, and&#160;nanotechnology.

Functionalized quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes with electronegative atoms (O/N/F)&#8208;containing functional groups facilitate the optimization of the electron distribution around them, which endows the facile optimization of the interaction strength between the positively charged and negatively charged species, leading to desired thermal and kinetical optimal states, and thus benefiting the stabilization of the Zn anode for potential flexible devices.








Abstract
The rapid development of wearable and intelligent flexible devices has posed strict requirements for power sources, including excellent mechanical strength, inherent safety, high energy density, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Zn&#8208;ion batteries with aqueous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (AQSSEs) with various functional groups that contain electronegative atoms (O/N/F) with tunable electron accumulation states are considered as a promising candidate to power the flexible devices and tremendous progress has been achieved in this prospering area. Herein, this review proposes a comprehensive summary of the recent achievements using the AQSSE in flexible devices by focusing on the significance of different functional groups. The fundamentals and challenges of the ZIBs are introduced from a chemical view in the first place. Then, the mechanism behind the stabilization of the flexible ZIBs with the functionalized AQSSE is summarized and explained in detail. Then the recent progress regarding the enhanced electrochemical stability of the ZIBs with the AQSSE is summarized and classified based on the functional groups on the polymer chain. The advanced characterization methods for the AQSSE are briefly introduced in the following sections. Last but not least, current challenges and future perspectives for this promising area are provided from the authors' point of view.

         <title>Bidirectional Photovoltage&#8208;Driven Oxide Transistors for Neuromorphic Visual Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional photovoltage&#8208;driven neuromorphic visual sensor is constructed by connecting the different electrodes of two perovskite solar cells to the two gates of ion&#8208;regulated In2O3 transistors. The mem&#8208;reservoir chip is also proposed for handing object movement and dynamic color recognition.








Abstract
Biological vision is one of the most important parts of the human perception system. However, emulating biological visuals is challenging because it requires complementary photoexcitation and photoinhibition. Here, the study presents a bidirectional photovoltage&#8208;driven neuromorphic visual sensor (BPNVS) that is constructed by monolithically integrating two perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with dual&#8208;gate ion&#8208;gel&#8208;gated oxide transistors. PSCs act as photoreceptors, converting external visual stimuli into electrical signals, whereas oxide transistors generate neuromorphic signal outputs that can be adjusted to produce positive and negative photoresponses. This device mimics the human vision system's ability to recognize colored and color&#8208;mixed patterns. The device achieves a static color recognition accuracy of 96% by utilizing the reservoir computing system for feature extraction. The BPNVS mem&#8208;reservoir chip is also proposed for handing object movement and dynamic color recognition. This work is a significant step forward in neuromorphic sensing and complex pattern recognition.

         <title>In Situ Reversible and Robust Mechano&#8208;Responsive Ultralong Phosphorescence of Polyurethane Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ, sensitive, and rapidly reversible mechano&#8208;responsive (MR) phosphorescence from a doped polyurethane (PU) elastomer has been achieved from the reversible MR polymer chain orientation and hydrogen bonding interactions among the system. Based on their MR afterglow, these PU materials have demonstrated various applications without interruption of background, including micro&#8208;crack detection, material damage prediction, limb movement monitoring, and information encryption.








Abstract
Though mechano&#8208;responsive luminescent materials obtained much attention, most of their responses are non&#8208;reversible, let alone in situ reversible. Here, the study presents a new strategy to push through this limitation for their applications, which relies on the reversible mechano&#8208;responsive (MR) hydrogen bonding interactions and polymer chain orientation among a doped polyurethane (PU) elastomer. The radiative and nonradiative transitions inside these phosphorescent triphenylene&#8208;based aromatic secondary amines (TpNP and TpNPO) doped in the PU matrix can be accordingly modulated by these MR variations, including the PU chains orientation and the interactions between emitters and PU, respectively. Surprisingly, the intensities, quantum yields, and even lifetimes of their ultralong phosphorescence correlate well with the stress of PU, showing triple mechano&#8208;enhancement with a small threshold value of 7.9&#160;MPa. Importantly, these in situ and rapidly reversible MR phosphorescences possess excellent repeatability, which is still displayed even after &gt;500 cycles of loading/unloading. Based on such a robust and highly sensitive MR afterglow, these PU materials have been demonstrated applications with no interruption of background in several fields, including micro&#8208;crack detection, material damage prediction, limb movement monitoring, and information encryption. This work provides new insights for developing innovative ultralong phosphorescence materials with improved luminescence and reversible mechano&#8208;responsive behavior.

         <title>Ultrafast Charge and Exciton Diffusion in Monolayer Films of 9&#8208;Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>Schematic representation of 9&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbons subjected to a pump pulse, which generates charge carriers. The spatial and temporal dynamics of these carriers are investigated using a probe pulse with variable time delay &#916;t and a controllable spatial offset.








Abstract
Determining the electronic transport properties of graphene nanoribbons is crucial for assessing their suitability for applications. So far, this has been highly challenging both through experimental and theoretical approaches. This is particularly the case for graphene nanoribbons that are prepared by chemical vapor deposition, which is a scalable and industry&#8208;compatible bottom&#8208;up growth method that results in closely packed arrays of ribbons with relatively short lengths of a few tens of nanometers. In this study, the experimental technique of spatiotemporal microscopy is applied to study monolayer films of 9&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbons prepared using this growth method, and combined with linear&#8208;scaling quantum transport calculations of arrays of thousands of nanoribbons. Both approaches directly resolve electronic spreading in space and time through diffusion and give an initial diffusivity approaching 200 cm2 s&#8722;1 during the first picosecond after photoexcitation. This corresponds to a mobility up to 550 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The quasi&#8208;free carriers then form excitons, which spread with a diffusivity of tens of cm2 s&#8722;1. The results indicate that this relatively large charge carrier mobility is the result of electronic transport not being hindered by defects nor inter&#8208;ribbon hopping. This confirms their suitability for applications that require efficient electronic&#160;transport.

         <title>Suppressing Static and Dynamic Disorder for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Thick&#8208;Film Organic Solar Cells via Synergistic Dilution Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a synergistic dilution strategy to suppress traps of transport and active layers, restrain static, and dynamic disorder, to fabricate efficient and stable thick&#8208;film OSCs. It mitigates dynamic disorder through electron&#8208;phonon coupling suppression and static disorder via molecular stacking enhancement, ensuring practicality and cost&#8208;effectiveness for large&#8208;scale use.








Abstract
Developing stable and highly efficient thick&#8208;film organic solar cells (OSCs) is crucial for the large&#8208;scale commercial application of organic photovoltaics. A novel synergistic dilution strategy to address this issue, using Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) &#8208;modified zinc oxide (ZnO) as the interfacial layer, is introduced. This strategy effectively mitigates oxygen defects in ZnO while also regulating the self&#8208;assembly process of the active layer to achieve an ordered distribution of donors and acceptors. In synergistic diluted devices, the dynamic disorder is reduced owing to the suppression of electron&#8208;phonon coupling, while the static disorder is suppressed by improved molecular stacking and enhanced intermolecular interactions. Consequently, the 300&#160;nm PM6:L8&#8208;BO device post&#8208;synergistic dilution manifests a marked enhancement in device performance, achieving a photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE) &gt;17% with excellent thermal stability. A typical ternary system is selected to explore the general applicability of synergistic dilution strategy, the PCE has been enhanced significantly from 17.89% to 18.72%, which falls within the range of the highest values among inverted single junction OSCs. As a practical application that depends on the pivotal synergy between high efficiency and stability, this approach paves the way for large&#8208;scale implementation of OSCs and ensures cost&#8208;effectiveness.

As a practical application that depends on the pivotal synergy between high efficiency and stability, this approach paves the way for large-scale implementation of OSCs and ensures cost-effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Doped Facet&#8208;Selective Copper Nanowires for Activating CO&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research reports a nickel&#8208;doped copper nanowire catalyst for highly selective ethanol production from CO electroreduction. The theoretical calculations and operando spectroelectrochemical investigations cooperatively demonstrate that nickel&#8208;doping onto copper surface can regulate the interfacial water structure and water dissociation kinetics, which significantly influences the hydrogenation kinetics of a key C2 intermediate (*CHCOH), and thus leading to a high selectivity switch from ethylene to ethanol.








Abstract
Ethanol isa promising energy vector for closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle through reversible electrochemical redox. Currently, ethanol electrosynthesissuffers from low product selectivity due to the competitive advantage of ethylene in CO2/CO electroreduction. Here, a facet&#8208;selective metal&#8208;doping strategy is reported, tuning the reaction kinetics of CO reduction paths and thus enhancing the ethanol selectivity. The theoretical calculations reveal that nickel (Ni)doped Cu(100) surface facilitates water dissociation to form adsorbed hydrogen, which promotesselective electrochemical hydrogenation of a key C2 intermediate (*CHCOH) toward ethanol path over ethylene path. Experimentally, a solution&#8208;phase synthesis of a Ni&#8208;doped {100}&#8208;dominated Copper nanowires (Cu NWs) catalyst is reported, enabling an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 56% and a selectivity ratio of ethanol to ethylene of 2.7, which are &#8776;4 and 15 times larger than those of undoped Cu NWs, respectively. The operando spectroscopic characterizations&#160;confirm that Ni&#8208;doping in Cu NWs can alter the interfacial water activity and thus regulate the C2 product selectivity. With further electrode engineering, a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer using Ni&#8208;doped Cu NWs catalysts demonstrates an ethanol Faradaic efficiency over 50% at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a full cell voltage of &#8776;2.7&#160;V and operates stably for over 300 h.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning Empowered Customized Chiral Metasurface for Calibration&#8208;Free Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a deep learning&#8208;driven data iteration strategy alongside a global optimization network, showcasing excellent capabilities in expediting metasurface design and unearthing complex light&#8208;matter interactions. As anticipated, it enables the customized and easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement design of chiral metasurfaces and advanced sensing abilities for enantiomer&#8208;specific analysis of bio&#8208;samples in a calibration&#8208;free manner.








Abstract
As a 2D metamaterial, metasurfaces offer an unprecedented avenue to facilitate light&#8208;matter interactions. The current &#8220;one&#8208;by&#8208;one design&#8221; method is hindered by time&#8208;consuming, repeated testing within a confined space. However, intelligent design strategies for metasurfaces, limited by data&#8208;driven properties, have rarely been explored. To address this gap, a data iterative strategy based on deep learning, coupled with a global optimization network is proposed, to achieve the customized design of chiral metasurfaces. This methodology is applied to precisely identify different chiral molecules in a label&#8208;free manner. Fundamentally different from the traditional approach of collecting data purely through simulation, the proposed data generation strategy encompasses the entire design space, which is inaccessible by conventional methods. The dataset quality is significantly improved, with a 21&#8208;fold increase in the number of chiral structures exhibiting the desired circular dichroism (CD) response (&gt;0.6). The method's efficacy is validated by a monolayer structure that is easily prepared, demonstrating advanced sensing abilities for enantiomer&#8208;specific analysis of bio&#8208;samples. These results demonstrate the superior capability of data&#8208;driven schemes in photonic design and the potential of chiral metasurface&#8208;based platforms for calibration&#8208;free biosensing applications. The proposed approach will accelerate the development of complex systems for rapid molecular detection, spectroscopic imaging, and other applications.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage of Twisted Structures in Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using machine learning, a variety of PU&#8208;based polymers are forecasted and successfully synthesized two with a high dielectric constant (K) and thermal stability. Combining these with PI via hydrogen bonds to form twisted HNP, both K and Eb are improved. Impressively, HNP&#8208;20% reaches an Ud of 6.42 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics possess outstanding advantages for high&#8208;power energy storage applications such as high breakdown strength (Eb) and efficiency (&#951;), while both of them decrease rapidly at elevated temperatures. Although several strategies have been evaluated to enhance Eb and heat resistance, the discharged energy density (Ud) is still limited by the planar conjugated structure. In this study, a novel approach to manipulate polymer morphology is introduced, thereby influencing dielectric properties. A range of polyurea (PU)&#8208;based polymers are predicted from different structural unit combinations by machine learning and synthesized two representative polymers with high dielectric constants (K) and thermal stability. These polymers are combined with PI to form a twisted polymer via hydrogen bonding interactions (HNP). Both experimental results and computational simulations demonstrate the twisted structure disrupts the conjugated structure to widen the bandgap and increase dipole moment through the twisting of polar groups, leading to simultaneous improvements in both K and Eb. Consequently, HNP&#8208;20% achieves an ultrahigh Ud of 6.42 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200 &#176;C. This work opens a new avenue to scalable high Ud all&#8208;polymer dielectric for high&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Transcytosable and Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Liposome Enables Deep Penetration of Biofilm for Surgical Site Infection Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vascular&#8208;cell&#8208;adhesion&#8208;molecule&#8208;1 (VCAM1)&#8208;targeted and ultrasound&#8208;activated liposome (ligand&#8208;modified, perfluoropentane&#8208;encapsulated, and dual Ce6 and OTM&#8208;integrated liposome) is capable of overcoming the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in biofilm&#8208;associated surgical site infection. VCAM1&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic&#8208;cavitation&#8208;induced EPS collapse consecutively achieve efficient drug accumulation and deep penetration, then lead to potent biofilm eradication.








Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;associated surgical site infection (BSSI) is a common and grievous postoperative complication lacking effective remedies, mainly due to the poor drug accumulation and penetration in the biofilms featured by dense extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). Here, it is found that the vascular cell adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (VCAM1) is highly overexpressed in the vascular cells of BSSI. It is proposed that the combination of VCAM1&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic cavitation can consecutively overcome the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and EPS for biofilm eradication. To demonstrate the feasibility, a VCAM1&#8208;targeted and ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated liposome (LPCOTML) loaded with a reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;responsive lipoid prodrug of oleoyl meropenem, sonosensitizer of lipoid Ce6, and perfluoropentane is developed. LPCOTML can recognize the receptors on vascular cells, and initiate receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis for transendothelial transport into the BSSI periphery. LPCOTML subsequently transforms from nanoparticle into microbubble via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition under US irradiation, triggering strong ultrasonic cavitation to blow up the EPS and deeply penetrate the biofilms. The sonosensitizer Ce6 induces ROS production under US irradiation and triggers the release of meropenem to induce potent antibacterial effect in a BSSI model. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the biological barriers in BSSI via combining receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic cavitation.

         <title>Using a Supramolecular Monomer Formulation Approach to Engineer Modular, Dynamic Microgels, and Composite Macrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microgels with engineerable properties are created using supramolecular monomers. The inherent modularity offers versatility, allowing inclusion of functionalities, e.g. dyes and cell adhesive additives, providing control over microgel composition. Integrated into robust and dynamic macrogels, microgels act as modular micro&#8208;building blocks, introducing multi&#8208;compartmentalization and reinforcing mechanical properties. This modular control spans across the nano, micro, and macro length scale.








Abstract
Microgels show advantages over bulk hydrogels due to convenient control over microgel size and composition, and the ability to use microgels to modularly construct larger hierarchical scaffold hydrogel materials. Here, supramolecular chemistry is used to formulate supramolecular polymer, dynamic microgels solely held together by non&#8208;covalent interactions. Four&#8208;fold hydrogen bonding ureido&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) monomers with different functionalities are applied to precisely tune microgel properties in a modular way, via variations in monomer concentration, bifunctional crosslinker ratio, and the incorporation of supramolecular dyes and peptides. Functionalization with a bioactive supramolecular cell&#8208;adhesive peptide induced selectivity of cells toward the bioactive microgels over non&#8208;active, non&#8208;functionalized versions. Importantly, the supramolecular microgels can also be applied as microscale building blocks into supramolecular bulk macrogels with tunable dynamic behavior: a robust and weak macrogel, where the micro&#8208; and macrogels are composed of similar molecular building blocks. In a robust macrogel, microgels act as modular micro&#8208;building blocks, introducing multi&#8208;compartmentalization, while in a weak macrogel, microgels reinforce and enhance mechanical properties. This work demonstrates the potential to modularly engineer higher&#8208;length&#8208;scale structures using small molecule supramolecular monomers, wherein microgels serve as versatile and modular micro&#8208;building units.

The inherent modularity offers versatility, allowing inclusion of functionalities, e.g. dyes and cell adhesive additives, providing control over microgel composition. Integrated into robust and dynamic macrogels, microgels act as modular micro-building blocks, introducing multi-compartmentalization and reinforcing mechanical properties. This modular control spans across the nano, micro, and macro length scale.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>

Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
