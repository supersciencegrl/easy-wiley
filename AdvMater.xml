         <title>Gradient Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte Enables Selective and Fast Ion Transport for Robust Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (QSEs) have attracted extensive attentions due to their improved ion transport properties and high stability, which is synergistically based on tunable functional groups and confined solvent molecules among polymetric networks. However, the trade&#8208;off effect between the polymer content and ionic conductivity exists in QSEs, limiting their rate performance. In this work, the epitaxial polymerization strategy is used to build the gradient hydrogel networks (GHNs) covalently fixed on zinc anode. Then we reveal that the asymmetric distribution of negative charges benefits GHNs with fast and selective ionic transport properties, realizing a higher Zn2+ transference number of 0.65 than the homogeneous networks (0.52) at same polymer content. Meanwhile, the high&#8208;density networks formed at GHNs/Zn interface can efficiently immobilize free water and homogenize the Zn2+ flux, greatly inhibiting the water&#8208;involved parasitic reactions and dendrites growth. Thus, the GHNs enable dendrite&#8208;free stripping/plating over 1000&#160;h at 8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in Zn||Zn symmetric cell, as well as the evidently prolonged cycles in various full cells. This work will shed light on asymmetric engineering of ion transport channels in advanced quasi&#8208;solid battery systems to achieve high energy and safety.

         <title>Approaching Theoretical Limits in The Performance of Printed P&#8208;Type Cui Transistors via Room Temperature Vacancy Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Development of a novel high performing inorganic p&#8208;type thin film transistor could pave the way for new transparent electronic devices. This complements the widely commercialized n&#8208;type counterparts, indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO). Of the few potential candidates, copper monoiodide (CuI) stands out. It boasts visible light transparency and high intrinsic hole mobility (&gt; 40 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), and is suitable for various low&#8208;temperature processes. However, the performance of reported CuI transistors is still below expected mobility, mainly due to the uncontrolled excess charge&#8208; and defect&#8208;scattering from thermodynamically favoured formation of copper and iodine vacancies. Here, we report a solution&#8208;processed CuI transistor with a significantly improved mobility. This enhancement is achieved through a room&#8208;temperature vacancy&#8208;engineering processing strategy on high&#8208;k dielectrics, sodium&#8208;embedded alumina (SEA). A thorough set of chemical, structural, optical and electrical analyses elucidates the processing&#8208;dependent vacancy&#8208;modulation and its corresponding transport mechanism in CuI. This encompasses defect&#8208; and phonon&#8208;scattering, as well as the delocalization of charges in crystalline domains. As a result, the optimized CuI thin film transistors exhibit exceptionally high hole mobility of 21.6 &#177; 4.5 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Further, successful operation of IGZO&#8208;CuI complementary logic gates confirms applicability of our device.

         <title>Emerging Spintronic Materials and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims at discussing the spin&#8208;related performance and functionalities of diverse emerging spintronic material systems. The spin transport/manipulation properties of organic semiconductors, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, and 2D materials are discussed in the first place, respectively. Following, device multifunctionalities based on these materials are discussed, including spin&#8208;filter effect via chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity, spin&#8208;photovoltaic, spin&#8208;light&#8208;emitting, and spin&#8208;transistor functions.








Abstract
The explosive growth of the information era has put forward urgent requirements for ultrahigh&#8208;speed and extremely efficient computations. In direct contrary to charge&#8208;based computations, spintronics aims to use spins as information carriers for data storage, transmission, and decoding, to help fully realize electronic device miniaturization and high integration for next&#8208;generation computing technologies. Currently, many novel spintronic materials have been developed with unique properties and multifunctionalities, including organic semiconductors (OSCs), organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs), and 2D materials (2DMs). These materials are useful to fulfill the demand for developing diverse and advanced spintronic devices. Herein, these promising materials are systematically reviewed for advanced spintronic applications. Due to the distinct chemical and physical structures of OSCs, OIHPs, and 2DMs, their spintronic properties (spin transport and spin manipulation) are discussed separately. In addition, some multifunctionalities due to photoelectric and chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) are overviewed, including the spin&#8208;filter effect, spin&#8208;photovoltaics, spin&#8208;light emitting devices, and spin&#8208;transistor functions. Subsequently, challenges and future perspectives of using these multifunctional materials for the development of advanced spintronics are presented.

         <title>Nanomedicine for T&#8208;Cell Mediated Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomedicines provide modular platforms enabling T&#8208;cell immunotherapy enhancement. The impact of different nanomaterials on immunotherapy and the mechanisms involved deserve further study. Nanomedicine&#8208;based combination therapy can enhance T&#8208;cell immunotherapy, but require rational control over site of action and dose. Overall, nanomedicine offers promising solutions to enhance T&#8208;cell immunotherapy, which will further advance its clinical application.








Abstract
T&#8208;cell immunotherapy offers outstanding advantages in the treatment of various diseases, and with the selection of appropriate targets, efficient disease treatment can be achieved. T&#8208;cell immunotherapy has made great progress, but clinical results show that only a small proportion of patients can benefit from T&#8208;cell immunotherapy. The extensive mechanistic work outlines a blueprint for using T cells as a new option for immunotherapy, but also presents new challenges, including the balance between different fractions of T cells, the inherent T&#8208;cell suppression patterns in the disease microenvironment, the acquired loss of targets, and the decline of T&#8208;cell viability. The diversity, flexibility, and intelligence of nanomedicines give them great potential for enhancing T&#8208;cell immunotherapy. Here, how T&#8208;cell immunotherapy strategies can be adapted with different nanomaterials to enhance therapeutic efficacy is discussed. For two different pathological states, immunosuppression and immune activation, recent advances in nanomedicines for T&#8208;cell immunotherapy in diseases such as cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, and diabetes are summarized. With a focus on T&#8208;cell immunotherapy, this review highlights the outstanding advantages of nanomedicines in disease treatment, and helps advance one's understanding of the use of nanotechnology to enhance T&#8208;cell immunotherapy.

         <title>Liquid Metal Actuators: A Comparative Analysis of Surface Tension Controlled Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the operation and design principles of surface tension&#8208;controlled actuation by liquid metals and discusses their performance and functionalities. Theoretical pathways toward higher performances, thanks to the unique scaling law of surface tension, are analyzed and compared to other popular soft actuators. The review concludes by offering a roadmap for future research&#160;directions.








Abstract
Liquid metals, with their unique combination of electrical and mechanical properties, offer great opportunities for actuation based on surface tension modulation. Thanks to the scaling laws of surface tension, which can be electrochemically controlled at low voltages, liquid metal actuators stand out from other soft actuators for their remarkable characteristics such as high contractile strain rates and higher work densities at smaller length scales. This review summarizes the principles of liquid metal actuators and discusses their performance as well as theoretical pathways toward higher performances. The objective is to provide a comparative analysis of the ongoing development of liquid metal actuators. The design principles of the liquid metal actuators are analyzed, including low&#8208;level elemental principles (kinematics and electrochemistry), mid&#8208;level structural principles (reversibility, integrity, and scalability), and high&#8208;level functionalities. A wide range of practical use cases of liquid metal actuators from robotic locomotion and object manipulation to logic and computation is reviewed. From an energy perspective, strategies are compared for coupling the liquid metal actuators with an energy source toward fully untethered robots. The review concludes by offering a roadmap of future research directions of liquid metal actuators.

         <title>Visible to NIR&#8208;II Photoluminescence of Atomically Precise Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (NCs) have emerged as a new class of precision materials and attracted wide interest in recent years. One of the unique properties of such nanoclusters pertains to their photoluminescence (PL), for that it can widely span visible to near infrared&#8211;I and &#8211;II wavelengths, and even beyond 1700 nm by manipulating the size, structure, and composition. The current research efforts focus on the structure&#8208;PL correlation and the development of strategies for raising the PL quantum yields, which is nontrivial when moving from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared wavelengths, especially in the NIR&#8211;II region. This review summarizes the recent progress in the field, including i) the types of PL observed in gold NCs such as fluorescence, phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence, as well as dual emission; ii) some effective strategies that have been devised to improve the PLQY of gold NCs by heterometal doping, surface rigidification, and core phonon engineering, with double&#8208;digit QYs for the NIR PL on the horizons; and iii) the applications of luminescent gold NCs in bioimaging, photosensitization, and optoelectronics. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges and opportunities for future research.

         <title>Suppressing Buried Interface Nonradiative Recombination Losses Towards High&#8208;efficiency Antimony Triselenide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) has possessed excellent optoelectronic properties and has gained interest as a light&#8208;harvesting material for photovoltaic technology over the past several years. However, the severe interfacial and bulk recombination obviously contribute to significant carrier transport loss thus leading to the deterioration of power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, we synergistically employ buried interface and heterojunction engineering to regulate the film growth kinetic and optimize the band alignment. Through this approach, the orientation of the precursor films is successfully controlled, promoting the preferred orientational growth of the (hk1) of the Sb2Se3 films. Besides, interfacial trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination loss and heterojunction band alignment are successfully minimized and optimized. As a result, the champion device presents a PCE of 9.24% with short&#8208;circuit density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of 29.47&#160;mA/cm2 and 63.65%, respectively, representing the highest efficiency in sputtered&#8208;derived Sb2Se3 solar cells. This work provides an insightful prescription for fabricating high&#8208;quality Sb2Se3 thin film and enhancing the performance of Sb2Se3 solar cells.

         <title>Targeted Depletion of Individual Pathogen by Bacteria&#8208;templated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Selective and targeted removal of individual species or strains of bacteria from complex communities can be desirable over traditional and broadly acting antibiotics in several conditions. However, strategies that could detect and ablate bacteria with high specificity are emerging in recent years. Herein, we report a platform that uses bacteria as a template to synthesize polymers containing guanidinium groups for self&#8208;selective depletion of specific pathogenic bacteria without disturbing microbial communities. Different from conventional antibiotics, repeated treatment of bacteria with the templated polymers does not evolve drug resistance mutants after 20 days of serial passaging. Especially, high in vivo therapeutic effectiveness of the templated polymers is achieved in E. coli&#8208; and P. aeruginosa&#8208;induced microbial peritonitis. The templated polymers have shown high selectivity in in vivo antimicrobial activity, which has excellent potential as systemic antimicrobials against bacterial infections.

         <title>A Counterion&#8208;Free Strategy for Chronic Metabolic Acidosis Based on an Orally Administered Gut&#8208;Restricted Inorganic Adsorbent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chronic metabolic acidosis, arising as a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), not only reduces patients&#8217; quality of life but also aggravates renal impairment. The only available therapeutic modality, involving intravenous infusion of NaHCO3, engenders undesirable sodium retention, thereby increasing hemodynamic load and seriously exacerbating the primary disease. This deleterious cascade extends to the development of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Herein, we developed an orally administered, gut&#8208;restricted inorganic adsorbent that can effectively alleviate chronic metabolic acidosis without causing any electrolytic derangement or superfluous cardiovascular strain. The genesis of ABC&#8208;350 entails the engineering of bismuth subcarbonate via annealing, thereby yielding a partially &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;doped (BiO)2CO3 biphasic crystalline structure framework enriched with atomic vacancies. ABC&#8208;350 can selectively remove chloride ions and protons from the gastrointestinal tract, mimicking the physiological response to gastric acid removal and resulting in increased serum bicarbonate. Owing to its gut&#8208;restricted nature, ABC&#8208;350 exhibits commendable biosafety, averting undue systemic exposure. In two rat models of metabolic acidosis, ABC&#8208;350 emerges not only as a potent mitigator of acidosis but also effects discernible amelioration concerning proximal tubular morphology, interstitial fibrosis, and the incendiary cascades incited by metabolic acidosis within the renal milieu. ABC&#8208;350, as the translationally relevant material, provides a promising strategy for the treatment of metabolic acidosis.

Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) has always posed a significant challenge, limiting their wide application in cold environments. In this work, we report the high&#8208;performance LIBs working under ultra&#8208;low&#8208;temperature conditions, which is achieved by employing the weak&#8208;solvation and low&#8208;viscosity isobutyronitrile as a cosolvent to tame the affinity between solvents and lithium ions. The as&#8208;prepared electrolytes exhibit a sufficiently high conductivity (1.152 mS cm&#8722;1) at &#8208;70&#160;&#176;C. The electrolytes enable LiCoO2 cathode and graphite anode to achieve high Coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.9% during long&#8208;term cycling at room temperature, and to respectively achieve 75.8% and 100.0% of their room&#8208;temperature capacities at &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C. Even the LiCoO2//graphite pouch cells can retain 68.7% of the room&#8208;temperature capacity when discharged at &#8208;70&#160;&#176;C, and present stable cycling performance at &#8208;40 and 60&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a solution for the development of advanced electrolytes to enable LIBs working at wide&#8208;temperatures range.

         <title>Protein Nanotubes as Advanced Material Platforms and Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Protein nanotubes (PNTs) as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanocarriers are promising for various potential applications both in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Due to the edible starting sources, i.e., &#945;&#8208;lactalbumin, lysozyme, bovine serum albumin, and ovalbumin, PNTs bear properties of biocompatibility and biodegradability. Additionally, their large specific surface area and hydrophobic core can be used for chemical modification and loading of bioactive substances, respectively. Moreover, their enhanced permeability and penetration ability across biological barriers such as intestinal mucus, extracellular matrix, thrombus clot, and biofilms, make it a promising delivery platform and biomaterials for health&#8208;related applications and biological systems. Most importantly, their simple preparation processes enable large&#8208;scale production, making it possible targeting applications in the biomedical and nanotechnological fields. Understanding the self&#8208;assembly principles for these systems is important for controlling their morphology, size, and shape, and thus provides the ground to a multitude of applications. Here, we comprehensively review the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of PNTs including their building materials, physicochemical properties, self&#8208;assembly and formation mechanisms. We then discuss and highlight the advantages and limitations, as well as challenges and prospects of these PNTs for their successful application in biomaterial and pharmaceutical sectors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein nanotubes (PNTs) as state-of-the-art nanocarriers are promising for various potential applications both in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Due to the edible starting sources, i.e., &#945;-lactalbumin, lysozyme, bovine serum albumin, and ovalbumin, PNTs bear properties of biocompatibility and biodegradability. Additionally, their large specific surface area and hydrophobic core can be used for chemical modification and loading of bioactive substances, respectively. Moreover, their enhanced permeability and penetration ability across biological barriers such as intestinal mucus, extracellular matrix, thrombus clot, and biofilms, make it a promising delivery platform and biomaterials for health-related applications and biological systems. Most importantly, their simple preparation processes enable large-scale production, making it possible targeting applications in the biomedical and nanotechnological fields. Understanding the self-assembly principles for these systems is important for controlling their morphology, size, and shape, and thus provides the ground to a multitude of applications. Here, we comprehensively review the current state-of-the-art of PNTs including their building materials, physicochemical properties, self-assembly and formation mechanisms. We then discuss and highlight the advantages and limitations, as well as challenges and prospects of these PNTs for their successful application in biomaterial and pharmaceutical sectors. We also highlight potential cytotoxicity of PNTs and the need of regulations as a critical factor for enabling in vivo applications. In the end, a brief summary and future prospects for PNTs as advanced material platforms and delivery systems are included.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reconstruction of vesicle assemblies with DNA nanorulers for resolving heterogeneity of vesicles in live cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanoscale vesicles such as synaptic vesicles play pivotal role in efficient inter&#8208;neuronal communications in vivo. However, the co&#8208;existence of single vesicle and vesicle clusters in living cells increases the heterogeneity of vesicle populations, which largely complicates the quantitative analysis of the vesicles. Hence, the high spatiotemporal monitoring of vesicle assemblies is currently incompletely resolved. Here, we used synthetic vesicles and DNA nanorulers to reconstruct in vitro the vesicle assemblies that mimic vesicle clusters in living cells. DNA nanorulers programmed the lateral distance of vesicle assemblies from 3 nm to 10 nm. We used the carbon fiber nanoelectrode (CFNE) to amperometric monitor artificial vesicles assemblies with sub&#8208;10 nm interspaces, and obtained a larger proportion of complex events. We resolve the heterogeneity of individual vesicle release kinetics in PC12 cells with the temporal resolution down to &#8764;0.1 ms. We further analyzed the aggregation state of intracellular vesicles and the exocytosis of living cells with electrochemical vesicle cytometry. Our results indicated that the exocytosis of vesicle clusters was critically dependent on the size of clusters. This technology has potential as a tool to shed light on the heterogeneity analysis of vesicle populations.

         <title>Fe Cluster Modified Co9S8 Heterojunction: Highly Efficient Photoelectrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting and Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Designing bifunctional low&#8208;cost photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalysts for converting solar and electric energy into hydrogen energy remains a huge challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a heterojunction (Fe cluster modified Co9S8) for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the good electronic conductivity and spatial confinement of the N&#8208;doped carbon skeleton, as well as the electronic structure regulation of the Fe cluster, Co9S8&#8208;Fe@CNT exhibits excellent catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 150&#160;mV for OER and 135&#160;mV for HER at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Upon light irradiation, holes and electrons are generated in the valence band and conduction band of the Co9S8, respectively. Part of the charges are transferred to the interface to facilitate the catalytic reaction, while the remaining are transferred by the electrode. When working as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, the performance can reach 1.33&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under light conditions, which is significantly better than 1.52&#160;V in a dark environment. Theoretical calculations revealed lowered Gibbs free energy (&#8710;GH*) of the heterojunction with the effect of Fe modification of Co9S8. This work sheds a new light in designing novel photoelectrochemical materials to convert solar energy and electric energy into chemical energy.

         <title>Inhibition of Ion Migration for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The resultant perovskite solar cells are intrinsically unstable owing to ion migration, which severely impedes performance enhancement, even with device encapsulation. This review aims to provide a thorough understanding of the origin of ion migration and the action of effective inhibition strategies that are essential for the development of &#8220;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#8221; perovskite solar cells with high intrinsic stability to accelerate commercialization.








Abstract
In recent years, organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites are now emerging as the most attractive alternatives for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic devices, due to their excellent optoelectronic characteristics and low manufacturing cost. However, the resultant perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) are intrinsically unstable owing to ion migration, which severely impedes performance enhancement, even with device encapsulation. There is no doubt that the investigation of ion migration and the summarization of recent advances in inhibition strategies are necessary to develop &#8220;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#8221; PVSCs with high intrinsic stability for accelerated commercialization. This review systematically elaborates on the generation and fundamental mechanisms of ion migration in PVSCs, the impact of ion migration on hysteresis, phase segregation, and operational stability, and the characterizations for ion migration in PVSCs. Then, many related works on the strategies for inhibiting ion migration toward highly efficient and stable PVSCs are summarized. Finally, the perspectives on the current obstacles and prospective strategies for inhibition of ion migration in PVSCs to boost operational stability and meet all of the requirements for commercialization success are summarized.

         <title>Interdisciplinary&#8208;Inspired Smart Antibacterial Materials and Their Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces the recent advances in smart antibacterial materials (SAMs) focusing on their interdisciplinarity. To combat antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria, SAMs are developed by adopting ideas incubated in materials science, physiology, and biomimicry. More interdisciplinary collaborations are expected for the continuous development, promotion, and clinical adoption of SAMs.








Abstract
The discovery of antibiotics has saved millions of lives, but the emergence of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria has become another problem in modern medicine. To avoid or reduce the overuse of antibiotics in antibacterial treatments, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, pathogen&#8208;targeting nanoparticles, immunogenic nano&#8208;toxoids, and biomimetic materials are being developed to make sterilization better and smarter than conventional therapies. The common goal of smart antibacterial materials (SAMs) is to increase the antibiotic efficacy or function via an antibacterial mechanism different from that of antibiotics in order to increase the antibacterial and biological properties while reducing the risk of drug resistance. The research and development of SAMs are increasingly interdisciplinary because new designs require the knowledge of different fields and input/collaboration from scientists in different fields. A good understanding of energy conversion in materials, physiological characteristics in cells and bacteria, and bactericidal structures and components in nature are expected to promote the development of SAMs. In this review, the importance of multidisciplinary insights for SAMs is emphasized, and the latest advances in SAMs are categorized and discussed according to the pertinent disciplines including materials science, physiology, and biomimicry.

         <title>Toward Sustainable All Solid&#8208;State Li&#8211;Metal Batteries: Perspectives on Battery Technology and Recycling Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;metal batteries (ASSLMBs) show promising potential for using in future energy storage devices. However, underexplored recycling aspects for ASSLMBs greatly restrict their sustainable development. Here, recent advancements in recycling technology and potentially viable recycling concepts for ASSLMBs are summarized, along with a discussion on recycling&#8208;oriented battery design. Future directions and perspectives for sustainable ASSLMBs operation are discussed.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;based batteries are gradually evolving from the liquid to the solid state in terms of safety and energy density, where all solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are considered the most promising candidates. This is demonstrated by the Bluecar electric vehicle produced by the Bollor&#233; Group, which is utilized in car&#8208;sharing services in several cities worldwide. Despite impressive progress in the development of ASSLMBs, their avenues for recycling them remain underexplored, and combined with the current explosion of spent Li&#8208;ion batteries, they should attract widespread interest from academia and industry. Here, the potential challenges of recycling ASSLMBs as compared to Li&#8208;ion batteries are analyzed and the current progress and prospects for recycling ASSLMBs are summarized and analyzed. Drawing on the lessons learned from Li&#8208;ion battery recycling, it is important to design sustainable recycling technologies before ASSLMBs gain widespread market adoption. A battery&#8208;recycling&#8208;oriented design is also highlighted for ASSLMBs to promote the recycling rate and maximize profitability. Finally, future research directions, challenges, and prospects are outlined to provide strategies for achieving sustainable development of ASSLMBs.

         <title>Van der Waals Ferroelectrics: Theories, Materials, and Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D vdW ferroelectric materials reveal great potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and spintronics, owing to robust spontaneous polarization, widespread bandgap tunability, inert surfaces, and silicon&#8208;based technology compatibility. This review covers their recent advances in ferroelectricity origin and practical applications, especially in artificial intelligence. The hot topic of sliding ferroelectrics in physical origins and novel properties is also focused on.








Abstract
In recent years, an increasing number of 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials are theory&#8208;predicted or laboratory&#8208;validated to possess in&#8208;plane (IP) and/or out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) spontaneous ferroelectric polarization. Due to their dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces, interlayer charge coupling, robust polarization, tunable energy band structures, and compatibility with silicon&#8208;based technologies, vdW ferroelectric materials exhibit great promise in ferroelectric memories, neuromorphic computing, nanogenerators, photovoltaic devices, spintronic devices, and so on. Here, the very recent advances in the field of vdW ferroelectrics (FEs) are reviewed. First, theories of ferroelectricity are briefly discussed. Then, a comprehensive summary of the non&#8208;stacking vdW ferroelectric materials is provided based on their crystal structures and the emerging sliding ferroelectrics. In addition, their potential applications in various branches/frontier fields are enumerated, with a focus on artificial intelligence. Finally, the challenges and development prospects of vdW ferroelectrics are discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Laser&#8208;Induced Synthesis of MOF Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) derivatives show excellent diversity and tunability and thus are promising materials for catalytic, environmental, and energy&#8208;related applications. Laser&#8208;induced synthesis endows MOF derivatives with new features due to their high efficiency, selectivity, and programmability. In this paper, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in laser&#8208;induced synthesis of MOF derivatives are reviewed, and the structure&#8208;effect relationships and functional applications are highlighted.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline materials with permanent pores constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of organic ligands and metal clusters through coordination bonds. Due to their diversity and tunability, MOFs are used as precursors to be converted into other types of functional materials by pyrolytic recrystallization. Laser&#8208;induced synthesis is proven to be a powerful pyrolytic processing technique with fast and accurate laser irradiation, low loss, high efficiency, selectivity, and programmability, which endow MOF derivatives with new features. Laser&#8208;induced MOF derivatives exhibit high versatility in multidisciplinary research fields. In this review, first, the basic principles of laser smelting and the types of materials for laser preparation of MOF derivatives are briefly introduced. Subsequently, it is focused on the peculiarity of the engineering of structural defects and their applications in catalysis, environmental protection, and energy fields. Finally, the challenges and opportunities at the current stage are highlighted with the aim of elucidating the future direction of the rapidly growing field of laser&#8208;induced synthesis of MOF derivatives.

         <title>Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction: Ammonia Synthesis and the Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitrogen cycle in global ecosystem has been greatly disrupted by intensive anthropogenic activities. Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) provides a promising strategy to green ammonia production, promoting sustainable nitrogen cycle. This review presents the recent important advances of electrochemical NO3RR and pushes the boundaries of NO3RR beyond ammonia synthesis by incorporating C&#63743;N coupling processes and novel N species&#8208;based batteries.








Abstract
Natural nitrogen cycle has been severely disrupted by anthropogenic activities. The overuse of N&#8208;containing fertilizers induces the increase of nitrate level in surface and ground waters, and substantial emission of nitrogen oxides causes heavy air pollution. Nitrogen gas, as the main component of air, has been used for mass ammonia production for over a century, providing enough nutrition for agriculture to support world population increase. In the last decade, researchers have made great efforts to develop ammonia processes under ambient conditions to combat the intensive energy consumption and high carbon emission associated with the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. Among different techniques, electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) can achieve nitrate removal and ammonia generation simultaneously using renewable electricity as the power, and there is an exponential growth of studies in this research direction. Here, a timely and comprehensive review on the important progresses of electrochemical NO3RR, covering the rational design of electrocatalysts, emerging C&#63743;N coupling reactions, and advanced energy conversion and storage systems is provided. Moreover, future perspectives are proposed to accelerate the industrialized NH3 production and green synthesis of chemicals, leading to a sustainable nitrogen cycle via prosperous N&#8208;based electrochemistry.

         <title>Hydrogels and Bioprinting in Bone Tissue Engineering: Creating Artificial Stem&#8208;Cell Niches for In Vitro Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on hydrogels and 3D bioprinting in bone tissue engineering for development of&#160;in vitro&#160;models of bone. It highlights challenges in recapitulating the biological complexity seen in bone and how synergistic application of dynamic hydrogels and innovative bioprinting pipelines can address these challenges to achieve bone models.








Abstract
Advances in bioprinting have enabled the fabrication of complex tissue constructs with high speed and resolution. However, there remains significant structural and biological complexity within tissues that bioprinting is unable to recapitulate. Bone, for example, has a hierarchical organization ranging from the molecular to whole organ level. Current bioprinting techniques and the materials employed have imposed limits on the scale, speed, and resolution that can be achieved, rendering the technique unable to reproduce the structural hierarchies and cell&#8211;matrix interactions that are observed in bone. The shift toward biomimetic approaches in bone tissue engineering, where hydrogels provide biophysical and biochemical cues to encapsulated cells, is a promising approach to enhancing the biological function and development of tissues for in vitro modeling. A major focus in bioprinting of bone tissue for in vitro modeling is creating dynamic microenvironmental niches to support, stimulate, and direct the cellular processes for bone formation and remodeling. Hydrogels are ideal materials for imitating the extracellular matrix since they can be engineered to present various cues whilst allowing bioprinting. Here, recent advances in hydrogels and 3D bioprinting toward creating a microenvironmental niche that is conducive to tissue engineering of in vitro models of bone are reviewed.

         <title>Highly Bright and Stable Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskite White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites (DPs) are emerging highly stable emitters with efficient broadband self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) photoluminescence (PL), but their low electroluminescent (EL) efficiency is a critical shortcoming. We promoted the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and luminance of DP&#8208;based white light&#8208;emitting diode (wLED) with a normal device structure to 0.76% and 2793&#160;cd m&#8722;2 via two modifications: We prevented the formation of adverse metallic silver, spatially confined STE, and lowered local site symmetry in Cs2Na0.4Ag0.6In0.97Bi0.03Cl6 DP by terbium doping; and we developed a guest&#8208;host strategy to improve film morphology, reduce defect density and increase carrier mobility. These alterations caused substantial increases in STE radiative recombination and charge injection efficiency of perovskite layer. Finally, pure white EL with ideal color coordinates of (0.328, 0.329) and a record&#8208;breaking optoelectronic performance was achieved by introducing additional green carbon dots in LED to fill the deficient green component.

Abstract
Photocatalysts as long&#8208;lasting, benign reagents for disinfection of bacteria in hospitals and public area/facilities/transportation vehicles are strongly needed. A common limitation for all existing semiconductor photocatalysts is the requirement of activation by external UV&#8208;visible&#8208;near infrared (NIR) light with wavelengths shorter than &#8764;1265 nm. None of existing photocatalysts can function during night time in the absence of external light. Herein, we report an unprecedented LaB6 plasmonic photocatalyst, which can absorb UV&#8208;visible&#8208;NIR light and mid&#8208;IR (3900 nm) light to split water and generate hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals for decomposition of organic pollutants as well as killing of multidrug&#8208;resistant E. coli bacteria. Mid&#8208;IR light (2&#8764;50 &#956;m) is readily available from the natural environments, via thermal radiation of warm/hot objects on the earth, including human bodies, animals, buildings, etc.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Magnesium Deposition Induced by Paper&#8208;Based Triple&#8208;Gradient Scaffolds Toward Flexible Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of advanced magnesium metal batteries (MMBs) has been hindered by longstanding challenges, such as the inability to induce uniform Mg nucleation and the inefficient utilization of Mg foil. This study introduces a novel solution in the form of a flexible, lightweight, paper&#8208;based scaffold that incorporates gradient conductivity, magnesiophilicity, and pore size. This design was achieved through an industrially adaptable papermaking process in which the ratio of carboxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes to softwood cellulose fibers was meticulously adjusted. The triple&#8208;gradient structure of the scaffold enabled the regulation of Mg ion flux, promoting bottom&#8208;up Mg deposition. Owing to its high flexibility, low thickness, and reduced density, the scaffold has potential applications in flexible and wearable electronics. Accordingly, the triple&#8208;gradient electrodes exhibited stable operation for over 1200 h at 3 mA cm&#8722;2/3 mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetrical cells, markedly outperforming the non&#8208;gradient and metallic Mg alternatives. Notably, this study marks the first successful fabrication of a flexible MMB pouch full cell, achieving an impressive volumetric energy density of 244 Wh L&#8722;1. The simplicity and scalability of the triple&#8208;gradient design, which uses readily available materials through an industrially compatible papermaking process, open new doors for the production of flexible, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment Modulating CaCO3&#8208;based Colloidosomal Microreactors Can Generally Reinforce Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tumor hypoxia and acidity, two general features of solid tumors, are known to have negative effect on cancer immunotherapy by directly causing dysfunction of effector immune cells and promoting suppressive immune cells inside tumors. Herein, a multifunctional colloidosomal microreactor is constructed by encapsulating catalase within calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle&#8208;assembled colloidosomes (abbreviated as CaP CSs) via the classic double emulsion method. The yielded CCaP CSs exhibit well&#8208;retained proton&#8208;scavenging and hydrogen peroxide decomposition performances and can thus neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia and suppress lactate production upon intratumoral administration. Consequently, CCaP CSs treatment can activate potent antitumor immunity and thus significantly enhance the therapeutic potency of coloaded anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) antibodies in both murine subcutaneous CT26 and orthotopic 4T1 tumor xenografts. In addition, such CCaP CSs treatment also markedly reinforces the therapeutic potency of epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;expressing chimeric antigen receptor T (EGFR&#8208;CAR&#8208;T) cells toward a human triple&#8208;negative breast cancer xenograft by promoting their tumor infiltration and effector cytokine secretion. Therefore, this study highlights that chemical modulation of tumor acidity and hypoxia can collectively reverse tumor immunosuppression and thus significantly potentiate both immune checkpoint blockade and CAR&#8208;T cell immunotherapies toward solid tumors.

         <title>Direct Seawater Electrolysis: From Catalyst Design to Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Direct seawater electrolysis (DSE) for hydrogen production, using earth&#8208;abundant seawater as the feedstock and renewable electricity as the driving source, paves a new opportunity for flexible energy conversion/storage and smooths the volatility of renewable energy. Unfortunately, the complex environments of seawater impose significant challenges on the design of DSE catalysts, and the practical performance of many current DSE catalysts remains unsatisfactory on the device level. However, many studies predominantly concentrated on the development of electrocatalysts for DSE without giving due consideration to the specific devices. To mitigate this gap, we systematically evaluated the most recent progress (mainly published within the year 2020&#8211;2023) of DSE electrocatalysts and devices. By discussing key bottlenecks, corresponding mitigation strategies, and various device designs and applications, we emphasize that it is tremendously challenging to address the trade&#8208;off among activity, stability, and selectivity for DSE electrocatalysts by a single shot. In addition, the rational design of the DSE electrocatalysts needs to align with the specific device configuration, which is more effective than attempting to comprehensively enhance all catalytic parameters. This work, featuring the first review of this kind to consider rational catalyst design in the framework of DSE devices, will facilitate practical DSE development.

         <title>Slippery Porous&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Infused Porous Surface (SPIPS) with On&#8208;Demand Responsive Switching Between &#8220;Defensive&#8221; And &#8220;Offensive&#8221; Antifouling Modes</title>

Abstract
Slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have received widespread attention in the antifouling field. However, the reduction in antifouling performance caused by lubricant loss limits their application in marine antifouling. Herein, inspired by the skin of a poison dart frog which contains venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF&#8208;8 is prepared as a lubricant and injected into a silicone polyurethane matrix to construct a new type of SLIPS for marine antifouling applications: the slippery porous&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SPIPS). The SPIPS consists of a responsive antifoulant&#8208;releasing switch between &#8220;defensive&#8221; and &#8220;offensive&#8221; antifouling modes to intelligently enhance the antifouling effect after lubricant loss. The SPIPS can adjust antifouling performance to meet the antifouling requirements under different light conditions. The wastage of antifoulants is reduced, thereby effectively maintaining the durability and service life of SLIPS materials. The SPIPS exhibits efficient lubricant self&#8208;replenishment, self&#8208;cleaning, anti&#8208;protein, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;algal, and self&#8208;healing (97.48%) properties. Furthermore, it shows satisfactory 360&#8208;day antifouling performance in actual marine fields during boom seasons, demonstrating the longest antifouling lifespan in the field tests of reported SLIPS coatings. Hence, the SPIPS can effectively promote the development of SLIPS for neritic antifouling.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Activatable Heterostructured Nanoadjuvant Cop/Nicop Executing Lactate Metabolism Interventions for Boosted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Therapy And Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser&#8208;induced photoimmunotherapy has aroused great interest due to its intrinsic non&#8208;invasiveness and spatiotemporal precision, while immune evasion evoked by lactic acid (LA) accumulation severely limits its clinical outcomes. Although several metabolic interventions have been devoted to ameliorate immunosuppression, intracellular residual LA still remains a potential energy source for oncocyte proliferation. Herein, we construct an immunomodulatory nanoadjuvant based on a yolk&#8208;shell CoP/NiCoP (CNCP) heterostructure loaded with the monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) inhibitor fluvastatin sodium (Flu) to concurrently relieve immunosuppression and elicit robust antitumor immunity. Under NIR irradiation, CNCP heterojunctions exhibit superior photothermal performance and photocatalytic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen. The continuous heat then facilitates Flu release to restrain LA exudation from tumor cells, whereas cumulative LA can be depleted as a hole scavenger to improve photocatalytic efficiency. Subsequently, potentiated photocatalytic therapy (PCT) can not only initiate systematic immunoreaction, but also provoke severe mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupt the energy supply for heat shock protein (HSP) synthesis, in turn realizing mild photothermal therapy (PTT). Consequently, LA metabolic remodeling endows an intensive cascade treatment with an optimal safety profile to effectually suppress tumor proliferation and metastasis, which offers a new paradigm for the development of metabolism&#8208;regulated immunotherapy.

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;free And High&#8208;Rate Potassium Metal Batteries Sustained by An Inorganic&#8208;Rich Sei</title>

Abstract
Potassium metal battery is an appealing candidate for future energy storage. However, its application is plagued by the notorious dendrite proliferation at the anode side, which entails the formation of vulnerable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and non&#8208;uniform potassium deposition on the current collector. Here we report a dual&#8208;modification design of aluminum current collector to render dendrite&#8208;free potassium anodes with favorable reversibility. We achieve to modulate the electronic structure of the designed current collector and accordingly attain an SEI architecture with robust inorganic&#8208;rich constituents, which is evidenced by detailed cryo&#8208;EM inspection and X&#8208;ray depth profiling. The thus&#8208;produced SEI manages to expedite ionic conductivity and guide homogeneous potassium deposition. Compared to the potassium metal cells assembled using typical aluminum current collector, cells based on our designed current collector realize improved rate capability (maintaining 400&#160;h under 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and low&#8208;temperature durability (stable operation at &#8722;50&#176;C). Moreover, scalable production of our current collector allows for the sustainable construction of high&#8208;safety potassium metal batteries, with the potential for reducing the manufacturing cost.

         <title>Substrate Engineering for Chemical Vapor Deposition Growth of Large&#8208;Scale 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a critical summary on the recent development of substrate engineering strategies, in specific, surface&#8208;stepping approaches, chemical&#8208;functionalization methods, substrate seeding strategies and so on, with the aim of the growth of large&#8208;scale 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The contribution might guide the deep understanding on the controlled growth of high&#8208;quality 2D TMDs toward their industrial&#8208;scale practical applications.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale production of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is essential to realize their industrial applications. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been considered as a promising method for the controlled growth of high&#8208;quality and large&#8208;scale 2D TMDs. During a CVD process, the substrate plays a crucial role in anchoring the source materials, promoting the nucleation and stimulating the epitaxial growth. It thus significantly affects the thickness, microstructure, and crystal quality of the products, which are particularly important for obtaining 2D TMDs with expected morphology and size. Here, an insightful review is provided by focusing on the recent development associated with the substrate engineering strategies for CVD preparation of large&#8208;scale 2D TMDs. First, the interaction between 2D TMDs and substrates, a key factor for the growth of high&#8208;quality materials, is systematically discussed by combining the latest theoretical calculations. Based on this, the effect of various substrate engineering approaches on the growth of large&#8208;area 2D TMDs is summarized in detail. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of substrate engineering for the future development of 2D TMDs are discussed. This review might provide deep insight into the controllable growth of high&#8208;quality 2D TMDs toward their industrial&#8208;scale practical applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Eutectic Electrolyte with Weak Hydrogen Bonds for High&#8208;Rate and Ultra&#8208;Stable Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
As the need for sustainable battery chemistry grows, non&#8208;metallic ammonium ion (NH4+) batteries are receiving considerable attention because of their unique properties, such as low cost, nontoxicity, and environmental sustainability. In this study, we elucidated the solvation interactions between NH4+ and solvents and proposed design principles for NH4+ weakly solvated electrolytes. Given that hydrogen bond interactions dominate the solvation of NH4+ and solvents, the strength of the solvent's electrostatic potential directly determines the strength of its solvating power. As a proof of concept, succinonitrile with relatively weak electronegativity was selected to construct a metal&#8208;free eutectic electrolyte (MEE). As expected, this MEE was able to significantly broaden the electrochemical stability window and reduce the solvent coordination number and binding energy in the solvation shell, which led to a lower desolvation energy barrier and a fast charge transfer process. As a result, the as&#8208;constructed NH4&#8208;ion batteries exhibited superior reversible rate capability (energy density of 65&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1total active mass at 600&#160;W kg&#8211;1) and unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performance (retention of 90.2% after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8211;1). Our proposed methodology for constructing weakly hydrogen bonded electrolytes will provide guidelines for implementing high&#8208;rate and ultra&#8208;stable NH4+&#8208;based energy storage systems.

         <title>Ultrafast and Controlled Capturing, Loading, and Release of Extracellular Vesicles by a Portable Microstructured Electrochemical Fluidic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A portable device that offers an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip approach, capable of separating extracellular vesicles directly from biological fluids in a simple and efficient manner, while also allowing their subsequent manipulation, is reported. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by all living cells and are found in body fluids. They exert numerous physiological and pathological functions and serve as cargo shuttles. Due to their safety and inherent bioactivity, they have emerged as versatile therapeutic agents, biomarkers, and potential drug carriers. Despite the growing interest in EVs, current progress in this field is, in part, limited by relatively inefficient isolation techniques. Conventional methods are indeed slow, laborious, require specialized laboratory equipment, and may result in low yield and purity. This work describes an electrochemically controlled &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; device enabling capturing, loading, and releasing of EVs. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes. It rapidly isolates EVs with a high level of purity from various biofluids. As a proof of principle, the device is applied to isolate EVs from skin wounds of healthy and diabetic mice. Strikingly, it is found that EVs from healing wounds of diabetic mice are enriched in mitochondrial proteins compared to those of healthy mice. Additionally, the device improves the loading protocol of EVs with polyplexes, and may therefore find applications in nucleic acid delivery. Overall, the electrochemical device can greatly facilitate the development of EVs&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Toward Chiral Lasing from All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Flexible Perovskite&#8208;Nanocrystal&#8211;Liquid&#8208;Crystal Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing membrane consisting of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) layers is demonstrated. Two CLCs layers with same helical structure act as reflectors to construct a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. The selective reflection of CLCs leads to polarization selectivity. The membrane device is highly flexible and all&#8208;solution&#8208;processable and exhibits a high dissymmetry factor of 1.4.








Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) coherent light sources are of great potential for various advanced optical applications spanning displays/imaging to data processing/encryption and quantum communication. Here, the first demonstration of CP amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing and flexible membrane device is reported. The membrane device consists of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs)&#160;layers sandwiched within a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (F&#8211;P) cavity architecture. The chiral liquid crystal cavity enables the generation of CP light from the device. The device is completely solution&#8208;processable and displays CP ASE with record dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 1.4, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher as compared with glum of CP luminescence of chiral ligand&#8208;capped colloidal PNCs. The device exhibits ultraflexibility as the ASE intensity remains unchanged after repeated 100 bending cycles and it is stable for more than 3 months with 80% of its original intensity. Furthermore, the ultraflexibility enables the generation of ASE from various objects of different geometric surfaces covered with the flexible perovskite membrane device. This work not only demonstrates the first CP ASE from a PNCs membrane with extremely high glum but also opens the door toward the fabrication of ultraflexible, extremely stable, and all solution&#8208;processable perovskite chiral laser devices.

&lt;p&gt;Circularly polarized (CP) coherent light sources are of great potential for various advanced optical applications spanning displays/imaging to data processing/encryption and quantum communication. Here, the first demonstration of CP amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free-standing and flexible membrane device is reported. The membrane device consists of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs)&#160;layers sandwiched within a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (F&#8211;P) cavity architecture. The chiral liquid crystal cavity enables the generation of CP light from the device. The device is completely solution-processable and displays CP ASE with record dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) as high as 1.4, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher as compared with &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; of CP luminescence of chiral ligand-capped colloidal PNCs. The device exhibits ultraflexibility as the ASE intensity remains unchanged after repeated 100 bending cycles and it is stable for more than 3 months with 80% of its original intensity. Furthermore, the ultraflexibility enables the generation of ASE from various objects of different geometric surfaces covered with the flexible perovskite membrane device. This work not only demonstrates the first CP ASE from a PNCs membrane with extremely high &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; but also opens the door toward the fabrication of ultraflexible, extremely stable, and all solution-processable perovskite chiral laser devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Assemblable Bespoke Scaffold as a Versatile Microcryogel Carrier for Site&#8208;Specific Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hive&#8208;structured assemblable bespoke scaffold (HIVE) can be manually assembled in any shape/size with ease, so surgeons can create a scaffold that will best fit a defect. Simultaneously, it can have site&#8208;specific treatments by working as a carrier filled with microcryogels incorporating different biological factors in different pockets of HIVE. This simple and cost&#8208;effective patient&#8208;specific implant reduces the healthcare system burden.








Abstract
Advances in additive manufacturing have led to diverse patient&#8208;specific implant designs utilizing computed tomography, but this requires intensive work and financial implications. Here, Digital Light Processing is used to fabricate a hive&#8208;structured assemblable bespoke scaffold (HIVE). HIVE can be manually assembled in any shape/size with ease, so a surgeon can create a scaffold that will best fit a defect before implantation. Simultaneously, it can have site&#8208;specific treatments by working as a carrier filled with microcryogels (MC) incorporating different biological factors in different pockets of HIVE. After characterization, possible site&#8208;specific applications are investigated by utilizing HIVE as a versatile carrier with incorporated treatments such as growth factors (GF), bioceramic, or cells. HIVE as a GF&#8208;carrier shows a controlled release of bone morphogenetic protein/vascular endothelial growth factor (BMP/VEGF) and induced osteogenesis/angiogenesis from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC)/human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, as a bioceramic&#8208;carrier, HIVE demonstrates enhanced mineralization and osteogenesis, and as a HUVEC carrier, it upregulates both osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression of hMSCs. HIVE with different combinations of MCs yields a distinct local effect and successful cell migration is confirmed within assembled HIVEs. Finally, an in vivo&#160;rat subcutaneous implantation demonstrates site&#8208;specific osteogenesis and angiogenesis.

         <title>Near&#8208; and Far&#8208;Field Observation of Phonon Polaritons in Wafer&#8208;Scale Multilayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride Prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infrared nanoimaging reveals propagating phonon polaritons on wafer&#8208;scale nanometer&#8208;thick hexagonal boron nitride grown by chemical vapor deposition. The material quality allows for the fabrication of phonon polariton nanoresonators with quality factors comparable to those fabricated from exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride, paving the way for wafer&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Polaritons in layered materials (LMs) are a promising platform to manipulate and control light at the nanometer scale. Thus, the observation of polaritons in wafer&#8208;scale LMs is critically important for the development of industrially relevant nanophotonics and optoelectronics applications. In this work, phonon polaritons (PhPs) in wafer&#8208;scale multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) grown by chemical vapor deposition are reported. By infrared nanoimaging, the PhPs are visualized, and PhP lifetimes of &#8776;0.6&#160;ps are measured, comparable to that of micromechanically exfoliated multilayer hBN. Further, PhP nanoresonators are demonstrated. Their quality factors of &#8776;50 are about 0.7 times that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices based on exfoliated hBN. These results can enable PhP&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopy (e.g., for gas sensing) and infrared photodetector applications.

         <title>Fundamentals, Advances, and Artifacts in Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence enables exciting applications such as holography, advanced cryptography, and energy&#8208;efficient displays. This Perspective lays out the fundamentals of the corresponding spectroscopic technique and reports a home&#8208;built setup. The corrections necessary for accurate measurements as well as the most common artifacts and pitfalls to avoid are detailed. Custom operating software is made available free of charge.








Abstract
Objects are chiral when they cannot be superimposed with their mirror image. Materials can emit chiral light with an excess of right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed circular polarization. This circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is key to promising future applications, such as highly efficient displays, holography, sensing, enantiospecific discrimination, synthesis of drugs, quantum computing, and cryptography. Here, a practical guide to CPL spectroscopy is provided. First, the fundamentals of the technique are laid out and a detailed account of recent experimental advances to achieve highly sensitive and accurate measurements is given, including all corrections required to obtain reliable results. Then the most common artifacts and pitfalls are discussed, especially for the study of thin films, for example, based on molecules, polymers, or halide perovskites, as opposed to dilute solutions of emitters. To facilitate the adoption by others, custom operating software is made publicly available, equipping the reader with the tools needed for successful and accurate CPL determination.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Lasing in Perovskite LEDs with an Integrated Distributed Feedback Resonator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;wave lasing in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator is achieved, showing a low threshold of 220&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. The LED can also work well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically pumping. The results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.








Abstract
Realization of electrically pumped laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processed semiconductors is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Metal halide perovskites have shown great potential toward this goal due to their&#160;excellent optoelectronic properties. Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) optically pumped lasing in a real electroluminescent device represents a key step to current&#8208;injection laser diodes, but it has not yet been realized. This is mainly due to the challenge of incorporating a resonant cavity into an efficient light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) able to sustain intensive carrier injection. Here, CW lasing is reported in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator, which shows a low lasing threshold of 220&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. Importantly, the LED works well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically pumping. The results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Like Stretchable Nanocomposite Using Locally&#8208;Bundled Nanowires for Skin&#8208;Mountable Devices</title>

A material strategy to fabricate a stretchable nanocomposite with metal&#8208;like conductivity and high stretchability is proposed. When the nanocomposite is solidified in the highly humid air, silver nanowires are locally&#8208;bundled, minimizing contact resistance. Treatment of dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol improves conductivity further to &#8776;120 000 S cm&#8722;1 while attaining high stretchability of &#8776;200% for skin&#8208;mountable devices.








Abstract
Stretchable conductive nanocomposites have been intensively studied for wearable bioelectronics. However, development of nanocomposites that simultaneously feature metal&#8208;like conductivity(&gt; 100 000 S cm&#8722;1) and high stretchability (&gt; 100%) for high&#8208;performance skin&#8208;mountable devices is still extremely challenging. Here&#160;a material strategy for such a nanocomposite is&#160;presented by using local bundling of silver nanowires stabilized with dual ligands (i.e., 1&#8208;propanethiols and 1&#8208;decanethiols). When the nanocomposite&#160;is&#160;solidified via solvent evaporation under a highly humid condition, the nanowires in the organic solution are bundled and stabilized. The resulting locally&#8208;bundled nanowires lower contact resistance while maintain their percolation network, leading to high conductivity. Dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol further boost up the conductivity. As a result, a nanocomposite with both high conductivity of &#8776;122,120 S cm&#8722;1 and high stretchability of &#8776;200% is obtained. Such superb electrical and mechanical properties are critical for various applications in skin&#8208;like electronics, and&#160;herein, a wearable thermo&#8208;stimulation device is demonstrated.

When the nanocomposite is solidified in the highly humid air, silver nanowires are locally-bundled, minimizing contact resistance.

         <title>A Cholesterol Metabolic Regulated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF)&#8208;Based Biotuner for Antibody Non&#8208;Dependent Immunotherapy Tailored for Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile nanocarrier, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF)&#8208;based biotuner, regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism for bidirectionally blocking immune checkpoints to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive microenvironment. It synergizes with chemiexcited&#8208;PDT to enable effective immunotherapy and significantly inhibit glioblastoma growth. The biotuner is tailored to address the immunotherapeutic dilemma and metabolic characteristics of glioblastomas, providing new insights into the metabolically regulated immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioblastomas.








Abstract
The metabolic reprogramming of glioblastoma (GBM) poses a tremendous obstacle to effective immunotherapy due to its impact on the immunosuppressive microenvironment. In this work, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) specifically designed for GBM immunotherapy is developed, taking advantage of the relatively isolated cholesterol metabolism microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS). The HOF&#8208;based biotuner regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism, effectively blocking the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1) pathway and reducing 2B4 expression. This metabolically disrupts the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM and rejuvenates CD8+ T cells. Moreover, cholesterol metabolism regulation offers additional benefits in treating GBM invasion. Furthermore, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;initiated chemiexcited photodynamic therapy (PDT) is enhanced during the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, and the biotuner can effectively trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) and increase the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in GBM. By reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment and bolstering chemiexcited&#8208;PDT, this approach invigorates efficient antibody non&#8208;dependent immunotherapy for GBM. This study provides a model for enhancing immunotherapy through cholesterol metabolism regulation and explores the feasibility of a &#8220;metabolic checkpoint&#8221; strategy in GBM treatment.

         <title>Engineering Efficient CAR&#8208;T Cells via Electroactive Nanoinjection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroactive nanoinjection (ENI) platform consisting of arrays of vertically configured conductive nanotubes, which mediate the loading and efficient nanoinjection of CAR construct into primary human T cells, with negligible cellular damage, is developed. The engineered ENI platform provides a non&#8208;viral, low&#8208;voltage (10&#160;V), scalable, and reusable intracellular delivery system that can generate functional and effective anti&#8208;lymphoma CAR&#8208;T cells.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy has emerged as a promising cell&#8208;based immunotherapy approach for treating blood disorders and cancers, but genetically engineering CAR&#8208;T cells is challenging due to primary T cells&#8217; sensitivity to conventional gene delivery approaches. The current viral&#8208;based method can typically involve significant operating costs and biosafety hurdles, while bulk electroporation (BEP) can lead to poor cell viability and functionality. Here, a non&#8208;viral electroactive nanoinjection (ENI) platform is developed to efficiently negotiate the plasma membrane of primary human T cells via vertically configured electroactive nanotubes, enabling efficient delivery (68.7%) and expression (43.3%) of CAR genes in the T cells, with minimal cellular perturbation (&gt;90% cell viability). Compared to conventional BEP, the ENI platform achieves an almost threefold higher CAR transfection efficiency, indicated by the significantly higher reporter GFP expression (43.3% compared to 16.3%). By co&#8208;culturing with target lymphoma Raji cells, the ENI&#8208;transfected CAR&#8208;T cells&#8217; ability to effectively suppress lymphoma cell growth (86.9% cytotoxicity) is proved. Taken together, the results demonstrate the platform's remarkable capacity to generate functional and effective anti&#8208;lymphoma CAR&#8208;T cells. Given the growing potential of cell&#8208;based immunotherapies, such a platform holds great promise for ex vivo cell engineering, especially in CAR&#8208;T cell therapy.

         <title>A Balance between Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208;Microgel Mechanics Governs Stem Cell Viability in Injectable Dynamic Granular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guest&#8208;host injectable microgel formulation strategy is introduced in which flowability and elasticity are tuned independently by modulating inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;microgel crosslinking. Flowability and elasticity represent conflicting constraints for injectable design, &#160;as they respectively govern injection protection and engraftment potential following injection. The balance between these parameters is systematically investigated and found to regulate stem cell viability during injection.








Abstract
Injectable hydrogels are increasingly explored for the delivery of cells to tissue. These materials exhibit both liquid&#8208;like properties, protecting cells from mechanical stress during injection, and solid&#8208;like properties, providing a stable 3D engraftment niche. Many strategies for modulating injectable hydrogels tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like material properties simultaneously, such that formulation changes designed to improve injectability can reduce stability at the delivery site. The ability to independently tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like properties would greatly facilitate formulation development. Here, such a strategy is presented in which cells are ensconced in the pores between microscopic granular hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels (microgels), where elasticity is tuned with static covalent intra&#8208;microgel crosslinks and flowability with mechanosensitive adamantane&#8208;cyclodextrin (AC) inter&#8208;microgel crosslinks. Using the same AC&#8208;free microgels as a 3D printing support bath, the location of each cell is preserved as it exits the needle, allowing identification of&#160;the mechanism driving mechanical trauma&#8208;induced cell death. The microgel AC concentration is varied to find the threshold from microgel yielding&#8208; to AC interaction&#8208;dominated injectability, and this threshold is exploited to fabricate a microgel with better injection&#8208;protecting performance. This delivery strategy, and the balance between intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;microgel properties it reveals, may facilitate the development of new cell injection formulations.

A photothermal pump patch is proposed as a universal structure for a highly efficient, non&#8208;destructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule directional delivery. It is based on poly(dimethyl siloxane) photothermal expansion&#8208;driven pore shrinkage, which directionally delivers macromolecules into the cell to improve intracellular delivery efficiency. It is also suitable for transdermal intracellular delivery and has broad potential in the fields of cell/gene therapy.








Abstract
The development of a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable universal delivery strategy of therapeutic macromolecules into desired cells and tissues is very challenging. Photothermal methods have advantages in intracellular delivery, particularly in in vivo manipulation. However, the inability of directional transmission of exogenous molecules limits their delivery efficiency. Here, a photothermal pump (PTP) patch with numerous &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; is reported. Under a laser, the cell membrane ruptures, while &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; shrink, resulting in a directional exogenous molecule delivery into cells for a high&#8208;efficient intracellular delivery. The PTP patches are considered a universal structure for a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule delivery. Under in vivo transdermal intracellular delivery conditions, the target genes are efficiently and noninvasively delivered into epidermal and dermal cells through the PTP patch and exosomes produced by the epidermal cells, respectively. The PTP patch provides a new strategy for a high&#8208;efficiency, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable macromolecule delivery.

         <title>From Volumetric to Planar Multiplexing: Phase&#8208;Coded Metasurfaces without the Bragg Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexing metasurface based on orthogonal phase encoding is demonstrated to implement a near&#8208;field optical router. Bragg diffraction, which plays a vital role in traditional volume holography,is replaced by mode&#8208;matching surface waves, resulting in the realization of ultrathin metadevices. The method facilitates further development of an additional degree of freedom in the field of photonic multiplexing.








Abstract
Metasurfaces consisting of planar subwavelength structures with minimal thickness are appealing to emerging technologies such as integrated optics and photonic chips for their small footprint and compatibility with sophisticated planar nanofabrication techniques. However, reduced dimensionality due to the 2D nature of a metasurface poses challenges to the adaptation of a few useful methods that have found great success with conventional optics in 3D space. For instance, Bragg diffraction is the foundation of the well&#8208;established technique of phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in volume holography. It relies on interference among the scattered waves from multiple layers across the thickness of a sample. In this work, despite losing the dimension in thickness, a metasurface is devised to experimentally demonstrate phase&#8208;coded multiplexing by replacing free&#8208;space light with a surface wave in its output. The in&#8208;plane interference along the propagation of the surface wave resembles the Bragg diffraction, thus enabling phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in the 2D design. An example of code&#8208;based all&#8208;optical routing is also achieved by using a multiplexed metasurface, which can find applications in photonic data processing and communications.

         <title>Reversible Multielectron Redox Chemistry in a NASICON&#8208;Type Cathode toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Long&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Fe&#8208;substituted Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 cathode with Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type structure is proposed, which realizes reversible structural evolution and multielectron redox reactions (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) by incorporating iron, whose unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital are inextricably related to the activation of higher&#8208;voltage redox couple.








Abstract
Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type cathodes (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3) have attracted extensive attention due to their open and robust framework, fast Na+ mobility, and superior thermal stability. To commercialize sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON&#8208;type cathodes. Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by an Fe&#8208;substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high&#8208;voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10&#160;000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic&#8208;migration energy barrier and ideal Na+&#8208;diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher&#8208;valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;duration cycling lifespan (3000&#160;stable cycles at 50 C), along with material&#8208;level energy density up to 304&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. The present work can provide new perspectives to accelerate the commercialization of SIBs.

         <title>Directional Shunting of Photogenerated Carriers in POM@MOF for Promoting Nitrogen Adsorption and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 composite is prepared by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction, which realizes an effective photocatalyst for storing and relaying oxidation N2 by inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers under mild conditions. The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits the high N2 adsorption capacity (250.5&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1) and superior N2 oxidation performance to produce HNO3 (702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The efficient catalysis of nitrogen (N2) into high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing products plays a crucial role in the N economic cycle. However, weak N2 adsorption and invalid N2 activation remain two major bottlenecks in rate&#8208;determining steps, leading to low N2 fixation performance. Herein, an effective dual active sites photocatalyst of polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is highlighted via altering coordination microenvironment and inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers to facilitate N2/catalyst interaction and enhance oxidation performance. MOFs create more open unsaturated metal cluster sites with unoccupied d orbital possessing Lewis acidity to accept electrons from the 3&#963;g bonding orbital of N2 for storage by combining with POMs to replace bidentate linkers. POMs act as electron sponges donating electrons to MOFs, while the holes directional flow to POMs. The hole&#8208;rich POMs with strong oxidation capacity are easily involved in oxidizing adsorbed N2. Taking UiO&#8208;66 (C48H28O32Zr6) and Mo72Fe30 ([Mo72Fe30O252(CH3COO)12{Mo2O7(H2O)}2{H2Mo2O8(H2O)}(H2O)91]&#183;150H2O) as an example, Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 shows twofold enhanced adsorption of N2 (250.5&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) than UiO&#8208;66 (122.9&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1) at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1. And, the HNO3 yield of Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 is 702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;7&#160;times and 24 times higher than UiO&#8208;66 and Mo72Fe30. This work provides reliable value for the storage and relaying artificial N2 fixation.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional Perovskite&#8208;Based Photodetector and Memristor for Visual Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor is designed, realizing visual perception and memory capacities. The dual&#8208;functional device exhibit excellent performance in both PD and memristor. Such a device provides new opportunities for the mimicry of human visual memory in future multifunctional application.








Abstract
The imitation of human visual memory demands the multifunctional integration of light sensors similar to the eyes, and image memory, similar to the brain. Although humans have already implemented electronic devices with visual memory functions, these devices require a combination of various components and logical circuits. However, the combination&#160;of visual perception and high&#8208;performance information storage capabilities into a single device to achieve visual memory remains challenging. In this study, inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor are designed to realize visual perception and memory capacities. As a PD, it realizes an ultrahigh self&#8208;powered responsivity of 276&#160;mA W&#8722;1, a high detectivity of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;Jones (530&#160;nm; light intensities, 2.34&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;100 (&#177;2&#160;V). As a memristor, an ultrahigh on/off ratio (&#8776;105), an ultralow power consumption of 3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;11&#160;W, a low setting voltage (0.15&#160;V), and a long retention time (&gt;7000&#160;s) are realized. Moreover, the dual&#8208;functional device has the capacity to perceive and remember light paths and store data with good cyclic stability. This device exhibits perceptual and cyclic erasable memory functions, which provides new opportunities for mimicking human visual memory in future multifunctional applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Sensing Platform Based on 2D Monoelement Germanane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smartphone&#8208;assisted fluorometric sensing platform based on CH3Ge&#8208;coated paper is developed. CH3Ge paper is suitable for sensing humidity as well as acidic and alkaline gases emitted by spoiled food to track its quality. Further, it is used for printing confidential information using a water inkjet printer and shows significant re&#8208;writability.








Abstract
Covalently functionalized germanane is a novel type of fluorescent probe that can be employed in material science and analytical sensing. Here, a fluorometric sensing platform based on methyl&#8208;functionalized germanane (CH3Ge) is developed for gas (humidity and ammonia) sensing, pH (1&#8211;9) sensing, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Luminescence (red&#8211;orange) is seen when a gas molecule intercalates into the interlayer space of CH3Ge and the luminescence disappears upon deintercalation. This allows for direct detection of gas absorption via fluorometric measurements of the CH3Ge. Structural and optical properties of CH3Ge with intercalated gas molecules are investigated by density functional theory (DFT). To demonstrate real&#8208;time and on&#8208;the&#8208;spot testing, absorbed gas molecules are first precisely quantified by CH3Ge using a smartphone camera with an installed color intensity processing application (APP). Further, CH3Ge&#8208;paper&#8208;based sensor is integrated into real food packets (e.g., fish and milk) to monitor the shelf life of perishable foods. Finally, CH3Ge&#8208;based rewritable paper is applied in water jet printing to illustrate the potential for secret communication with quick coloration and good reversibility by water evaporation.

         <title>Core Electron Count as a Versatile and Accurate New Descriptor for Sorting Mechanical Properties of Diverse Transition Metal Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;electron consideration of both valence electron concentration (VEC) and core electron count (CEC) is invoked in developing a distinct VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor to sort mechanical properties of diverse transition&#8208;metal compounds with higher accuracy and versatility compared to many other commonly used descriptors. A fresh path is thus opened for rational design and optimization of these compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal light&#8208;element compounds show superb mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties, and accurate descriptors are important to sorting targeted properties among this vast class of materials. Valence electron concentration (VEC) can track broad trends of mechanical properties, but this widely used descriptor suffers low accuracy with sorted data strongly scattered along trendlines, necessitating an improved sorting strategy. Here, elastic parameters from first&#8208;principles calculations are examined for 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMN) in cubic structure and 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal diborides (TMB2) in hexagonal structure and identify core electron count (CEC) of the solvent atoms as a new descriptor. Combined with VEC, the composite VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor exhibits greatly improved ability to sort elastic parameters of distinct TMN and TMB2 compounds. Unregulated property variations under the VEC description are well&#8208;captured by CEC, which tends to enhance ductility and reduce strength at fixed VEC and rising CEC. By invoking a full&#8208;electron consideration, the VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor accounts for the impact on bonding behaviors by both core and valence electrons with much&#8208;improved accuracy and versatility in sorting mechanical properties of diverse TM compounds compared to many other commonly used descriptors, opening a fresh path for rational design and optimization of TM compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.

         <title>Stabilizing Precursor Solution and Controlling Crystallization Kinetics Simultaneously for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that the TFFH additive can inhibit the oxidation of I&#8722;, eliminating I0, Pb0, and uncoordinated Pb2+ defects and control crystallization kinetics by the strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics mean the optimized solar cells achieve improved reproducibility and stability, and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux.








Abstract
The efficiency of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed; however, defects created by aging precursor solutions and during crystallization pose a significant barrier to the reproducibility and efficiency of solar cells. In this work, fluoro&#8208;N,N,N&#8243;,N&#8243;&#8208;tetramethylformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (F&#8208;(CH3)4CN2PF6, abbreviated as TFFH) is introduced to stabilize precursor solution and improve crystallization dynamics simultaneously for high&#8208;performance formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based perovskite indoor photovoltaics. The TFFH stabilizes the precursor solution by inhibiting oxidation of I&#8722; and reducing newly generated I0 to I&#8722;, and passivates undercoordinated Pb2+ by interacting with the Pb&#9472;I framework. Time&#8208;resolved optical diagnostics show prolonged perovskite crystallization dynamics and in situ defect passivation due to the presence of strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics guarantee larger perovskite grain sizes, better crystal orientation, fewer defects and more efficient charge extraction in PSCs. The optimized PSCs achieve improved reproducibility and better stability and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux, which is the highest efficiency among all indoor photovoltaics. It is anticipated that the concurrent stabilization of solutions and regulation of crystallization dynamics will emerge as a prevalent approach for enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of perovskite.

&lt;p&gt;It is found that the TFFH additive can inhibit the oxidation of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, eliminating I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, and uncoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; defects and control crystallization kinetics by the strong FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics mean the optimized solar cells achieve improved reproducibility and stability, and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed; however, defects created by aging precursor solutions and during crystallization pose a significant barrier to the reproducibility and efficiency of solar cells. In this work, fluoro-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;-tetramethylformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (F-(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, abbreviated as TFFH) is introduced to stabilize precursor solution and improve crystallization dynamics simultaneously for high-performance formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-based perovskite indoor photovoltaics. The TFFH stabilizes the precursor solution by inhibiting oxidation of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and reducing newly generated I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and passivates undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by interacting with the Pb&#9472;I framework. Time-resolved optical diagnostics show prolonged perovskite crystallization dynamics and in situ defect passivation due to the presence of strong FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics guarantee larger perovskite grain sizes, better crystal orientation, fewer defects and more efficient charge extraction in PSCs. The optimized PSCs achieve improved reproducibility and better stability and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux, which is the highest efficiency among all indoor photovoltaics. It is anticipated that the concurrent stabilization of solutions and regulation of crystallization dynamics will emerge as a prevalent approach for enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of perovskite.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A universal strategy to enhance long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing is reported, by which amorphous organic LPL materials show broader application prospects.








Abstract
Amorphous organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence materials (OLPLMs) can realize simpler solution processing and large&#8208;area uniform luminescence, where the luminescent properties are significantly influenced by the rigid environment. However, research on utilizing the rigidity to promote long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) properties of amorphous OLPLMs is still relatively rare due to the lack of an unambiguous and effective strategy to construct the rigid environment. Here, a universal strategy is proposed to enhance the LPL performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing, which utilizes the rigid environment constructed by UV curing to promote the interaction between host and guest, thus inducing a generation of materials with highly efficient LPL performance. This solution&#8208;processable, large&#8208;area, and &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;realize&#8221; material fabrication strategy can make amorphous OLPLMs show broader application prospects in some fields, such as anti&#8208;counterfeiting, nondestructive detection, and pattern marking or indication.

         <title>Achieving a Record Scintillation Performance by Micro&#8208;Doping a Heterovalent Magnetic Ion in Cs3Cu2I5 Single&#8208;Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;doping of magnetic Mn2+ ions in Cs3Cu2I5 single&#8208;crystal can regulate the emission of self&#8208;trapped excitons under high&#8208;energy ray excitation, solving its drawback of slow scintillation decay. This optimization makes the crystal an ideal scintillator for ultrafast, ultrabright, and low&#8208;cost scintillation with significant application prospects.








Abstract
An ultrabright, ultrafast, and low&#8208;cost ideal scintillator has been critically absent and is sorely desired in scintillation detection, but has hitherto not been found. Here, a high&#8208;quality bulk Cs3Cu2I5:Mn single&#8208;crystal scintillator with ultrahigh light yield (&#8776;95&#8239;772 photons&#160;per&#160;MeV, 137Cs &#947;&#8208;rays), excellent energy resolution (3.79%, 662&#160;keV), and ultrafast scintillation decay time (3&#160;ns, 81.5%) is reported. In mechanism, it is found that micro&#8208;doping of a heterovalent magnetic ion (at the ppm level) can effectively modulate the luminescence kinetics of self&#8208;trapped excitons in the scintillator. Compared with previous reports, the introduction of trace amounts of magnetic Mn2+ (&#8776;18.6&#160;ppm) in Cs3Cu2I5 single&#8208;crystal shortens the scintillation decay time by several hundred times, transforming the slow decay into an ultrafast decay. Simultaneously, the light yield is also increased about three times&#160;to the highest value so far. From the comprehensive performance of the micro&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5:Mn single&#8208;crystal, these excellent scintillation properties, physical characteristics suitable for practical applications, and low&#8208;cost advantages render this single&#8208;crystal an ideal scintillator with great potential for commercialization.

         <title>Rational Design of Orally Administered Cascade Nanozyme for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Materials Project is used as a candidate database to establish a rational nine&#8208;tier high&#8208;throughput screening method for multifaceted therapeutic demands for IBD. Ni3S4 is selected as the best matching nanozyme, with 3.13&#8208; and 1.80&#8208;fold higher activity than natural superoxide dismutase and catalase, respectively, and its therapeutic effectiveness is demonstrated using in vitro and in vivo anti&#8208;inflammatory models.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects millions of individuals worldwide annually. Enteric reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in the physiology and pathology of IBD. Nanozymes hold great promise for the treatment of IBD because of their exceptional ability to regulate redox homeostasis during ROS&#8208;related inflammation. However, the rapid development of orally administered, acid&#8208;tolerant, antioxidant nanozymes for IBD therapy is challenging. Here, a nine&#8208;tier high&#8208;throughput screening strategy is established to address the multifaceted IBD treatment demands, including intrinsic stability, radioactivity, solubility, gut microbiome toxicity, biomimetic elements, intermediate frontier molecular orbitals, reaction energy barriers, negative charges, and acid tolerance. Ni3S4 is selected as the best matching material from 146&#160;323 candidates, which exhibits superoxide dismutase&#8208;catalase bienzyme&#8208;like activity and is 3.13&#8208; and 1.80&#8208;fold more active than natural enzymes. As demonstrated in a mouse model, Ni3S4 is stable in the gastrointestinal tract without toxicity and specifically targets the diseased colon to alleviate oxidative stress. RNA and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses show that Ni3S4 effectively inhibits the cellular pathways of pro&#8208;inflammatory factors and restores the gut microbiota. This study not develops a highly efficient orally administered cascade nanozyme for IBD therapy and offers a next&#8208;generation paradigm for the rational design of nanomedicine through data&#8208;driven approaches.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Framework with Highly Accessible Aniline&#8208;Fused Quinonoid Units Affords Efficient Proton Charge Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD&#8208;COF)&#8208;based cathode&#160;with aniline&#8208;fused quinonoids for proton batteries is developed. The assembled TPAD&#8208;COF//AQ all&#8208;organic proton battery exhibits excellent cycling performance. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that both the NH and C=O groups of the aniline&#8208;fused quinonoids exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes.








Abstract
Owing to their intrinsic safety and sustainability, aqueous proton batteries have emerged as promising energy devices. Nevertheless, the corrosion or dissolution of electrode materials in acidic electrolytes must be addressed before practical applications. In this study, a cathode material based on a redox&#8208;active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD&#8208;COF) with aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units&#160;featuring inherently regular open porous channels and excellent stability is developed. The TPAD&#8208;COF cathode delivers a high capacity of 126 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, paired with long&#8208;term cycling stability with capacity retention of 84% after 5000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that both the &#8211;NH&#8211; and C=O groups of the aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, the assembled punch battery consisting of a TPAD&#8208;COF//anthraquinone (AQ) all&#8208;organic system delivers a discharge capacity of 115 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 130 cycles, implying the potential application of the TPAD&#8208;COF cathode in aqueous proton batteries. This study provides a new perspective on the design of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries with long&#8208;term cycling performance and high capacity.

&lt;p&gt;A redox-active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD-COF)-based cathode&#160;with aniline-fused quinonoids for proton batteries is developed. The assembled TPAD-COF//AQ all-organic proton battery exhibits excellent cycling performance. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that both the NH and C=O groups of the aniline-fused quinonoids exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to their intrinsic safety and sustainability, aqueous proton batteries have emerged as promising energy devices. Nevertheless, the corrosion or dissolution of electrode materials in acidic electrolytes must be addressed before practical applications. In this study, a cathode material based on a redox-active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD-COF) with aniline-fused quinonoid units&#160;featuring inherently regular open porous channels and excellent stability is developed. The TPAD-COF cathode delivers a high capacity of 126 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, paired with long-term cycling stability with capacity retention of 84% after 5000 cycles at 2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that both the &#8211;NH&#8211; and C=O groups of the aniline-fused quinonoid units exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, the assembled punch battery consisting of a TPAD-COF//anthraquinone (AQ) all-organic system delivers a discharge capacity of 115 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 130 cycles, implying the potential application of the TPAD-COF cathode in aqueous proton batteries. This study provides a new perspective on the design of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries with long-term cycling performance and high capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Bacteriochlorin Nanosheet as a Specific Pyroptosis Inducer for Robust Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin nanosheets as a specific pyroptosis inducer exhibit the ability to induce both Cu+&#8208;driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy to produce potent reactive oxygen species, leading to pyroptosis of primary tumors while promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell activation, thereby enhancing tumor immunogenicity for inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases with minimal systemic side effects.








Abstract
Pyroptosis is increasingly considered a new weathervane in cancer immune therapy. However, triggering specific pyroptotic tumor cell death while preserving normal cells still remains a major challenge. Herein, a brand&#8208;new pyroptosis inducer, copper&#8208;bacteriochlorin nanosheet (Cu&#8208;TBB), is designed. The synthesized Cu&#8208;TBB can&#160;be activated to an &#8220;on&#8221; state in the tumor microenvironment with glutathione (GSH) overexpression, leading to the release of Cu+ and TBB, respectively. Intriguingly, the released Cu+ can&#160;drive cascade reactions to produce O2&#8722;&#8226; and highly toxic &#183;OH in cells. Additionally, the released TBB can&#160;also generate O2&#8722;&#8226; and 1O2 upon 750&#160;nm laser irradiation. Encouragingly, both Cu+&#8208;driven cascade reactions and photodynamic therapy pathways result in potent pyroptosis along with dendritic cell maturation and T cell priming, thus simultaneously eliminating the primary tumors and inhibiting the distant tumor growth and metastases. Conclusively, the well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;TBB nanosheet is shown to trigger specific pyroptosis in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo, leading to enhanced tumor immunogenicity and antitumor efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Self&#8208;Assembled Hydroxyl Radical Generator Based on Photoinduced Cascade Electron Transfer for Hypoxic Tumor Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generators (ANOR&#8208;Cy5) that are activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, capable of forming nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The generation of &#8226;OH is accomplished with high efficiency through photoinduced cascade electron transfer pathways within the self&#8208;assembled molecular state. Consequently, ANOR&#8208;Cy5 exhibits exceptional efficacy in inducing photoablation of hypoxic tumors.








Abstract
The hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) is an extremely potent reactive oxygen species that plays a crucial role in photooxidations within the realm of hypoxic tumor therapy. However, the current methods for &#8226;OH photogeneration typically rely on inorganic materials that require UV/vis light excitation. Consequently, photogenerators based on organic molecules, especially those utilizing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light excitation, are rare. In this study, the concept of photoinduced cascade charge transfer (PICET), which utilizes NIR heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (ANOR&#8208;Cy5) to generate &#8226;OH is introduced. The ANOR&#8208;Cy5 photosensitizer, with its flexible hydrophobic structure, enables the formation of nanoparticles in aqueous solutions through molecular assembly. PICET involves a symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation&#8208;induced localized charge&#8208;separated state, transitioning to a delocalized charge&#8208;separated state, which governs the efficiency of &#8226;OH generation. Thanks to the oxygen&#8208;independent nature of &#8226;OH generation and its robust oxidative properties, the ANOR&#8208;Cy5&#8208;based photosensitizer demonstrates highly effective photoinduced anti&#8208;cancer effects, even under severely hypoxic conditions. This discovery emphasizes the potential for achieving &#8226;OH photogeneration using a single organic molecule through the engineering of molecular self&#8208;assembly, thereby opening up new possibilities for phototherapy and beyond.

         <title>Inhibited Grain Growth Through Phase Transition Modulation Enables Excellent Mechanical Properties in Oxide Ceramic Nanofibers up to 1700&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase transition modulation strategy is proposed to prepare oxide ceramic nanofibers, which are featured by inhibited grain growth at high temperatures. As a result, a strikingly high average tensile strength of 1.02&#160;GPa is achieved at 1700&#160;&#176;C, laying a basis for developing advanced oxide ceramics for reliable thermal protection in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
Oxide ceramics are widely used as thermal protection materials due to their excellent structural properties and earth abundance. However, in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments (above 1500&#160;&#176;C), the explosive growth of grain size causes irreversible damage to the microstructure of oxide ceramics, thus exhibiting poor thermomechanical stability. This problem, which may lead to catastrophic accidents, remains a great challenge for oxide ceramic materials. Here, a novel strategy of phase transition modulation is proposed to control the grain growth at high temperatures in oxide ceramic nanofibers, realizing effective regulation of the crystalline forms as well as the size uniformity of primary grains, and thus suppressing the malignant growth of the grains. The resulting oxide ceramic nanofibers have excellent mechanical strength and flexibility, delivering an average tensile strength as high as 1.02&#160;GPa after being exposed to 1700&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min, and can withstand thousands of flexural cycles without obvious damage. This work may provide new insight into the development of advanced oxide ceramic materials that can serve in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments with long&#8208;term durability.

         <title>Dual Breaking of Molecular Orbitals and Spatial Symmetry in an Optically Controlled Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual breaking of molecular orbitals and spatial symmetry enables the optical control of two ferroelectric states between the closed&#8208;ring and open&#8208;ring forms of a photochromic organic ferroelectric, which is an unprecedented mechanism in ferroelectrics and brings a new paradigm for manipulating ferroelectric polarization. 








Abstract
As particles carry quantified energy, photon radiation enables orbital transitions of energy levels, leading to changes in the spin state of electrons. The resulting switchable structural bistability may bring a new paradigm for manipulating ferroelectric polarization. However, the studies on molecular orbital breaking in the ferroelectric field remain blank. Here, for the first time, a new mechanism of ferroelectrics&#8212;dual breaking of molecular orbitals and spatial symmetry, demonstrated in a photochromic organic crystal with light&#8208;induced polarization switching, is formally proposed. By alternating the ultraviolet/visible light irradiation, the states of electron spin and the radial distribution p atomic orbitals experience a change, showing a reversible switch from &#8220;shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder&#8221; form to a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; form. This reflects a reversible conversion between &#960; and &#963; bonds, which induces and couples with the variation of spatial symmetry. The intersection of spatial symmetry breaking and molecular orbital breaking in ferroelectrics present in this work will be more conducive to data encryption and anticounterfeiting.

         <title>Regulating Exciton De&#8208;Trapping of Te4+&#8208;Doped Zero&#8208;Dimensional Scandium&#8208;Halide Perovskite for Fluorescence Thermometry with Record High Time&#8208;Resolved Thermal Sensitivity</title>

         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive fluorescence thermometer is developed by Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O engineering. The rapid de&#8208;trapping process of self&#8208;trapped excitons induced by the soft lattice results in a record high thermal sensitivity for the lifetime&#8208;based detection, reaching up to 27.36% K&#8722;1 at 325 K, with the temperature uncertainty below 0.1 K, enabling remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components.








Abstract
Fluorescence thermometry has been propelled to the forefront of scientific attention due to its high spatial resolution and remote non&#8208;invasive detection. However, recent generations of thermometers still suffer from limited thermal sensitivity (Sr) below 10% change per Kelvin. Herein, this work presents an ideal temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence material through Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O, in which isolated polyhedrons endow highly localized electronic structures, and the strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling facilitates the formation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). With rising temperature, the dramatic asymmetric expansion of the soft lattice induces increased defects, strong exciton&#8211;phonon coupling, and low thermal activation energy, which evokes a rapid de&#8208;trapping process of STEs, enabling several orders of magnitude changes in the fluorescence lifetime over a narrow temperature range. After regulating the de&#8208;trapping process with different Te4+ doping, a record&#8208;high Sr (27.36% K&#8722;1) of fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based detection is achieved at 325 K. The robust stability against multiple heating/cooling cycles and long&#8208;term measurements enables a low temperature uncertainty of 0.067 K. Further, the developed thermometers are demonstrated for the remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components. It is believed that this work constitutes a solid step towards building the next generation of ultrasensitive thermometers based on low&#8208;dimensional metal halides.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Cosmetic Contact Lenses for Ocular Surface Disease Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor Prussian blue family nanozymes with antioxidant abilities are embedded into cosmetic contact lenses to prevent ocular surface diseases, minimize potential safety risks, and protect corneas from external stimulation and underlying systemic diseases via reactive oxygen species scavenging.








Abstract
Efficiently balancing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by various factors on the ocular surface is a promising strategy for preventing the development of ocular surface diseases (OSDs). Nevertheless, the conventional topical administration of antioxidants is limited in efficacy due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and irreversible depletion, which impede their performance. To address this issue, contact lenses embedded with antioxidant nanozymes that can continuously scavenge ROS, thereby providing an excellent preventive effect against OSDs are developed. Specifically, Prussian blue family nanozymes are chosen based on their multiple antioxidant enzyme&#8208;like activities and excellent biocompatibility. The diverse range of colors made them promising candidates for the development of cosmetic contact lenses (CCLs) as a substitute for conventional pigments. The efficacy of nanozyme&#8208;CCLs is demonstrated in rabbits and rats exposed to a high risk of developing OSDs. These OSDs' prevention nanozyme&#8208;CCLs can pave the way for CCLs toward powerful wearable biomedical devices and provide novel strategies for the rational utilization of nanomaterials in clinical practice.

         <title>Ductile Oligomeric Acceptor&#8208;Modified Flexible Organic Solar Cells Show Excellent Mechanical Robustness and Near 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oligomeric acceptors with different flexible alkyl chains (DOY&#8208;C2, DOY&#8208;C4, and TOY&#8208;C4) are synthesized. When doped into D18:N3 system, outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.01% and 17.91% are achieved in rigid and flexible devices based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4, respectively. In addition, the mechanical properties of ternary films are also successfully improved due to form tie and entangled chain networks.








Abstract
High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness are key requirements for wearable applications of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, almost all highly efficient photoactive films comprising polymer donors (PD) and small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are mechanically brittle. In this study, highly efficient (PCE = 17.91%) and mechanically robust (crack&#8208;onset strain [COS] = 11.7%) flexible OSCs are fabricated by incorporating a ductile oligomeric acceptor (DOA) into the PD:SMA system, representing the most flexible OSCs to date. The photophysical, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties of D18:N3 with different DOAs are characterized. By introducing DOA DOY&#8208;C4 with a longer flexible alkyl linker and lower polymerization, the D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4&#8208;based flexible OSCs exhibit a significantly higher PCE (17.91%) and 50% higher COS (11.7%) than the D18:N3&#8208;based device (PCE = 17.06%, COS = 7.8%). The flexible OSCs based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4 retain 98% of the initial PCE after 2000 consecutive bending cycles, showing greater mechanical stability than the reference device (maintaining 89% of initial PCE). After careful investigation, it is hypothesized that the enhancement in mechanical properties is mainly due to the formation of tie chains or entanglement in the ternary blend films. These results demonstrate that DOAs have great potential for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible OSCs.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Driven Tribo&#8208;Electrophoresis Enabled Human&#8211;Droplet Interaction in 3D Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel human&#8211;droplet interaction platform rooted in the TEP approach is demonstrated, eliminating the need for complex electrodes and external power sources. By employing a well&#8208;designed triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer, precise and flexible manipulation of droplets in 3D space is achieved through human motion, fostering enhanced synergy and flexibility between humans and droplets.








Abstract
Electronically controlled droplet manipulation has widespread applications in biochemistry, life sciences, and industry. However, current technologies such as electrowetting, electrostatics, and surface charge printing rely on complex electrode arrays and external power supplies, leading to inefficient manipulation. In light of these limitations, a novel method is proposed, which&#160;leverages tribo&#8208;electrophoresis (TEP) to pipette in an oil medium, thereby enabling human&#8211;droplet interactions to be constructed with greater efficiency. The approach involves the rational design of a triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer&#160;that generates an electric field to charge the droplet and improves the maneuverability of the charged droplet, including aligned/non&#8208;aligned pipetting and stable transport in the clamped state, which can be accomplished solely by hand motion. The TEP method not only provides droplets with freedom to move in three dimensions but also offers a feasibility case for chemical reactions in the liquid phase and non&#8208;invasive sample extraction. This breakthrough establishes a cornerstone for human&#8211;droplet interactions capitalized on triboelectric nanogenerators, opening new avenues for research in droplet manipulation.

2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson phase perovskite BDASnI4 is identified to be promising for constructing high&#8211;performance field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). By developing interface and additive engineering strategies, BDASnI4 FETs achieve mobility of 1.61 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. Moreover, the devices remain functional after being exposed to ambient conditions (temperature of 45 &#8451; and humidity of 45%) for over 150 h.&#160; 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskites hold immense potential for the advancement of next&#8208;generation field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the instability of perovskite&#8208;based transistors has impeded their progress and practical applications. Here, ambient&#8208;stable high&#8208;performance FETs based on 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson phase tin halide perovskite BDASnI4, which has high film quality and excellent electrical properties, are reported. The perovskite channels are established by engineering the film crystallization process via the employment of ammonium salt interlayers and the incorporation of NH4SCN additives within the precursor solution. The refined FETs demonstrate field&#8208;effect hole mobilities up to 1.61 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio surpassing 106. Moreover, the devices show impressive operational and environmental stability and retain their functional performance even after being exposed to ambient conditions with a temperature of 45 &#176;C and humidity of 45% for over 150 h.

         <title>Fast Gas&#8208;Adsorption Kinetics in Supraparticle&#8208;Based MOF Packings with Hierarchical Porosity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#160;adsorbents with a multilevel hierarchical pore structure consisting of interconnected pore networks at three distinct length scales (&gt;1000, &#8776;100, and &#8776;1 nm) exhibit efficient mass transport. These materials can be self&#8208;assembled using supraparticles formed with nanoscale ZIF&#8208;8 primary particles as intermediate building blocks and exhibit 30 times faster adsorption kinetics compared to their unstructured analogs.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are microporous adsorbents for high&#8208;throughput gas separation. Such materials exhibit distinct adsorption characteristics owing to the flexibility of the crystal framework in a nanoparticle, which can be different from its bulk crystal. However, for practical applications, such particles need to be compacted into macroscopic pellets, creating mass&#8208;transport limitations. In this work, this problem is addressed by forming materials with structural hierarchy, using a supraparticle&#8208;based approach. Spherical supraparticles composed of nanosized MOF particles are fabricated by emulsion templating and they are used as the structural component forming a macroscopic material. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) particles are used as a model system and the gas&#8208;adsorption kinetics of the hierarchical material are compared with conventional pellets without structural hierarchy. It is demonstrated that a pellet packed with supraparticles exhibits a 30 times faster adsorption rate compared to an unstructured ZIF&#8208;8 powder pellet. These results underline the importance of controlling structural hierarchy to maximize the performance of existing materials. In the hierarchical MOFs, large macropores between the supraparticles, smaller macropores between individual ZIF&#8208;8 primary particles, and micropores inherent to the ZIF&#8208;8 framework collude to combine large surface area, defined adsorption sites, and efficient mass transport to enhance performance.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosecond Reconfiguration of Ferroelectric Domains in Bismuth Ferrite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon pulsed photoexcitation, multiferroic bismuth ferrite thin film exhibits a sub&#8208;nanosecond melting of their periodic stripe domains. The disordered domains recover back to their original state over few nanosecond timescale. The ultrafast manipulation of domains can be used for fast speed operation in applications of ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Domain switching is crucial for achieving desired functions in ferroic materials that are used in various applications. Fast control of domains at sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales remains a challenge despite its potential for high&#8208;speed operation in random&#8208;access memories, photonic, and nanoelectronic devices. Here, ultrafast laser excitation is shown to transiently melt and reconfigure ferroelectric stripe domains in multiferroic bismuth ferrite on a timescale faster than 100&#160;picoseconds. This dynamic behavior is visualized by picosecond&#8208; and nanometer&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffraction and time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffuse scattering. The disordering of stripe domains is attributed to the screening of depolarization fields by photogenerated carriers resulting in the formation of charged domain walls, as supported by phase&#8208;field simulations. Furthermore, the recovery of disordered domains exhibits subdiffusive growth on nanosecond timescales, with a non&#8208;equilibrium domain velocity reaching up to 10&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1. These findings present a new approach to image and manipulate ferroelectric domains on sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales, which can be further extended into other complex photoferroic systems to modulate their electronic, optical, and magnetic properties beyond gigahertz frequencies. This approach could pave the way for high&#8208;speed ferroelectric data storage and computing, and, more broadly, defines new approaches for visualizing the non&#8208;equilibrium dynamics of heterogeneous and disordered materials.

         <title>Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction of (Fe,Ni)OOH via Defect Engineering for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis Under Industrial Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH catalyst is prepared through an energy&#8208;saving cation exchange method. It exhibits good catalytic durability and structural stability for large&#8208;scale alkaline water oxidation under industrial conditions. When coupled with NiMoN and assembled in an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, the large&#8208;area d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH&#8208;NiMoN pair shows outstanding overall water electrolysis performance.








Abstract
Developing non&#8208;precious catalysts with long&#8208;term catalytic durability and structural stability under industrial conditions is the key to practical alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis. Here, an energy&#8208;saving approach is proposed to synthesize defect&#8208;rich iron nickel oxyhydroxide for stability and efficiency toward the oxygen evolution reaction. Benefiting from in situ cation exchange, the nanosheet&#8208;nanoflake&#8208;structured catalyst is homogeneously embedded in, and tightly bonded to, its substrate, making it ultrastable at high current densities. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the introduction of Ni in FeOOH reduces the activation energy barrier for the catalytic reaction and that the purposely created oxygen defects not only ensure the exposure of active sites and maximize the effective catalyst surface but also modulate the local coordination environment and chemisorption properties of both Fe and Ni sites, thus lowering the energy barrier from *O to *OOH. Consequently, the optimized d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic activity with long&#8208;term durability under both laboratory and industrial conditions. The large&#8208;area d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH||NiMoN pair requires 1.795&#160;V to reach a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an absolute current of 12.5 A in an AEM electrolyzer for overall water electrolysis, showing great potential for industrial water electrolysis.

         <title>Liquids with High Compressibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional liquids are barely compressible. However, here, a simple strategy is presented to increase the compressibility of aqueous liquids by dispersing into them small particles of porous materials with empty hydrophobic pores. The total compression is due to compression of the interparticle water phase in addition to water&#160;being forced into the pores, and the resulting compressibility is up to 20 times that of conventional liquids.








Abstract
Compressibility is a fundamental property of all materials. For fluids, that is, gases and liquids, compressibility forms the basis of technologies such as pneumatics and hydraulics and determines basic phenomena such as the propagation of sound and shock waves. In contrast to gases, liquids are almost incompressible. If the compressibility of liquids could be increased and controlled, new applications in hydraulics and shock absorption could result. Here, it is shown that dispersing hydrophobic porous particles into water gives aqueous suspensions with much greater compressibilities than any normal liquids such as water (specifically, up to 20 times greater over certain pressure ranges). The increased compressibility results from water molecules being forced into the hydrophobic pores of the particles under applied pressure. The degree of compression can be controlled by varying the amount of porous particles added. Also, the pressure range of compression can be reduced by adding methanol or increased by adding salt. In all cases, the liquids expand back to their original volume when the applied pressure is released. The approach shown here is simple and economical and could potentially be scaled up to give large amounts of highly compressible liquids.

&lt;p&gt;Conventional liquids are barely compressible. However, here, a simple strategy is presented to increase the compressibility of aqueous liquids by dispersing into them small particles of porous materials with empty hydrophobic pores. The total compression is due to compression of the interparticle water phase in addition to water&#160;being forced into the pores, and the resulting compressibility is up to 20 times that of conventional liquids.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Polyionic Hydrogels Enable Dendrites&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries with Fast Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel electrolyte is developed to realize cycle&#8208;stable Zn&#8208;I2 batteries with fast kinetics. Polyanionic hydrogel with high zincophilicity uniformizes Zn2+ flux and retards polyiodides/SO42&#8211; transport, leading to a dendrite&#8208;free and corrosion&#8208;free Zn anode. Iodophilic polycationic hydrogel alleviates the shuttling of polyiodides and boosts the reaction kinetics at hydrogel/carbon interface for iodine species.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries (ZIB) are regarded as a promising energy storage candidate. However, soluble polyiodide shuttling and rampant Zn dendrite growth hamper its commercial implementation. Herein, a hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel is designed as the electrolyte for ZIBs. On the cathode side, iodophilic polycationic hydrogel (PCH) effectively alleviates the shuttle effect and facilitates the redox kinetics of iodine species. Meanwhile, polyanionic hydrogel (PAH) toward Zn metal anode uniformizes Zn2+ flux and prevents surface corrosion by electrostatic repulsion of polyiodides. Consequently, the Zn symmetric cells with PAH electrolyte demonstrate remarkable cycling stability over 3000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (1 mAh cm&#8211;2) and 800&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (5 mAh cm&#8211;2). Moreover, the Zn&#8208;I2 full cells with PAH&#8208;PCH hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel electrolyte deliver a low&#8208;capacity decay of 0.008 &#8240; per cycle during 18&#160;000 cycles at 8 C. This work sheds light on hydrogel electrolytes design for long&#8208;life conversion&#8208;type aqueous batteries.

         <title>Activating Selenium Cathode Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se (abbreviated as &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se) is successfully prepared via a facile hydrothermal method for advanced cathodes of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZIBs). Benefiting from synergistic doping and amorphization strategy, the resulting &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se||Zn battery displays record&#8208;high capacity and exceptional cyclability. Such novel electrode chemistry of &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se with both intercalation/deintercalation and deposition/stripping mechanisms opens new opportunities for next&#8208;generation ARZIBs.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZIBs) are a promising next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage device by virtue of the superior safety and low cost of both the aqueous electrolyte and zinc&#8208;metal anode. However, their development is hindered by the lack of suitable cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can provide both lightweight and compact size. Herein, a novel cathode chemistry based on amorphous Se doped with transition metal Ru that mitigates the resistive surface layer produced by the side reactions between the Se cathode and aqueous electrolyte is reported. This improvement can permit high volumetric capacity in this system. Distinct from the conventional conversion mechanisms between Se and ZnSe in Se||Zn cells, this strategy realizes synchronous proton and Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation in the Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells. Moreover, an unanticipated Zn2+ deposition/stripping process in this system further contributes to the superior electrochemical performance of this new cathode chemistry. Consequently, the Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells are found to deliver a record&#8208;high capacity of 721&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1/3472&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, and superior cycling stability of over 800 cycles with only 0.015% capacity decay per cycle. This reported work opens the door for new chemistries that can further improve the gravimetric and volumetric capacity of ARZIBs.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Triads with Flexible Spacers: Deciphering Complex Photophysics for Targeted Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads are deciphered for practical use in materials science. In solution, fluorescent exciplexes are formed only for the short spacer (n = 4). Upon freezing, emissive static charge transfer (CT) complexes are formed for all spacer lengths. The molecular solids are stimuli&#8208;responsive, showing on/off fluorescence switching (n &gt; 4) or change of the emission color (n = 4).








Abstract
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads with varying flexible spacer lengths (n = 4&#8211;10 carbon atoms) are investigated in liquid and solid solution, as well as in crystals, by steady&#8208;state and transient fluorescence spectroscopy combined with computational studies. For the short spacer (n = 4) in a liquid solution, dynamic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state formation with subsequent, efficient exciplex emission is observed, effectively competing with quenching through electron transfer (eT) via a radical ion pair. In a solid solution, a fluorescent CT static complex is formed upon freezing for all spacer lengths. This allows the observations of a former seminal report on stimuli&#8208;responsive high&#8208;contrast fluorescence on/off switching in films of the triads to be reassigned (Adv. Mater. 2012, 24, 5487), now providing a holistic picture on varying spacer length. In fact, external stimuli of the film by modulating the geometry of the CT complex, which results in on/off fluorescence switching (for n &gt; 4) or in a change of the emission color (n = 4). The work thus demonstrates how in&#8208;depth analysis of complex photophysics can be put to practical use in materials science.

         <title>Reversed Electron Transfer in Dual Single Atom Catalyst for Boosted Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis of Au/Co dual single atom (DSA) loaded CdS for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. A reversed electron transfer mechanism is confirmed for this Au/Co DSA that leads to localized electrons around Co, and delocalized electrons from Au. This boosts electron transfer and CO2 adsorption/activation/reduction leading to a highly significant increase in reduction.








Abstract
Photogenerated charge localization on material surfaces significantly affects photocatalytic performance, especially for multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction. Dual single atom (DSA) catalysts with flexibly designed reactive sites have received significant research attention for CO2 photoreduction. However, the charge transfer mechanism in DSA catalysts remains poorly understood. Here, for the first time, a reversed electron transfer mechanism on Au and Co DSA catalysts is reported. In situ characterizations confirm that for CdS nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with Co or Au single atoms, photogenerated electrons are localized around the single atom of Co or Au. In DSA catalysts, however, electrons are delocalized from Au and accumulate around Co atoms. Importantly, combined advanced spectroscopic findings and theoretical computation evidence that this reversed electron transfer in Au/Co DSA boosts charge redistribution and activation of CO2 molecules, leading to highly significantly increased photocatalytic CO2 reduction, for example, Au/Co DSA loaded CdS exhibits, respectively, &#8776;2800% and 700% greater yields for CO and CH4 compared with that for CdS alone. Reversed electron transfer in DSA can be used for practical design for charge redistribution and to boost photoreduction of CO2.

     alt="Reversed Electron Transfer in Dual Single Atom Catalyst for Boosted Photoreduction of CO2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work reports the synthesis of Au/Co dual single atom (DSA) loaded CdS for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. A reversed electron transfer mechanism is confirmed for this Au/Co DSA that leads to localized electrons around Co, and delocalized electrons from Au. This boosts electron transfer and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption/activation/reduction leading to a highly significant increase in reduction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photogenerated charge localization on material surfaces significantly affects photocatalytic performance, especially for multi-electron CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Dual single atom (DSA) catalysts with flexibly designed reactive sites have received significant research attention for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction. However, the charge transfer mechanism in DSA catalysts remains poorly understood. Here, for the first time, a reversed electron transfer mechanism on Au and Co DSA catalysts is reported. In situ characterizations confirm that for CdS nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with Co or Au single atoms, photogenerated electrons are localized around the single atom of Co or Au. In DSA catalysts, however, electrons are delocalized from Au and accumulate around Co atoms. Importantly, combined advanced spectroscopic findings and theoretical computation evidence that this reversed electron transfer in Au/Co DSA boosts charge redistribution and activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, leading to highly significantly increased photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, for example, Au/Co DSA loaded CdS exhibits, respectively, &#8776;2800% and 700% greater yields for CO and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compared with that for CdS alone. Reversed electron transfer in DSA can be used for practical design for charge redistribution and to boost photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Findings will be of benefit to researchers and manufacturers in DSA-loaded catalysts for the generation of solar fuels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unleashing the Full Potential of Photo&#8208;Driven CO&#160;Hydrogenation to Light Olefins over Carbon&#8208;Coated CoMn&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel carbon&#8208;coated CoMn&#8208;based catalyst, a C&#8208;coated mixture of Co and MnO, is designed to efficiently utilize full&#8208;spectral solar light for converting syngas to light olefins. Through the coupling of photo&#8208;thermocatalysis and photocatalysis (between MnO and Co with carbon mediation), the catalyst unleashes the full potential of a photodriven reaction, achieving 5.5&#8208;fold the activity of thermal catalysis.








Abstract
As a nonpetroleum process, photodriven Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis provides a practical approach for the synthesis of light olefins. However, maximizing the solar&#8208;energy conversion efficiency based on the design of the composite catalyst and understanding the catalytic mechanism remain challenging. Herein, a novel carbon&#8208;coated CoMn&#8208;based catalyst, a C&#8208;coated mixture of Co and MnO, is designed for the efficient conversion of syngas to light olefins under light irradiation. The CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst exhibits a CO conversion of 12.6% with a selectivity to light olefins of 36.5% under light irradiation, showing 5.5&#8208;fold the activity of thermocatalysis. Experimental characterizations as certain the CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst can be excited to generate photogenerated carriers under light irradiation and then the electron transfer to metallic Co to form electron&#8208;rich active sites with carbon mediation, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculation based on density functional theory reveal the unique roles of photogenerated carriers in promoting the adsorption and activation of CO molecules. This study demonstrates a feasible catalyst model to efficiently utilize full&#8208;spectral solar light to produce the value&#8208;added chemical.

         <title>Mimicking Antioxidases and Hyaluronan Synthase: A Zwitterionic Nanozyme for Photothermal Therapy of Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal dual&#8208;bionic nanozyme (MPMP), mimicking antioxidases and hyaluronan synthase, is developed for effective osteoarthritis (OA) therapy, which can produce heat, scavenge free radical and promote chondrogenesis even if under inflammatory conditions. This nanozyme regulates anabolic and catabolic processes simultaneously, thereby restoring joint homeostasis effectively and demonstrating an admirable photothermally therapeutic&#160; effect on OA.








Abstract
Restoring joint homeostasis is crucial for relieving osteoarthritis (OA). Current strategies are limited to unilateral efforts in joint lubrication, inhibition of inflammation, free radicals scavenging, and cartilage regeneration. Herein, by modifying molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with Mg2+&#8208;doped polydopamine and coating with polysulfobetaines, a dual&#8208;bionic photothermal nanozyme (MPMP) is constructed to mimic antioxidases/hyaluronan synthase for OA therapy. Photothermally enhanced lubrication lowers the coefficient of friction (0.028) in the early stage of OA treatment. The antioxidases&#8208;mimicking properties of MPMP nanozyme contribute to eliminating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) (over 90% of scavenging ratio for H2O2/&#183;OH/O&#183;2&#8211;/DPPH/ABTS+) and supplying O2. With NIR irradiation, the MPMP nanozyme triggers thermogenesis (upregulating HSP70 expression) and Mg2+ release, which promotes the chondrogenesis in inflammatory conditions by deactivating NF&#8208;&#954;B/IL&#8208;17 signaling pathways and enhancing MAPK signaling pathway. Benefiting from HSP70 and Mg2+, MPMP&#8208;NIR shows HAS&#8208;mimicking activity to increase the intracellular (twofold) and extracellular (3.12&#8208;fold) HA production. Therefore, MPMP&#8208;NIR demonstrates superior spatiotemporally therapeutic effect on OA in mice model, in terms of osteophytes (83.41% of reduction), OARSI scores (88.57% of reduction), and ACAN expression (2.70&#8208;fold of increment). Hence, insights into dual&#8208;bionic nanozymes can be a promising strategy for OA therapy or other inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

&#8220;Fish&#8208;in&#8208;net&#8221; encapsulation of sulfur nanoparticles in an ordered metal&#8211;organic framework is reported as an efficient strategy for overcoming the sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This approach results in long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption, and decent multistep catalytic conversion, thereby significantly improving the interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics and sulfur conversion rate.








Abstract
Sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling reactions severely impede lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery operation; resolving these issues can enhance the capacity retention and cyclability of Li&#8211;S cells. Therefore, an effective strategy featuring core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Co/Ni bimetal&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/sulfur nanoparticles is reported herein for addressing these problems; this approach offers unprecedented spatial confinement and abundant catalytic sites by encapsulating sulfur within an ordered architecture. The protective shells exhibit long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption capability, and decent multistep catalytic conversion. Additionally, the delocalized electrons of the MOF endow the cathodes with superior electron/lithium&#8208;ion transfer ability. Via multiple physicochemical and theoretical analysis, the resulting synergistic interactions are proved to significantly promote interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, facilitate sulfur conversion dynamics, and inhibit shuttling. The assembled Li&#8211;S batteries deliver a stable, highly reversible capacity with marginal decay (0.075% per cycle) for 400 cycles at 0.2 C, a pouch&#8208;cell areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 200 cycles under a high sulfur loading, as well as remarkably improved pouch&#8208;cell performance.

         <title>Grain Boundary Elimination via Recrystallization&#8208;Assisted Vapor Deposition for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapor deposition method in combination with a solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization technique is presented to fabricate high&#8208;quality larger&#8208;area perovskite film. Efficiency of 19.9% is achieved, which is among the highest values ever reported for minimodules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite.








Abstract
Vapor deposition is a promising technology for the mass production of perovskite solar cells. However, the efficiencies of solar cells and modules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskites are significantly lower than those fabricated using the solution method. Emerging evidence suggests that large defects are generated during vapor deposition owing to a specific top&#8208;down crystallization mechanism. Herein, a hybrid vapor deposition method combined with solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization for fabricating high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films with low defect densities is presented. It is demonstrated that an intermediate phase can be formed at the grain boundaries, which induces the secondary growth of small grains into large ones. Consequently, perovskite films with substantially reduced grain boundaries and defect densities are fabricated. Results of temperature&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;carrier dynamics show that the proposed method successfully suppresses all recombination reactions. Champion efficiencies of 21.9% for small&#8208;area (0.16 cm2) cells and 19.9% for large&#8208;area (10.0 cm2) solar modules under AM 1.5 G irradiation are achieved. Moreover, the modules exhibit high operational stability, i.e., they retain &gt;92% of their initial efficiencies after 200&#160;h of continuous operation.

Herein, a hybrid vapor deposition method combined with solvent-assisted recrystallization for fabricating high-quality large-area perovskite films with low defect densities is presented. It is demonstrated that an intermediate phase can be formed at the grain boundaries, which induces the secondary growth of small grains into large ones. Consequently, perovskite films with substantially reduced grain boundaries and defect densities are fabricated. Results of temperature-dependent charge-carrier dynamics show that the proposed method successfully suppresses all recombination reactions. Champion efficiencies of 21.9% for small-area (0.16 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cells and 19.9% for large-area (10.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) solar modules under AM 1.5 G irradiation are achieved. Moreover, the modules exhibit high operational stability, i.e., they retain &amp;gt;92% of their initial efficiencies after 200&#160;h of continuous operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identifying a Universal Activity Descriptor and a Unifying Mechanism Concept on Perovskite Oxides for Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal activity descriptor (orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy) is successfully extracted from various materials&#8217; physicochemical properties for both hydrogen&#8208;evolving and oxygen&#8208;evolving reactions in multiple electrolytes. Systematic experiments and computations reveal the life&#8208;cycle HER and OER mechanisms and identify the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory as a powerful mechanism analysis tool and foundation.








Abstract
Producing indispensable hydrogen and oxygen for social development via water electrolysis shows more prospects than other technologies. Although electrocatalysts have been explored for centuries, a universal activity descriptor for both hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) is not yet developed. Moreover, a unifying concept is not yet established to simultaneously understand HER/OER mechanisms. Here, the relationships between HER/OER activities in three common electrolytes and over ten representative material properties on 12 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based model oxides are rationally bridged through statistical methodologies. The orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy (&#916;) can serve as an ideal universal descriptor, where a neither too large nor too small &#916; (&#8776;1&#160;eV) with optimal electron&#8208;cloud density around Fermi level affords the best activities, fulfilling Sabatier's principle. Systematic experiments and computations unravel that pristine oxide with &#916; &#8776; 1&#160;eV possesses metal&#8208;like high&#8208;valence configurations and active lattice&#8208;oxygen sites to help adsorb key protons in HER and induce lattice&#8208;oxygen participation in the OER, respectively. After reactions, partially generated metals in the HER and high&#8208;valence hydroxides in the OER dominate proton adsorption and couple with pristine lattice&#8208;oxygen activation, respectively. These can be successfully rationalized by the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory. This work provides the foundation of rational material design and mechanism understanding for many potential applications.

         <title>A General Strategy for Developing Ultrasensitive &#8220;Transistor&#8208;Like&#8221; Thermochromic Fluorescent Materials for Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;engineering strategy based on rational design and selection of fluorophores and phase&#8208;change molecules to construct color&#8208;independent thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) with ultrasensitive thermoresponsive fluorescence switching, high brightness, and superior reversibility and stability to the heating&#8211;cooling cycle is reported. By using these TFMs, a thermo&#8208;controllable multilevel information encryption/decryption is achieved within 10&#160;K temperature change.








Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) exhibit great potential in information encryption applications but are limited by low thermosensitivity, poor color tunability, and a wide temperature&#8208;responsive range. Herein, a novel strategy for constructing highly sensitive TFMs with tunable emission (450&#8211;650&#160;nm) toward multilevel information encryption is proposed, which employs polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores with donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) type structures as emitters and long&#8208;chain alkanes as thermosensitive loading matrixes. The structure&#8211;function relationships between the performance of TFMs and the structures of both fluorescent emitters and phase&#8208;change molecules are systematically studied. Benefiting from the above design, the obtained TFMs exhibit over 9500&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement toward the temperature change, as well as ultrahigh relative temperature sensitivity up to 80%&#160;K&#8722;1, which are first confirmed. Thanks to the superior transducing performance, the above&#8208;prepared TFMs can be further developed as information&#8208;storage platforms within a relatively narrow interval of temperature variation, including temperature&#8208;dominated multicolored information display and multilevel information encryption. This work will not only provide a novel perspective for designing superior TFMs for information encryption but also bring inspiration to the design and preparation of other response&#8208;switching&#8208;type fluorescent probes with ultrahigh conversion efficiency.

         <title>Beyond Rattling: Tetrahedrites as Incipient Ionic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In tetrahedrite, copper ions are mobile at temperatures of 200&#160;K or above, but confined to cages within the crystal structure. The localized diffusional jumps of the copper ions within a confined octahedral environment are effective at suppressing thermal conduction. This work reveals that tetrahedrite behaves as an incipient ionic conductor.








Abstract
Materials with ultralow thermal conductivity are crucial to many technological applications, including thermoelectric energy harvesting, thermal barrier coatings, and optoelectronics. Liquid&#8208;like mobile ions are effective at disrupting phonon propagation, hence suppressing thermal conduction. However, high ionic mobility leads to the degradation of liquid&#8208;like thermoelectric materials under operating conditions due to ion migration and metal deposition at the cathode, hindering their practical application. Here, a new type of behavior, incipient ionic conduction, which leads to ultralow thermal conductivity, while overcoming the issues of degradation inherent in liquid&#8208;like materials, is identified. Using neutron spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is demonstrated that in tetrahedrite, an established thermoelectric material with a remarkably low thermal conductivity, copper ions,&#160;although mobile above 200 K, are predominantly confined to cages within the crystal structure. Hence the undesirable migration of cations to the cathode can be avoided. These findings unveil a new approach for the design of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity, by exploring systems in which incipient ionic conduction may be present.

Thermochromic Fluorescent Materials
In article number 2305472, Xiaobo Zhou, Yuling Qin, Li Wu, and co&#8208;workers present a comprehensive approach for the development of highly sensitive thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) suitable for multilevel information encryption. They employ polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores with D&#8211;A&#8211;D type structures as emitters and long&#8208;chain alkanes as thermosensitive loading matrices. Thanks to this well&#8208;designed strategy, the resulting TFMs exhibit remarkable fluorescence enhancements within relatively narrow range of temperature variations.

Circularly Polarized Luminescence
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is the emission of left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed helical light, and a key property of certain chiral materials with applications such as highly efficient displays, holography, sensing, enantiospecific discrimination, synthesis of drugs, quantum computing, and cryptography. In article number 2302279 by Sascha Feldmann and co&#8208;workers, the fundamentals, advances, pitfalls and software for accurately measuring CPL are described.

Extracellular Vesicles
Extracellular vesicles have emerged as therapeutic agents, biomarkers, and potential drug carriers. However, current techniques for their isolation are relatively inefficient. In article number 2212000, Jean&#8208;Christophe Leroux and co&#8208;workers report the development of a novel electrochemical device with affinity&#8208;based capturing for the rapid isolation of extracellular vesicles from biosamples and their further purification after loading with exogenous compounds.

Stretchable Electronics
In article number 2303458, Dae&#8208;Hyeong Kim and co&#8208;workers report how when a nanocomposite solution is solidified in high humidity, nanowires self&#8208;assemble into bundles, resulting in a highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposite. The nanocomposite is then cut into a serpentine&#8208;shaped wearable thermostimulation device and applied to the wrist.

         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) as emerging carbon nanomaterials have been regarded as promising alternatives for electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their distinct characteristics, such as low toxicity, tuneable photoluminescence, and good photostability. In this review,&#160;we&#160;focus on the optical properties of CDs based on their structural design and recent trends in electroluminescent LED applications.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs), as emerging carbon nanomaterials, have been regarded as promising alternatives for electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their distinct characteristics, such as low toxicity, tuneable photoluminescence, and good photostability. In the last few years, despite remarkable progress achieved in CD&#8208;based LEDs, their device performance is still inferior to that of well&#8208;developed organic, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;based QDs, and perovskite LEDs. To better exploit LED applications and boost device performance, in this review, a comprehensive overview of currently explored CDs is presented, focusing on their key optical characteristics, which are closely related to the structural design of CDs from their carbon core to surface modifications, and to macroscopic structural engineering, including the embedding of CDs in the matrix or spatial arrangement of CDs. The design of CD&#8208;based LEDs for display and lighting applications based on the fluorescence, phosphorescence, and delayed fluorescence emission of CDs is also highlighted. Finally, it is concluded with a discussion regarding the key challenges and plausible prospects in this field. It is hoped that this review inspires more extensive research on CDs from a new perspective and promotes practical applications of CD&#8208;based LEDs in multiple directions of current and future research.

A comprehensive overview of the emerging perovskite&#8208;solar&#8208;cell&#8208;based photo&#8208;electrochemical device, including the configuration design, key parameters, working principle, integration strategies, electrode materials, and their performance evaluations, is highlighted. The existing challenges and future perspectives are provided for the ongoing research in this promising field.








Abstract
Metal halide hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received considerable attention over the past decade owing to their potential for low&#8208;cost, solution&#8208;processable, earth&#8208;abundant, and high&#8208;performance superiority, increasing power conversion efficiencies of up to 25.7%. Solar energy conversion into electricity is highly efficient and sustainable, but direct utilization, storage, and poor energy diversity are difficult to achieve, resulting in a potential waste of resources. Considering its convenience and feasibility, converting solar energy into chemical fuels is regarded as a promising pathway for boosting energy diversity and expanding its utilization. In addition, the energy conversion&#8211;storage integrated system can efficiently sequentially capture, convert, and store energy in electrochemical energy storage devices. However, a comprehensive overview focusing on PSC&#8208;self&#8208;driven integrated devices with a discussion of their development and limitations remains lacking. Here, focus is on the development of representative configurations of emerging PSC&#8208;based photo&#8208;electrochemical devices including self&#8208;charging power packs, unassisted solar water splitting/CO2 reduction. The advanced progresses in this field, including configuration design, key parameters, working principles, integration strategies, electrode materials, and their performance evaluations are also summarized. Finally, scientific challenges and future perspectives for ongoing research in this field are presented.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 44, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary copper halides (TCHs) have generated considerable attention for the exceptional structure diversity and fascinating optoelectronic properties. The recent advances of currently explored TCHs are systemically summarized, regarding the crystal and electronic structure, synthesis strategy, photophysical mechanism, luminescence regulation, environmental stability, and their emerging applications. Moreover, current existing challenges and possible development directions are proposed for their further development.








Abstract
Recently, the newly&#8208;emerging lead&#8208;free metal&#8208;halide materials with less toxicity and superior optoelectronic properties have received wide attention as the safer and potentially more robust alternatives to lead&#8208;based perovskite counterparts. Among them, ternary copper halides (TCHs) have become a vital group due to their unique features, including abundant structural diversity, ease of synthesis, unprecedented optoelectronic properties, high abundance, and low cost. Although the recent efforts in this field have made certain progresses, some scientific and technological issues still remain unresolved. Herein, a comprehensive and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of recent progress on the fundamental characteristics of TCH materials and their versatile applications is presented, which contains topics such as: i) crystal and electronic structure features and synthesis strategies; ii) mechanisms of self&#8208;trapped excitons, luminescence regulation, and environmental stability; and iii) their burgeoning optoelectronic devices of phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs), electroluminescent LEDs, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, X&#8208;ray scintillators, photodetectors, sensors, and memristors. Finally, the current challenges together with future perspectives on the development of TCH materials and applications are also critically described, which is considered to be critical for accelerating the commercialization of these rapidly evolving technologies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Metal Foam Catalysts for Cathodic Electro&#8208;Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although electro&#8208;organic synthesis is currently receiving renewed interest because of its potential to enable sustainability in chemical processes to value&#8208;added products, challenges in process development persist: For reductive transformations performed in protic media, an inherent issue is the limited choice of metallic cathode materials that can effectively suppress the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) while maintaining a high activity towards the targeted electro&#8208;organic reaction. Current development trends are aimed at avoiding the previously used HER&#8208;suppressing elements (Cd, Hg and Pb) because of their toxicity. Here, we report the rational design of highly porous foam&#8208;type binary and ternary electrocatalysts with reduced Pb content. Optimized cathodes are tested in electro&#8208;organic reductions using an oxime to nitrile transformation as a model reaction relevant for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Their electrocatalytic performance is compared with that of the model CuSn7Pb15 bronze alloy that has recently been endorsed as the best cathode replacement for bare Pb electrodes. All developed metal foam catalysts outperform both bare Pb and the CuSn7Pb15 benchmark in terms of chemical yield and energetic efficiency. Moreover, post&#8208;electrolysis analysis of the crude electrolyte mixture and the cathode's surfaces through ICP&#8208;MS and SEM, respectively, reveal the foam catalysts&#8217; elevated resistance to cathodic corrosion.

         <title>Mechanically Strengthened Aerogels through Multi&#8208;Scale, Multi&#8208;Composition, and Multi&#8208;Dimensional Approaches: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent decades, aerogels have attracted tremendous attention in academia and industries as a lightweight and porous multifunctional nanomaterial. Despite their wide application range, their limited mechanical durability hinders their processing and operation, particularly in application requiring complex physical structures. &#8220;Mechanically strengthened aerogels&#8221; have emerged as the potential solution to address this drawback. Since the first report on aerogels in 1931, various modified synthesis processes have been introduced to enhance the mechanical strength of aerogels in the last decade, further advancing their multifunctional scope. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments of mechanically strengthened aerogels through multicompositional and multidimensional approaches in the past 10 years. Additionally, new trends and future technologies for the commercialization of aerogels as much as plastic is discussed in the final section.

         <title>Review of Carbon Support Coordination Environments for Single Metal Atom Electrocatalysts (SACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon support single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are widely investigated in numerous electrocatalytic systems due to their high selectivity and activity from size effects and unique metal&#8208;support interactions. This review summarizes the recent progress on carbon&#8208;supported SACs in key electrocatalytic systems from the perspective of their coordination environment regulations that greatly affect the electrocatalytic activity and electrocatalytic selectivity.








Abstract
This topical review focuses on the distinct role of carbon support coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for electrocatalysis. The article begins with an overview of atomic coordination configurations in SACs, including a discussion of the advanced characterization techniques and simulation used for understanding the active sites. A summary of key electrocatalysis applications is then provided. These processes are oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The review then shifts to modulation of the metal atom&#8208;carbon coordination environments, focusing on nitrogen and other non&#8208;metal coordination through modulation at the first coordination shell and modulation in the second and higher coordination shells. Representative case studies are provided, starting with the classic four&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (M&#63743;N4) based SACs. Bimetallic coordination models including homo&#8208;paired and hetero&#8208;paired active sites are also discussed, being categorized as emerging approaches. The theme of the discussions is the correlation between synthesis methods for selective doping, the carbon structure&#8211;electron configuration changes associated with the doping, the analytical techniques used to ascertain these changes, and the resultant electrocatalysis performance. Critical unanswered questions as well as promising underexplored research directions are identified.

         <title>Schottky Junction and D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 System Dual Regulation of Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Highly Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are emerging as a promising molecular platform for photocatalysis. Nevertheless, the construction of highly effective charge transfer pathways in CTFs for oriented delivery of photoexcited electrons to enhance the photocatalytic performance remains highly challenging. Herein, we presented a molecular engineering strategy to achieve highly efficient charge separation and transport in both the lateral and vertical directions for solar&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion. Specifically, a large &#960;&#8208;delocalized and &#960;&#8208;stacked Schottky junction (Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF/RGO) that synergistically knitted a rebuilt extended &#960;&#8208;delocalized network of the D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 system (multiple donor or acceptor units, Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF) with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was developed. We have verified that the single&#8208;site Ru units in Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF/RGO acted as effective secondary electron acceptors in the lateral direction for multistage charge separation/transport. Simultaneously, the &#960;&#8208;stacked and covalently bonded graphene was regarded as a hole extraction layer, accelerating the separation/transport of the photogenerated charges in the vertical direction over the Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF/RGO Schottky junction with full use of photogenerated electrons for the reduction reaction. Thus, the obtained photocatalyst had an excellent CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion rate (&#8764;11050 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and selectivity (&#8764;99%), producing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the heterogeneous conversion of CO2 to formate without an extra photosensitizer.

         <title>Retarding Ion Migration for Stable Blade&#8208;Coated Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through blade coating is seen as one of the most viable paths toward commercialization. However, relative to the less scalable spin coating method, the blade coating process often results in more defective perovskite films with lower grain uniformity. Ion migration, facilitated by those elevated defect levels, is one of the main triggers of phase segregation and device instability. Here, we report a bifunctional molecule, p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which enhances the barrier to ion migration, induces grain growth along the (100) facet, and promotes the formation of homogeneous perovskite films with fewer defects. As a result, PSCs with PABA achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies of 23.32% and 22.23% for devices with active areas of 0.1 cm2 and 1 cm2, respectively. Furthermore, these devices maintained 93.8% of their initial efficiencies after 1000 hours under 1&#8208;sun illumination, 75 &#176;C, and 10% relative humidity conditions.

         <title>Multiscale Interpenetrated/Interconnected Network Design Confers All&#8208;carbon Aerogels with Unprecedented Thermomechanical Properties for Thermal Insulation Under Extreme Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With ultralight weight, low thermal conductivity, and extraordinary high&#8208;temperature resistance, carbon aerogels hold tremendous potential against severe thermal threats encountered by hypersonic vehicles during the in&#8208;orbit operation and re&#8208;entry process. However, current 3D aerogels are plagued by irreconcilable contradictions between adiabatic and mechanical performance due to monotonicity of the building blocks or uncontrollable assembly behavior. Herein, we report a spatially confined assembly strategy of multiscale low&#8208;dimensional nanocarbons to decouple the stress and heat transfer. The nanofiber framework, a basis for transferring the loading strain, is covered by a continuous thin&#8208;film&#8208;like layer formed by the aggregation of nanoparticles, which in combination serve as the fundamental structural units for generating an elastic behavior while yielding compartments in aerogels to suppress the gaseous fluid thermal diffusion within distinct partitions. The resulting all&#8208;carbon aerogels with a hierarchical cellular structure and quasi&#8208;closed cell walls achieve the best thermomechanical and insulation trade&#8208;off, exhibiting flyweight density (24&#160;mg cm&#8211;3), temperature&#8208;constant compressibility (&#8211;196 to 1600 &#176;C), and a low thermal conductivity of 0.04829&#160;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at 300 &#176;C. This strategy provides a remarkable thermal protection material in hostile environments for future aerospace exploration.

         <title>Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP) Enables mRNA Delivery for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the development of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) for&#160;mRNA delivery, including component screening, internal ratio optimization, surface modification, and route of administration. Then, the applications of mRNA&#8208;LNP in cancer therapy are reviewed, including vaccines, antibodies, cytokines, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;based cell therapy, tumor suppressors, and genome editing. Finally, current challenges and future directions of this field are discussed.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) has received great attention in the prevention and treatment of various diseases due to the success of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19)&#160;mRNA vaccines (Comirnaty and Spikevax). To meet the therapeutic purpose, it is required that mRNA must enter the target cells and express sufficient proteins. Therefore, the development of effective delivery systems is necessary and crucial. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) represents a remarkable vehicle that has indeed accelerated mRNA applications in humans, as several mRNA&#8208;based therapies have already been approved or are in clinical trials. In this review, the focus is on mRNA&#8208;LNP&#8208;mediated anticancer therapy. It summarizes the main development strategies of mRNA&#8208;LNP formulations, discusses representative therapeutic approaches in cancer, and points out current challenges and possible future directions of this research field. It is hoped that these delivered messages can help further improve the application of mRNA&#8208;LNP technology in cancer therapy.

The unique aqueous electrolyte with rich hydrogen bond (HB) environment inevitably has a significant impact on the electrode materials and electrochemical processes. While numerous reviews have focused on materials design and assembly of aqueous batteries, the utilization of HB chemistry has been overlooked. Herein, instead of merely compiling recent advancements, this review presents a comprehensive summary and analysis of the profound implication exerted by HB on all components of the aqueous batteries. Intricate links between the novel HB chemistry and various aqueous batteries are ingeniously constructed within the critical aspects, such as: self&#8208;discharge, structural stability of electrode materials, pulverization, solvation structures, charge carrier diffusion, corrosion reactions, pH sensitivity, water splitting, polysulfides shuttle and H2S evolution. By adopting a vantage point that encompasses material design, binder and separator functionalization, electrolyte regulation, and HB optimization, we conduct a critical examination of the key factors that impede electrochemical performance in diverse aqueous batteries. Finally, we render insights properly based on HB chemistry, with the aim of propelling the advancement of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aqueous batteries.

         <title>Boosting Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Activity of Ru Single&#8208;Atom Through Promoting Hydroxyl Adsorption on Ru/WC1&#8208;x Interfaces</title>

Abstract
text. The sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline conditions continue to pose a significant challenge for the practical implementation of anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells. Developing single&#8208;atom catalysts can accelerate the pace of new HOR catalyst discovery for highly cost&#8208;effective and active HOR performance. However, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for the alkaline HOR have rarely been reported, and fundamental studies on the rational design of SACs are still required. Herein, we report the design of Ru SAC supported on the ordered mesoporous tungsten carbide (Ru SA/WC1&#8208;x) via in situ high&#8208;temperature annealing strategy. The resulting Ru SA/WC1&#8208;x catalyst exhibits remarkably enhanced HOR performance in alkaline media, a level of activity that could not be achieved with carbon&#8208;supported Ru SAC. Electrochemical results and density functional theory demonstrate that promoting the hydroxyl adsorption on Ru SA/WC1&#8208;x interfaces, which is derived from the low potential of zero charge of WC1&#8208;x support, has significant effect on enhancing the HOR performance of SACs. This enhancement leads to 5.8 and 60.1 times higher Ru mass activity of Ru SA/WC1&#8208;x than Ru nanoparticles on carbon and Ru SA on N&#8208;doped carbon, respectively. This work provides new insights into the design of highly active SACs for alkaline HOR.

         <title>Facilitating Layered Oxide Cathodes Based on Orbital Hybridization for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries: Marvelous Air Stability, Controllable High Voltage, And Anion Redox Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Layered oxides have become the research focus of cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to the low cost, simple synthesis process, and high specific capacity. However, the poor air stability, unsteady phase structure under high voltage, and slow anionic redox kinetics hinder their commercial application. In recent years, the concept of manipulating orbital hybridization has been proposed to simultaneously tune the microelectronic structure and modify the surface chemistry environment intrinsically. In this review, the hybridization modes between atoms in 3d/4d transition metal (TM) orbitals and O 2p orbitals near the region of the Fermi energy level (EF) were summarized based on orbital hybridization theory and first&#8208;principles calculations as well as various sophisticated characterizations. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms are explored from macro&#8208;scale to micro&#8208;scale, including enhancing air stability, modulating high voltage, and stabilizing anionic redox chemistry. Meanwhile, the origin, formation conditions, and different types of orbital hybridization, as well as its application in layered oxide cathodes are presented, which provide insights into the design and preparation of cathode materials. Ultimately, the main challenges in the development of orbital hybridization and its potential for the production application are also discussed, pointing out the route for high&#8208;performance practical sodium layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;High Modulus Gel Electrolytes Reforming the Growing Pattern of Li Dendrites for Interfacially Stable Lithium Metal Batteries.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) have aroused intensive attention for their moderate comprehensive performances in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, GPEs with low elastic moduli of MPa magnitude cannot mechanically regulate the Li deposition, leading to recalcitrant lithium dendrites. Herein, a porous Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) framework (PLF) is employed as an integrated solid filler to address the intrinsic drawback of GPEs. With the incorporation of PLF, the composite GPE exhibits an ultra&#8208;high elastic modulus of GPa magnitude, confronting Li dendrites at a mechanical level and realizing steady polarization at high current densities in Li||Li cells. Benefiting from the compatible interface with anodes, the LFP|PLF@GPE|Li cells deliver excellent rate capability and cycling performance at room temperature. Theoretical models extracted from the topology of solid fillers reveal that the PLF with unique 3D structures can effectively reinforce the gel phase of GPEs at the nano&#8208;scale via providing sufficient mechanical support from the load&#8208;sensitive direction. Numerical models are further developed to reproduce the multi&#8208;physical procedure of dendrite propagation and give insights into predicting the failure modes of LMBs. This work quantitatively clarifies the relationship between the topology of solid fillers and the interface stability of GPEs, providing guidelines for designing mechanically reliable GPEs for LMBs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Direct ink writing (DIW) stands out as a facile additive manufacturing method, minimizing material waste. Nonetheless, developing homogeneous Bingham inks with high yield stress and swift liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions for versatile 3D printing remains a challenge. In this study, we formulate high&#8208;performance Bingham inks by destabilizing silica particle suspensions in acrylate&#8208;based resin. A colloidal network forms in the shear&#8208;free state through interparticle attraction, achieved by disrupting the solvation layer of large resin molecules using polar molecules. The network is highly dense, with evenly distributed linkage strength, as monodisperse particles undergo gelation at an ultra&#8208;high fraction. Crucially, the strength is calibrated to ensure a sufficiently large yield stress, while still allowing the network to reversibly melt under shear flow. The inks immediately undergo a liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition upon discharge, while maintaining fluidity without nozzle clogging. The dense colloidal networks develop structural colors due to the short&#8208;range order. This enables the rapid and sophisticate drawing of structurally&#8208;colored 3D structures, relying solely on rheological properties. Moreover, the printed composite structures exhibit high mechanical stability due to the presence of the colloidal network, which expands the range of potential applications.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional &#960;&#8722;d Conjugated Coordination Polymer Enabling Ultra&#8208;Long Life Magnesium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

Abstract
There has been increasing interests in &#960;&#8722;d conjugated coordination polymers (CCPs) for energy storage because of their rapid charge transfer through long&#8208;range planar &#960;&#8722;d conjugation between ligands and metal centers. Nevertheless, currently reported CCPs for energy storage are mostly based on one&#8208;dimensional (1D) or two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures. There are few three&#8208;dimensional (3D) CCPs reported to date because of the great challenge in constructing non&#8208;planar coordination geometries, let alone their applications in multivalent ions storage. Herein, we successfully synthesize a triphenylene&#8208;catecholate&#8208;based 3D CCP (Mn&#8208;HHTP) assembled from the multidentate chelating groups of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) ligands and their isotropic coordination with Mn2+ ions. The 3D conjugated structure of Mn&#8208;HHTP enables an exceptional cycle life of &gt;4,000 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 for multivalent Mg2+ ion storage, which is far superior to most organic and inorganic electrode materials. Experimental characterizations combined with theoretical calculations indicate that the semiquinone radicals at the HHTP ligands are the electroactive centers for Mg2+ ions storage. The excellent performance of Mn&#8208;HHTP opens a new avenue towards the design of 3D CCPs for long&#8208;life rechargeable magnesium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Sulfur Loading and Single Ion&#8208;Selective Membranes for High&#8208;Energy and Durable Decoupled Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Decoupled battery design is promising for breaking the energy density limit of traditional aqueous batteries. However, the complex battery configuration and low&#8208;selective separator membranes restrict their energy output and service time. Herein, a zinc&#8208;sulfur decoupled aqueous battery is achieved by designing high&#8208;mass loading sulfur electrode and single ion&#8208;selective membrane. A vertically assembled nanosheet network constructed with the assistance of magnetic field enables facile electron and ion conduction in thick sulfur electrodes, which is conducive to boosting the cell&#8208;level energy output. For the tailored ion&#8208;selective membrane, the Na ions anchored on its skeleton effectively prevent the crossover of OH&#8722; or Cu2+, facilitating the transport of Na+ and ensuring structural and mechanical stability. Consequently, the Zn&#8208;S aqueous battery achieves a reversible energy density of 3988&#160;Wh kgs&#8722;1 (by sulfur mass), stable operation over 300 cycles and an energy density of 53.2 mWh cm&#8722;2. The sulfur&#8208;based decoupled system may be of immediate benefit toward safe, reliable, and affordable static energy storage.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Based Functional Platforms for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With excellent optical/electrical properties, tunable performance, and good biosafety, MXenes and their derivatives show great prospects in application of tumor therapy. This review summarizes the recent progress of MXenes and MXenes&#8208;derived materials in the construction of functional platforms for precise and effective antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Recently, 2D transition metal carbide, nitride, and carbonitrides (MXenes) materials stand out in the field of tumor therapy, particularly in the construction of functional platforms for optimal antitumor therapy due to their high specific surface area, tunable performance, strong absorption of near&#8208;infrared light as well as preferable surface plasmon resonance effect. In this review, the progress of MXene&#8208;mediated antitumor therapy is summarized after appropriate modifications or integration procedures. The enhanced antitumor treatments directly performed by MXenes, the significant improving effect of MXenes on different antitumor therapies, as well as the MXene&#8208;mediated imaging&#8208;guided antitumor strategies are discussed in detail. Moreover, the existing challenges and future development directions of MXenes in tumor therapy are presented.

         <title>Designing Hydrogels for Immunomodulation in Cancer Therapy and Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The immune system not only acts as a defense against pathogen and cancer cells, but also plays an important role in homeostasis and tissue regeneration. Targeting immune systems is a promising strategy for efficient cancer treatment and regenerative medicine. Current systemic immunomodulation therapies are usually associated with low persistence time, poor targeting to action sites and severe side effects. Due to their ECM&#8208;mimetic nature, tunable properties and diverse bioactivities, hydrogels are intriguing platforms to locally deliver immunomodulatory agents and cells, as well as provide an immunomodulatory microenvironment to recruit, activate and expand host immune cells. In this review, we focus on the design considerations, including polymer backbones, crosslinking mechanisms, physicochemical nature, and immunomodulation&#8208;related components, of the hydrogel platforms. The immunomodulatory effects and therapeutic outcomes in cancer therapy and tissue regeneration of different hydrogel systems are emphasized, including hydrogel depots for delivery of immunomodulatory agents, hydrogel scaffolds for cell delivery, and immunomodulatory hydrogels depending on the intrinsic properties of materials. Finally, the remained challenges in current systems and future development of immunomodulatory hydrogels are discussed.

         <title>Opportunities and Challenges in Applying Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy in Organic Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The opportunities and challenges of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as a versatile analytical tool in the strongly emerging field of organic mechanochemistry are discussed. Strengths of solid&#8208;state NMR are highlighted, for instance in ex situ structure characterization, differentiating polymorphs, NMR&#8208;crystallographic structure&#8208;determination protocols, or detecting weak noncovalent interactions in molecular&#8208;recognition events employing proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR experiments.








Abstract
In recent years it is shown that mechanochemical strategies can be beneficial in directed conversions of organic compounds. Finding new reactions proved difficult, and due to the lack of mechanistic understanding of mechanochemical reaction events, respective efforts have mostly remained empirical. Spectroscopic techniques are crucial in shedding light on these questions. In this overview, the opportunities and challenges of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in the field of organic mechanochemistry are discussed. After a brief discussion of the basics of high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state NMR under magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) conditions, seven opportunities for solid&#8208;state NMR in the field of organic mechanochemistry are presented, ranging from ex situ approaches to structurally elucidated reaction products obtained by milling to the potential and limitations of in situ solid&#8208;state NMR approaches. Particular strengths of solid&#8208;state NMR, for instance in differentiating polymorphs, in NMR&#8208;crystallographic structure&#8208;determination protocols, or in detecting weak noncovalent interactions in molecular&#8208;recognition events employing proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR experiments at fast MAS frequencies, are discussed.

         <title>Hydrovoltaic Electricity Generator with Hygroscopic Materials: A Review and New Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the design and applications of hydrovoltaic electricity generators through an in&#8208;depth discussion of published case studies. Upon a concise introduction of their operating principles, strategic considerations for the development of high&#8208;performance HEGs, including the choice of hydrovoltaic active materials, hygroscopic materials, electrode materials, and device structures are provided.








Abstract
The global energy crisis caused by the overconsumption of nonrenewable fuels has prompted researchers to develop alternative strategies for producing electrical energy. In this review, a fascinating strategy that simply utilizes water, an abundant natural substance throughout the globe and even in air as moisture, as a power source is introduced. The concept of the hydrovoltaic electricity generator (HEG) proposed herein involves generating an electrical potential gradient by exposing the two ends of the HEG device to dissimilar physicochemical environments, which leads to the production of an electrical current through the active material. HEGs, with a large variety of viable active materials, have much potential for expansion toward diverse applications including permanent and/or emergency power sources. In this review, representative HEGs that generate electricity by the mechanisms of diffusion, streaming, and capacitance as case studies for building a fundamental understanding of the electricity generation process are discussed. In particular, by comparing the use and absence of hygroscopic materials, HEG mechanism studies to establish active material design principles are meticulously elucidated. The review with future perspectives on electrode design using conducting nanomaterials, considerations for high performance device construction, and potential impacts of the HEG technology in improving the livelihoods are reviewed.

         <title>Material Breakthroughs in Smart Food Monitoring: Intelligent Packaging and On&#8208;Site Testing Technologies for Spoilage and Contamination Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper comprehensively reviews material breakthroughs in in situ and on&#8208;site food monitoring. Base material substrates are discussed, both with regards to their intrinsic material properties and their contributions within recently reported sensing platforms. Biogenic amine, pH, and pathogen monitoring are all examined. Finally, a situational assessment and anticipated future directions are outlined.








Abstract
Despite extensive commercial and regulatory interventions, food spoilage and contamination continue to impose massive ramifications on human health and the global economy. Recognizing that such issues will be significantly eliminated by the accurate and timely monitoring of food quality markers, smart food sensors have garnered significant interest as platforms for both real&#8208;time, in&#8208;package food monitoring and on&#8208;site commercial testing. In both cases, the sensitivity, stability, and efficiency of the developed sensors are largely informed by underlying material design, driving focus toward the creation of advanced materials optimized for such applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of emerging intelligent materials and sensors developed in this space is provided, through the lens of three key food quality markers &#8211; biogenic amines, pH, and pathogenic microbes. Each sensing platform is presented with targeted consideration toward the contributions of the underlying metallic or polymeric substrate to the sensing mechanism and detection performance. Further, the real&#8208;world applicability of presented works is considered with respect to their capabilities, regulatory adherence, and commercial potential. Finally, a situational assessment of the current state of intelligent food monitoring technologies is provided, discussing material&#8208;centric strategies to address their existing limitations, regulatory concerns, and commercial considerations.

In both cases, the sensitivity, stability, and efficiency of the developed sensors are largely informed by underlying material design, driving focus toward the creation of advanced materials optimized for such applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of emerging intelligent materials and sensors developed in this space is provided, through the lens of three key food quality markers &#8211; biogenic amines, pH, and pathogenic microbes. Each sensing platform is presented with targeted consideration toward the contributions of the underlying metallic or polymeric substrate to the sensing mechanism and detection performance. Further, the real-world applicability of presented works is considered with respect to their capabilities, regulatory adherence, and commercial potential. Finally, a situational assessment of the current state of intelligent food monitoring technologies is provided, discussing material-centric strategies to address their existing limitations, regulatory concerns, and commercial considerations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large Room Temperature Magnetoresistance in a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Open&#8208;shell conjugated polymers (CPs) offer new opportunities for the development of emerging technologies that utilize the spin&#8208;degree of freedom. Their light&#8208;element composition, weak spin orbit coupling, synthetic modularity, high chemical stability, and solution&#8208;processability offer attributes that are unavailable from other semiconducting materials. However, developing an understanding of how electronic structure correlates with emerging transport phenomena remains central to their application. Here, we provide the first connections between molecular, electronic, and solid&#8208;state transport in a high&#8208;spin donor&#8208;acceptor CP, poly(4&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,5&#8208;didodecylbenzylidene)&#8208;4H&#8208;cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;[1,2,5]&#8208;thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinoxaline). At low temperatures (T &lt; 180 K) a giant negative magnetoresistance (MR) is achieved in a thin&#8208;film device with a value of &#8211;98% at 10 K, which surpasses the performance of all other organic materials. The thermal depopulation of the high&#8208;spin manifold and negative MR decrease as temperature increases and at T &gt; 180 K, the MR becomes positive with a relatively large MR of 13.5% at room temperature. Variable temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements demonstrate that modulation of both the sign and magnitude of the MR correlates with the electronic and spin structure of the CP. These results indicate that donor&#8208;acceptor CPs with open&#8208;shell and high&#8208;spin ground states offer new opportunities for emerging spin&#8208;based applications.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation Reaction with A Benchmark Rate at Air&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Solid Joint Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The rapid charge recombination, low selectivity for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction and limited O2 diffusion rate hinder the practical applications of photocatalytic H2O2 generation. Herein, we develop a triphase photocatalytic system in which the H2O2 generation occurs at the air&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid joint interfaces, using polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The introduction of pyrrole units and cyano group into PCN could promote the activation of oxygen molecules and facilitate the spatial separation of HOMO and LUMO orbits, hence improving the charge carrier separation efficiency and enhance the formation of H2O2. Importantly, the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triphase interface system allows for the rapid transport of oxygen from the air to the reaction interface, overcoming the low solubility and slow diffusion of oxygen in the water in conventional liquid reaction systems. The triphase system shows a benchmark H2O2 generation rate over PCN based materials in pure water (2063.21&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), which is an approximate 10&#8208;fold enhancement as compared to powder photocatalyst (215.44&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Simulation and electrochemical tests reveal that the rapid oxygen diffusion rate of triphase interface could promote charge separation and provide more O2 to generate H2O2. This work provides a promising strategy for constructing an efficient and sustainable H2O2 production system.

         <title>Anisotropic Superconducting Nb2CTx MXene Processed by Atomic Exchange at The Wafer Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The recent successful induction of superconductivity in MXenes through surface modification significantly expands the exploration space for MXene&#8208;based physical properties. However, relevant investigations were mostly based on powders or cold&#8208;pressed pellets, with few about the intrinsic superconductive properties at the nanoscale. Here we show that, after an atomic exchange process of aqueous&#8208;acid&#8208;synthesized Nb2CTx in the NH3 atmosphere, the superconductivity can be induced to either the single&#8208;flake or the thin film of the Nb2CTx MXene. The exchange process between nitrogen atoms and fluorine, carbon, and oxygen atoms on the MXene lattice and related structure evolutions were studied using both experiments and density functional theory (DFT). Based on either single&#8208;flake or thin&#8208;film devices, the anisotropic magnetic response of the two&#8208;dimensional superconducting transformation has been successfully uncovered. The anisotropic superconductivity indicates the great potential of MXenes with rich and unique physical properties. Moreover, the processing of the superconducting thin film uniformly over a 4&#8208;inch wafer opens up a space for scalable MXene&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Resilient Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite solar cells have attracted significant attention for commercialization. However, their intrinsic instabilities due to their high susceptibility to moisture cause irreversible perovskite degradation and device failures must be addressed. This article discusses extensively all available strategies to make perovskite solar cells, before final encapsulation, as moisture resilient as possible.








Abstract
With the rapid rise in device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), overcoming instabilities under outdoor operating conditions has become the most crucial obstacle toward their commercialization. Among stressors such as light, heat, voltage bias, and moisture, the latter is arguably the most critical, as it can decompose metal&#8208;halide perovskite (MHP) photoactive absorbers instantly through its hygroscopic components (organic cations and metal halides). In addition, most charge transport layers (CTLs) commonly employed in PSCs also degrade in the presence of water. Furthermore, photovoltaic module fabrication encompasses several steps, such as laser processing, subcell interconnection, and encapsulation, during which the device layers are exposed to the ambient atmosphere. Therefore, as a first step toward long&#8208;term stable perovskite photovoltaics, it is vital to engineer device materials toward maximizing moisture resilience, which can be accomplished by passivating the bulk of the MHP film, introducing passivation interlayers at the top contact, exploiting hydrophobic CTLs, and encapsulating finished devices with hydrophobic barrier layers, without jeopardizing device performance. Here, existing strategies for enhancing the performance stability of PSCs are reviewed and pathways toward moisture&#8208;resilient commercial perovskite devices are formulated.

Abstract
Metal alloys&#8208;structured electrocatalysts (MAECs) have made essential contributions to accelerating the practical applications of electrocatalytic devices in renewable energy systems. However, due to the complex atomic structures, varied electronic states, and abundant supports, precisely decoding the metal&#8208;metal interactions and structure&#8208;activity relationships of MAECs still confronts great challenges, which is critical to direct the future engineering and optimization of MAECs. Here, this timely review comprehensively summarizes the latest advances in creating the MAECs, including the metal&#8208;metal interactions, coordination microenvironments, and structure&#8208;activity relationships. First, the fundamental classification, design, characterization, and structural reconstruction of MAECs are outlined. Then, the electrocatalytic merits and modulation strategies of recent breakthroughs for noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;structured MAECs are thoroughly discussed, such as solid solution alloys, intermetallic alloys, and single&#8208;atom alloys. Particularly, unique insights into the bond interactions, theoretical understanding, and operando techniques for mechanism disclosure are given. Thereafter, the current states of diverse MAECs with a unique focus on structural property&#8208;reactivity relationships, reaction pathways, and performance comparisons are discussed. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives for MAECs are systematically discussed. It is believed that this comprehensive review can offer a substantial impact on stimulating the widespread utilization of metal alloys&#8208;structured materials in electrocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Metal alloys-structured electrocatalysts (MAECs) have made essential contributions to accelerating the practical applications of electrocatalytic devices in renewable energy systems. However, due to the complex atomic structures, varied electronic states, and abundant supports, precisely decoding the metal-metal interactions and structure-activity relationships of MAECs still confronts great challenges, which is critical to direct the future engineering and optimization of MAECs. Here, this timely review comprehensively summarizes the latest advances in creating the MAECs, including the metal-metal interactions, coordination microenvironments, and structure-activity relationships. First, the fundamental classification, design, characterization, and structural reconstruction of MAECs are outlined. Then, the electrocatalytic merits and modulation strategies of recent breakthroughs for noble and non-noble metal-structured MAECs are thoroughly discussed, such as solid solution alloys, intermetallic alloys, and single-atom alloys. Particularly, unique insights into the bond interactions, theoretical understanding, and operando techniques for mechanism disclosure are given. Thereafter, the current states of diverse MAECs with a unique focus on structural property-reactivity relationships, reaction pathways, and performance comparisons are discussed. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives for MAECs are systematically discussed. It is believed that this comprehensive review can offer a substantial impact on stimulating the widespread utilization of metal alloys-structured materials in electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Sonodynamic Materials for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer immunotherapy that leverages the immune system to fight against cancer has great potential to synergize with sonodynamic therapy for the treatment of cancer with high efficiency and safety. This review summarizes the recent progress of organic sonodynamic materials for combination cancer immunotherapy and highlights their synergistic antitumor effects originating from organic sonosensitizer&#8208;mediated SDT and immuno&#8208;oncology drug&#8208;induced immune pathway modulation.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a promising non&#8208;invasive therapeutic modality to treat deep&#8208;seated tumors owing to the good tissue penetration ability and spatiotemporal controllability of ultrasound (US); however, the low sonodynamic activity and potential side effects greatly limit its clinical translation. Cancer immunotherapy that leverages the immune system to fight against cancer has great potential to synergize with SDT for the treatment of cancer with high efficiency and safety. In this review, the convergence of SDT with cancer immunotherapy to exert their merits and break through the limitations of combination cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy are discussed. The focus is on the development and construction of organic materials with high sonodynamic activity and immunotherapeutic efficiency. These organic materials not only induce immunogenic cell death to improve tumor immunogenicity via SDT but also activate antitumor immunity via immuno&#8208;oncology drug&#8208;mediated immune pathway modulation. The combination of various immuno&#8208;oncology drugs with organic sonosensitizers is categorized and discussed along with the prospects and challenges for clinical translation.

A2&#8208;A1&#8208;D&#8208;A1&#8208;A2&#8208;type small molecules, with one electron&#8208;donating (D) core flanked by two electron&#8208;accepting (A) units, are an essential branch of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). Herein, advances in material development and voltage loss are highlighted. Their roles are reviewed in ternary organic photovoltaics, applications in indoor photovoltaics, and device stability.

Abstract
The A2&#8208;A1&#8208;D&#8208;A1&#8208;A2&#8208;type molecules consist of one electron&#8208;donating (D) core flanked by two electron&#8208;accepting units (A1 and A2) and have emerged as an essential branch of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). These molecules generally possess higher molecular energy levels and wider optical bandgaps compared with those of the classic A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208; and A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A&#8208;type NFAs, owing to the attenuated intramolecular charge transfer effect. These characteristics make them compelling choices for the fabrication of high&#8208;voltage organic photovoltaics (OPVs), ternary OPVs, and indoor OPVs. Herein, the recent progress in the A2&#8208;A1&#8208;D&#8208;A1&#8208;A2&#8208;type NFAs are reviewed, including the molecular engineering, structure&#8208;property relationships, voltage loss (Vloss), device stability, and photovoltaic performance of binary, ternary, and indoor OPVs. Finally, the challenges and provided prospects are discussed for the further development of this type of NFAs.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Electron Synchronization Excitation for Photochemical Synthesis And Patterning Graphene&#8208;based Electrode</title>

Abstract
Micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) represent a pressing requirement for powering the forthcoming generation of micro&#8208;electronic devices. The simultaneous realization of high&#8208;efficiency synthesis of electrode materials and precision patterning for MSCs in a single step presents an ardent need, yet it poses a formidable challenge. Herein, a unique shaped laser&#8208;induced patterned electron synchronization excitation strategy has been put forward to photochemical synthesis RuO2/rGO electrode and simultaneously manufacture the micron&#8208;scale high&#8208;performance MSCs with ultra&#8208;high resolution. Significantly, our technique represents a noteworthy advancement over traditional laser direct writing (LDW) patterning and photoinduced synthetic electrode methods. It not only improves the processing efficiency for MSCs and the controllability of laser&#8208;induced electrode material but also enhances electric fields and potentials at the interface for better electrochemical performance. The resultant MSCs exhibited excellent area and volumetric capacitance (516 mF cm&#8722;2 and 1720 F cm&#8722;3), and ultrahigh energy density (0.41&#160;Wh cm&#8722;3) and well&#8208;cycle stability (retaining 95% capacitance after 12000 cycles). This investigation establishes a novel avenue for electrode design and underscores substantial potential in the fabrication of diverse microelectronic devices.

         <title>Ag Nanoparticle&#8208;Induced Surface Chloride Immobilization Strategy Enables Stable Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although hydrogen gas (H2) storage might enable offshore renewable energy to be stored at scale, the commercialization of technology for H2 generation by seawater electrolysis depends upon the development of methods that avoid the severe corrosion of anodes by chloride (Cl&#8722;) ions. Here, we reveal that the stability of an anode used for seawater splitting can be increased by more than an order of magnitude by loading Ag nanoparticles on the catalyst surface. In experiments, an optimized NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH)@Ag electrode displayed stable operation at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline saline electrolyte and seawater for over 5000 and 2500&#160;h, respectively. The impressive long&#8208;term durability was more than 20 times that of an unmodified NiFe&#8208;LDH anode. Meticulous characterization and simulation revealed that in the presence of an applied electric field, free Cl&#8722; ions reacted with oxidized Ag nanoparticles to form stable AgCl species, giving rise to the formation of a Cl&#8722;&#8208;free layer near the anode surface. Because of its simplicity and effectiveness, we anticipate that the proposed strategy to immobilize chloride ions on the surface of an anode has the potential to become a crucial technology to control corrosion during large&#8208;scale electrolysis of seawater to produce hydrogen.

         <title>Sustainable Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries Beyond Li</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The limitations of resources used in current Li&#8208;ion batteries render them unsuitable for grid energy storage systems, prompting the search for low&#8208;cost and resource&#8208;abundant alternatives. &#8220;Beyond&#8208;Li cation&#8221; batteries have emerged as promising contenders; however, they confront noteworthy challenges due to the scarcity of suitable host materials for these cations. In contrast, anions, the other crucial component in electrolytes, demonstrate reversible intercalation capacity in specific materials like graphite. The convergence of anion and cation storage has given rise to a new battery technology known as dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs). This comprehensive review presents the current status, advancements, and future prospects of sustainable DIBs beyond Li. Notably, most DIBs exhibit similar cathode reaction mechanisms involving anion intercalation, while the distinguishing factor lies in the cation types functioning at the anode. Accordingly, this review is organized into sections by various cation types, including Na&#8208;, K&#8208;, Mg&#8208;, Zn&#8208;, Ca&#8208;, Al&#8208;, NH4+&#8208;, and proton&#8208;based DIBs. Moreover, a perspective on these novel DIBs is presented, along with proposed protocols for investigating DIBs and promising future research directions. We envision that this review will inspire fresh concepts, ideas, and research directions, while raising important questions to further tailor and understand sustainable DIBs, ultimately facilitating their practical realization.

         <title>Polyester Nanofiltration Membranes for Efficient Cations Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polyester nanofiltration membranes highlight beneficial chlorine resistance, but their loose structures and negative charge result in poor cations retention precluding advanced use in cations separation. This work designed a new monomer (TET) containing &#8220;hydroxyl&#8208;ammonium&#8221; entities that confer dense structures and positive charge to polyester nanofiltration membranes. The TET monomer underwent efficient interfacial polymerization with the trimesoyl chloride (TMC) monomer, and the resultant TET&#8208;TMC membranes feature one of the lowest molecular weight cut&#8208;off (389&#160;Da) and the highest zeta potential (4 mv, pH: 7) among all polyester nanofiltration membranes. The MgCl2 rejection of the TET&#8208;TMC membrane is 95.5%, significantly higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyester nanofiltration membranes (&lt;50%). The Li+/Mg2+ separation performance of TET&#8208;TMC membrane is on par with cutting&#8208;edge polyamide membranes, while additionally, the membrane is stable against NaClO though polyamide membranes readily degrade. Thus the TET&#8208;TMC is the first polyester nanofiltration membrane for efficient cations separation.

         <title>Observation of Ferroelectric Lithography on Biodegradable Pla Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferroelectric lithography, which can purposefully control and pattern ferroelectric domains in the micro&#8208;/nanometer scale, has extensive applications in data memories, field&#8208;effect transistors, race&#8208;track memory, tunneling barriers, and integrated biochemical sensors. In pursuit of mechanical flexibility and light weight, organic ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) have been developed; however, they still suffer from complicated stretching processes of film fabrication and poor degradability. These poor features severely hinder its applications. Here, we demonstrate the ferroelectric lithography on the biocompatible and biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA) thin films at room temperature. The semi&#8208;crystalline PLA thin film can be easily fabricated through the melt&#8208;casting method, and the desired domain structures can be precisely written according to the predefined patterns. Most importantly, the coercive voltage (Vc) of PLA thin film is relatively low (lower than 30 V) and can be further reduced with the decrease of the film thickness. These intriguing behaviors combined with satisfying biodegradability make PLA thin film a desirable candidate for ferroelectric lithography and enable its future application in the field of bioelectronics and biomedicine. This work sheds light on further exploration of ferroelectric lithography on other polymer ferroelectrics as well as their application as nanostructured devices.

         <title>Straightforward Design Strategy Towards 3D Near&#8208;Net&#8208;Shape Stoichiometric Sic Parts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), traditionally reserved for thermoplastics, is extending here to advanced non&#8208;oxide ceramics via a straightforward design strategy by considering the shaping and chemical richness offered by preceramic polymers. Specifically, 3D near net shape stoichiometric silicon carbide (SiC) objects are designed by manipulating the key features of a commercially available polycarbosilane (fusibility, high carbon content, relatively high SiC yield). In the early stage of the process, the carbon&#8208;rich polycarbosilane is first mixed with Si and SiC fillers and then thermolyzed at 120&#176;C to increase polymer branching while offering tailored rheological properties during micro&#8208;extrusion and providing adequate shape retention once extruded. This allowed for the design of tailored and complex 3D complex polymer architectures with features down to 400&#160;&#956;m. The complex polymer parts are further converted into 3D stoichiometric SiC objects with quasi&#8208;near&#8208;net&#8208;shape &#8211; a volume shrinkage reduced to 9.1% has been measured &#8211; by heat&#8208;treatment at a temperature as low as 1400&#176;C (argon flow). Given the flexibility to tune the preceramic polymer chemical and rheological properties, a new combined design approach is leveraged to generate bespoke advanced ceramics with a high freedom in geometry complexity.

         <title>Rational Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Inorganic 2D Materials via Molecular Engineering: Towards Molecule&#8208;Programmable Nanoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible. Succeeding graphene, emerging Inorganic 2D Materials (i2DMs) have been identified as alternative 2D Materials to harbor a variety of active molecular components to move the current silicon&#8208;based semiconductor technology forward to a post&#8208;Moore era based on molecule&#8208;based information processing components. In this regard, i2DMs benefits not only for their prominent physiochemical properties (e.g., the existence of band gap, contrary to graphene), but also their high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio rich in reactive sites (functionalization capability). Nonetheless, since this field is still in an early stage, having knowledge of both i) the different strategies for molecularly functionalizing the current library of i2DMs, and ii) the different types of active molecular components is a sine qua non condition for a rational design of stimuli&#8208;responsive i2DMs capable of performing logical binary operations at the molecular level. Consequently, this Review provides a comprehensive tutorial for covalently anchoring ad hoc molecular components &#8212;as active units triggered by different external inputs&#8212; onto pivotal i2DMs to assess their role in the expanding field of Molecule&#8208;Programmable Nanoelectronics for electrically monitoring bistable molecular switches. Limitations, challenges, and future perspectives of this emerging field which crosses materials chemistry with computation are critically discussed.

         <title>Thermochromic Photonic Crystal Paper with Integrated Multi&#8208;layer Structure and Fast Thermal Response: A Waterproof and Mechanically Stable Material for Structural&#8208;colored Thermal Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermochromic photonic crystals are promising materials for thermal printing due to their unfaded colors under chemical/illuminated environments and the absence of toxic chemicals. However, the slow thermochromic response, the multi&#8208;step printing procedures, the use of inks or developing liquids, and the requirement of expensive parts in printers limit their applications. Here, a thermochromic PU/HPO&#8208;SiO2&#8208;PC/Para film with an integrated multi&#8208;layer structure was fabricated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;step thermal printing that is fully compatible with commercial printers. The fast thermochromic response in milli&#8208;seconds enabled high&#8208;resolution and greyscale printing as the paraffin infiltration and the color change could be finely controlled in a microscale range. The integrated and hydrophobic multi&#8208;layer structure rendered the thermochromic film good stability in daily liquids, which addressed the long&#8208;existing concern of print fading. Meanwhile, the integrated multi&#8208;layer structure also enhanced the mechanical stability when it was deposited on fibrous paper so that people could fold, cut, or staple the thermal papers, and make notes confidently in practical usage.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Design of Metastable Phase Catalyst Enables Highly&#8208;Performance Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is a highly important reaction for catalytic industry. Developing non&#8208;noble metal based catalysts with platinum group metal&#8208;like activity and selectivity is extremely crucial yet challenging. Metastable phase catalysts provide a potential candidate to realize high activity, yet the control of selectivity remains an open question. Here, we first report a metastable phase core&#8208;shell: face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase Ag (10 at%) core&#8208;metastable hexagonal closest packed (hcp) phase Ni (90 at%) shell catalyst, which represents high conversion rate, high selectivity and remarkable universality for the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene and its derivatives. More impressively, a TOF value of 8241.8 h&#8722;1 is achieved, much higher than those of stable phase catalysts and reported platinum group metal based catalysts. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the surface of hcp Ni becomes more oxidized due to electron transfer from hcp Ni shell to fcc Ag core, which decreases the adsorption capacity of styrene on the metastable phase Ni surface, thus preventing full hydrogenation. This work has gained crucial research significance for the design of high performance metastable phase catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Highly selective semi-hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is a highly important reaction for catalytic industry. Developing non-noble metal based catalysts with platinum group metal-like activity and selectivity is extremely crucial yet challenging. Metastable phase catalysts provide a potential candidate to realize high activity, yet the control of selectivity remains an open question. Here, we first report a metastable phase core-shell: face-centered cubic (fcc) phase Ag (10 at%) core-metastable hexagonal closest packed (hcp) phase Ni (90 at%) shell catalyst, which represents high conversion rate, high selectivity and remarkable universality for the semi-hydrogenation of phenylacetylene and its derivatives.

         <title>Over&#8208;stoichiometric Metastabilization of Cation&#8208;Disordered Rock Salts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cation&#8208;disordered rock salts (DRXs) have been well known for their potential to realize the goal of achieving scalable Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;free high&#8208;energy density Li&#8208;ion batteries. Unlike in most cathode materials, the disordered cation distribution may lead to more factors that control the electrochemistry of DRXs. An important variable that has not been emphasized by research community is regarding whether a DRX exists in a more thermodynamically stable form or a more metastable form. Moreover, within the scope of metastable DRXs, over&#8208;stoichiometric DRXs, which allow relaxation of the site balance constraint of a rock salt structure, are particularly under explored. In this work, we report our findings in locating a generally applicable approach to &#8220;metastabilize&#8221; thermodynamically stable Mn&#8208;based DRXs to metastable ones by introducing Li over&#8208;stoichiometry. The over&#8208;stoichiometric metastabilization greatly stimulates more redox activities, enables better reversibility of Li deintercalation/intercalation, and changes the energy storage mechanism. The metastabilized DRXs can be transformed back to the thermodynamically stable form, which also revert the electrochemical properties, further contrasting the two categories of DRXs. This work enriches the structural and compositional space of DRXs families and adds new pathways for rationally tuning the properties of DRX cathodes.

         <title>Tunable Hydrogel Electronics for Diagnosis of Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Peripheral neuropathy characterized by rapidly increasing numbers of patients is commonly diagnosed via analyzing electromyography signals obtained from stimulation&#8208;recording devices. However, existing commercial electrodes have difficulty in implementing conformal contact with skin and gentle detachment, dramatically impairing stimulation/recording performances. Here, we develop on&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel (PDEH) as stimulation/recording devices to capture electromyography signals for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel achieves rapid and wide&#8208;range regulation of adhesion and substantially strengthened mechanical performances. Moreover, hydrogel patches assembled with a silver&#8208;liquid metal (SLM) layer exhibit superior charge injection and low contact impedance, capable of capturing high&#8208;fidelity electromyography. We further verify the feasibility of hydrogel devices for accurate diagnoses of peripheral neuropathy in sensory, motor, and mixed nerves. For various body parts, such as fingers, the elderly's loose skin, hairy skin, and children's fragile skin, we regulate the adhesion of PDEH&#8208;SLM devices to establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal. Noticeably, hydrogel patches achieve precise diagnoses of nerve injuries in these clinical cases while providing extra advantages of more effective stimulation/recording performances. These patches offer a promising alternative for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of neuropathy in future.

         <title>Phase Selection Rules of Multi&#8208;Principal Element Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Computational prediction of phase stability of multi&#8208;principal element alloys (MPEAs) holds a lot of promise for rapid exploration of the enormous design space and autonomous discovery of superior structural and functional properties. Regardless of many plausible works that rely on phenomenological theory and machine learning, precise prediction is still limited by insufficient data and the lack of interpretability of some machine learning algorithms, e.g., convolutional neural network. In this work, we have presented a comprehensive approach, encompassing the development of a complete dataset that contains 72,387 density functional theory calculations, as well as a predictive global phenomenological descriptor. The phase selection descriptor, based on atomic electronegativity and valence electron concentration, significantly outperforms the widely used valence electron concentration, excelling in both accuracy (with an F1 score of 63% compared to 47%) and its ability to predict the HCP phase (0.48 recall compared to 0). The comprehensive data mining on the global design space of 61,425 quaternary MPEAs made from 28 possible metals, together with the phenomenological theory and physical interpretation, will set up a solid computational science foundation for data&#8208;driven exploration of MPEAs.

         <title>Lightning the Spin: Harnessing the Potential of 2D Magnets in Opto&#8208;Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Since the emergence of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) magnets in 2017, the diversity of these materials has greatly expanded. Their 2D nature (atomic&#8208;scale thickness) endows these magnets with strong magnetic anisotropy, layer&#8208;dependent and switchable magnetic order, and quantum&#8208;confined quasiparticles, which distinguish them from conventional three&#8208;dimensional (3D) magnetic materials. Moreover, the 2D geometry facilitates light incidence for opto&#8208;spintronic applications and potential on&#8208;chip integration. In analogy to optoelectronics based on optical&#8208;electronic interactions, opto&#8208;spintronics use light&#8208;spin interactions to process spin information stored in the solid state. In this review, we divide opto&#8208;spintronics into three types with respect to the wavelengths of radiation interacting with 2D magnets: (1) GHz (microwave) to THz (mid&#8208;infrared), (2) visible, and (3) UV to X&#8208;rays. We focus on the recent research advancements on the newly discovered mechanisms of light&#8208;spin interactions in 2D magnets and introduce the potential design of novel opto&#8208;spintronic applications based on these interactions.

         <title>Unrestricted Chiral Patterning by Laser Writing in Liquid Crystalline and Plasmonic Nanocomposite Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Obtaining hierarchical structures with arbitrarily controlled chirality remains a challenge since the commonly used chiral building blocks favor chiral randomness throughout length scales. Here, we obtain chiroptically bipolar patterned thin films by introducing an autonomous device for microscale photothermal re&#8208;melting of materials exhibiting chirality synchronization. The device operates on an algorithm that reads, identifies, and controls the recrystallization of the film, facilitating the homochiral growth of supramolecular organic helices. Owing to the molecular achirality of the individual molecules and local chirality synchronization, both handednesses of the helices are available, enabling unrestricted chiral writing in the film. The collective chiroptical response of assembled molecules is used for guiding the patterning process, thus creating a foundation for optically secured information. Established methodology enabled achieving dissymmetry factor values for circular dichroism a magnitude higher than previously reported, as confirmed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, synchrotron&#8208;based Mueller matrix polarimetry. Moreover, we apply the developed method to nanocomposites comprising gold nanoparticles, providing the opportunity to tune the circular dichroism towards the plasmonic region. Our strategy uncovers the potential of photothermal processing by laser&#8208;directed melting, widening the selection of nanostructured materials with precisely designed chiroptical functionalities for photonic applications.

         <title>Discovering Process Dynamics for Scalable Perovskite Solar Cell Manufacturing with Explainable AI</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Large&#8208;area processing of perovskite semiconductor thin&#8208;films is complex and evokes unexplained variance in quality, posing a major hurdle for the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. Advances in scalable fabrication processes are currently limited to gradual and arbitrary trial&#8208;and&#8208;error procedures. While the in&#8208;situ acquisition of photoluminescence videos has the potential to reveal important variations in the thin&#8208;film formation process, the high dimensionality of the data quickly surpasses the limits of human analysis. In response, this study leverages deep learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to discover relationships between sensor information acquired during the perovskite thin&#8208;film formation process and the resulting solar cell performance indicators, while rendering these relationships humanly understandable. We&#160;further show how gained insights can be distilled into actionable recommendations for perovskite thin&#8208;film processing, advancing towards industrial&#8208;scale solar cell manufacturing. Our&#160;study demonstrates that XAI methods will play a critical role in accelerating energy materials science.

         <title>Stability Issues in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: Recent Advances in Fundamental Understanding and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically discusses the stability issues in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), covering the fundamental understanding on the destabilization mechanisms from electrocatalyst degradation to microenvironment evolution, and effective strategies to enhance the CO2RR stability from designing the robust electrocatalysts, optimizing the electrolysis system to manipulating the operation conditions.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising approach to close the anthropogenic carbon cycle and store intermittent renewable energy in fuels or chemicals. On the path to commercializing this technology, achieving the long&#8208;term operation stability is a central requirement but still confronts challenges. This motivates to organize the present review to systematically discuss the stability issue of CO2RR. This review starts from the fundamental understanding on the destabilization mechanisms of CO2RR, with focus on the degradation of electrocatalyst and change of reaction microenvironment during continuous electrolysis. Subsequently, recent efforts on catalyst design to stabilize the active sites are summarized, where increasing atomic binding strength to resist surface reconstruction is highlighted. Next, the optimization of electrolysis system to enhance the operation stability by maintaining reaction microenvironment especially mitigating flooding and carbonate problems is demonstrated. The manipulation on operation conditions also enables to prolong CO2RR lifespan through recovering catalytically active sites and mass transport process. This review finally ends up by indicating the challenges and future opportunities.

         <title>Leveraging Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have been widely used in tumor treatment. Through modification, SPNs can encapsulate or conjugate with various types of immune modulators. This review summarizes the recent progress of SPNs&#8208;based combination cancer immunotherapy and highlights the synergetic effect that amplifies the anti&#8208;tumor immune response.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has become a promising method for cancer treatment, bringing hope to advanced cancer patients. However, immune&#8208;related adverse events caused by immunotherapy also bring heavy burden to patients. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as an emerging nanomaterial with high biocompatibility, can eliminate tumors and induce tumor immunogenic cell death through different therapeutic modalities, including photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and sonodynamic therapy. In addition, SPNs can work as a functional nanocarrier to synergize with a variety of immunomodulators to amplify anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. In this review, SPNs&#8208;based combination cancer immunotherapy is comprehensively summarized according to the SPNs&#8217; therapeutic modalities and the type of loaded immunomodulators. The in&#8208;depth understanding of existing SPNs&#8208;based therapeutic modalities will hopefully inspire the design of more novel nanomaterials with potent anti&#8208;tumor immune effects, and ultimately promote their clinical translation.

         <title>Opto&#8208;electrochemical Synaptic Memory in Supramolecularly Engineered Janus 2d MoS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Artificial synapses combining multiple yet independent signal processing strategies in a single device are key enabler to achieve high&#8208;density of integration, energy efficiency and fast data manipulation in brain&#8208;like computing. By taming functional complexity, the use of hybrids comprising multiple materials as active components in synaptic devices represents a powerful route to encode both short&#8208;term potentiation (STP) and long&#8208;term potentiation (LTP) in synaptic circuitries. To meet such a grand challenge, herein we have developed a novel Janus two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material by dressing asymmetrically the two surfaces of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with an electrochemically&#8208;switchable ferrocene (Fc)/ ferrocenium (Fc+) redox couple and an optically&#8208;responsive photochromic azobenzene (Azo). Upon varying the magnitude of the electrochemical stimulus, it was possible to steer the transition between STP and LTP, thereby either triggering a Fc/Fc+ redox reaction or controlling an adsorption/desorption process of such redox species on MoS2. The adsorption/desorption process rules the programming of LTP states, whereas STP states are encoded through the chemical doping of MoS2 by tuning the electrochemical Fc/Fc+ equilibrium. In addition, a lower magnitude STP is recorded by activating the photoisomerization of azobenzene chemisorbed molecules and therefore modulating the dipole induced doping of the 2D semiconductor. Significantly, the interplay of electrochemical and optical stimuli makes it possible to construct artificial synapses where LTP can be boosted to 4&#8208;bit (16 memory states) while simultaneously also functioning as STP.

         <title>Pseudopolymorphic Phase Engineering for Improved Thermoelectric Performance in Copper Sulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymorphism (and its extended form &#8211; pseudopolymorphism) in solids is ubiquitous in mineralogy, crystallography, chemistry/ biochemistry, materials science and the pharmaceutical industries. Despite the difficulty of controlling (pseudo&#8208;)polymorphism, the realization of specific (pseudo&#8208;)polymorphic phases and associated boundary structures is an efficient route to enhance material performance for energy conversion and electromechanical applications. Here, we apply the pseudopolymorphic phase (PP) concept to a thermoelectric copper sulfide, Cu2&#8208;xS (x &#8804; 0.25), via CuBr2 doping. A peak ZT value of 1.25 is obtained at 773&#160;K in Cu1.8S + 3&#160;wt.% CuBr2, which is 2.3 times higher than that of a pristine Cu1.8S sample. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy confirms the transformation of pristine Cu1.8S low digenite into PP&#8208;engineered high digenite, as well as the formation of (semi&#8208;)coherent interfaces between different PPs, which is expected to enhance phonon scattering. Our results demonstrate that PP engineering is an effective approach for achieving improved thermoelectric performance in Cu&#8208;S compounds. It is also expected to be useful in other materials.

         <title>Reconfigurable Neuromorphic Computing: Materials, Devices, and Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable neuromorphic computing strives for bridging the gap between discrete intelligent paradigms. Developments about reconfigurable neuromorphic computing are systematically overviewed, in which the state&#8208;of&#8208;art strides from the material, device, and integration aspects are included, highlighting their significance in motivating the prosperity of general&#8208;purposed intelligent computing. Perspective on the trends and obstacles of reconfigurable neuromorphic computing is also outlined.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing has been attracting ever&#8208;increasing attention due to superior energy efficiency, with great promise to promote the next wave of artificial general intelligence in the post&#8208;Moore era. Current approaches are, however, broadly designed for stationary and unitary assignments, thus encountering reluctant interconnections, power consumption, and data&#8208;intensive computing in that domain. Reconfigurable neuromorphic computing, an on&#8208;demand paradigm inspired by the inherent programmability of brain, can maximally reallocate finite resources to perform the proliferation of reproducibly brain&#8208;inspired functions, highlighting a disruptive framework for bridging the gap between different primitives. Although relevant research has flourished in diverse materials and devices with novel mechanisms and architectures, a precise overview remains blank and urgently desirable. Herein, the recent strides along this pursuit are systematically reviewed from material, device, and integration perspectives. At the material and device level, one comprehensively conclude the dominant mechanisms for reconfigurability, categorized into ion migration, carrier migration, phase transition, spintronics, and photonics. Integration&#8208;level developments for reconfigurable neuromorphic computing are also exhibited. Finally, a perspective on the future challenges for reconfigurable neuromorphic computing is discussed, definitely expanding its horizon for scientific communities.

Departing from chemical design, this paper reports on how the miniaturization as nanoparticles and their integration into various architectures, in particular combining them with two&#8208;dimensional materials,&#160;provides a suitable approach to prepare robust and resilient devices for electrically sensing spin transitions.








Abstract
The field of spin&#8208;crossover complexes is rapidly evolving from the study of the spin transition phenomenon to its exploitation in molecular electronics. Such spin transition is gradual in a single&#8208;molecule, while in bulk it can be abrupt, showing sometimes thermal hysteresis and thus a memory effect. A convenient way to keep this bistability while reducing the size of the spin&#8208;crossover material is to process it as nanoparticles (NPs). Here, the most recent advances in the chemical design of these NPs and their integration into electronic devices, paying particular attention to optimizing the switching ratio are reviewed. Then, integrating spin&#8208;crossover NPs over 2D materials is focused to improve the endurance, performance, and detection of the spin state in these hybrid devices.

         <title>Molecular Masking of Synthetic Immunomodulator Evokes Antitumor Immunity with Reduced Immune Tolerance and Systemic Toxicity by Temporal Activity Recovery and Sustained Stimulation</title>

Abstract
Activation of the innate immune system counteracts tumor&#8208;induced immunosuppression. Hence, small molecule&#8208;based Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonists (TLR7/8a), which can modulate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment along with the activation of innate immunity, are emerging as essential components of cancer immunotherapy. However, the clinical application of synthetic TLR7/8a therapies has been limited by systemic immune&#8208;associated toxicity and immune tolerance induced by uncontrolled stimulatory activities and repeated treatments. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal recovery of the activity of TLR7/8a through prodrug&#8208;like TLR7/8a (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained and controlled release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposome (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) (NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8)) in a macroscale depot were designed. Immunization with cationic NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8) and anionic antigens triggered robust activation of innate immune cells as well as antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses, eliciting reprogramming of immunosuppressive cells (M2 macrophages and MDSCs) into tumor&#8208;suppressive cells (M1 macrophages), with decreased systemic adverse effects and immune tolerance. Combination treatment with NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 plus anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) or nanoliposomes (Dox) had synergistic effects on antitumor immunity in various tumor models. The concept of pro&#8208;TLR7/8a suggested herein may facilitate the advancement of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based immunomodulators for clinical translation and safe and effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Labile Coordination Interphase for Regulating Lean Ion Dynamics in Reversible Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The rechargeable&#160;Zn battery technology is plagued with&#160;limited reversibility&#160;on the anode. The&#160;issue&#160;is particularly exacerbated when using lean electrolytes,&#160;which compromises the economic advantages of zinc batteries for large&#8208;scale energy storage. In this paper, we report the development&#160;of a zinc&#8208;coordinated&#160;interphase that prevents chemical corrosion and provides protection for zinc anodes. The selective binding of Zn2+&#160;ions towards histidine and carboxylate ligands forms a coordination environment that offers high Zn2+&#160;affinity and fast Zn2+&#160;diffusion owing to its thermodynamic stability and kinetic lability. Both experiments and calculations suggest that the interphase mitigates side reactions&#160;and regulates the dendrite&#8208;free electrodeposition. Implementing this labile coordination interphase yields enhanced cycling at a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2&#160;with high reversibility of dendrite&#8208;free zinc plating/stripping for more than 200 hours. The reversibility was demonstrated in a Zn||LiMn2O4 cell, which shows an energy density of 74.7 mWh g&#8722;1 and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% after 500 cycles. In addition, we demonstrate&#160;a lean&#8208;electrolyte full cell utilizing&#160;electrolyte of only 10&#160;&#956;L mAh&#8722;1. This cell operates for an extended cycling life of 100 cycles, five times longer than the pristine Zn anodes. This provides an energy density that is significantly higher than that of commercial aqueous batteries. This work demonstrates a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design for utilizing labile coordination interphases on Zn anodes, offering an approach for low&#8208;electrolyte usage and the manufacture of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Broadband Emission Origin in Metal Halide Perovskites: Are Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons or Ions?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The broadband emission origin of single&#8208;component metal halide perovskites is now recognized as from self&#8208;trapped excitons and/or ns2 ions, whose fundamentals and recent advances are summarized. A clear and comprehensive understanding is offered to meet the design requirements toward highly efficient materials and devices.








Abstract
It has always been a goal to realize high efficiency and broadband emission in single&#8208;component materials. The appearance of metal halide perovskites makes it possible. Their soft lattice characteristics and significant electron&#8211;phonon coupling synergistically generate self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs), contributing to a broadband emission with a large Stokes shift. Meanwhile, their structural/compositional diversity provides suitable active sites and coordination environments for doping of ns2 ions, allowing 3Pn(n=0,1,2)&#8594;1S0 transitions toward broadband emission. The ns2 ions emission is phenomenologically similar to that of STE emission, hindering in&#8208;depth understanding of their emission origin, and leading to failure to meet the design requirements for practical applications. In this scenario, herein, the fundamentals and development of such two emission mechanisms are summarized to establish a clear and comprehensive understanding of the broadband emission phenomenon, which may pave the way to an ideal customization of broadband&#8208;emission metal halide perovskites.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;entangled Spontaneous Pseudo Planar Heterojunction for Constructing Efficient Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs) have attracted considerable attention from researchers as promising portable power sources for wearable electronic devices. However, insufficient power conversion efficiency (PCE), intrinsic stretchability, and mechanical stability of FOSCs remain severe obstacles to their application. Herein, we propose an entangled strategy for the synergistic optimization of PCE and mechanical properties of FOSCs through green sequential printing combined with polymer&#8208;induced spontaneous gradient heterojunction phase separation morphology. Impressively, the toughened&#8208;pseudo planar heterojunction (Toughened&#8208;PPHJ) film exhibited excellent tensile properties with a crack onset strain (COS) of 11.0%, twice that of the reference bulk heterojunction (BHJ) film (5.5%), which is among the highest values reported for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer/small molecule&#8208;based systems. Finite element simulation of stress distribution during film bending confirmed that Toughened&#8208;PPHJ film can release residual stress well. Therefore, this optimal device showed a high PCE (18.16%) with enhanced JSC and suppressed energy loss, which is a significant improvement over the conventional BHJ device (16.99%). Finally, the 1 cm2 flexible Toughened&#8208;PPHJ device retained more than 92% of its initial PCE (13.3%) after 1000 bending cycles. This work provides a feasible guiding idea for future flexible portable power supplies.

         <title>Deep Learning for Size&#8208;Agnostic Inverse Design of Random&#8208;Network 3D Printed Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Practical applications of mechanical metamaterials often involve solving inverse problems where the objective is to find the (multiple) microarchitectures that give rise to a given set of properties. The limited resolution of additive manufacturing techniques often requires solving such inverse problems for specific sizes. One should, therefore, find multiple microarchitectural designs that exhibit the desired properties for a specimen with given dimensions. Moreover, the candidate microarchitectures should be resistant to fatigue and fracture, meaning that peak stresses should be minimized as well.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical applications of mechanical metamaterials often involve solving inverse problems where the objective is to find the (multiple) microarchitectures that give rise to a given set of properties. The limited resolution of additive manufacturing techniques often requires solving such inverse problems for specific sizes. One should, therefore, find multiple microarchitectural designs that exhibit the desired properties for a specimen with given dimensions. Moreover, the candidate microarchitectures should be resistant to fatigue and fracture, meaning that peak stresses should be minimized as well. Such a multi-objective inverse design problem is formidably difficult to solve but its solution is the key to real-world applications of mechanical metamaterials. Here, we propose a modular approach titled &#8220;Deep-DRAM&#8221; that combines four decoupled models, including two deep learning models (DLM), a deep generative model (DGM) based on conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE), and direct finite element (FE) simulations. Deep-DRAM (deep learning for the design of random-network metamaterials) integrates these models into a unified framework capable of finding many solutions to the multi-objective inverse design problem posed here. All microarchitectural designs are based on random-network (RN) unit cells with ordered lattices. The first DLM predicts the anisotropic elastic properties of RN unit cells given their microarchitectural design while the other one does the same with the additional input of specimen dimensions. The DGM generates unit cells that give rise to a given set of elastic properties. The integrated framework first introduces the desired elastic properties to the DGM, which returns a set of candidate designs. The candidate designs, together with the target specimen dimensions are then passed to the DLM which predicts their actual elastic properties considering the specimen size. After a filtering step based on the closeness of the actual properties to the desired ones, the last step uses direct FE simulations to identify the designs with the minimum peak stresses.

         <title>Air&#8208;Working Electrochromic Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Artificial muscles are indispensable components for next&#8208;generation robotics to mimic the sophisticated movements of living systems and provide higher output energies when compared with real muscles. However, artificial muscles actuated by electrochemical ion injection have problems with single actuation properties and difficulties in stable operation in air. Here, we report air&#8208;working electrochromic artificial muscles (EAMs) with both color&#8208;changing and actuation functions, which are constructed based on vanadium pentoxide nanowires and carbon tube yarn. Each EAM can generate a contractile stroke of approximately 12% during stable operation in the air with multiple color changes (yellow&#8208;green&#8208;gray) under &#177;4&#160;V actuation voltages. The reflectance contrast is as high as 51%, demonstrating the excellent versatility of the EAMs. Additionally, we have constructed a toroidal EAM arrangement with fast response and high resilience. The EAM's contractile stroke can be displayed through visual color changes, which provides new ideas for future artificial muscle applications in soft robots and artificial limbs.

         <title>Enhanced CO2 Electrolysis Through Mn Substitution Coupled with Ni Exsolution in Lanthanum Calcium Titanate Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this work, the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transition and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer process is exploited to derive lanthanide organic framework (Tb&#8208;cpon) modified perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with enhanced performance under UV irradiation. Tb&#8208;cpon&#8208;modified PSCs exhibit rapid response and reduced degradation due to energy down&#8208;conversion facilitated by effective coupling of UV&#8208;sensitive chromophores to lanthanide luminescent centers, enhancing the spectral response range of the composite films. Furthermore, the characteristic changes of precursor particle sizes suggest formation of Tb&#8208;cpon adducts as intermediate products, leading to enhanced crystallinity and reduced defect concentrations in the Tb&#8208;cpon&#8208;perovskite hybrid film. Accordingly, the Tb&#8208;cpon modified PSC devices obtained a champion efficiency up to 23.72% as well as a sensitive photovoltaic conversion even under pure UV irradiation. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintained more than 80% of the initial efficiency after continuous irradiation under a 310&#160;nm UV lamp for 24&#160;h (from the Au electrode side), compared to 21% for the control devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;responsive Nanorobot Based Marsupial Robotic System for Intracranial Cross&#8208;Scale Targeting Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanorobots capable of active movement are an exciting technology for targeted therapeutic intervention. However, the extensive motion range and hindrance of the blood&#8208;brain barrier impeded their clinical translation in glioblastoma therapy. Here, we report a marsupial robotic system constructed by integrating chemical/magnetic hybrid nanorobots (child robots) with a miniature magnetic continuum robot (mother robot) for intracranial cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery. For primary targeting on macro&#8208;scale, the continuum robot enters the cranial cavity through a minimally invasive channel (e.g., Ommaya device) in the skull and transports the nanorobots to pathogenic regions. Upon circumventing the blood&#8208;brain barrier, the released nanorobots perform secondary targeting on micro&#8208;scale to further enhance the spatial resolution of drug delivery. In vitro experiments against primary glioblastoma cells derived from different patients were conducted for personalized treatment guidance. The operation feasibility within organisms is shown in ex vivo swine brain experiments. The biosafety of the treatment system is suggested in in vivo experiments. Owing to our hierarchical targeting method, the targeting rate, targeting accuracy, and treatment efficacy have improved greatly. The marsupial robotic system offers a novel intracranial local therapeutic strategy and constitutes a key milestone in the development of glioblastoma treatment platforms.

         <title>Thiomolybdate Clusters: from Homogeneous Catalysis to Heterogenization and Active Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thiomolybdates are molecular molybdenum&#8208;sulfide clusters formed from Mo centers and sulfur&#8208;based ligands. For decades, they have attracted the interest of synthetic chemists due to their unique structures and their relevance in biological systems, e.g., as reactive sites in enzymes. More recently, thiomolybdates have been explored from the catalytic point of view and applied as homogeneous and molecular mimics of heterogeneous molybdenum sulfide catalysts. This review summarizes prominent examples of thiomolybdate&#8208;based electro&#8208; and photocatalysis and provides a comprehensive analysis of their reactivities under homogeneous and heterogenized conditions. Active sites of thiomolybdates relevant for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are examined, aiming to shed light on the link between cluster structure and performance. The shift from solution&#8208;phase to surface&#8208;supported thiomolybdates is discussed with a focus on applications in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The outlook highlights current trends and emerging areas of thiomolybdate research, ending with a summary of challenges and key takeaway messages based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research.

         <title>Intravascularly Deliverable Biomaterial Platforms for Tissue Repair and Regeneration Post&#8208;Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind intravascularly administered biomaterials for the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). First, biomaterials can utilize passive diffusion into the infarct. Second, biomaterials can utilize specific cellular presence in the infarct for localization. Finally, these active materials can be leveraged to localize to the ischemic heart based on the MI pathophysiology.








Abstract
Each year, nearly 19 million people die of cardiovascular disease with coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction (MI) as the leading cause of the progression of heart failure. Due to the high risk associated with surgical procedures, a variety of minimally invasive therapeutics aimed at tissue repair and regeneration are being developed. While biomaterials delivered via intramyocardial injection have shown promise, there are challenges associated with delivery in acute MI. In contrast, intravascularly injectable biomaterials are a desirable category of therapeutics due to their ability to be delivered immediately post&#8208;MI via less invasive methods. In addition to passive diffusion into the infarct, these biomaterials can be designed to target the molecular and cellular characteristics seen in MI pathophysiology, such as cells and proteins present in the ischemic myocardium, to reduce off&#8208;target localization. These injectable materials can also be stimuli&#8208;responsive through enzymes or chemical imbalances. This review outlines the natural and synthetic biomaterial designs that allow for retention and accumulation within the infarct via intravascular delivery, including intracoronary infusion and intravenous injection.

         <title>Breaking the Activity and Stability Bottlenecks of Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advance in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is systematically reviewed, including reaction mechanisms, catalysts, and operando characterizations, aiming to shed light on the rational design of advanced catalysts for the large&#8208;scale application of OER in various energy conversion and storage systems such as proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone reaction for a variety of electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems such as water splitting, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8211;air batteries. However, OER catalysis in acids suffers from extra sluggish kinetics due to the additional step of water dissociation along with its multiple electron transfer processes. Furthermore, OER catalysts often suffer from poor stability in harsh acidic electrolytes due to the severe dissolution/corrosion processes. The development of active and stable OER catalysts in acids is highly demanded. Here, &#160;the recent advances in OER electrocatalysis in acids are reviewed and the key strategies are summarized to overcome the bottlenecks of activity and stability for both noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based and noble metal&#8208;free catalysts, including i) morphology engineering, ii) composition engineering, and iii) defect engineering. Recent achievements in operando characterization and theoretical calculations are summarized which provide an unprecedented understanding of the OER mechanisms regarding active site identification, surface reconstruction, and degradation/dissolution pathways. Finally, views are offered on the current challenges and opportunities to break the activity&#8211;stability relationships for acidic OER in mechanism understanding, catalyst design, as well as standardized stability and activity evaluation for industrial applications such as proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers and beyond.

         <title>Electrochemical Syntheses of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely applied in optoelectronics and material sciences. In the past decade, molecular electrochemistry has emerged as a novel and robust tool for PAHs synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive survey on electrochemical assembly of PAHs largely by the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have surfaced as increasingly viable components in optoelectronics and material sciences. The development of highly efficient and atom&#8208;economic tools to prepare PAHs under exceedingly mild conditions constitutes a long&#8208;term goal. Traditional syntheses of PAHs have largely relied on multistep approaches or the conventional Scholl reaction. However, Scholl reactions are largely inefficient with electron&#8208;deficient substrates, require stoichiometric chemical oxidants, and typically occur in the presence of strong acid. In sharp contrast, electrochemistry has gained considerable momentum during the past decade as an alternative for the facile and straightforward PAHs assembly, generally via electro&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenative annulation, releasing molecular hydrogen as the sole stoichiometric byproduct by the hydrogen evolution reaction. This review provides an overview on the recent and significant advances in the field of electrochemical syntheses of various PAHs until January 2023.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Light Responsive Materials: Design Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the application&#8208;guided design strategies of circularly polarized light&#8208;responsive materials are systematically summarized and discussed.








Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) with the end of optical vector traveling along circumferential trajectory shows left&#8208; and right&#8208;handedness, which transmits chiral information to materials via complicated CPL&#8211;matter interactions. Materials with circular dichroism respond to CPL illumination selectively with differential outputs that can be used to design novel photodetectors. Racemic or achiral compounds under CPL go through photodestruction, photoresolution, and asymmetric synthesis pathways to generate enantiomeric bias and optical activity. By this strategy, helical polymers and chiral inorganic plasmonic nanostructures are synthesized directly, and their intramolecular folding and subsequent self&#8208;assembly are photomodulable as well. In the aggregated state of self&#8208;assembly and liquid crystal phase, helical sense of the dynamic molecular packing is sensitive to enantiomeric bias brought by CPL, enabling the chiral amplification to supramolecular scale. In this review, the application&#8208;guided design strategies of CPL&#8208;responsive materials are aimed to be systematically summarized and discussed. Asymmetric synthesis, resolution, and property&#8208;modulation of small organic compounds, polymers, inorganic nanoparticles, supramolecular assemblies and liquid crystals are highlighted based on the important developments during the last decades. Besides, applications of light&#8211;matter interactions including CPL detection and biomedical applications are also referred.

Abstract
Over the past three years, remarkable advancements in organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged, propelled by the introduction of Y6&#8212;an innovative A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type small molecule non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA). This review provides a critical discussion of the current knowledge about the structural and physical properties of the PM6:Y6 material combination in relation to its photovoltaic performance. The design principles of PM6 and Y6 are discussed, covering charge transfer, transport, and recombination mechanisms. Then, the authors delve into blend morphology and degradation mechanisms before considering commercialization. The current state of the art is presented, while also discussing unresolved contentious issues, such as the blend energetics, the pathways of free charge generation, and the role of triplet states in recombination. As such, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the PM6:Y6 material combination and its potential for further development in the field of organic solar cells. By addressing both the successes and challenges associated with this system, this review contributes to the ongoing research efforts toward achieving more efficient and stable organic solar cells.

         <title>1D Magnetic MX3 Single&#8208;Chains (M = Cr, V and X = Cl, Br, I)</title>

         <dc:description>
1D magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I) confined in carbon nanotubes are investigated. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique 1D face&#8208;sharing octahedron MX3 structure. Charge transfer from carbon nanotube to MX3 single&#8208;chain plays a critical role in stabilizing the chain structures.








Abstract
Magnetic materials in reduced dimensions are not only excellent platforms for fundamental studies of magnetism, but they play crucial roles in technological advances. The discovery of intrinsic magnetism in monolayer 2D van der Waals systems has sparked enormous interest, but the single&#8208;chain limit of 1D magnetic van der Waals materials has been largely unexplored. This paper reports on a family of 1D magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I), prepared in fully&#8208;isolated fashion within the protective cores of carbon nanotubes. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique structures that differ from the well&#8208;known 2D honeycomb lattice MX3 structure. Density functional theory calculations reveal charge&#8208;driven reversible magnetic phase transitions.

         <title>Catechin&#8208;Functionalized Cationic Lipopolymer Based Multicomponent Nanomicelles for Lung&#8208;Targeting Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent nano&#8208;scaled micellar composite, Ac/Pc, consisting of catechin functionalized cationic lipopolymer (Pc) and serum albumin (Ac) is the focus of this work. The use of grafting catechins on polyelectrolyte macromolecules has resulted in the construction of a carrier with lung&#8208;targeted, effective delivery of catechins intracellularly, giving the carrier the properties of catechins, i.e., cancer cell&#8208;selective apoptosis&#8208;induction and normal cell protection. Cationic liposomes, Pc, tend to accumulate in the pulmonary microvasculature due to electrostatic effects, as well as are able to deliver the micellar system intracellularly. Albumin in the system acts as a biocompatible anti&#8208;plasma absorbent and can form complexes with positively charged Pc under electrostatic interactions, prolonging the in vivo retention time and reducing side effects.








Abstract
Catechins from green tea are one of the most effective natural compounds for cancer chemoprevention and have attracted extensive research. Cancer cell&#8208;selective apoptosis&#8208;inducing properties of catechins depend on efficient intracellular delivery. However, the low bioavailability limits the application of catechins. Herein, a nano&#8208;scaled micellar composite composed of catechin&#8208;functionalized cationic lipopolymer and serum albumin is constructed.

&lt;p&gt;A multicomponent nano-scaled micellar composite, Ac/Pc, consisting of catechin functionalized cationic lipopolymer (Pc) and serum albumin (Ac) is the focus of this work. The use of grafting catechins on polyelectrolyte macromolecules has resulted in the construction of a carrier with lung-targeted, effective delivery of catechins intracellularly, giving the carrier the properties of catechins, i.e., cancer cell-selective apoptosis-induction and normal cell protection. Cationic liposomes, Pc, tend to accumulate in the pulmonary microvasculature due to electrostatic effects, as well as are able to deliver the micellar system intracellularly. Albumin in the system acts as a biocompatible anti-plasma absorbent and can form complexes with positively charged Pc under electrostatic interactions, prolonging the in vivo retention time and reducing side effects.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catechins from green tea are one of the most effective natural compounds for cancer chemoprevention and have attracted extensive research. Cancer cell-selective apoptosis-inducing properties of catechins depend on efficient intracellular delivery. However, the low bioavailability limits the application of catechins. Herein, a nano-scaled micellar composite composed of catechin-functionalized cationic lipopolymer and serum albumin is constructed. Cationic liposomes tend to accumulate in the pulmonary microvasculature due to electrostatic effects and are able to deliver the micellar system intracellularly, thus improving the bioavailability of catechins. Albumin in the system acts as a biocompatible anti-plasma absorbent, forming complexes with positively charged lipopolymer under electrostatic interactions, contributing to prolonged in vivo retention. The physicochemical properties of the nano-micellar complexes are characterized, and the antitumor properties of catechin-functionalized materials are confirmed by reactive oxygen species (ROS), caspase-3, and cell apoptosis measurements. The role of each functional module, cationic polymeric liposome, and albumin is revealed by cell penetration, in vivo animal assays, etc. This multicomponent micellar nanocomposite has the potential to become an effective vehicle for the treatment of lung diseases such as pneumonia, lung tumors, sepsis-induced lung injury, etc. This study also demonstrates that it is a great strategy to create a delivery system that is both tissue-targeted and biologically active by combining cationic liposomes with the native bioactive compound catechins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Augmenting Immunotherapy via Bioinspired MOF&#8208;Based ROS Homeostasis Disruptor with Nanozyme&#8208;Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart nanozyme with multiple activities, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione oxidase, is designed to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors and activate host immunity through nanozyme&#8208;mediated cascade reactions. After synergy with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 blocking antibody, the outstanding efficacy of immunotherapy is acquired by the guide of tumor microenvironment&#8208;activated fluorescence imaging /1H/19F dual&#8208;nuclei magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Despite its remarkable clinical breakthroughs, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy remains limited by the insufficient immune response in the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor. Nanozyme&#8208;based antitumor catalysis is associated with precise immune activation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, a cascade&#8208;augmented nanoimmunomodulator (CMZM) with multienzyme&#8208;like activities, which includes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx), that dissociates under an acidic and abundant GSH TME, is proposed for multimodal imaging&#8208;guided chemodynamic therapy (CDT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT) enhanced immunotherapy. Vigorous multienzyme&#8208;like activities can not only produce O2 to alleviate hypoxia and promote the polarization of M2 to M1 macrophages, but also generate ROS (&#8226;OH and 1O2) and deplete GSH in the TME to expose necrotic cell fragments and reverse immunosuppressive TME by eliciting the maturation of dendritic cells and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors. Therefore, inhibitory effects on both primary and distant tumors are achieved through synergy with an &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 blocking antibody. This cascade multienzyme&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a smart strategy for highly efficient ICB immunotherapy against &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors by revising immunosuppressive TME.

         <title>Charge Density Wave Order and Electronic Phase Transitions in a Dilute d&#8208;Band Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The observation of charge density wave (CDW) order and a series of hysteretic phase transitions are reported in a dilute d&#8208;band semiconductor, BaTiS3. The combined experimental and theoretical investigations suggest the role of electron&#8211;phonon coupling and non&#8208;negligible electron&#8211;electron interactions. This work opens new opportunites for exploring CDW&#160;physics in the dilute filling limit and developing novel electronic devices.








Abstract
As one of the most fundamental physical phenomena, charge density wave (CDW) order predominantly occurs in metallic systems such as quasi&#8208;1D metals, doped cuprates, and transition metal dichalcogenides, where it is well understood in terms of Fermi surface nesting and electron&#8211;phonon coupling mechanisms. On the other hand, CDW phenomena in semiconducting systems, particularly at the low carrier concentration limit, are less common and feature intricate characteristics, which often necessitate the exploration of novel mechanisms, such as electron&#8211;hole coupling or Mott physics, to explain. In this study, an approach combining electrical transport, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and density&#8208;functional theory calculations is used to investigate CDW order and a series of hysteretic phase transitions in a dilute d&#8208;band semiconductor, BaTiS3. These experimental and theoretical findings suggest that the observed CDW order and phase transitions in BaTiS3 may be attributed to both electron&#8211;phonon coupling and non&#8208;negligible electron&#8211;electron interactions in the system. This work highlights BaTiS3 as a unique platform to explore CDW physics and novel electronic phases in the dilute filling limit and opens new opportunities for developing novel electronic devices.

         <title>Intermediates Regulation via Electron&#8208;Deficient Cu Sites for Selective Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu/Co0.85SeVSe nanosheets for catalyzing NO3RR are developed by introducing Cu dopants and Se vacancies into Cu0.85Se to efficiently enhance electron transfer from Cu to Co through the bridging Se atoms, leading to the formation of deficient electronic Cu sites that accelerate NO3&#8722; dissociation and eventually facilitate the NO3RR process.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3), known as one of the fundamental raw materials for manufacturing commodities such as chemical fertilizers, dyes, ammunitions, pharmaceuticals, and textiles, exhibits a high hydrogen storage capacity of &#8776;17.75%. Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3RR) to valuable ammonia at ambient conditions is a promising strategy to facilitate the artificial nitrogen cycle. Herein, copper&#8208;doped cobalt selenide nanosheets with selenium vacancies are reported as a robust and highly efficient electrocatalyst for the reduction of nitrate to ammonia, exhibiting a maximum Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;93.5% and an ammonia yield rate of 2360&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.60&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The in situ spectroscopical and theoretical study demonstrates that the incorporation of Cu dopants and Se vacancies into cobalt selenide efficiently enhances the electron transfer from Cu to Co atoms via the bridging Se atoms, forming the electron&#8208;deficient structure at Cu sites to accelerate NO3&#8722; dissociation and stabilize the *NO2 intermediates, eventually achieving selective catalysis in the entire NO3RR process to produce ammonia efficiently.

         <title>Marriage of High&#8208;Throughput Gradient Surface Generation With Statistical Learning for the Rational Design of Functionalized Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the marriage of gradient surface generation with statistical learning, a strategy of biomaterial rational design is developed. The parameter combinations are screened in a high&#8208;throughput fashion, and the optimal conditions beyond the experimentally tested range are extrapolated. Subsequently, an unprecedented ternary functionalized surface is designed for orthopedic implant, with optimal osteogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic activities.








Abstract
Functional biomaterial is already an important aspect in modern therapeutics; yet, the design of novel multi&#8208;functional biomaterial is still a challenging task nowadays. When several biofunctional components are present, the complexity that arises from their combinations and interactions will lead to tedious trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening. In this work, a novel strategy of biomaterial rational design through the marriage of gradient surface generation with statistical learning is presented. Not only can parameter combinations be screened in a high&#8208;throughput fashion, but also the optimal conditions beyond the experimentally tested range can be extrapolated from the models. The power of the strategy is demonstrated in rationally designing an unprecedented ternary functionalized surface for orthopedic implant, with optimal osteogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic activities, and its optimality and the best osteointegration promotion are confirmed in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The presented strategy is expected to open up new possibilities in the rational design of biomaterials.

         <title>Layered Inorganic Silicate Aerogel Pillared by Nanoclusters for High Temperature Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared with nanoclusters has been developed for high temperature thermal insulation. The well dispersed and strong coupled nanocluster pillars in the interlayers not only significantly decrease the solid thermal conductivity but also maintain the layered structure under high temperatures.








Abstract
Layered inorganic material, with large&#8208;area interlayer surface and interface, provides an essential material platform for constructing new configuration of functional materials. Herein, a layered material pillared with nanoclusters realizing high temperature thermal insulation performance is demonstrated for the first time. Specifically, systematic synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and finite element calculation analysis show that ZrOx nanoclusters served as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to effectively produce porous structures with enough boundary defect while maintaining the layered structure, thereby significantly reducing solid state thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.32&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 298&#8211;573&#160;K). Moreover, the layered inorganic silicate material assembled aerogel also exhibits superior thermal insulation performance from room temperature (0.034&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 298&#160;K, air conditions) to high temperature (0.187&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 1073&#160;K, air conditions) and largely enhanced compressive strength (42&#160;kPa at 80% compression), which is the best layered material&#8208;based aerogel that has achieved synergistic improvement in thermal and mechanical performance so far. Layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared by nanoclusters will pave a new avenue for the design of advanced thermal insulation materials under extreme conditions.

         <title>Bioactivable STING Nanoagonists to Synergize NIR&#8208;II Mild Photothermal Therapy Primed Robust and Long&#8208;Term Anticancer Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extracellular matrix anchoring stimulator of interferon genes agonist&#8208;based photoimmunothernostic nanomedicine is developed, which can be activated by NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided mild photothermal therapy&#8208;induced neutrophilic inflammation. In orthotopic breast tumors, this strategy leads to the mice regaining tumor&#8208;free survival of at least 2 months. In addition, the immune&#8208;mediated abscopal effect shows inhibition of the distant solid tumor growth.








Abstract
Pharmacological activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has become a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy. However, the insufficient tumorous accumulation, rapid clearance, and short duration of drug efficacy in the tumor microenvironment of small structural STING agonists greatly compromise the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a tumorous extracellular matrix (ECM) is presented anchoring STING agonist&#8208;based photoimmunothernostic nanomedicine (SAPTN) that can be activated by mild&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (mild PTT) induced neutrophilic inflammation. The SAPTN owns second window near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photonics properties fitting for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapy. The aggregates SAPTN targeting to the ECM provide slow and continuous release of potent STING agonists diABZIs. The mild PTT and long&#8208;lasting STING agonists released in the ECM synergistically&#160;prime systematic, robust, and long&#8208;term anticancer immunity. In a tumor model, this approach leads to complete tumor eradication in about 100% of mice with orthotopic breast tumors, and the mice regained tumor&#8208;free survival of at least 2 months. In addition, the immune&#8208;mediated abscopal effect shows inhibition of the distant solid tumor growth by intratumoral administration of SAPTN with laser irradiation. Overall, this approach represents a generalized photoactivable nanomedicine to prime anticancer immunity for improved cancer theranostics.

         <title>Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Polymer Dielectric Constant and Loss via Aluminum Oxo Macrocycle Dopants for High&#8208;Performance Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping the polymer dielectrics with structurally precise Aluminum Oxo Macrocycles successfully breaks the inherent trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss. The resulting hybrid dielectrics enable high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors, ultralow power synapses (0.9&#160;fJ&#160;spike&#8722;1) with photoelectric synergistic modulation, and flexible artificial neuromorphic retinas capable of recognizing handwritten numbers with a high accuracy of 91.15% via in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing.








Abstract
The dielectric layer is crucial in regulating the overall performance of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), the key component in central processing units, sensors, and displays. Despite considerable efforts being devoted to developing high&#8208;permittivity (k) dielectrics, limited progress is made due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss. Here, a solution is presented by designing a monodispersed disk&#8208;shaped Ce&#8211;Al&#8211;O&#8208;macrocycle as a dopant in polymer dielectrics. The molecule features a central Ce(III) core connected with eight Al atoms through sixteen bridging hydroxyls and eight 3&#8208;aminophenyl peripheries. The incorporation of this macrocycle in polymer dielectrics results in an up to sevenfold increase in dielectric constants and up to 89% reduction in dielectric loss at low frequencies. Moreover, the leakage&#8208;current densities decrease, and the breakdown strengths are improved by 63%. Relying on the above merits, FETs bearing cluster&#8208;doped polymer dielectrics give near three&#8208;orders source&#8208;drain current increments while maintaining low&#8208;level leakage/off currents, resulting in much higher charge&#8208;carrier mobilities (up to 2.45&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) and on/off ratios. This cluster&#8208;doping strategy is generalizable and shows great promise for ultralow&#8208;power photoelectric synapses and neuromorphic retinas. This work successfully breaks the trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss and offers a unique design for polymer composite dielectrics.

         <title>Recent Progress in Functional Nanomaterials towards the Storage, Separation, and Removal of Tritium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tritium is a prime fuel to generate fusion power, but its storage and separation in pure form are major challenges in nuclear industries. This review discusses recent progress and main research trends in hydrogen isotope storage and separation while emphasizing tritium using metal hydrides, nanoporous zeolites, and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and 2&#8208;D layered graphene, h&#8208;BN, and MXenes based on their diverse functionalities.








Abstract
Tritium is a sustainable next&#8208;generation prime fuel for generating nuclear energy through fusion reactions to fulfill the increasing global energy demand. Owing to the scarcity&#8211;high demand tradeoff, tritium must be bred inside a fusion reactor to ensure sustainability and must therefore be separated from its isotopes (protium and deuterium) in pure form, stored safely, and supplied on demand. Existing multistage isotope separation technologies exhibit low separation efficiency and require intensive energy inputs and large capital investments. Furthermore, tritium&#8208;contaminated heavy water constitutes a major fraction of nuclear waste, and accidents like the one at Fukushima Daiichi leave behind thousands of tons of diluted tritiated water, whose removal is beneficial from an environmental point of view. In this review, the recent progress and main research trends in hydrogen isotope storage and separation by focusing on the use of metal hydride (e.g., intermetallic, and high&#8208;entropy alloys), porous (e.g., zeolites and metal organic frameworks (MOFs)), and 2&#8208;D layered (e.g., graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), and MXenes) materials to separate and store tritium based on their diverse functionalities are discussed. Finally, the challenges and future directions for implementing tritium storage and separation are summarized in the reviewed materials.

         <title>Cellular Membrane&#8208;Engineered Nanovesicles as a Three&#8208;Stage Booster to Target&#160;the Lesion Core</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For targeted delivery to the lesion core of injured myocardium, a cellular membrane&#8208;engineered nanovesicle (CMEV) is constructed by integrating a neutrophil membrane, specific antibody, and gelled drug&#8208;loaded core as a three&#8208;stage booster. CMEV enhances the efficacy of catestatin in improving cardiomyocyte apoptosis, excessive fibrosis, macrophage polarization, and angiogenesis. Thus, CMEV significantly ameliorates cardiac function and adverse remodeling to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy.








Abstract
The lesion core is the area with the most serious injury and vigorous repair. Existing nanocarriers are difficult to break through the targeted delivery to the lesion core for precise treatment in the intracellular and extracellular microenvironment. Herein, a cellular membrane&#8208;engineered nanovesicle (CMEV) with a hierarchical structure is constructed using the double emulsion&#8208;extrusion method by integrating a neutrophil membrane, functional antibody, and gelled drug&#8208;loaded core as a three&#8208;stage booster to target the lesion core and deliver catestatin (CST), a small therapeutic peptide, for ischemic cardiomyopathy therapy. By coating the neutrophil membrane outside the shell, CMEV is endowed with the function of neutrophil&#8208;like migration to achieve the first stage of tissue targeting. Based on the specific anchoring to injured myocardium, a myosin light chain 3 (MLC3) antibody is embedded to fulfill the second stage of CMEV accumulation in the lesion core.

&lt;p&gt;For targeted delivery to the lesion core of injured myocardium, a cellular membrane-engineered nanovesicle (CMEV) is constructed by integrating a neutrophil membrane, specific antibody, and gelled drug-loaded core as a three-stage booster. CMEV enhances the efficacy of catestatin in improving cardiomyocyte apoptosis, excessive fibrosis, macrophage polarization, and angiogenesis. Thus, CMEV significantly ameliorates cardiac function and adverse remodeling to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesion core is the area with the most serious injury and vigorous repair. Existing nanocarriers are difficult to break through the targeted delivery to the lesion core for precise treatment in the intracellular and extracellular microenvironment. Herein, a cellular membrane-engineered nanovesicle (CMEV) with a hierarchical structure is constructed using the double emulsion-extrusion method by integrating a neutrophil membrane, functional antibody, and gelled drug-loaded core as a three-stage booster to target the lesion core and deliver catestatin (CST), a small therapeutic peptide, for ischemic cardiomyopathy therapy. By coating the neutrophil membrane outside the shell, CMEV is endowed with the function of neutrophil-like migration to achieve the first stage of tissue targeting. Based on the specific anchoring to injured myocardium, a myosin light chain 3 (MLC3) antibody is embedded to fulfill the second stage of CMEV accumulation in the lesion core. The gelled core containing CST-sodium alginate (NaAlg) with a pH-responsive shell is prepared by ionic cross-linking to accomplish the third stage of precise CST administration. Triggered by the microenvironment, NaAlg electrostatically adheres to the lesion core for sustained release, enhancing the efficacy of CST in improving cardiomyocyte apoptosis, excessive fibrosis, macrophage polarization, and angiogenesis. Thus, the &#8220;three-stage booster&#8221; nanovesicle significantly ameliorates cardiac function and adverse remodeling to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Targeted Exosome Therapeutic Confers Both CfDNA Scavenging and Macrophage Polarization for Ameliorating Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel therapeutic MEX+cP is constructed by utilizing M2 macrophage&#8208;derived exosome as a chassis, which is modified with oligolysine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;cleavable polyethylene glycol. After intravenous injection into a collagen&#8208;induced arthritis (CIA) animal model, MEX+cP enriches at inflamed joints, wherein MMP cleavage exposes MEX+ to exert both cfDNA scavenging and M1&#8208;to&#8208;M2 polarization for efficiently ameliorating CIA.








Abstract
Only a minority of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients achieve disease remission, so the exploration of additional pathogenic factors and the development of new therapeutics are needed. Here, strong correlations among the cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) level and the inflammatory response in clinical synovial fluid samples and RA disease activity are discovered. The important role of cfDNA in disease development in a collagen&#8208;induced arthritis (CIA) murine model is also demonstrated. Building on these findings, a novel therapeutic based on anti&#8208;inflammatory (M2) macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes as chassis, that are modified with both oligolysine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;cleavable polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the membrane, is developed. After intravenous injection, PEG&#8208;enabled prolonged circulation and C&#9472;C motif chemokine ligand&#8208;directed accumulation together result in enrichment at inflamed joints. Following subsequent MMP cleavage, the positively charged oligolysine is exposed for cfDNA scavenging, while exosomes induce M2 polarization. By using a classical CIA murine model and a newly established CIA canine model, it is demonstrated that the rationally designed exosome therapeutic substantially suppresses inflammation in joints and provides strong chondroprotection and osteoprotection, revealing its potential for effective CIA amelioration.

         <title>Introducing a Phenyl End Group in the Inner Side Chains of A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A Acceptors Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Processed with Nonhalogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new small molecule acceptors Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph with phenyl&#8208;alkyl inner side chains are synthesized. The results show that the phenyl&#8208;alkyl side chains can suppress the molecular excessive aggregation and make the molecular packing more orderly under the long&#8208;time film&#8208;forming process with nonhalogenated solvents processing. Therefore, the L8&#8208;Ph&#8208;based organic solar cells processed by o&#8208;xylene achieve a high power conversion efficiency of 18.40%.








Abstract
Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) processed by nonhalogenated solvents is unsatisfactory due to the unfavorable morphology. Herein, two new small molecule acceptors&#160;(SMAs) Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph are synthesized by introducing a phenyl end group in the inner side chains of the SMAs of Y6 and L8&#8208;BO, respectively, for overcoming the excessive aggregation of SMAs in the long&#8208;time film forming processed by nonhalogenated solvents. First, the effect of the film forming time on the aggregation property and photovoltaic performance of Y6, L8&#8208;BO, Y6&#8208;Ph, and L8&#8208;Ph is studied by using the commonly used solvents: chloroform (CF) (rapid film forming process) and chlorobenzene (CB) (slow film forming process). It is&#160;found that Y6&#8208; and L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs exhibit a dramatic drop in PCE&#160;from CF&#8208; to CB&#8208;processed devices owing to the large phase separation, while the Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph based OSCs show obviously increased PCEs Furthermore, L8&#8208;Ph&#8208;based OSCs processed by nonhalogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) achieved a high PCE of 18.40% with an FF of 80.11%. The results indicate that introducing a phenyl end group in the inner side chains is an effective strategy to modulate the morphology and improve the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs processed by nonhalogenated solvents.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Spatial Confinement in Immune Cell Recruitment and Regeneration of Skin Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that spatial confinement within microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels (130 &#181;m) promote a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.








Abstract
Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are injectable granular materials comprised of micron sized hydrogel particles (microgels). The diameter of these microgels directly determines the size of the interconnected void space between particles where infiltrating or encapsulated cells reside. This tunable porosity allows the authors to use MAP scaffolds to study the impact of spatial confinement (SC) on both cellular behaviors and the host response to biomaterials. Despite previous studies showing that pore size and SC influence cellular phenotypes, including mitigating macrophage inflammatory response, there is still a gap in knowledge regarding how SC within a biomaterial modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. Thus, the immune cell profile within confined and unconfined biomaterials is studied using small (40&#160;&#181;m), medium (70&#160;&#181;m), and large (130&#160;&#181;m) diameter spherical microgels, respectively. This work uncovered that MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels promote a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.

         <title>The State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Solution&#8208;Processed Single Component Organic Photodetectors Achieved by Strong Quenching of Intermolecular Emissive State and High Quadrupole Moment in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient solution&#8208;processed single&#8208;component organic photodetectors using non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with strong donor/acceptor character are demonstrated. Efficient photocurrent generation is achieved via strong quenching of intermolecular charge transfer excitonic (CTE) states by electric field and CTE dissociation due to large interfacial energetic offset induced by high quadrupole moments of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors.








Abstract
A bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) blend is commonly used as the photoactive layer in organic photodetectors (OPDs) to utilize the donor (D)/acceptor (A) interfacial energetic offset for exciton dissociation. However, this strategy often complicates optimization procedures, raising serious concerns over device processability, reproducibility, and stability. Herein, highly efficient OPDs fabricated with single&#8208;component organic semiconductors are demonstrated via solution&#8208;processing. The non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with strong intrinsic D/A character are used as the photoactive layer, where the emissive intermolecular charge transfer excitonic (CTE) states are formed within &lt;1&#160;ps, and efficient photocurrent generation is achieved via strong quenching of these CTE states by reverse bias. Y6 and IT&#8208;4F&#8208;based OPDs show excellent OPD performances, low dark current density (&#8776;10&#8722;9 A cm&#8722;2), high responsivity (&#8805;0.15 A W&#8722;1), high specific detectivity (&gt;1012 Jones), and fast photo&#8208;response time (&lt;10 &#181;s), comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art BHJ OPDs. Together with strong CTE state quenching by electric field, these excellent OPD performances are also attributed to the high quadrupole moments of NFA molecules, which can lead to large interfacial energetic offset for efficient CTE dissociation. This work opens a new way to realize efficient OPDs using single&#8208;component systems via solution&#8208;processing and provides important molecular design rules.

         <title>Regulating Isolated&#8208;Molecular and Aggregated&#8208;State Phosphorescence for Multicolor Afterglow by Photoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general principle is proposed to design color&#8208;tunable phosphorescence with isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated&#8208;state emitting centers. The isolated&#8208;molecular phosphorescence lifetime in 1,3,6,8&#8208;pyrene tetra sulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (PTA)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) film can reach 1735.71 ms with minimal influence on aggregated&#8208;state phosphorescence after photo&#8208;activation. Moreover, multi&#8208;color afterglow display, ultraviolet detection, and multilevel information encryption are demonstrated based on these materials.








Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Herein, a new type of flexible films is fabricated by doping amphipathic pyrene tetrasulfonic acid sodium salts into amorphous poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix, which enables the realization of color&#8208;tunable UOP spanning from orange&#8208;red to green after excitation light is switched off. Interestingly, precise control of the proportion of isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated&#8208;state phosphorescence is demonstrated for colorful afterglow using photo&#8208;activation. An increase in the dynamic phosphorescence lifetime of isolated molecules is observed from 894.75 to 1735.71 ms following an 8 min irradiation under ambient conditions. The photo&#8208;activation, however, showed little influence on aggreated&#8208;state phosphorescence. This flexible and processable film exhibits versatile applications in multicolor afterglow displays, ultraviolet detection, multilevel information encryption, etc. This study not only provides a strategy for the rational regulation of UOP colors but also expands the application potential of color&#8208;tunable UOP materials.

         <title>Suppression of Interphase Dissolution Via Solvent Molecule Tuning for Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;solvation and thermal&#8208;stable electrolyte is proposed for highly reliable sodium metal batteries via solvent molecule tuning, which induces a low solubility interphase and tailored solvation sheath of Na+ ions. These synergistically minimize the dissolution of solid electrolyte interphase, self&#8208;discharge, and passivate the hyper&#8208;active metallic Na anode at both room and high temperatures.








Abstract
Solvent molecule tuning is used to alter the redox potentials of solvents or ion&#8208;solvent binding energy for high&#8208;voltage or low&#8208;temperature electrolytes. Herein, an electrolyte design strategy that effectively suppresses solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dissolution and passivates highly&#8208;reactive metallic Na anode via solvent molecule tuning is proposed. With rationally lengthened phosphate backbones with &#9472;CH2&#9472; units, the low&#8208;solvation tris(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (TOP) molecule effectively weakens the solvation ability of carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, reduces the free solvent ratio, and enables an anion&#8208;enriched primary Na+ ion solvation sheath. The decreased free solvent and compact lower&#8208;solubility interphase established in this electrolyte prevent electrodes from continuous SEI dissolution and parasitic reactions at both room temperature (RT) and high temperature (HT). As a result, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 cell with the new electrolyte achieves impressive cycling stability of 95.7% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 25 &#176;C and 62.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the TOP&#160;molecule not only maintains the nonflammable feature of phosphate but also attains higher thermal stability, which endows the electrolyte with high safety and thermal stability. This design concept for electrolytes offers a promising path to long&#8208;cycling and high&#8208;safety&#160;sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Natural Wood&#8208;Derived Macroporous Cellulose for Highly Efficient and Ultrafast Elimination of Double&#8208;Stranded RNA from In Vitro&#8208;Transcribed mRNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a highly efficient and ultrafast method for dsRNA elimination using natural wood&#8208;derived macroporous cellulose (WMC). Scalable mRNA purification can be also achieved by integrating a WMC&#8208;filled column with fast&#8208;protein liquid chromoatography. WMC purification improves the enhanced green fluorescent protein&#160;mRNA expression efficiency and significantly reduces cytokine secretion and innate immune responses in the cells.








Abstract
Double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a major impurity that can induce innate immune responses and cause adverse drug reactions. Removing dsRNA is an essential and non&#8208;trivial process in manufacturing mRNA. Current methods for dsRNA elimination use either high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography or microcrystalline cellulose, rendering the process complex, expensive, toxic, and/or time&#8208;consuming. This study introduces a highly efficient and ultrafast method for dsRNA elimination using natural wood&#8208;derived macroporous cellulose (WMC). With a naturally formed large total pore area and low tortuosity, WMC removes up to 98% dsRNA within 5&#160;min. This significantly shortens the time for mRNA purification and improves purification efficiency. WMC can also be filled into chromatographic columns of different sizes and integrates with fast&#8208;protein liquid chromatography for large&#8208;scale mRNA purification to meet the requirements of mRNA manufacture. This study further shows that WMC purification improves the enhanced green fluorescent protein mRNA expression efficiency by over 28% and significantly reduces cytokine secretion and innate immune responses in the cells. Successfully applying WMC provides an ultrafast and efficient platform for mRNA purification, enabling large&#8208;scale production with significant cost reduction.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer&#8211;Liquid Metal Composite: Ultrafast, Untethered, and Programmable Actuation by Induction Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The liquid crystal elastomer&#8211;liquid metal (LCE&#8208;LM) composite consists of LM embedded between LCE layers enabling ultrafast, reversible, and programmable actuation by eddy current induction heating. It integrates selective and sequential heating functions that are further exploited for multimodal pop&#8208;up deformation, on&#8208;ground omnidirectional robotic motion, and in&#8208;water object manipulation and crawling.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that have been intensively studied for applications including artificial muscles, shape morphing structures, and soft robotics due to their capability of large, programmable, and fully reversible actuation strains. To fully take advantage of LCEs, rapid, untethered, and programmable actuation methods are highly desirable. Here, a liquid crystal elastomer&#8208;liquid metal (LCE&#8208;LM) composite is reported, which enables ultrafast and programmable actuations by eddy current induction heating. The composite consists of LM sandwiched between two LCE layers printed via direct ink writing (DIW). When subjected to a high&#8208;frequency alternating magnetic field, the composite is actuated in milliseconds. By moving the magnetic field, the eddy current is spatially controlled for selective actuation. Additionally, sequential actuation is achievable by programming the LM thickness distribution in a sample. With these capabilities, the LCE&#8208;LM composite is further exploited for multimodal deformation of a pop&#8208;up structure, on&#8208;ground omnidirectional robotic motion, and in&#8208;water targeted object manipulation and crawling.

         <title>Ultrasonic Field Induces Better Crystallinity and Abundant Defects at Grain Boundaries to Develop CuS Electromagnetic Wave Absorber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrasonic induced&#8208;cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at grain boundaries. As a result, the CuS with nitrate precursor under USF (UNCu) shows the optimum effective absorption bandwidth of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is 228.6% more than the WUNCu (absence of USF).








Abstract
Ultrasonic field (USF) is widely used to regulate the intrinsic properties of materials that are not applied in electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption. One reason is that the lack of a response mechanism for the materials to USF hinders the expansion of their EMW absorption performance. Therefore, to address this issue, a series of CuS nanoparticles with diverse anions are&#160;constructed in the presence or absence of USF. The ultrasonic&#8208;induced cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at the grain boundaries (GBs). Furthermore, the S defects at the GBs are&#160;easily oriented and arranged, allowing the polarization relaxation retention to be maintained at 10&#160;wt%. Consequently, the CuS with a nitrate precursor under USF shows an optimum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is&#160;228.6% more than that without the USF. CuS with a chloride precursor also achieves an EAB of 3.92&#160;GHz, even at a considerably low filler ratio. Thus, this&#160;study demonstrates the response mechanism of diverse anions to the USF for the first time and provides a novel technique to optimize the EMW absorption performance of semiconductors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrasonic field (USF) is widely used to regulate the intrinsic properties of materials that are not applied in electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption. One reason is that the lack of a response mechanism for the materials to USF hinders the expansion of their EMW absorption performance. Therefore, to address this issue, a series of CuS nanoparticles with diverse anions are&#160;constructed in the presence or absence of USF. The ultrasonic-induced cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at the grain boundaries (GBs). Furthermore, the S defects at the GBs are&#160;easily oriented and arranged, allowing the polarization relaxation retention to be maintained at 10&#160;wt%. Consequently, the CuS with a nitrate precursor under USF shows an optimum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is&#160;228.6% more than that without the USF. CuS with a chloride precursor also achieves an EAB of 3.92&#160;GHz, even at a considerably low filler ratio. Thus, this&#160;study demonstrates the response mechanism of diverse anions to the USF for the first time and provides a novel technique to optimize the EMW absorption performance of semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Operational Stability by Cavity Control of Single&#8208;Layer Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy to improve the operational stability of single&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence is introduced by increasing the emissive layer thickness to the second&#8208;order interference maximum, leading to devices with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 16% and LT50 at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 close to 90&#160;000&#160;h.








Abstract
Highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are realized in recent years, but the device lifetime needs further improvement for practical display or lighting applications. In this work, a device design principle is presented by tuning the optical cavity of single&#8208;layer undoped devices, to realize efficient and long&#8208;lived TADF OLEDs. Extending the cavity length to the second&#8208;order interference maximum by increasing the emissive layer thickness broadens the recombination zone, while the optical outcoupling efficiency remains close to that of the thinner first&#8208;order devices. Such a device design leads to efficient and stable single&#8208;layer undoped OLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 16%, an LT90 of 452&#160;h, and an LT50 of 3693&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which is doubled compared to the first&#8208;order counterparts. It is further demonstrated that the widely&#8208;used empirical relation between OLED lifetime and light intensity originates from triplet&#8211;polaron annihilation, resulting in an extrapolated LT50 at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 of close to 90&#160;000&#160;h, approaching the demands for practical backlight applications.

         <title>Isomerized Green Solid Additive Engineering for Thermally Stable and Eco&#8208;Friendly All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Approaching 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isomerized solid additive engineering based on volatile dithienothiophene (DTT) isomers is empolyed to achieve a remarkable PCE of 18.72% for all&#8208;PSCs processed with green solvent. More importantly, the all&#8208;PSCs fabricated with this approach offer excellent compatibility with large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating techniques, and demonstrate exceptional thermal stability with extrapolated T80 lifetime of 14&#160;000&#160;h.








Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;scale all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have exhibited remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 19%. However, the utilization of hazardous solvents and nonvolatile liquid additives poses challenges for eco&#8208;friendly commercialization, resulting in&#160;the trade&#8208;off between device efficiency and operation stability. Herein, an innovative approach based on isomerized solid additive engineering is proposed, employing volatile dithienothiophene (DTT) isomers to modulate intermolecular interactions and facilitate molecular stacking within the photoactive layers. Through elucidating the underlying principles of the DTT&#8208;induced polymer assembly on molecular level, a PCE of 18.72% is achieved for devices processed with environmentally benign solvents, ranking it among the highest record values for eco&#8208;friendly all&#8208;PSCs. Significantly, such superiorities of the DTT&#8208;isomerized strategy afford excellent compatibility with large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating techniques, offering a promising pathway for industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing of all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, these devices demonstrate enhanced thermal stability with a promising extrapolated T80 lifetime of 14&#160;000&#160;h, further bolstering their potential for sustainable technological advancement.

         <title>Wet&#8208;Adaptive Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wet&#8208;adaptive electronic skin (WADE&#8208;skin) is developed, which consists of a next&#8208;to&#8208;skin wet&#8208;adhesive fibrous layer, a next&#8208;to&#8208;air waterproof fibrous layer, and a stretchable and permeable liquid metal electrode layer. This WADE&#8208;skin simultaneously achieves superb stretchability, wet adhesion, permeability, biocompatibility, and waterproof property, enabling stable device performance and comfortable wearing for underwater electrocardiogram detection and human&#8208;machine interactions.








Abstract
Skin electronics provides remarkable opportunities for non&#8208;invasive and long&#8208;term monitoring of a wide variety of biophysical and physiological signals that are closely related to health, medicine, and human&#8208;machine interactions. Nevertheless, conventional skin electronics fabricated on elastic thin films are difficult to adapt to the wet microenvironments of the skin: Elastic thin films are non&#8208;permeable, which block the skin perspiration; Elastic thin films are difficult to adhere to wet skin; Most skin electronics are difficult to work underwater. Here, a Wet&#8208;Adaptive Electronic Skin (WADE&#8208;skin) is reported, which consists of a next&#8208;to&#8208;skin wet&#8208;adhesive fibrous layer, a next&#8208;to&#8208;air waterproof fibrous layer, and a stretchable and permeable liquid metal electrode layer. While the electronic functionality is determined by the electrode design, this WADE&#8208;skin simultaneously offers superb stretchability, wet adhesion, permeability, biocompatibility, and waterproof property. The WADE&#8208;skin can rapidly adhere to human skin after contact for a few seconds and stably maintain the adhesion over weeks even under wet conditions, without showing any negative effect to the skin health. The use of WADE&#8208;skin is demonstrated for the stable recording of electrocardiogram during intensive sweating as well as underwater activities, and as the strain sensor for the underwater operation of virtual reality&#8208;mediated human&#8208;machine interactions.

         <title>Regulating Lithium Transfer Pathway to Avoid Capacity Fading of Nano Si Through Sub&#8208;Nano Scale Interfused SiOx/C Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SiOx/C coating has electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility, enabling a fast and stable lithium diffusion pathway towards encapsulated Si. A fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration distinction are realized, endowing the obtained Si@SiOx/C composite anode material with a high capacity and prolonged lifespan.








Abstract
Si nanoparticles (NPs) are considered as a promising high&#8208;capacity anode material owing to their ability to prevent mechanical failure from drastic volume change during (de)lithiation. However, upon cycling, a quick capacity fading is still observed for Si NPs, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this contribution, it is demonstrated that the quick capacity fading is mainly caused by the generation of dead (electrochemically inert) Si with blocked electron conductivity in a densely composited Si/SEI (solid electrolyte interface) hybrid. This is due to the combined influence of electrolyte&#8208;related side reactions and the accompanied agglomeration of Si NPs. A compact, sub&#8208;nano scale interfused SiOx/C composite coating onto the Si NPs is constructed, and a highly stabilized electrochemistry is achieved upon long cycling. The SiOx/C coating with electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility enables a fast and stable lithium ion/electron dual diffusion pathway towards the encapsulated Si. With fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration feature, the obtained Si@SiOx/C composite demonstrates a stable high capacity. This work unravels new perspectives on the capacity fading of Si NPs and provides an effective encapsulating method to remedy the structure degradation and capacity fading of nano Si.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Conversion of Photodetector and Neuromorphic Vision Sensor via Bias Voltage Regulation on a Single Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trench&#8208;bridged GaN/Ga2O3/GaN device is fabricated. According to the manipulation of the ionization and de&#8208;ionization processe of oxygen vacancies within the Ga2O3, the device shows fast photoresponse at low voltages and persistent photoconductivity behavior at high voltages. Accordingly, various functions of the photodetector and neuromorphic vision sensor are achieved by one device and switched via bias voltage regulation.








Abstract
Simultaneous implementation of photodetector and neuromorphic vision sensor (NVS) on a single device faces a great challenge, due to the inherent speed discrepancy in their photoresponse characteristics. In this work, a trench&#8208;bridged GaN/Ga2O3/GaN back&#8208;to&#8208;back double heterojunction array device is fabricated to enable the advanced functionalities of both devices on a single device. Interestingly, the device shows fast photoresponse and persistent photoconductivity behavior at low and high voltages, respectively, through the modulation of oxygen vacancy ionization and de&#8208;ionization processes in Ga2O3. Consequently, the role of the optoelectronic device can be altered between the photodetector and NVS by simply adjusting the magnitude of bias voltage. As a photodetector, the device is able to realize fast optical imaging and optical communication functions. On the other hand, the device exhibits outstanding image sensing, image memory, and neuromorphic visual pre&#8208;processing as an NVS. The utilization of NVS for image pre&#8208;processing leads to a noticeable enhancement in both recognition accuracy and efficiency. The results presented in this work not only offer a new avenue to obtain complex functionality on a single optoelectronic device but also provide opportunities to implement advanced robotic vision systems and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>KERS&#8208;Inspired Nanostructured Mineral Coatings Boost IFN&#8208;&#947; mRNA Therapeutic Index for Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytokines play an important role in tumor immunotherapy but are easily degraded. Inspired by kinetic energy recovery systems in hybrid vehicles, a cytokine efficacy recovery system is designed to substantially augment the therapeutic index of mRNA&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy via a &#8220;capture and stabilize&#8221; mechanism exerted by a nanostructured mineral coating carrying therapeutic cytokine mRNA.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM) reprogramming is a promising therapeutic approach for cancer immunotherapy; however, its efficacy remains modest due to the low bioactivity of the recombinant cytokines used for TAM reprogramming. mRNA therapeutics are capable of generating fully functional proteins for various therapeutic purposes but accused for its poor sustainability. Inspired by kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS) in hybrid vehicles, a cytokine efficacy recovery system (CERS) is designed to substantially augment the therapeutic index of mRNA&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy via a &#8220;capture and stabilize&#8221; mechanism exerted by a nanostructured mineral coating carrying therapeutic cytokine mRNA. CERS remarkably recycles nearly 40% expressed cytokines by capturing them onto the mineral coating to extend its therapeutic timeframe, further polarizing the macrophages to strengthen their tumoricidal activity and activate adaptive immunity against tumors. Notably, interferon&#8208;&#947; (IFN&#8208;&#947;) produced by CERS exhibits &#8776;42&#8208;fold higher biological activity than recombinant IFN&#8208;&#947;, remarkably decreasing the required IFN&#8208;&#947; dosage for TAM reprogramming. In tumor&#8208;bearing mice, IFN&#8208;&#947; cmRNA@CERS effectively polarizes TAMs to inhibit osteosarcoma progression. When combined with the PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody, IFN&#8208;&#947; cmRNA@CERS significantly boosts antitumor immune responses, and substantially prevents malignant lung metastases. Thus, CERS&#8208;mediated mRNA delivery represents a promising strategy to boost antitumor immunity for tumor treatment.

         <title>A &#8220;Trinity&#8221; Design of Li&#8208;O2 Battery Engaging the Slow&#8208;Release Capsule of Redox Mediators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of Li&#8208;O2 battery is initiated by employing hollow cobalt metal organic frameworks impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously for cathode catalyst, anode protection, and slow&#8208;release redox mediators (RM). Mechanistic investigations assert the critical role of RM&#8208;mediated solution growth of crystalline Li2O2 to greatly boost both the capacity and cycling reversibility.








Abstract
Nonaqueous Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) represents one of the promising next&#8208;gen energy storage solutions owing to its ultrahigh energy density but suffers from problems such as high charging overpotential, slow redox kinetics, Li anode corrosion, etc., calling for a systemic optimization of the battery configuration and structural components. Herein, an ingenious &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of LOB is initiated by implementing a hollowed cobalt metal organic framework (MOF) impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously as the cathode catalyst, anode protection layer, and slow&#8208;release capsule of redox mediators, so as to systemically address issues of impeded mass transport and redox kinetics on the cathode, dendrite growth, and surface corrosion on the anode, as well as limited intermediate solubility in the low donor&#8208;number (DN) solvent. As a result of the systemic effort, the LOB constructed demonstrates an ultralow discharge/charge polarization of 0.2&#160;V, prolonged cycle life of 1244&#160;h and total discharge capacity of 28.41&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic investigations attribute the superb LOB performance to the redox&#8208;mediated solution growth mechanism of crystalline Li2O2 with both enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility. This study offers a paradigm in designing smart materials to raise the performance bar of Li&#8208;O2 battery toward realistic applications.

         <title>Processable Hydroxide Ink with Oriented Microstructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pinpoints the inner relationship between the microstructure and rheology as well as the mechanical engineering, achieving the fabrication of hydroxide production including continuous fiber, meter&#8208;level film, and free&#8208;standing aerogel. Also, the enlarge&#8208;batch fabrication (capacity of 10&#160;L) of hydroxide is successfully executed, paving the way for further practical application of hydroxide&#8208;based production in the foreseeable future.








Abstract
The intrinsic poor processability of hydroxide originating from the structural property greatly hinders their practical applications. Here, a processable highly&#8208;concentrated nickel/cobalt double hydroxide ink is reported to meet the practical demand. The inner nanoflakes in ink possess a high width/thickness ratio (&gt;100), which endows the highly&#8208;concentrated ink (60&#160;mg&#160;mL&#8722;1) with liquid&#8208;like rheology properties. Further, the elliptical diffusive arc in small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering pattern and porous and ordered alignment morphology in cryogenic temperature scanning electron microscopy confirms the locally oriented arrangement of nanoflakes in the ink. Benefiting from this interior&#8208;ordered structure, the ink can be processed into meter&#8208;level film, continuous yarn, and rigid and free&#8208;standing aerogel, respectively. In particular, the films can be used as electrodes directly in aqueous zinc ion batteries and deliver a favorable capacity (382&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 @ 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) as well as long cycle stability (capacity retention rate of 88% @ 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 after 400&#160;cycles). Moreover, the enlarged&#8208;batched fabrication with the introduction of efficient thermal conduction in a 10&#160;L reactor is also carried out successfully. These results clarify the inner relationship between microstructure&#8208;rheology and mechanical engineering for hydroxides, thus paving the way to develop hydroxide&#8208;based products for future practical applications.

         <title>An Integrative Bioorthogonal Nanoengineering Strategy for Dynamically Constructing Heterogenous Tumor Spheroids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) is developed for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with a multivalent click ligand (ClickRod). BONE not only effectively assembled multiple types of cells together, but dynamically regulated cell fates under light stimulation, which together enhanced the development of tumor models.








Abstract
Although tumor models have revolutionized perspectives on cancer aetiology and treatment, current cell culture methods remain challenges in constructing organotypic tumor with in vivo&#8208;like complexity, especially native characteristics, leading to unpredictable results for in vivo responses. Herein, the bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids is developed. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with multivalent click ligand (ClickRod) that is composed of hyaluronic acid&#8208;functionalized gold nanorod carrying dibenzocyclooctyne moieties, resulting in rapid construction of tumor spheroids. BONE can effectively assemble different cancer cells and immune cells together to construct heterogenous tumor spheroids is identified. Particularly, ClickRod exhibited favorable photothermal activity, which precisely promoted cell activity and shaped physiological microenvironment, leading to formation of dynamic features of original tumor, such as heterogeneous cell population and pluripotency, different maturation levels, and physiological gradients. Importantly, BONE not only offered a promising platform for investigating tumorigenesis and therapeutic response, but also improved establishment of subcutaneous xenograft model under mild photo&#8208;stimulation, thereby significantly advancing cancer research.

&lt;p&gt;A bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) is developed for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with a multivalent click ligand (ClickRod). BONE not only effectively assembled multiple types of cells together, but dynamically regulated cell fates under light stimulation, which together enhanced the development of tumor models.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although tumor models have revolutionized perspectives on cancer aetiology and treatment, current cell culture methods remain challenges in constructing organotypic tumor with in vivo-like complexity, especially native characteristics, leading to unpredictable results for in vivo responses. Herein, the bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids is developed. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with multivalent click ligand (ClickRod) that is composed of hyaluronic acid-functionalized gold nanorod carrying dibenzocyclooctyne moieties, resulting in rapid construction of tumor spheroids. BONE can effectively assemble different cancer cells and immune cells together to construct heterogenous tumor spheroids is identified. Particularly, ClickRod exhibited favorable photothermal activity, which precisely promoted cell activity and shaped physiological microenvironment, leading to formation of dynamic features of original tumor, such as heterogeneous cell population and pluripotency, different maturation levels, and physiological gradients. Importantly, BONE not only offered a promising platform for investigating tumorigenesis and therapeutic response, but also improved establishment of subcutaneous xenograft model under mild photo-stimulation, thereby significantly advancing cancer research. Therefore, the first bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy for developing dynamic tumor models, which have the potential for bridging gaps between in vitro and in vivo research is presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
