         <title>Hetero&#8208;Polyionic Hydrogels Enable Dendrites&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries with Fast Kinetics</title>

Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 battery (ZIB) has been regarded as a promising energy storage candidate. However, the soluble polyiodides shuttling and rampant Zn dendrites growth hamper its commercial implementation. Herein, a hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel is designed as the electrolyte for ZIBs. On the cathode side, iodophilic polycationic hydrogel (PCH) effectively alleviates the shuttle effect and facilitates the redox kinetics of iodine species. Meanwhile, polyanionic hydrogel (PAH) towards Zn metal anode uniformizes Zn2+ flux and prevents surface corrosion by electrostatic repulsion of polyiodides. Consequently, the Zn symmetric cells with PAH electrolyte demonstrate remarkable cycling stability over 3000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (1 mAh cm&#8211;2) and 800&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 (5 mAh cm&#8211;2). Moreover, the Zn&#8208;I2 full cells with PAH&#8208;PCH hetero&#8208;polyionic hydrogel electrolyte deliver a low&#8208;capacity decay of 0.008 &#8240; per cycle during 18000 cycles at 8 C. This work sheds light on hydrogel electrolytes design for long&#8208;life conversion&#8208;type aqueous batteries.

         <title>Rational Design of Orally Administered Cascade Nanozyme for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects millions of individuals worldwide annually. Enteric reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in the physiology and pathology of IBD. Nanozymes hold great promise for the treatment of IBD because of their exceptional ability to regulate redox homeostasis during ROS&#8208;related inflammation. However, the rapid development of orally administered, acid&#8208;tolerant, antioxidant nanozymes for IBD therapy is challenging. Herein, a nine&#8208;tier high&#8208;throughput screening strategy was established to address the multifaceted IBD treatment demands, including intrinsic stability, radioactivity, solubility, gut microbiome toxicity, biomimetic elements, intermediate frontier molecular orbitals, reaction energy barriers, negative charges, and acid tolerance. Ni3S4 was selected as the best matching material from 146323 candidates, which exhibited superoxide dismutase&#8208;catalase bienzyme&#8208;like activity and was 3.13&#8208; and 1.80&#8208;fold more active than natural enzymes. As demonstrated in a mouse model, Ni3S4 is stable in the gastrointestinal tract without toxicity and specifically targets the diseased colon to alleviate oxidative stress. RNA and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses showed that Ni3S4 effectively inhibited the cellular pathways of pro&#8208;inflammatory factors and restored the gut microbiota. This study not developed a highly efficient orally administered cascade nanozyme for IBD therapy and offers a next&#8208;generation paradigm for the rational design of nanomedicine through data&#8208;driven approaches.

         <title>Near&#8208;Atomic Scale Perspective on the Oxidation of Ti3C2Tx MXenes: Insights from Atom Probe Tomography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
MXenes are a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides with remarkable properties and great potential for energy storage and catalysis applications. However, their oxidation behavior is not yet fully understood, and there are still open questions regarding the spatial distribution and precise quantification of surface terminations, intercalated ions, and possible uncontrolled impurities incorporated during synthesis and processing. Here, atom probe tomography analysis of as&#8208;synthesized Ti3C2Tx MXenes reveals the presence of alkali (Li, Na) and halogen (Cl, F) elements as well as unetched Al. Following oxidation of the colloidal solution of MXenes, it is observed that the alkalies enriched in TiO2 nanowires. Although these elements are tolerated through the incorporation by wet chemical synthesis, they are often overlooked when the activity of these materials is considered, particularly during catalytic testing. This work demonstrates how the capability of atom probe tomography to image these elements in 3D at the near&#8208;atomic scale can help to better understand the activity and degradation of MXenes, in order to guide their synthesis for superior functional properties.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Embedded with Iodine for High&#8208;Performance Ammonium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ammonium ions (NH4+) are emerging non&#8208;metallic charge carriers for advanced electrochemical energy storage devices, due to their low cost, elemental abundance, and environmental benignity. However, finding suitable electrode materials to achieve rapid diffusion kinetics for NH4+ storage remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) for immobilizing iodine as a high&#8208;performance cathode material for NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors. Cu&#8208;HHB (HHB = hexahydroxybenzene) MOF embedded with iodine (Cu&#8208;HHB/I2) features excellent electrical conductivity, highly porous structure, and rich accessible active sites of copper&#8208;bis(dihydroxy) (Cu&#8208;O4) and iodide species, resulting in a remarkable areal capacitance of 111.7 mF cm&#8211;2 at 0.4&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that Cu&#8208;O4 species in Cu&#8208;HHB play a critical role in binding polyiodide and suppressing its dissolution, as well as contributing to a large pseudocapacitance with adsorbed iodide. In combination with porous MXene anode, the full NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors deliver an excellent energy density of 31.5 mWh cm&#8211;2 and long&#8208;term cycling stability with 89.5% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles, superior to those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors. This study sheds light on the material design for NH4+ storage, enabling the development of novel high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Non&#8208;Blinking Luminescence from Charged Single Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;blinking luminescence from charged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs) is observed. This is attributed to the singly charged trion maintaining photon emission, including radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination. This phenomenon can be explained in terms of the different energy levels in the GQDs caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups.








Abstract
Photoluminescence blinking behavior from single quantum dots under steady illumination is an important but controversial topic. Its occurrence has impeded the use of single quantum dots in bioimaging. Different mechanisms have been proposed to account for it, although controversial, the most important of which is the non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination mechanism whereby photocharging of quantum dots can lead to the blinking phenomenon. Here, the singly charged trion, which maintains photon emission, including radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination, leads to fluorescence non&#8208;blinking which is observed in photocharged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs). This phenomenon can be explained in terms of different energy levels in the GQDs, caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups in the single GQDs. The suppressed blinking is due to the filling of trap sites owing to a Coulomb blockade. These results provide a profound understanding of the special optical properties of GQDs, affording a reference for further in&#8208;depth research.

         <title>Soft&#8211;Rigid Heterostructures with Functional Cation Vacancies for Fast&#8208;Charging and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of a soft&#8211;rigid Co9S8@MoS2 heterostructure is proposed and realized in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is confirmed by electrochemical tests and theoretical calculations. The synergy of heterostructure and functional cation vacancies can effectively lower the mechanical stress, decrease Na+&#8208;diffusion barriers and maintain structural stability, resulting in high rate capacity and remarkable cycling performance.








Abstract
Optimizing charge transfer and alleviating volume expansion in electrode materials are critical to maximize electrochemical performance for energy&#8208;storage systems. Herein, an atomically thin soft&#8211;rigid Co9S8@MoS2 core&#8211;shell heterostructure with dual cation vacancies at the atomic interface is constructed as a promising anode for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The dual cation vacancies involving VCo and VMo in the heterostructure and the soft MoS2 shell afford ionic pathways for rapid charge transfer, as well as the rigid Co9S8 core acting as the dominant active component and resisting structural deformation during charge&#8211;discharge. Electrochemical testing and theoretical calculations demonstrate both excellent Na+&#8208;transfer kinetics and pseudocapacitive behavior. Consequently, the soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure delivers extraordinary sodium&#8208;storage performance (389.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 5.0 A g&#8722;1), superior to those of the single&#8208;phase counterparts: the assembled Na3V2(PO4)3||d&#8208;Co9S8@MoS2/S&#8208;Gr full cell achieves an energy density of 235.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 0.5 C. This finding opens up a unique strategy of soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure and broadens the horizons of material design in energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Density Vacancy&#8208;Rich 2D MoS2&#160;for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur vacancy engineering is a vital strategy to activate the hydrogen evolution activity of the MoS2 basal plane. Unlike traditional costly post&#8208;treatment methods, this work demonstrates a novel salt&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition method for synthesizing vacancy&#8208;rich 2H&#8208;MoS2 electrocatalysts with exceptional catalytic activity. The generation of such defects is closely related to ion adsorption in the growth process.








Abstract
Emerging non&#8208;noble metal 2D&#160;catalysts, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), hold great promise in hydrogen evolution reactions. The sulfur vacancy is recognized as a key defect type that can activate the inert basal plane to improve the catalytic performance. Unfortunately, the method&#160;of introducing sulfur vacancies is limited and requires costly post&#8208;treatment processes. Here, a novel salt&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is demonstrated for synthesizing ultrahigh&#8208;density vacancy&#8208;rich 2H&#8208;MoS2, with a controllable sulfur vacancy density of up to 3.35&#160;&#215;&#160;1014&#160;cm&#8722;2. This approach involves a pre&#8208;sprayed potassium chloridepromoter on the growth substrate. The generation of such defects is closely related to ion adsorption in the growth process, the unstable MoS2&#8208;K&#8208;H2O triggers the formation of sulfur vacancies during the subsequent transfer process, and it is more controllable and nondestructive when compared to traditional post&#8208;treatment methods. The vacancy&#8208;rich monolayer MoS2 exhibits exceptional catalytic activity based on the microcell measurements, with an overpotential of &#8776;158.8&#160;mV (100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and a Tafel slope of 54.3&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4 electrolyte. These results indicate a promising opportunity for modulating sulfur vacancy defects in MoS2 using salt&#8208;assisted CVD growth. This approach represents a significant leap toward achieving better control over the catalytic performances of 2D materials.

         <title>Enhanced Multiwavelength Response of Flexible Synaptic Transistors for Human Sunburned Skin Simulation and Neuromorphic Computation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible organic synaptic transistors with enhanced multiwavelength light&#8208;response properties are prepared by introducing alumina oxide (AlOX ) nanoparticles. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, a learning efficiency model, neural network computing, and &#8220;deer&#8221; picture learning memory functions are successfully simulated.








Abstract
In biological species, optogenetics and bioimaging work together to regulate the function of neurons. Similarly, the light&#8208;controlled artificial synaptic system not only enhances computational speed but also simulates complex synaptic functions. However, reported synaptic properties are mainly limited to mimicking simple biological functions and single&#8208;wavelength responses. Therefore, the development of flexible synaptic devices with multiwavelength optical signal response and multifunctional simulation remains a challenge. Here, flexible organic light&#8208;stimulated synaptic transistors (LSSTs) enabled by alumina oxide (AlOX), with a simple fabrication process, are reported. By embedding AlOX nanoparticles, the excitons separation efficiency is improved, allowing for multiple wavelength responses. Optimized LSSTs can respond to multiple optical and electrical signals in a highly synaptic manner. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, electrical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, learning efficiency model controlled by photoelectric cooperative stimulation, neural network computing, &#8220;deer&#8221; picture learning and memory functions are successfully proposed, which promote the development for future artificial intelligent systems. Furthermore, as prepared flexible transistors exhibit mechanical flexibility with bending radius down to 2.5&#160;mm and improved photosynaptic plasticity, which facilitating development of neuromorphic computing and multifunction integration systems at the device&#8208;level.

A self&#8208;assembling dendrimer nanosystem is decorated with an antibody against programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) for delivering small interfering RNA to target 3&#8208;phosphoinositide&#8208;dependent protein kinase&#8208;1, generating simultaneous inhibition of glycolysis and programmed cell death 1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 interaction with blockage on tumor growth.

Abstract
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy affecting women, yet current therapeutic strategies remain ineffective for patients with late&#8208;stage or metastatic disease. Here an effective strategy is reported for treating metastatic breast cancer. Specifically, a self&#8208;assembling dendrimer nanosystem decorated with an antibody against programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) is established for delivering a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target 3&#8208;phosphoinositide&#8208;dependent protein kinase&#8208;1 (PDK1), a kinase involved in cancer metabolism and metastasis. This nanosystem, named PPD, is designed to target PD&#8208;L1 for cancer&#8208;specific delivery of the siRNA to inhibit PDK1 and modulate cancer metabolism while promoting programmed cell death 1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;based immunotherapy. Indeed, PPD effectively generates simultaneous inhibition of PDK1&#8208;induced glycolysis and the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;related immune response, leading to potent inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis without any notable toxicity in tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. Collectively, these results highlight the potential use of PPD as an effective and safe tumor&#8208;targeting therapy for breast cancer. This study constitutes a successful proof of principle exploiting the intrinsic features of the tumor microenvironment and metabolism alongside a unique self&#8208;assembling dendrimer platform to achieve specific tumor targeting and siRNA&#8208;based gene silencing in combined and precision cancer therapy.

         <title>Dual Breaking of Molecular Orbitals and Spatial Symmetry in an Optically Controlled Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As particles carry quantified energy, photon radiation enables orbital transitions of energy levels, leading to changes in the spin state of electrons. The resulting switchable structural bistability may bring a new paradigm for manipulating ferroelectric polarization. However, the studies on molecular orbital breaking in the ferroelectric field remain blank. Here, for the first time, we formally propose a new mechanism of ferroelectrics&#8212;dual breaking of molecular orbitals and spatial symmetry, demonstrated in a photochromic organic crystal with light&#8208;induced polarization switching. By alternating the ultraviolet/visible light irradiation, the states of electron spin and the radial distribution p atomic orbitals experience a change, showing a reversible switch from &#8220;shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder&#8221; form to a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; form. This reflects a reversible conversion between &#960; and &#963; bonds, which induces and couples with the variation of spatial symmetry. The intersection of spatial symmetry breaking and molecular orbital breaking in ferroelectrics present in this work will be more conducive to data encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Flash&#8208;Thermal Shock Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Toward High Performance Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) provide unprecedented physicochemical properties over unary nanoparticles (NPs). According to the conventional alloying guideline (Hume&#8208;Rothery rule), however, only size&#8208;and&#8208;structure similar elements can be mixed, limiting the possible combinations of alloying elements. Recently, it was reported that based on carbon thermal shocks (CTS) in a vacuum atmosphere at high temperature, ultrafast heating/cooling rates and high&#8208;entropy environment play a critical role in synthesis of HEAs, ruling out possibility of phase separation. Since the CTS requires conducting supports, the Joule&#8208;heating efficiencies rely on the carbon qualities, featuring difficulties in uniform heating along the large area. In this work, we propose a photo&#8208;thermal approach as an alternative and innovative synthetic method that is compatible with ambient air, large&#8208;area, remote process, and free of materials selection. Single flash irradiation on carbon nanofibers induced momentary high&#8208;temperature annealing (&gt; 1,800&#176;C within 20&#8208;ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &gt;&#160;104 K/s) to successfully decorate HEA NPs up to 9 elements with excellent compatibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm2 of carbon nanofiber paper). To demonstrate their feasibility toward applications, senary HEA NPs (PtIrFeNiCoCe) were designed and screened, showing high activity (&#951;overall = 777&#160;mV) and excellent stability (&gt;5,000 cycles) at the water splitting, including hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions.

         <title>Non&#8208;Lignin Substrate Constructing the Gas&#8208;Solid Interface For Enhancing The Photothermal Catalytic Water Vapor Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The progress of solar&#8208;driven water&#8208;splitting technology has been impeded by the limited light response capability of semiconductor materials. Despite attempts to leverage nearly 50% of infrared radiation for photothermal synergy and catalytic reaction enhancement, heat loss during liquid phase reactions results in low energy conversion efficiency. Here, the photothermal&#8208;driven catalytic water&#8208;splitting system, which designs K&#8208;SrTiO3 loaded TiN silica wool at the water&#8208;air interface. Photocatalytic tests and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the thermal effect transforms liquid water into water vapor, thereby reducing the reaction free energy of catalysts and improving the transmission rate of catalytic products. Hence, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches 275.46&#160;mmol m&#8211;2&#160;h&#8211;1, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) efficiency is 1.81% under 1 sun irradiation in this gas&#8208;solid system, which is more than twice that of liquid water splitting. This novel photothermal&#8208;catalytic pathway, which involves a coupled reaction of water evaporation and water splitting, is anticipated to broaden the utilization range of the solar spectrum and significantly enhance the conversion efficiency of STH.

         <title>Decoupling Activation and Transport by Electron&#8208;Regulated Atomic&#8208;Bi Harnessed Surface&#8208;To&#8208;Pore Interface for Vanadium Redox Flow Battery</title>

Abstract
Vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) promises a route to low&#8208;cost and grid&#8208;scale electricity storage using renewable energy resources. However, the interplay of mass transport and activation processes of high&#8208;loading catalysts makes it challenging to drive high&#8208;performance density VRFB. Herein, we&#160; report a surface&#8208;to&#8208;pore interface design that unlocks the potential of atomic&#8208;Bi&#8208;exposed catalytic surface via decoupling activation and transport. The functional interface accommodates electron&#8208;regulated atomic&#8208;Bi catalyst in an asymmetric Bi&#8208;O&#8208;Mn structure that expedites the V3+/V2+ conversion, and a mesoporous Mn3O4 sub&#8208;scaffold for rapid shuttling of redox&#8208;active species, whereby the site accessibility is maximized, contrary to conventional transport&#8208;limited catalysts. By in&#8208;situ grafting this interface onto micron&#8208;porous carbon felt (Bi1&#8208;sMn3O4&#8208;CF), a high&#8208;performance flow battery is achieved, yielding a record high energy efficiency of 76.72% even at a high current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a peak power density of 1.503&#160;W cm&#8722;2, outdoing the battery with sMn3O4&#8208;CF (62.60%, 0.978&#160;W cm&#8722;2) without Bi catalyst. Moreover, this battery renders extraordinary durability of over 1500 cycles, bespeaking a crucial breakthrough toward sustainable RFBs.

         <title>Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction of (Fe,Ni)Ooh via Defect Engineering for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis Under Industrial Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing non&#8208;precious catalysts with long&#8208;term catalytic durability and structural stability under industrial conditions is the key to practical alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis. Here we propose an energy&#8208;saving approach to synthesize defect&#8208;rich iron nickel oxyhydroxide for stability and efficiency toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from in situ cation exchange, the nanosheet&#8208;nanoflake&#8208;structured catalyst is homogeneously embedded in, and tightly bonded to, its substrate, making it ultrastable at high current densities. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the introduction of Ni in FeOOH reduces the activation energy barrier for the catalytic reaction and that the purposely created oxygen defects not only ensure the exposure of active sites and maximize the effective catalyst surface but also modulate the local coordination environment and chemisorption properties of both Fe and Ni sites, thus lowering the energy barrier from *O to *OOH. Consequently, the optimized d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic activity with long&#8208;term durability under both laboratory and industrial conditions. The large&#8208;area d&#8208;(Fe,Ni)OOH||NiMoN pair requires 1.795&#160;V to reach a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an absolute current of 12.5 A in an AEM electrolyzer for overall water electrolysis, showing great potential for industrial water electrolysis.

         <title>Reversed Electron Transfer in Dual Single Atom Catalyst for Boosted Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photogenerated charge localization on material surfaces significantly affects photocatalytic performance, especially for multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction. Dual single atom (DSA) catalysts with flexibly designed reactive sites have received significant research attention for CO2 photoreduction. However, the charge transfer mechanism in DSA catalysts remains poorly understood. Here we report for the first time a reversed electron transfer mechanism on Au and Co DSA catalysts. In situ characterizations confirm that for CdS nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with Co or Au single atoms, photogenerated eletrons are localized around the single atom of Co or Au. In DSA catalysts however electrons are delocalized from Au and accumulate around Co atoms. Importantly, combined advanced spectroscopic findings and theoretical computation evidence that this reversed electron transfer in Au/Co DSA boosts charge redistribution and activation of CO2 molecules, leading to highly significantly increased photocatalytic CO2 reduction, for example, Au/Co DSA loaded CdS exhibits, respectively, ca. 2800% and 700% greater yields for CO and CH4 compared with that for CdS alone. Reversed electron transfer in DSA can be used for practical design for charge redistribution and to boost photoreduction of CO2. Findings will be of benefit to researchers and manufacturers in DSA loaded catalysts for generation of solar fuels.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photogenerated charge localization on material surfaces significantly affects photocatalytic performance, especially for multi-electron CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Dual single atom (DSA) catalysts with flexibly designed reactive sites have received significant research attention for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction. However, the charge transfer mechanism in DSA catalysts remains poorly understood. Here we report for the first time a reversed electron transfer mechanism on Au and Co DSA catalysts. In situ characterizations confirm that for CdS nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with Co or Au single atoms, photogenerated eletrons are localized around the single atom of Co or Au. In DSA catalysts however electrons are delocalized from Au and accumulate around Co atoms. Importantly, combined advanced spectroscopic findings and theoretical computation evidence that this reversed electron transfer in Au/Co DSA boosts charge redistribution and activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, leading to highly significantly increased photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, for example, Au/Co DSA loaded CdS exhibits, respectively, &lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt;. 2800% and 700% greater yields for CO and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compared with that for CdS alone. Reversed electron transfer in DSA can be used for practical design for charge redistribution and to boost photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Findings will be of benefit to researchers and manufacturers in DSA loaded catalysts for generation of solar fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Bionic Skin for Health Management: Excellent Breathability, In&#8208;Situ Sensing, and Big Data Analysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing an intelligent wearable system is of great significance to human health management. An ideal health&#8208;monitoring patch should possess key characteristics like high air permeability, moisture&#8208;wicking function, high sensitivity, and a comfortable user experience. However, such a patch that encompasses all these functions is rarely reported. Herein, &#160;we developed an intelligent bionic skin patch for health management by integrating bionic structures, nano&#8208;welding technology, flexible circuit design, multifunctional sensing functions, and big data analysis using advanced electrospinning technology. By controlling the preparation of nanofibers and constructing bionic secondary structures, the resulting nanofiber membrane closely resembles human skin, exhibiting excellent air/ moisture permeability, and one&#8208;side sweat&#8208;wicking properties. Additionally, the bionic patch was endowed with a high&#8208;precision signal acquisition capabilities for sweat metabolites, including glucose, lactic acid, and pH; skin temperature, skin impedance, and electromyographic signals can be precisely measured through the in&#8208;situ sensing electrodes and flexible circuit design. The achieved intelligent bionic skin patch holds great potential for applications in health management systems and rehabilitation engineering management. The design of the smart bionic patch not only provides high practical value for health management but also has great theoretical value for the development of the new generation of wearable electronic devices.

         <title>Ductile Oligomeric Acceptor&#8208;Modified Flexible Organic Solar Cells Show Excellent Mechanical Robustness and Near 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness are key requirements for wearable applications of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, almost all highly efficient photoactive films comprising polymer donors (PD) and small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are mechanically brittle. In this study, highly efficient (PCE = 17.91%) and mechanically robust (crack&#8208;onset strain [COS] = 11.7%) flexible OSCs were fabricated by incorporating a ductile oligomeric acceptor (DOA) into the PD:SMA system, representing the most flexible OSCs to date. The photophysical, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties of D18:N3 with different DOAs were characterized. By introducing DOA DOY&#8208;C4 with a longer flexible alkyl linker and lower polymerization, the D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4&#8208;based flexible OSCs exhibited a significantly higher PCE (17.91%) and 50% higher COS (11.7%) than the D18:N3&#8208;based device (PCE = 17.06%, COS = 7.8%). The flexible OSCs based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4 retained 98% of the initial PCE after 2000 consecutive bending cycles, showing greater mechanical stability than the reference device (maintaining 89% of initial PCE). After careful investigation, we hypothesized that the enhancement in mechanical properties was mainly due to the formation of tie chains or entanglement in the ternary blend films. These results demonstrate that DOAs have great potential for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible OSCs.

         <title>Li2MnO3: A Catalyst for A Liquid Cl2 Electrode in Low&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li2MnO3 has been contemplated as a high&#8208;capacity cathode candidate for Li&#8208;ion batteries; however, it evolves oxygen during battery charging under ambient conditions, which hinders a reversible reaction. However, it is unclear if this irreversible process still holds under sub&#8208;ambient conditions. Here, we evaluated the low&#8208;temperature electrochemical properties of Li2MnO3 in an aqueous LiCl electrolyte and observed a reversible discharge capacity of 302 mAh/g at a potential of 1.0&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl at &#8211;78 &#176;C with good rate capability and stable cycling performance, in sharp contrast to the findings in a typical Li2MnO3 cell cycled at room temperature. However, our results reveal that the capacity does not originate from the reversible oxygen oxidation in Li2MnO3 but the reversible Cl2(l)/Cl&#8211;(aq.) redox from the electrolyte. Our results demonstrated the good catalytic properties of Li2MnO3 to promote the Cl2/Cl&#8211; redox at low temperatures.

Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskites hold immense potential for the advancement of next&#8208;generation field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the instability of perovskite&#8208;based transistors has impeded their progress and practical applications. Here we report ambient&#8208;stable high&#8208;performance FETs based on two&#8208;dimensional Dion&#8208;Jacobson phase tin halide perovskite BDASnI4 that has high film quality and excellent electrical properties. The perovskite channels are established by engineering the film crystallization process via the employment of ammonium salt interlayers and the incorporation of NH4SCN additives within the precursor solution. The refined FETs demonstrate field&#8208;effect hole mobilities up to 1.61 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio surpassing 106. Moreover, the devices show impressive operational and environmental stability, and retain their functional performance even after being exposed to ambient conditions with temperature of 45&#176;C and humidity of 45% for over 150 hours.

         <title>Regulating Exciton De&#8208;trapping of Te4+&#8208;doped Zero&#8208;Dimensional Scandium&#8208;Halide Perovskite for Fluorescence Thermometry with Record High Time&#8208;Resolved Thermal Sensitivity</title>

Abstract
Fluorescence thermometry has been propelled to the forefront of scientific attention due to its high spatial resolution and remote non&#8208;invasive detection. However, recent generations of thermometers still suffer from limited thermal sensitivity (Sr) below 10% change per Kelvin (K). Herein, we present an ideal temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence material through Te4+&#8208;doped zero&#8208;dimensional Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O, in which isolated polyhedrons endow highly localized electronic structures, and the strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling facilitates the formation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). With rising temperature, the dramatic asymmetric expansion of the soft lattice induces increased defects, strong exciton&#8208;phonon coupling, and low thermal activation energy, which evokes a rapid de&#8208;trapping process of STEs, enabling several orders of magnitude changes in the fluorescence lifetime over a narrow temperature range. After regulating the de&#8208;trapping process with different Te4+ doping, a record high Sr (27.36% K&#8722;1) of fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based detection is achieved at 325 K. The robust stability of Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O:Te4+ against multiple heating/cooling cycles and long&#8208;term measurements enables a low temperature uncertainty of 0.067 K. Further, the developed thermometers are demonstrated for the remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components. We believe that this work constitutes a solid step forward to build the next generation of ultrasensitive thermometers based on low&#8208;dimensional metal halides.

The robust stability of Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ScCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O:Te&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; against multiple heating/cooling cycles and long-term measurements enables a low temperature uncertainty of 0.067 K. Further, the developed thermometers are demonstrated for the remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components. We believe that this work constitutes a solid step forward to build the next generation of ultrasensitive thermometers based on low-dimensional metal halides.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>3D&#8208;Heterojunction Based on Embedded Perovskite Micro&#8208;Sized Single Crystals for Fast Photomultiplier Photodetectors with Broad/Narrowband Dual&#8208;Mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for creating a vertical fast photomultiplier photodetector based on a 3D heterostructure of embedded perovskite microsized single crystals with a dual mode of voltage&#8208;controlled broad/narrowband switching is reported. The additional radial interface and charge separation in the 3D heterostructure effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response of the high&#8208;performance multifunctional photodetectors.








Abstract
A fast photomultiplier photodetector with a broad/narrowband dual mode is implemented using a new 3D heterostructure based on embedded perovskite micro&#8208;sized single crystals. Because the single&#8208;crystal size is smaller than the electrode size, the active layer can be divided into a perovskite microcrystalline part for charge transport and a polymer&#8208;embedded part for charge storage. This induces an additional radial interface in the 3D heterojunction structure, and allows a photogenerated built&#8208;in electric field in the radial direction, especially when the energy levels between the perovskite and embedding polymer are similar. This type of heterojunction has a small radial capacitance that can effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response. By controlling the applied bias direction, up to 300&#8211;1000% external quantum efficiency (EQE) and microsecond response can be achieved not only in the wide range of ultraviolet to visible light from 320 to 550&#160;nm, but also in the narrow&#8208;band response with a full width at half minimum (FWHM) of 20&#160;nm. This shows great potential for applications in integrated multifunctional photodetectors.

         <title>Ultrahigh Permeability at High Frequencies via A Magnetic&#8208;Heterogeneous Nanocrystallization Mechanism in an Iron&#8208;Based Amorphous Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising Fe75.5Co0.5Mo0.5Cu1Nb1.5Si13B8 nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous composite alloy is developed by a unique magnetic&#8208;heterogeneous nanocrystallization mechanism and it shows an exceptionally high permeability up to 36&#160;000 at high frequency of 100 kHz. The exceptional soft magnetic properties are shown to be closely related to its low anisotropy and unique spin rotation mechanism under alternating magnetic fields in the nanocrystalline alloy.








Abstract
The prevalence of wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) semiconductors allows modern electronic devices to operate at much higher frequencies. However, development of soft magnetic materials with high&#8208;frequency properties matching the WBG&#8208;based devices remains challenging. Here, a promising nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous composite alloy with a normal composition Fe75.5Co0.5Mo0.5Cu1Nb1.5Si13B8 in atomic percent is reported, which is producible under industrial conditions, and which shows an exceptionally high permeability at high frequencies up to 36&#160;000 at 100&#160;kHz, an increase of 44% compared with commercial FeSiBCuNb nanocrystalline alloy (25&#160;000&#160;&#177;&#160;2000 at 100&#160;kHz), outperforming all existing nanocrystalline alloy systems and commercial soft magnetic materials. The alloy is obtained by a unique magnetic&#8208;heterogeneous nanocrystallization mechanism in an iron&#8208;based amorphous alloy, which is different from the traditional strategy of nanocrystallization by doping nonmagnetic elements (e.g., Cu and Nb). The induced magnetic inhomogeneity by adding Co atoms locally promotes the formation of highly ordered structures acting as the nuclei of nanocrystals, and Mo atoms agglomerate around the interfaces of the nanocrystals, inhibiting nanocrystal growth, resulting in an ultrafine nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous dual&#8208;phase structure in the alloy. The exceptional soft magnetic properties are shown to be closely related to the low magnetic anisotropy and the unique spin rotation mechanism under alternating magnetic fields.

         <title>Triiodide Attacks the Organic Cation in Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites: Mechanism and Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triiodide is formed from thermally stressed lead halide perovskites. It hydrogen bonds strongly with organic cations in these materials, and it induces, catalytically, their deprotonation leading to perovskite decomposition. A simple thiol applied to the perovskite surface interrupts the catalytic cycle, and when applied at the perovskite&#8211;hole&#8208;transport material interface, creates a surface dipole that facilitates hole injection.








Abstract
Molecular I2 can be produced from iodide&#8208;based lead perovskites under thermal stress; triiodide, I3&#8722;, is formed from this I2 and I&#8722;. Triiodide attacks protic cation MA+&#8208; or FA+&#8208;based lead halide perovskites (MA+, methylammonium; FA+, formamidinium) as explicated through solution&#8208;based nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies: triiodide has strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding affinity for MA+ or FA+, which leads to their deprotonation and perovskite decomposition. Triiodide is a catalyst for this decomposition that can be obviated through perovskite surface treatment with thiol reducing agents. In contrast to methods using thiol incorporation into perovskite precursor solutions, no penetration of the thiol into the bulk perovskite is observed, yet its surface application stabilizes the perovskite against triiodide&#8208;mediated thermal stress. Thiol applied to the interface between FAPbI3 and Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (&#8220;Spiro&#8221;) prevents oxidized iodine species penetration into Spiro and thus preserves its hole&#8208;transport efficacy. Surface&#8208;applied thiol affects the perovskite work function; it ameliorates hole injection into the Spiro overlayer, thus improving device performance. It helps to increase interfacial adhesion (&#8220;wetting&#8221;): fewer voids are observed at the Spiro/perovskite interface if thiols are applied. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) incorporating interfacial thiol treatment maintain over 80% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 300&#160;h of 85&#160;&#176;C thermal stress.

         <title>Directional Shunting of Photogenerated Carriers in Pom@Mof for Promoting Nitrogen Adsorption And Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The efficient catalysis nitrogen (N2) into high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing products plays a crucial role in N economic cycle. However, weak N2 adsorption and invalid N2 activation remain two major bottleneck in rate&#8208;determining steps, leading to low N2 fixation performance. Herein, we highlight an effective dual active sites photocatalyst of polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) via altering coordination microenvironment and inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers to facilitate N2/catalyst interaction and enhance oxidation performance. MOFs create more open unsaturated metal clusters sites with unoccupied d orbital possessing Lewis acidity to accept electrons from 3&#963;g bonding orbital of N2 for storage by combining with POMs to replace bidentate linkers. POMs act as electron sponges donating electrons to MOFs, while the holes directional flow to POMs. The hole&#8208;rich POMs with strong oxidation capacity are easily involved in oxidizing adsorbed N2. Taking UiO&#8208;66 (C48H28O32Zr6) and Mo72Fe30 ([Mo72Fe30O252(CH3COO)12{Mo2O7(H2O)}2{H2Mo2O8(H2O)}(H2O)91]&#183;150H2O) as an example, Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 shows 2&#8208;fold enhanced adsorption of N2 (250.5 cm3 g&#8722;1) than UiO&#8208;66 (122.9 cm3 g&#8722;1) at P/P0 = 1. And, the HNO3 yield of Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 is 702.4&#160;&#956;g g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, nearly 7 times and 24 times higher to UiO&#8208;66 and Mo72Fe30. Our work provides reliable value for the storage and relaying artificial N2 fixation.

         <title>Organic Optoelectronic Materials: A Rising Star of Bioimaging And Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recently, many organic optoelectronic materials (OOMs), especially those used in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells (OSCs), and organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), are explored for biomedical applications including imaging and photoexcited therapies. In this review,&#160;we&#160;summarize recently developed OOMs for fluorescence imaging, photoacoustic imaging, photothermal therapy, and photodynamic therapy. Relationships between their molecular structures, nano&#8208;aggregation structures, photophysical mechanisms, and properties for various biomedical applications are discussed. Mainly four kinds of OOMs are covered: thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials in OLEDs, conjugated small molecules and polymers in OSCs, and charge&#8208;transfer complexes in OFETs. Based on the OOM's unique optical properties, including excitation light wavelength and exciton dynamics, they are respectively exploited for suitable biomedical applications. This review is intended to serve as a bridge between researchers in the area of organic optoelectronic devices and those in the area of biomedical applications. Moreover, it provides guidance for selecting or modifying OOMs for high&#8208;performance biomedical uses. Current challenges and future perspectives of OOMs are also discussed with the hope of inspiring further development of OOMs for efficient biomedical applications.

         <title>Universal Strategy of Efficient Intracellular Macromolecule Directional Delivery Using Photothermal Pump Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable universal delivery strategy of therapeutic macromolecules into desired cells and tissues has been very challenging. Photothermal methods have advantages in intracellular delivery, particularly in in vivo manipulation. However, the inability of directional transmission of exogenous molecules limits their delivery efficiency. Here, we report a photothermal pump (PTP) patch with numerous &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221;. Under a laser, the cell membrane ruptures, while &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; shrink, resulting in a directional exogenous molecule delivery into cells for a high&#8208;efficient intracellular delivery. The PTP patches are considered a universal structure for a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule delivery. Under in vivo transdermal intracellular delivery conditions, the target genes are efficiently and noninvasively delivered into epidermal and dermal cells through the PTP patch and exosomes produced by the epidermal cells, respectively. The PTP patch provides a new strategy for a high&#8208;efficiency, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable macromolecule delivery.

         <title>Electrolyte and Interphase Engineering of Aqueous Batteries Beyond &#8220;Water&#8208;In&#8208;Salt&#8221; Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aqueous batteries are promising alternatives to non&#8208;aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their safety, environmental impact, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, their energy density is limited by the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of water. &#8220;Water&#8208;in&#8208;salts&#8221; (WIS) strategy is an effective method to broaden the ESW by reducing the &#8220;free water&#8221; in the electrolyte, but the drawbacks (high cost, high viscosity, poor low&#8208;temperature performance, etc.) also compromise these inherent superiorities. In this review, electrolyte and interphase engineering of aqueous batteries to overcome the drawbacks of the WIS strategy have been summarized, including the developments of electrolytes, electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases, and electrodes. Firstly, the main challenges of aqueous batteries and the problems of the WIS strategy are comprehensively introduced. Secondly, the electrochemical functions of various electrolyte components (e.g., additives and solvents) are summarized and compared. Gel electrolytes are also investigated as a special form of electrolyte. Thirdly, the formation and modification of the electrolyte&#8208;induced interphase on the electrode are discussed. Specifically, the modification and contribution of electrode materials toward improving WIS strategy are also introduced. Finally, the challenges of aqueous batteries and the prospects of electrolyte and interphase engineering beyond the WIS strategy are outlined for the practical applications of aqueous batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;insulator transition coupled with an ultrafast, significant, and reversible resistive change in Mott insulators has attracted tremendous interest for investigation into next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic devices, as well as a fundamental understanding of condensed matter systems. Although the mechanism of MIT in Mott insulators is still controversial, great efforts have been made to understand and modulate MIT behavior for various electronic and optoelectronic applications. In this review, we highlight recent progress in the field of nanoelectronics utilizing MIT. We begin with a brief introduction to the physics of MIT and its underlying mechanisms. After discussing the MIT behaviors of various Mott insulators, we describe recent advances in the design and fabrication of nanoelectronics devices based on MIT, including memories, gas sensors, photodetectors, logic circuits, and artificial neural networks. Finally, we provide an outlook on the development and future applications of nanoelectronics utilizing MIT. This review can serve as an overview and a comprehensive understanding of the design of MIT&#8208;based nanoelectronics for future electronic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Evidence of Nodal Superconductivity in Monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 with Hidden Order Fluctuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Unconventional superconductors represent one of the fundamental directions in modern quantum materials research. In particular, nodal superconductors are known to appear naturally in strongly correlated systems, including cuprate superconductors and heavy&#8208;fermion systems. Van der Waals materials hosting superconducting states are well known, yet nodal monolayer van der Waals superconductors have remained elusive. Here, using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) experiments, we&#160;show that pristine monolayer 1H&#8208;TaS2 realizes a nodal superconducting state. By including non&#8208;magnetic disorder, we&#160;drive the nodal superconducting state to a conventional gapped s&#8208;wave state. Furthermore, we&#160;observe the emergence of many&#8208;body excitations close to the gap edge, signalling a potential unconventional pairing mechanism. Our&#160;results demonstrate the emergence of nodal superconductivity in a van der Waals monolayer, providing a building block for van der Waals heterostructures exploiting unconventional superconducting&#160;states.

         <title>Trivalent Europium&#8208;Doped CsCl Quantum Dots for MA&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells with Inherent Bandgap through Lattice Strain Compensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots are introduced in FAPbI3 PSCs to solve the key issues in CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 (Cs&#8211;FA) PSCs and simultaneously exert the talent of Cs&#8211;FA PSCs on stability, which maintains the optimal bandgap of FAPbI3 and offsets the Cs&#8208;induced local strain with a high power conversion efficiency of 24.13%.








Abstract
Cesium&#8211;formamidinium (Cs&#8211;FA) perovskites have garnered widespread interest owing to their excellent thermal&#8208; and photostability in achieving stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, Cs&#8211;FA perovskite typically suffers from Cs+ and FA+ mismatches, affecting the Cs&#8211;FA morphology and lattice distortion, resulting in an enlarged bandgap (Eg). In this work, &#8220;upgraded&#8221; CsCl, Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots, are&#160;developed to solve the key issues in Cs&#8211;FA PSCs and also exploit the advantage of Cs&#8208;FA PSCs on stability. The introduction of Eu3+ promotes the formation of high&#8208;quality Cs&#8211;FA films by adjusting the Pb&#8211;I cluster. CsCl:Eu3+ also offsets the local strain and lattice contraction induced by Cs+, which maintains the inherent Eg of FAPbI3 and decreases the trap density. Finally, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.13% is obtained with an excellent short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 . The unencapsulated devices show excellent humidity stability and&#160;storage stability, and an initial PCE of 92.2% within 500&#160;h under continuous light illumination, and bias voltage conditions is achieved. This study provides a universal strategy to address the inherent issues of Cs&#8211;FA devices and maintain the stability of MA&#8208;free PSCs to satisfy future commercial criteria.

         <title>Overcoming Water Diffusion Limitations in Hydrogels via Microtubular Graphene Networks for Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates bioinspired microstructured thermoresponsive hydrogels for soft actuators with enhanced actuation performance and options for both light&#8208; and electrically controlled actuation. The poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels contain interconnected microtubular graphene networks for enhanced water transport, resulting in increased actuation dynamics and stresses without compromising the softness and mechanical stability of the hydrogel.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based soft actuators can operate in sensitive environments, bridging the gap of rigid machines interacting with soft matter. However, while stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels can undergo extreme reversible volume changes of up to &#8776;90%, water transport in hydrogel actuators is in general limited by their poroelastic behavior. For poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) the actuation performance is even further compromised by the formation of a dense skin layer. Here it is shown, that incorporating a bioinspired microtube graphene network into a PNIPAM matrix with a total porosity of only 5.4% dramatically enhances actuation dynamics by up to &#8776;400% and actuation stress by &#8776;4000% without sacrificing the mechanical stability, overcoming the water transport limitations. The graphene network provides both untethered light&#8208;controlled and electrically powered actuation. It is anticipated that the concept provides a versatile platform for enhancing the functionality of soft matter by combining responsive and 2D materials, paving the way toward designing soft intelligent matter.

         <title>Tuning Ligands Ratio Allows for Controlling Gold Nanocluster Conformation and Activating a Nonantimicrobial Thiol Fragrance for Effective Treatment of MRSA&#8208;Induced Keratitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the feed ratio of two thiol ligands with different steric hindrances, the conformation of the gold nanocluster is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16, while simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into a membrane&#8208;active antibacterial nanomedicine for the effective treatment of refractory bacterial keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus.








Abstract
Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular disease that affects millions of people worldwide each year, among which &#8776;25% are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. With the spread of bacterial resistance, refractory keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA) affects &#8776;120&#160;000&#8211;190&#160;000 people annually and is a significant cause of infectious blindness. Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (GNCs) recently emerged as promising antibacterial agents; although how the GNC structure and capping ligands control the antibacterial properties remains largely unexplored. In this study, by adjusting the ratio of a &#8220;bulky&#8221; thiol fragrance to a linear zwitterionic ligand, the GNC conformation is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16 species, simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into potent antibacterial nanomaterials. Surprisingly, mixed&#8208;ligand capped Au23(SR)16 GNCs exhibit superior antibacterial potency compared to their monoligand counterparts. The optimal GNC is highly potent against MRSA, showing &gt;1024&#8208;fold lower minimum inhibitory concentration than the corresponding free ligands. Moreover, it displays excellent potency in treating MRSA&#8208;induced keratitis in mice with greatly accelerated corneal recovery (by approximately ninefold). Thus, this study establishes a feasible method to synthesize antibacterial GNCs by adjusting the ligand ratio to control GNC conformation and active non&#8208;antibacterial ligands, thereby greatly increasing the repertoires for combating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.

         <title>Insight on the Intracellular Supramolecular Assembly of DTTO: A Peculiar Example of Cell&#8208;Driven Polymorphism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within live cells, DTTO molecules form amorphous spherical clusters which subsequently accumulate, coalesce, and lead to the formation of fibrous crystals interconnecting different cells. Remarkably, cells produce a distinctive crystalline form, that is, a bio&#8208;polymorph, which cannot be replicated outside cells. These fibers offer a new approach for artificially connecting cells and hold the potential for creating/regenerating cellular communication networks.








Abstract
The assembly of supramolecular structures within living systems is an innovative approach for introducing artificial constructs and developing biomaterials capable of influencing and/or regulating the biological responses of living organisms. By integrating chemical, photophysical, morphological, and structural characterizations, it is&#160;shown that the cell&#8208;driven assembly of 2,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene&#8208;4,4&#8208;dioxide (DTTO) molecules into fibers results in the formation of a &#8220;biologically assisted&#8221; polymorphic form, hence the term bio&#8208;polymorph. Indeed, X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that cell&#8208;grown DTTO fibers present a unique molecular packing leading to specific morphological, optical, and electrical properties. Monitoring the process of fiber formation in cells with time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, it is&#160;established that cellular machinery is necessary for fiber production and a non&#8208;classical nucleation mechanism for their growth is postulated. These biomaterials may have disruptive applications in the stimulation and sense of living cells, but more crucially, the study of their genesis and properties broadens the&#160;understanding of life beyond the native components of cells.

         <title>Integrating Enrichment, Reduction, and Oxidation Sites in One System for Artificial Photosynthetic Diluted CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalytic system of CO2 enrichment, CO2 reduction, and H2O oxidation sites is designed for diluted CO2 reduction, and the [Emim]BF4@Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF shows excellent visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and natural&#8208;sunlight&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity under diluted CO2 (15%) atmosphere.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction directly driven by natural sunlight is a challenging, but promising way to realize carbon&#8208;resources recycling utilization. Herein, a three&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalytic system of CO2 enrichment, CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation sites is designed for diluted CO2 reduction. A Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF) with oxidation and reductive sites is synthesized; then, ionic liquids (ILs) are loaded into the pores. As a result, [Emim]BF4@Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF shows a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 105.88&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under diluted CO2 (15%) atmosphere, even superior than most photocatalysts in high concentrations CO2. Moreover, natural sunlight driven diluted CO2 reduction rate also reaches 126.51&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 in 5&#160;h. Further experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the triazine ring in the Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF promotes the activity of H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction sites, and the loaded ILs provide an enriched CO2 atmosphere, realizing the efficient photocatalytic activity in diluted CO2 reduction.

&lt;p&gt;Artificial photosynthetic diluted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction directly driven by natural sunlight is a challenging, but promising way to realize carbon-resources recycling utilization.

         <title>Rationally Designing High&#8208;Performance Versatile Organic Memristors through Molecule&#8208;Mediated Ion Movements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized effective strategy with a view to molecules with specific coordination&#8208;groups&#8208;regulating ions, and regulating device functions through modulation of the molecule distribution is implemented. This well&#8208;known delicate coordination reaction is introduced into a generalized robust polymer framework, leading to modulation of the tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) molecule distribution and domain separation inside the polymer framework, and then to regulation of the formed shape of the Ag conductive filaments (CFs). The work inspires novel strategies in rationally designing high&#8208;performance and multifunctional memory devices and is promising to lead broad interest in special molecule&#8208;mediated ion memristors.








Abstract
Organic memory has attracted tremendous attention for next&#8208;generation electronic elements for the molecules&#8217; striking ease of structural design. However, due to them being hardly controllable and their low ion transport, it is always essential and challenge to effectively control their random migration, pathway, and duration. There are very few effective strategies, and specific platforms with a view to molecules with specific coordination&#8208;groups&#8208;regulating ions have been rarely reported. In this work, as a generalized rational design strategy, the well&#8208;known tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) is introduced with multiple coordination groups and small plane structure into a stable polymers framework to modulate Ag migration and then achieve high&#8208;performance devices with ideal productivity, low operation voltage and power, stable switching cycles, and state retention. Raman mapping demonstrates&#160;that the migrated Ag can specially coordinate with the embedded TCNQ molecules. Notably, the TCNQ molecule distribution can be modulated inside the polymer framework and regulate the memristive behaviors through controlling the formed Ag conductive filaments (CFs) as demonstrated by Raman mapping, in situ conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and depth&#8208;profiling X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Thus the controllable molecule&#8208;mediated Ag movements show its potential in rationally designing high&#8208;performance devices and versatile functions and is enlightening in constructing memristors with molecule&#8208;mediated ion movements.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Error&#8208;Correction Learning Accelerates Experimental Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning model using error&#8208;correction learning with experimental feedback is developed to predict high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials. Experimentally a new family of thermoelectric materials consisting of PbSe:SnSb is achieved, which exhibits large power factor at room temperature.








Abstract
The exploration of thermoelectric materials is challenging considering the large materials space, combined with added exponential degrees of freedom coming from doping and the diversity of synthetic pathways. Here, historical data is incorporated, and is updated using experimental feedback by employing error&#8208;correction learning (ECL). This is achieved by learning from prior datasets and then&#160;adapting the model to differences in synthesis and characterization that are otherwise difficult to parameterize. This strategy is thus applied to discovering thermoelectric materials, where synthesis is prioritized at temperatures &lt;300&#160;&#9675;C. A previously unexplored chemical family of thermoelectric materials, PbSe:SnSb, is documented, finding that the best candidate in this chemical family, 2 wt% SnSb doped PbSe, exhibits a power factor more than 2&#215; that of PbSe. The investigations herein reveal that a closed&#8208;loop experimentation strategy reduces the required number of experiments to find an optimized material by a factor as high as 3&#215; compared to high&#8208;throughput searches powered by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art machine&#8208;learning (ML) models. It is also observed that this improvement is dependent on the accuracy of the ML model in a manner that exhibits diminishing returns: once a certain accuracy is reached, factors that are instead associated with experimental pathways begin to dominate trends.

         <title>Metal&#8208;like Stretchable Nanocomposite Using Locally&#8208;Bundled Nanowires for Skin&#8208;Mountable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretchable conductive nanocomposites have been intensively studied for wearable bioelectronics. However, development of nanocomposites that simultaneously feature metal&#8208;like conductivity (&gt; 100,000 S/cm) and high stretchability (&gt; 100%) for high&#8208;performance skin&#8208;mountable devices is still extremely challenging. Here&#160;we&#160;present a material strategy for such a nanocomposite by using local bundling of silver nanowires stabilized with dual ligands (i.e., 1&#8208;propanethiols and 1&#8208;decanethiols). When the nanocomposite&#160;was&#160;solidified via solvent evaporation under a highly humid condition, the nanowires in the organic solution are bundled and stabilized. The resulting locally&#8208;bundled nanowires lower contact resistance while maintain their percolation network, leading to high conductivity. Dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol further boost up the conductivity. As a result, a nanocomposite with both high conductivity of &#8764; 122,120 S/cm and high stretchability of &#8764; 200% is obtained. Such superb electrical and mechanical properties are critical for various applications in skin&#8208;like electronics, and&#160;we&#160;herein demonstrated a wearable thermo&#8208;stimulation device.

         <title>The Distance Between Phosphate&#8208;Based Polyanionic Compounds and Their Practical Application For Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are a viable alternative to meet the requirements of future large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to the uniform distribution and abundant sodium resources. Among the various cathode materials for SIBs, phosphate&#8208;based polyanionic compounds exhibit excellent sodium&#8208;storage properties, such as high operation voltage, remarkable structural stability, and superior safety. However, their undesirable electronic conductivities and specific capacities limited their application in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. Herein, the development history and recent progress of phosphate&#8208;based polyanionic cathodes are first overviewed. Subsequently, the effective modification strategies of phosphate&#8208;based polyanionic cathodes are summarized toward high&#8208;performance SIBs, including surface coating, morphological control, ion doping, and electrolyte optimization. Besides, the electrochemical performance, cost, and industrialization analysis of phosphate&#8208;based polyanionic cathodes for SIBs are discussed for accelerating commercialization development. Finally, the future directions of phosphate&#8208;based polyanionic cathodes are comprehensively concluded. &#160;We believe that this review can provide instructive insight into developing practical phosphate&#8208;based polyanionic cathodes for SIBs.

Porous, ultrathin PtAgBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets with widths beyond 700 nm are synthesized via a visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoinduced Bi2Te3&#8208;nanosheet&#8208;mediated route, and are employed as anode electrocatalysts for hydrazine hydrate oxidation reaction and actual direct hydrazine hydrate fuel cells. The peak power densities of the PtAgBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets in actual hydrazine&#8211;O2/air fuel cell devices are 532.9/315.9 mW cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D&#160;nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention due to their fascinating applications in sustainable and clean&#8208;energy&#8208;related devices, but obtaining ultrathin 2D multimetallic polycrystalline structures with large lateral dimensions remains a challenge. In this study, ultrathin 2D porous PtAgBiTe and PtBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets (PNSs) are obtained via a visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoinduced Bi2Te3&#8208;nanosheet&#8208;mediated route. The PtAgBiTe PNSs are assembled by sub&#8208;5&#160;nm grains with widths beyond 700&#160;nm. Strain and ligand effects originating from the porous, curly polycrystalline structure endow the PtAgBiTe PNSs with robust hydrazine hydrate oxidation reaction activity. Theoretical research demonstrates that the modified Pt activates the N&#8211;H bonds in N2H4 during the reaction, and strong hybridization between Pt&#8208;5d and N&#8208;2p facilitates dehydrogenation while reducing energy consumption. The peak power densities of the PtAgBiTe PNSs in actual hydrazine&#8208;O2/air fuel cell devices are boosted to 532.9/315.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, while those of the commercial Pt/C are 394.7/157.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This work provides a strategy not only for preparing ultrathin multimetallic PNSs but also for finding promising electrocatalysts for actual hydrazine fuel cells.

         <title>Printed Divisional Optical Biochip for Multiplex Visualizable Exosome Analysis at Point&#8208;Of&#8208;Care</title>

Abstract
Rapid detection of various exosomes is of great significance in early diagnosis and postoperative monitoring of cancers. Here, we&#160;report a divisional optical biochip for multiplex exosome analysis via combining the self&#8208;assembly of nanochains and precise surface patterning. Arising from resonance&#8208;induced near&#8208;field enhancement, the nanochains show distinct color changes after capturing target exosomes for direct visual detection. Then, a series of divisional nanochain&#8208;based biochips conjugated with several specific antibodies are fabricated through designed hydrophilic and hydrophobic patterns. Because of significant wettability difference, one sample droplet is precisely self&#8208;splitting into several microdroplets enabling simultaneous identification of multiple target exosomes in 30&#160;min with a sensitivity of 6&#215;107 particles/ml, which is about two orders lower than enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay. Apart from the trace amount detection, excellent semiquantitative capability is demonstrated to distinguish clinical exosomes from glioblastoma patients and healthy people. This method is simple, versatile, and highly efficient that can be extended as a diagnostic tool for many diseases, promoting the development of liquid biopsy.

         <title>p&#8208;Phenylenediamine&#8208;Bridged Binder&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Unified Supramolecules for Versatile Lithium Secondary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The binder is an essential component in determining the structural integrity and ionic conductivity of Li&#8208;ion battery electrodes. However, conventional binders are not sufficiently conductive and durable to be used with solid&#8208;state electrolytes. In this study, we propose a novel system for a Li secondary battery that combines the electrolyte and binder into a unified structure, which is achieved by employing para&#8208;phenylenediamine (pPD) moiety to create supramolecular bridges between the parent binders. Due to a partial crosslinking effect and charge&#8208;transferring structure of pPD, the proposed strategy improves both the ionic conductivity and mechanical properties by a factor of 6.4 (achieving a conductivity of 3.73 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 for PEO&#8208;pPD) and 4.4 (reaching a mechanical strength of 151.4&#160;kPa for PAA&#8208;pPD) compared to those of conventional parent binders. As a result, when the supramolecules of pPD are used as a binder in a pouch cell with a lean electrolyte loading of 2&#160;&#956;L mAh&#8722;1, a capacity retention of 80.2% is achieved even after 300 cycles. Furthermore, when it is utilized as a solid&#8208;state electrolyte, an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% and capacity retention of 98.7% are attained under operations at 50&#176;C without external pressure or a pre&#8208;aging process.

         <title>Fruit&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicles Engineered Structural Droplet Drugs for Enhanced Glioblastoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Existing solid nanoparticle&#8208;based drug delivery systems remain a great challenge for glioblastoma chemotherapy due to their poor capacities in crossing the blood&#8208;brain barrier/blood&#8208;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB). Herein, we demonstrated fruit&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (EVs)&#8208;engineered structural droplet drugs (ESDD) by programming the self&#8208;assembly of fruit&#8208;derived EVs at the DOX@squalene&#8208;PBS interface, greatly enhancing the antitumor efficacy against glioblastoma. The EVs&#8208;engineered structural droplet drugs experience a flexible delivery via deformation&#8208;amplified macropinocytosis and membrane fusion, enabling them to highly efficiently cross BBB/BBTB and deeply penetrate glioblastoma tissues. As expected, the EVs&#8208;engineered structural droplet drugs exhibited 2.5&#8208;fold intracellular uptake, 2.2&#8208;fold transcytosis, and 5&#8208;fold membrane fusion as higher as the EVs (cRGD modified), allowing the highly efficient accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization into the glioblastoma tissues and thereby significantly extending the survival time of glioblastoma mice.

         <title>Constructing Chiral Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Circular Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The use of chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as active elements in photodetectors to directly identify circularly polarized light (CPL) can meet the requirement of integration and miniaturization of the as&#8208;fabricated devices. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of two isoreticular chiral two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs (CityU&#8208;7 and CityU&#8208;8) by introducing photosensitive porphyrin&#8208;based amines (5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin) to enhance the optical absorption and chiral aldehyde linkage (2,5&#8208;bis((S/R))&#8208;2&#8208;methylbutoxy)terephthalaldehyde) to engender chirality for direct CPL detection. Their crystalline structures were confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy and low&#8208;dose transition electron microscopy. Employing both chiral COFs as the active layers in photodetectors, left&#8208;handed circularly (LHC) and right&#8208;handed circularly (RHC) polarized light at 405&#160;nm can be well distinguishable with short response time, high responsivity and satisfying detectivity. Our study provides the first example on the design and synthesis of chiral COFs for direct detection of CPL.

         <title>High&#8208;rate Lithium&#8208;Selenium Batteries Boosted by A Multifunctional Janus Separator Over A Wide Temperature Range of &#8722;30 to 60&#176;C</title>

Abstract
Lithium&#8211;selenium batteries are characterized by high volumetric capacity comparable to Li&#8208;S batteries, while &#8764;1025 times higher electrical conductivity of Se than S favorable for high&#8208;rate capability. However, they also suffer from the &#8220;shuttling effect&#8221; of lithium polyselenides (LPSes) and Li dendrite growth. Herein, we design a multifunctional Janus separator by coating hierarchical nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (hNCNC) and AlN nanowires on two sides of commercial polypropylene (PP) separator to overcome these hindrances. At room temperature, the Li&#8208;Se batteries with the Janus separator exhibit an unprecedented high&#8208;rate capability (331 mAh g&#8722;1 at 25 C) and retain a high capacity of 408 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 C after 500 cycles. Moreover, the high retained capacities are achieved over a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 to 60&#176;C, showing the potential application under extreme environments. The excellent performances result from the &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8242; synergism of suppressed LPSes shuttling by chemisorption and electrocatalysis of hNCNC on the cathode side and suppressed Li&#8208;dendrite growth by thermally conductive AlN&#8208;network on the anode side, which can be well understood by the &#8216;Bucket Effect&#8221;. This Janus separator provides a general strategy to develop high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;chalcogen (Se, S, SeS2) batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8211;selenium batteries are characterized by high volumetric capacity comparable to Li-S batteries, while &#8764;10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; times higher electrical conductivity of Se than S favorable for high-rate capability. However, they also suffer from the &#8220;shuttling effect&#8221; of lithium polyselenides (LPSes) and Li dendrite growth. Herein, we design a multifunctional Janus separator by coating hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages (hNCNC) and AlN nanowires on two sides of commercial polypropylene (PP) separator to overcome these hindrances. At room temperature, the Li-Se batteries with the Janus separator exhibit an unprecedented high-rate capability (331 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25 C) and retain a high capacity of 408 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 3 C after 500 cycles. Moreover, the high retained capacities are achieved over a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 to 60&#176;C, showing the potential application under extreme environments. The excellent performances result from the &#8220;1+1&amp;gt;2&#8242; synergism of suppressed LPSes shuttling by chemisorption and electrocatalysis of hNCNC on the cathode side and suppressed Li-dendrite growth by thermally conductive AlN-network on the anode side, which can be well understood by the &#8216;Bucket Effect&#8221;. This Janus separator provides a general strategy to develop high-performance lithium-chalcogen (Se, S, SeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Advanced Catalyst Design and Reactor Configuration Upgrade in Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) driven by renewable energy shows great promise in mitigating and potentially reversing the devastating effects of anthropogenic climate change and environmental degradation. The simultaneous synthesis of energy&#8208;dense chemicals can meet global energy demand while decoupling emissions from economic growth. However, the development of CO2RR technology faces challenges in catalyst discovery and device optimization that hinder their industrial implementation. In this contribution, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of CO2RR research, starting with the background and motivation for this technology, followed by the fundamentals and evaluated metrics. We then discuss the underlying design principles of electrocatalysts, emphasizing their structure&#8211;performance correlations and advanced electrochemical assembly cells that can increase CO2RR selectivity and throughput. Finally, we look to the future and identify opportunities for innovation in mechanism discovery, material screening strategies, and device assemblies to move toward a carbon&#8208;neutral society.

         <title>Cellular Membrane&#8208;Engineered Nanovesicles as Three&#8208;Stage Booster to Target Lesion Core</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lesion core is the area with the most serious injury and vigorous repair. Existing nanocarriers are difficult to break through the targeted delivery to lesion core and the precise treatment for intracellular and extracellular microenvironment. Herein, a cellular membrane&#8208;engineered nanovesicle (CMEV) with hierarchical structure is constructed using double emulsion&#8208;extrusion method, by integrating neutrophil membrane, functional antibody and gelled drug&#8208;loaded core, as &#8216;three&#8208;stage booster&#8217; to target the lesion core and deliver catestatin (CST), a small therapeutic peptide, for ischemic cardiomyopathy therapy. By coating neutrophil membrane outside the shell, CMEV is endowed with the function of neutrophil&#8208;like migration to achieve the first stage of tissue targeting. Based on the specific anchoring to injured myocardium, myosin light chain 3 (MLC3) antibody was embedded to fulfill the second stage of CMEV accumulation in lesion core. The gelled core containing CST&#8208;sodium alginate (NaAlg) with pH&#8208;responsive shell is prepared by ionic cross&#8208;linking to accomplish the third stage of precise CST administration. Triggered by the microenvironment, NaAlg electrostatically adheres to the lesion core for sustained release, enhancing the efficacy of CST in improving cardiomyocyte apoptosis, excessive fibrosis, macrophage polarization and angiogenesis. Thus, the &#8220;three&#8208;stage booster&#8221; nanovesicle significantly ameliorates cardiac function and adverse remodeling to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy.

         <title>Rocket&#8208;Inspired Effervescent Motors for Oral Macromolecule Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure and function of rockets, a novel micromotor delivery system is presented with scaled&#8208;down rocket&#8208;like architecture and effervescent&#8208;tablets&#8208;derived fuel for efficient oral macromolecule delivery by penetrating the intestinal barrier. It is demonstrated that these motors can efficiently move and stab into the intestinal mucosa for insulin delivery, exhibiting efficacy in regulating blood glucose level in a&#160;diabetic rabbit model.








Abstract
Oral administration is among the most convenient ways with good patient compliance for drug delivery; while it remains a challenge to achieve desirable bioavailability of most macromolecules due to the complex gastrointestinal barriers. Here, inspired by the structure and function of rocket, a novel micromotor delivery system is presented with scaled&#8208;down rocket&#8208;like architecture and effervescent&#8208;tablets&#8208;derived fuel for efficient oral macromolecule delivery by penetrating intestinal barrier. These rocket&#8208;inspired effervescent motors (RIEMs) are composed of sharp needle tips for both loading cargoes and efficient penetrating, and tail wings for loading effervescent powders and avoiding perforation. When exposed to a water environment, the effervescent fuel generates intensive CO2 bubbles to propel the RIEMs to move at high speed. Thus, the RIEMs with their sharp tip can inject into the surrounding mucosa for effective drug release. Furthermore, benefiting from their tail&#8208;wing design, perforation can be effectively avoided during the injection process, ensuring the safety of the RIEMs in gastrointestinal active delivery. Based on these advantages, it is demonstrated that the RIEMs can efficiently move and stab into the intestinal mucosa for insulin delivery, exhibiting efficacy in regulating blood sugar glucose in a diabetic rabbit model. These features indicate that these RIEMs are versatile and valuable for clinical oral delivery of macromolecules.

         <title>Microporogen&#8208;Structured Collagen Matrices for Embedded Bioprinting of Tumor Models for Immuno&#8208;Oncology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microporous collagen matrix is developed for embedded printing of a 3D melanoma tumor model. This microporogen&#8208;structured matrix exhibits a fibrillar collagen type&#8208;I network akin to that observed in vivo. Printed tumor cells remain viable and proliferate, while antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells incorporated in the matrix migrate to the tumor site, where they induce cell death.








Abstract
Embedded bioprinting enables the rapid design and fabrication of complex tissues that recapitulate in vivo microenvironments. However, few biological matrices enable good print fidelity, while simultaneously facilitate cell viability, proliferation, and migration. Here, a new microporogen&#8208;structured (&#181;POROS) matrix for embedded bioprinting is introduced, in which matrix rheology, printing behavior, and porosity are tailored by adding sacrificial microparticles composed of a gelatin&#8211;chitosan complex to a prepolymer collagen solution. To demonstrate its utility, a 3D tumor model is created via embedded printing of a murine melanoma cell ink within the &#181;POROS collagen matrix at 4 &#176;C. The collagen matrix is subsequently crosslinked around the microparticles upon warming to 21&#160;&#176;C, followed by their melting and removal at 37&#160;&#176;C. This process results in a &#181;POROS matrix with a fibrillar collagen type&#8208;I network akin to that observed in vivo. Printed tumor cells remain viable and proliferate, while antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells incorporated in the matrix migrate to the tumor site, where they induce cell death. The integration of the &#181;POROS matrix with embedded bioprinting opens new avenues for creating complex tissue microenvironments in vitro that may find widespread use in drug discovery, disease modeling, and tissue engineering for therapeutic use.

         <title>Large Magnetoresistance of Isolated Domain Walls in La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation, manipulation, and sensing of magnetic domain walls are cornerstones in the design of more efficient spintronic devices. In this work, it is shown that the domain wall magnetoresistance in manganite perovskite nanowires can reach values in excess of 10% caused by the mistracking effect of the spin texture of the domain wall by the conduction electrons.








Abstract
Generation, manipulation, and sensing of magnetic domain walls are cornerstones in the design of efficient spintronic devices.

         <title>Soft Multimaterial Magnetic Fibers and Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preform&#8208;to&#8208;fiber thermal drawing of magnetically responsive soft composite materials enables the fabrication of magnetic fibers with extreme aspect ratios and intricate internal multimaterial structures, resulting in diverse functionalities. The soft magnetic fibers can optimally steer in many different directions, lift heavy loads, and also can be weaved into forming functional magnetic textiles for programmable shape&#8208;morphing. 








Abstract
Magnetically responsive soft materials are promising building blocks for the next generation of soft robotics, prosthesis, surgical tools, and smart textiles. To date, however, the fabrication of highly integrated magnetic fibers with extreme aspect ratios, that can be used as steerable catheters, endoscopes, or within functional textiles remains challenging. Here, multimaterial thermal drawing is proposed as a material and processing platform to realize 10s of meters long soft, ultrastretchable, yet highly resilient magnetic fibers. Fibers with a diameter as low as 300&#160;&#181;m and an aspect ratio of 105 are demonstrated, integrating nanocomposite domains with ferromagnetic microparticles embedded in a soft elastomeric matrix. With the proper choice of filler content that must strike the right balance between magnetization density and mechanical stiffness, fibers withstanding strains of &gt;1000% are shown, which can be magnetically actuated and lift up to 370 times their own weight. Magnetic fibers can also integrate other functionalities like microfluidic channels, and be weaved into conventional textiles. It is shown that the novel magnetic textiles can be washed and sustain extreme mechanical constraints, as well as be folded into arbitrary shapes when magnetically actuated, paving the way toward novel intriguing opportunities in medical textiles and soft magnetic systems.

         <title>Skyrmion&#8208;Excited Spin&#8208;Wave Fractal Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic dynamics within a lattice of topologically protected skyrmions and the resulting spin&#8208;wave emissions are measured using small&#8208;angle neutron scattering with in situ ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neutron scattering identifies a dynamic fractal network constructed from the interfering spin waves. The structure of the fractal network shows correlation to the length scales of the skyrmion and skyrmion lattice.









Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions exhibit unique, technologically relevant pseudo&#8208;particle behaviors which arise from their topological protection, including well&#8208;defined, 3D dynamic modes that occur at microwave frequencies. During dynamic excitation, spin waves are ejected into the interstitial regions between skyrmions, creating&#160;the magnetic equivalent of a turbulent&#160;sea. However, since the spin waves in these systems have a well&#8208;defined length scale, and the skyrmions are on an ordered lattice, ordered structures from spin&#8208;wave interference can precipitate from the chaos. This work uses small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS)&#160;to capture the dynamics in hybrid skyrmions and investigate the spin&#8208;wave structure. Performing simultaneous ferromagnetic resonance and SANS, the diffraction pattern shows a large increase in low&#8208;angle&#160;scattering intensity, which is present only in the resonance&#160;condition. This scattering pattern is best fit using a mass fractal model, which suggests the spin waves form a long&#8208;range fractal network. The fractal structure is constructed of fundamental units with a size that encodes the spin&#8208;wave emissions and are constrained by the skyrmion lattice. These results offer critical insights into the nanoscale dynamics of skyrmions, identify a new dynamic spin&#8208;wave fractal structure, and demonstrate SANS as a unique tool to probe high&#8208;speed dynamics.

         <title>Neonatal&#8208;Tissue&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicle Therapy (NEXT): A Potent Strategy for Precision Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large amounts of extracellular vesicles (EVs) can be produced from desired tissues with high yield/purity and low time/cost. Tissue&#8208;derived EVs exert tissue repair effects in an age&#8208; and donor tissue type specific manner, and neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EVs have favorable repair potential in diverse forms of tissue injury. Neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EV therapy (NEXT) may provide a new avenue for precision tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;based therapies have emerged as a promising means in regenerative medicine. However, the conventional EV therapy strategy displays some limitations, such as inefficient EV production and lack of tissue&#8208;specific repair effects. Here, it is reported that neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EV therapy (NEXT) is a potent strategy for precision tissue repair. In brief, large amounts of EVs with higher yield/purity can be readily isolated from desired tissues with less production time/cost compared to the conventional cell&#8208;culture&#8208;based method. Moreover, source factors, such as age and tissue type, can affect the repair efficacy of such tissue&#8208;derived EVs in different tissue injury models (skin wounds and acute kidney injury), and neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EVs show superior tissue repair potency compared with adult&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EVs. Different age&#8208; or tissue&#8208;type&#8208;derived EVs have distinct composition (e.g., protein) signatures that are likely due to the diverse metabolic patterns of the donor tissues, which may contribute to the specific repair action modes of NEXT in different types of tissue injury. Furthermore, neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EVs can be incorporated with bioactive materials for advanced tissue repair. This study highlights that the NEXT strategy may provide a new avenue for precision tissue repair in many types of tissue injury.

         <title>Judicious Heteroatom Doping Produces High&#8208;Performance Deep&#8208;Blue/Near&#8208;UV Multiresonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>

Transformation of a deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter, DIDOBNA&#8208;N, to a narrowband near&#8208;UV emitter, MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N is demonstrated. Efficient deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with EQEmax and CIEy coordinate of 15.3% and 0.073 with DIDOBNA&#8208;N and 16.2% and 0.049 with MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N illustrate the promise of the molecular design of these emitters.








Abstract
Two multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are presented and it is shown how further borylation of a deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter, DIDOBNA&#8208;N, both blueshifts and narrows the emission producing a new near&#8208;UV MR&#8208;TADF emitter, MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N, are shown. DIDOBNA&#8208;N emits bright blue light (&#934;PL = 444&#160;nm, FWHM = 64&#160;nm, &#934;PL = 81%, &#964;d = 23 ms, 1.5 wt% in TSPO1). The deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on this twisted MR&#8208;TADF compound shows a very high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 15.3% for a device with CIEy of 0.073. The fused planar MR&#8208;TADF emitter, MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N shows efficient and narrowband near&#8208;UV emission (&#955;PL = 402&#160;nm, FWHM = 19&#160;nm, &#934;PL = 74.7%, &#964;d = 133 ms, 1.5 wt% in TSPO1). The best OLED with MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N, doped in a co&#8208;host, shows the highest efficiency reported for a near&#8208;UV OLED at 16.2%. With a CIEy coordinate of 0.049, this device also shows the bluest EL reported for a MR&#8208;TADF OLED to date.

&lt;p&gt;Transformation of a deep-blue MR-TADF emitter, DIDOBNA-N, to a narrowband near-UV emitter, MesB-DIDOBNA-N is demonstrated. Efficient deep-blue OLEDs with EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and CIE&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; coordinate of 15.3% and 0.073 with DIDOBNA-N and 16.2% and 0.049 with MesB-DIDOBNA-N illustrate the promise of the molecular design of these emitters.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters are presented and it is shown how further borylation of a deep-blue MR-TADF emitter, DIDOBNA-N, both blueshifts and narrows the emission producing a new near-UV MR-TADF emitter, MesB-DIDOBNA-N, are shown. DIDOBNA-N emits bright blue light (&#934;&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt; = 444&#160;nm, FWHM = 64&#160;nm, &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt; = 81%, &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 23 ms, 1.5 wt% in TSPO1). The deep-blue organic light-emitting diode (OLED) based on this twisted MR-TADF compound shows a very high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 15.3% for a device with CIE&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.073. The fused planar MR-TADF emitter, MesB-DIDOBNA-N shows efficient and narrowband near-UV emission (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt; = 402&#160;nm, FWHM = 19&#160;nm, &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt; = 74.7%, &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 133 ms, 1.5 wt% in TSPO1). The best OLED with MesB-DIDOBNA-N, doped in a co-host, shows the highest efficiency reported for a near-UV OLED at 16.2%. With a CIE&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; coordinate of 0.049, this device also shows the bluest EL reported for a MR-TADF OLED to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Separating Crystal Growth from Nucleation Enables the In Situ Controllable Synthesis of Nanocrystals for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylic acid&#8208;containing ammonium ligands separate nucleation and crystal growth in in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed perovskite nanocrystals, enabling quantum&#8208;confined nanocrystals with narrow size distributions. Deprotonated phosphonates further enhance photoluminescence quantum yields to unity through defect passivation. These allow for perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with a maximum current efficiency of 109&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1 and a 45.6 h operating half&#8208;time with an initial brightness of 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) display bright luminescence for light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) applications; however, they require post&#8208;synthesis ligand exchange that may cause surface degradation and defect formation. In situ&#8208;formed PNCs achieve improved surface passivation using a straightforward synthetic approach, but their LED performance at the green wavelength is not yet comparable with that of colloidal PNC devices. Here, it is found that the limitations of in situ&#8208;formed PNCs stem from uncontrolled formation kinetics: conventional surface ligands confine perovskite nuclei but fail to delay crystal growth. A bifunctional carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;containing ammonium hydrobromide ligand that separates crystal growth from nucleation is introduced, leading to the formation of quantum&#8208;confined PNC solids exhibiting a narrow size distribution. Controlled crystallization is further coupled with defect passivation using deprotonated phosphinates, enabling improvements in photoluminescence quantum yield to near unity. Green LEDs are fabricated with a maximum current efficiency of 109&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1 and an average external quantum efficiency of 22.5% across 25 devices, exceeding the performance of their colloidal PNC&#8208;based counterparts. A 45.6 h operating half&#8208;time is further documented for an unencapsulated device in N2 with an initial brightness of 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.

         <title>A Sodium Alginate&#8208;Based Multifunctional Nanoplatform for Synergistic Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sodium alginate (ALG)&#8208;based multifunctional nanoplatform is developed by using constant &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;mannuronic acid (M) units and modulated &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;guluronic acid (G) units in the ALG structure for synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which not only integrates the natural immunity of ALG and the immunogenic cell death (ICD) triggering function of DOX, but also shows dual targeting properties to HCC cells.








Abstract
Efficient hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment remains a significant challenge due to&#160;the inherent limitations of traditional strategies. The exploration of polysaccharides&#8217; natural immunity for HCC immunotherapy is rarely explored. For this purpose, facile construction of a multifunctional nanoplatform, biotinylated aldehyde alginate&#8208;doxorubicin nano micelle (BEA&#63743;C&#63742;N&#63743;DOX&#63743;M) is reported in this study for synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy by using constant &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;mannuronic acid (M) units and modulated &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;guluronic acid (G) units in the alginate (ALG) structure. The M units show natural immunity and specific binding ability with mannose receptors (MRs) via strong receptor&#8208;ligand interactions, and the G units serve as highly reactive conjugation sites for biotin (Bio) and DOX. Therefore, this formulation not only integrates the natural immunity of ALG and the immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#160;triggering function of DOX, but also shows dual targeting properties to HCC cells via MRs and Bio receptors (BRs)&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Notably, BEA&#63743;C&#63742;N&#63743;DOX&#63743;M mediates a tumor inhibitory efficiency 12.10% and 4.70% higher than free DOX and single targeting aldehyde alginate&#8208;doxorubicin nano micelle controls, respectively, at an equivalent DOX dose of 3 mg kg&#8722;1 in Hepa1&#8208;6 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study reports the first example of integrating the natural immunity of ALG and the ICD effect of anticancer drugs&#160;for enhanced chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of HCC.

         <title>Formation of Amorphous Iron&#8208;Calcium Phosphate with High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;bearing amorphous calcium phosphate (Fe&#8208;ACP) is prepared in the presence of ammonium iron citrate. The Fe&#8208;ACP particles can be highly stable in water and simulated body fluid. The particles show good biocompatibility and osteogenic properties. By applying the Fe&#8208;ACP particles as initial powders, calcium iron phosphate ceramics with superior mechanical strength and acid resistance are prepared.








Abstract
Amorphous iron&#8208;calcium phosphate (Fe&#8208;ACP) plays a vital role in the mechanical properties of teeth of some rodents, which are very hard, but its formation process and synthetic route remain unknown. Here, the synthesis and characterization of an iron&#8208;bearing amorphous calcium phosphate in the presence of ammonium iron citrate (AIC) are reported. The iron is distributed homogeneously on the nanometer scale in the resulting particles. The prepared Fe&#8208;ACP particles can be highly stable in aqueous media, including water, simulated body fluid, and acetate buffer solution (pH 4). In vitro study demonstrates that these particles have good biocompatibility and osteogenic properties. Subsequently, Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) is utilized to consolidate the initial Fe&#8208;ACP powders. The results show that the hardness of the ceramics increases with the increase of iron content, but an excess of iron leads to a rapid decline in hardness. Calcium iron phosphate ceramics with a hardness of 4&#160;GPa can be achieved, which is higher than that of human enamel. Furthermore, the ceramics composed of iron&#8208;calcium phosphates show enhanced acid resistance. This study provides a novel route to prepare Fe&#8208;ACP, and presents the potential role of Fe&#8208;ACP in biomineralization and as starting material to fabricate acid&#8208;resistant high&#8208;performance bioceramics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;hydrogel that mimics the protein content and stiffness of healthy lung tissue is synthesized. Lung&#8208;mimicking material is applied&#160;to reveal the ability of tenascin&#8208;C to activate fibroblasts in lung&#8208;metastatic breast cancer. This novel hydrogel environment will be incredibly useful for research questions involving the lung extracellular matrix.








Abstract
The lung extracellular matrix (ECM) maintains the structural integrity of the tissue and regulates the phenotype and functions of resident fibroblasts. Lung&#8208;metastatic breast cancer alters these cell&#8208;ECM interactions, promoting fibroblast activation. There is a need for bio&#8208;instructive ECM models that match the ECM composition and biomechanics of the lung to study these cell&#8208;matrix interactions in vitro. Here, a synthetic, bioactive hydrogel is synthesized that mimics the native lung modulus and includes a representative distribution of the most abundant ECM peptide motifs responsible for integrin&#8208;binding and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;mediated degradation in the lung, which enables quiescent culture of human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). Stimulation with transforming growth factor &#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1), metastatic breast cancer conditioned media (CM), or tenascin&#8208;C&#8208;derived integrin&#8208;binding peptide activated hydrogel&#8208;encapsulated HLFs demonstrates multiple environmental methods to activate HLFs in a lung ECM&#8208;mimicking hydrogel. This lung hydrogel platform is a tunable, synthetic approach to studying the independent and combinatorial effects of ECM in regulating fibroblast quiescence and activation.

         <title>A Synthetic Signaling Network Imitating the Action of&#160;Immune Cells in Response to Bacterial Metabolism</title>

         <dc:description>
Bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology aims to replicate useful biological functions, but mimicking complex behaviors such as immunity remains elusive. In this work, a consortium of DNA particles and liposomes is shown to detect bacteria, trap them, and expose them to antibiotics, imitating a response of the immune system. These results demonstrate the bottom&#8208;up design of advanced life&#8208;like responses and outline new antimicrobial strategies. 








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology allows to replicate many basic biological functions in artificial&#8208;cell&#8208;like devices. To mimic more complex behaviors, however, artificial cells would need to perform many of these functions in a synergistic and coordinated fashion, which remains elusive. Here, a sophisticated biological response is considered, namely the capture and deactivation of pathogens by neutrophil immune cells, through the process of netosis. A consortium consisting of two synthetic agents is designed&#8212;responsive DNA&#8208;based particles and antibiotic&#8208;loaded lipid vesicles&#8212;whose coordinated action mimics the sought immune&#8208;like response when triggered by bacterial metabolism. The artificial netosis&#8208;like response emerges from a series of interlinked sensing and communication pathways between the live and synthetic agents, and translates into both physical and chemical antimicrobial actions, namely bacteria immobilization and exposure to antibiotics. The results demonstrate how advanced life&#8208;like responses can be prescribed with a relatively small number of synthetic molecular components, and outlines a new strategy for artificial&#8208;cell&#8208;based antimicrobial solutions.

         <title>Bi&#8208;Chiral Nanostructures Featuring Dynamic Optical Rotatory Dispersion for Polychromatic Light Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bi&#8208;chiral liquid crystalline nanostructure is proposed by customizing the transverse and longitudinal configuration of opposite&#8208;handed cholesteric liquid crystals. Thanks to the reflective version of the common optical rotatory dispersion, the spin&#8208;decoupled geometric phase modulation, and their multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness, the dynamic color&#8208;tunable holography is realized desirably. This extremely extends the construction of soft chiral nanostructures and enlightens polychromatic light multiplexing.








Abstract
Chiral nanostructures featuring the unique optical activity have attracted broad interests from scientists. The typical polarization rotation of transmitted light is usually wavelength dependent, namely the optical rotatory dispersion. However, its dynamic tunability and intriguing collaboration with other optical degrees of freedom, especially the highly desired spatial phase, remain elusive. Herein, a bi&#8208;chiral liquid crystalline nanostructure is proposed to induce an effect called reflective optical rotatory dispersion. Thanks to the independent manipulation of opposite&#8208;handed self&#8208;assembled helices, spin&#8208;decoupled geometric phases are induced simultaneously. These naturally unite multi&#8208;dimensions of light and versatile stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of soft matter. Dynamic holography driven by heat and electric field is demonstrated with a fast response. For polychromatic light, the hybrid multiplexed holographic painting is exhibited with fruitful tunable colors. This study extends the ingenious construction of soft chiral superstructures, presents an open&#8208;ended strategy for on&#8208;demand light control, and enlightens advanced applications of display, optical computing, and communication.

         <title>3D Optical Coherence Thermometry Using Polymeric Nanogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Translation of nanothermometry to the clinic faces limitations like lack of 3D thermal images and the need for tools that are clinically unavailable. To overcome them, optical coherence thermometry (OCTh) is developed by combining thermoresponsive nanogels with conventional optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems employed daily at hospitals. OCTh makes possible 3D thermal imaging of tissues subjected to photothermal processes.








Abstract
In nanothermometry, the use of nanoparticles as thermal probes enables remote and minimally invasive sensing. In the biomedical context, nanothermometry has emerged as a powerful tool where traditional approaches, like infrared thermal sensing and contact thermometers, fall short. Despite the strides of this technology in preclinical settings, nanothermometry is not mature enough to be translated to the bedside. This is due to two major hurdles: the inability to perform 3D&#160;thermal imaging and the requirement for tools that are readily available in the clinics. This work simultaneously overcomes both limitations by proposing the technology of optical coherence thermometry (OCTh). This is achieved by combining thermoresponsive polymeric nanogels and optical coherence tomography (OCT)&#8212;a 3D imaging technology routinely used in clinical practice. The volume phase transition of the thermoresponsive nanogels causes marked changes in their refractive index, making them temperature&#8208;sensitive OCT contrast agents. The ability of OCTh to provide 3D thermal images is demonstrated in tissue phantoms subjected to photothermal processes, and its reliability is corroborated by comparing experimental results with numerical simulations. The results included in this work set credible foundations for the implementation of nanothermometry in the form of OCTh in clinical practice.

         <title>Multifunctional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Capsules Modulate Reactivity of Lead Iodide toward Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells with UV Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8@formamidinium iodide multifunctional capsules induces porous channels within the lead iodide layer, facilitating the nucleation of perovskite nuclei and improving the light utilization through down&#8208;conversion effect. The utilization of this approach has resulted in a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.08%, along with enhanced long&#8208;term stability under UV and humid conditions.








Abstract
The two&#8208;step sequential deposition process is demonstrated as a reliable technology for the fabrication of efficient perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). However, the complete conversion of dense PbI2 to perovskite in planar PVSCs is tough without mesoporous titanium dioxide as support. Herein, multifunctional capsules consisting of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) encapsulant and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are introduced between tin oxide (SnO2) and lead iodide (PbI2) layer. Intriguingly, the capsule dopant interlayer benefits the formation of porous PbI2 film due to the porous nanostructure of ZIF&#8208;8 that is favorable for the subsequent intercalation reaction. Furthermore, the constituent of the perovskite precursor in ZIF&#8208;8 pores can convert into the crystal nuclei of perovskite by reacting with PbI2 first, thereby promoting further perovskite crystallization. Significantly, the incorporation of ZIF&#8208;8 can enhance the resistance of perovskite against UV illumination due to down&#8208;conversion effect. Consequently, the modified device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.08% and displays enhanced UV stability, which can sustain 83% of its original PCE under 365&#160;nm UV illumination for 300&#160;h. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintains 90% of initial PCE after 1500&#160;h storage in dark ambient conditions with a relative humidity range of 50%&#8211;70%.

Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintains 90% of initial PCE after 1500&#160;h storage in dark ambient conditions with a relative humidity range of 50%&#8211;70%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Control of Enzyme Reactivity in Response to Osmotic Pressure Modulation Mimicking Dynamic Assembly of Intracellular Organelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mimic the dynamic assembly of intracellular stress membraneless organelles inside living cells, elastin&#8208;like polypeptide&#8208;derived components are encapsulated within partially dewetted liposomes and can respond rapidly to hyperosmotic stress by undergoing fast phase separation to assemble biofunctional synthetic organelles. These synthetic organelles are enzymatically active and capable of controlling the rate of enzymatic reactions by locally segregating the enzyme and substrate.








Abstract
In response to variations in osmotic stress, in particular to hypertonicity associated with biological dysregulations, cells have developed complex mechanisms to release their excess water, thus avoiding their bursting and death. When water is expelled, cells shrink and concentrate their internal bio(macro)molecular content, inducing the formation of membraneless organelles following a liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) mechanism. To mimic this intrinsic property of cells, functional thermo&#8208;responsive elastin&#8208;like polypeptide (ELP) biomacromolecular conjugates are herein encapsulated into self&#8208;assembled lipid vesicles using a microfluidic system, together with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to mimic cells&#8217; interior crowded microenvironment. By inducing a hypertonic shock onto the vesicles, expelled water induces a local increase in concentration and a concomitant decrease in the cloud point temperature (Tcp) of ELP bioconjugates that phase separate and form coacervates mimicking cellular stress&#8208;induced membraneless organelle assemblies. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), as a model enzyme, is bioconjugated to ELPs and is locally confined in coacervates as a response to osmotic stress. This consequently increases local HRP and substrate concentrations and accelerates the kinetics of the enzymatic reaction. These results illustrate a unique way to fine&#8208;tune enzymatic reactions dynamically as a response to a physiological change in isothermal conditions.

         <title>Fundamentals of Skin Bioimpedances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multilayer structure of skin and the electrically insulating nature of the stratum corneum, which is the outermost layer of skin, complicate the electrical characterization of skin. In this work,&#160;the theoretical framework and the design strategies for overcoming these long&#8208;standing issues are established. The results may advance bioimpedance for skin cancer diagnosis or for assessing type&#8208;2 diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular risk.








Abstract
The bioimpedances of tissues beyond the stratum corneum, which is the outermost layer of skin, contain crucial clinical information. Nevertheless, bioimpedance measurements of both the viable skin and the adipose tissue are not widely used, mainly because of the complex multilayered skin structure and the electrically insulating nature of the stratum corneum. Here, a theoretical framework is established for analyzing the impedances of multilayered tissues and, in particular, of skin. Then, strategies are determined for the system&#8208;level design of electrodes and electronics, which minimize 4&#8208;wire (or tetrapolar) measurement errors even in the presence of a top insulating tissue, thus enabling non&#8208;invasive characterizations of tissues beyond the stratum corneum. As an example, non&#8208;invasive measurements of bioimpedances of living tissues are demonstrated in the presence of parasitic impedances which are much (e.g., up to 350 times) higher than the bioimpedances of the living tissues beyond the stratum corneum, independently on extreme variations of the barrier (tape stripping) or of the skin&#8211;electrode contact impedances (sweat). The results can advance the development of bioimpedance systems for the characterization of viable skin and adipose tissues in several applications, including transdermal drug delivery and the assessment of skin cancer, obesity, dehydration, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk, and multipotent adult stem cells.

         <title>Greatly Enhanced Resonant Exciton&#8208;Trion Conversion in Electrically Modulated Atomically Thin WS2 at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excitonic resonance in atomically thin semiconductors has the potential to enable highly tunable and ultra&#8208;compact optical devices. However, insufficient light&#8208;matter interactions have hindered the observation of trionic phenomenon and the development of excitonic devices for dynamic applications. To overcome this limitation, an optical cavity is engaged, resulting in greatly enhanced exciton&#8208;trion conversion at room temperature and enabling both amplitude and phase tuning in monolayer tungsten disulfide.








Abstract
Excitonic resonance in atomically thin semiconductors offers a favorite platform to study 2D nanophotonics in both classical and quantum regimes and promises potentials for highly tunable and ultra&#8208;compact optical devices. The understanding of charge density dependent exciton&#8208;trion conversion is the key for revealing the underlaying physics of optical tunability. Nevertheless, the insufficient and inefficient light&#8208;matter interactions hinder the observation of trionic phenomenon and the development of excitonic devices for dynamic power&#8208;efficient electro&#8208;optical applications. Here, by engaging an optical cavity with atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), greatly enhanced exciton&#8208;trion conversion is demonstrated at room temperature (RT) and achieve electrical modulation of reflectivity of &#8776;40% at exciton and 7% at trion state, which correspondingly enables a broadband large phase tuning in monolayer tungsten disulfide. Besides the absorptive conversion, &#8776;100% photoluminescence conversion from excitons to trions is observed at RT, illustrating a clear physical mechanism of an efficient exciton&#8208;trion conversion for extraordinary optical performance. The results indicate that both excitons and trions can play significant roles in electrical modulation of the optical parameters of TMDCs at RT. The work shows the real possibility for realizing electrical tunable and multi&#8208;functional ultra&#8208;thin optical devices using 2D materials.

         <title>Intrinsic Descriptor Guided Noble Metal Cathode Design for Li&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsic descriptor &#966; is discovered to predict high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2 battery cathode materials, which is experimentally verified and effectively guides the design of Pd@graphene catalyst with an ultralow overpotential (0.41&#160;V) and superior cycling performance up to 1400&#160;h.








Abstract
To date, the effect of noble metal (NM) electronic structures on CO2 reaction activity remains unknown, and explicit screening criteria are still lacking for designing highly efficient catalysts in CO2&#8208;breathing batteries. Herein, by preferentially considering the decomposition of key intermediate Li2CO3, an intrinsic descriptor constituted of the dx2&#8722;y2${{\rm{d}}}_{{x}^2 - {y}^2}$ orbital states and the electronegativity for predicting high&#8208;performance cathode material are discovered. As a demonstration, a series of graphene&#8208;supported noble metals (NM@G) as cathodes are fabricated via a fast laser scribing technique. Consistent with the preliminary prediction, Pd@G exhibits an ultralow overpotential (0.41&#160;V), along with superior cycling performance up to 1400&#160;h. Moreover, the overall thermodynamic reaction pathways on NM@G confirm the reliability of the established intrinsic descriptor. This basic finding of the relationship between the electronic properties of noble metal cathodes and the performance of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries provides a novel avenue for designing remarkably efficient cathode materials for metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

Multiple logic gates are constructed via engineered DNA crystals. Their outputs are crystal formation; thus, can be easily observed. In addition to providing a useful biosensing platform, this work, more importantly, points to the potential of using algorithmic self&#8208;assembly as a way to assemble otherwise non&#8208;accessible, complicated crystal architectures.








Abstract
DNA self&#8208;assembly computation is attractive for its potential to perform massively parallel information processing at the molecular level while at the same time maintaining its natural biocompatibility. It has been extensively studied at the individual molecule level, but not as much as ensembles in 3D. Here, the feasibility of implementing logic gates, the basic computation operations, in large ensembles: macroscopic, engineered 3D DNA crystals is demonstrated. The building blocks are the recently developed DNA double crossover&#8208;like (DXL) motifs. They can associate with each other via sticky&#8208;end cohesion. Common logic gates are realized by encoding the inputs within the sticky ends of the motifs. The outputs are demonstrated through the formation of macroscopic crystals that can be easily observed. This study points to a new direction of construction of complex 3D crystal architectures and DNA&#8208;based biosensors with easy readouts.

         <title>Ion Tunnel Matrix Initiated Oriented Attachment for Highly Utilized Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of &#8220;trapping&#8208;then&#8208;planting&#8221; oriented&#8208;attached deposition is demonstrated toward high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;metal anode battery. Stable zinc plating/stripping for 6600 cycles (1320 h) at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% with a rigorous 100% ZUR (zinc utilization ratio) protocol are realized. Moreover, an anode&#8208;limited pouch cell with a low N/P of 1.2 that displays an energy density of 214&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 is constructed; this greatly exceeds commercial aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Metallic zinc is an ideal anode for aqueous energy storage; however, Zn anodes suffer from nonhomogeneous deposition, low reversibility, and dendrite formation; these lead to an overprovision of zinc metal in full cells. Herein, oriented&#8208;attachment&#8208;regulated Zn stacking initiated through a trapping&#8208;then&#8208;planting process with a high zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is reported. Due to the isometric topology features of cubic&#8208;type Prussian blue analog (PBA), the initial Zn plating occurs at specific sites with equal spacing of &#8776;5&#160;&#197; in the direction perpendicular to the substrate; the trace amount of zinc ions trapped in tunnel matrix provides nuclei for the oriented attachment of Zn (002) deposits. As a result, the PBA&#8208;decorated substrate delivers high reversibility of dendrite&#8208;free zinc plating/stripping for more than 6600 cycles (1320&#160;h) and achieves an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5% at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 100% ZUR. Moreover, the anode&#8208;limited full cell with a low negative&#8211;positive electrode ratio (N/P) of 1.2 can be operated stably for 360 cycles, displaying an energy density of 214&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1; this greatly exceeds commercial aqueous batteries. This work provides a proof of concept design of metal anodes with a high utilization ratio and a practical method for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning&#8208;Enabled Intelligent Design of Thermal Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep&#8208;learning&#8208;enabled intelligent design method of thermal metamaterials is proposed by using a deep generative model. To realize automatic, real&#8208;time, and customizable design of thermal metamaterials, this framework is constructed via a pre&#8208;trained deep learning model to achieve an end&#8208;to&#8208;end mapping relationship between thermal response and microstructure, which provides great flexibility in the on&#8208;demand inverse design of thermal metamaterials.








Abstract
Thermal metamaterials are mixture&#8208;based materials that are engineered to manipulate, control, and process the flow of heat, enabling numerous advanced thermal metadevices. Conventional thermal metamaterials are predominantly designed with tractable regular geometries owing to the delicate analytical solution and easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement effective structures. Nevertheless, it is challenging to achieve the design of thermal metamaterials with arbitrary geometry, letting alone intelligent (automatic, real&#8208;time, and customizable) design of thermal metamaterials. Here, an intelligent design framework of thermal metamaterials is presented via a pre&#8208;trained deep learning model, which gracefully achieves the desired functional structures of thermal metamaterials with exceptional speed and efficiency, regardless of arbitrary geometry. It possesses incomparable versatility and is of great flexibility to achieve the corresponding design of thermal metamaterials with different background materials, anisotropic geometries, and thermal functionalities. The transformation thermotics&#8208;induced, freeform, background&#8208;independent, and omnidirectional thermal cloaks, whose structural configurations are automatically designed in real&#8208;time according to shape and background, are numerically and experimentally demonstrated. This study sets up a novel paradigm for an automatic and real&#8208;time design of thermal metamaterials in a new design scenario. More generally, it may open a door to the realization of an intelligent design of metamaterials in also other physical domains.

         <title>Solid&#8211;Liquid Crystal Biphasic Ferroelectrics with Tunable Biferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholestanyl 4&#8208;X&#8208;benzoate (X = Cl, Br, and&#160;I) shows ferroelectricity in solid and liquid&#8208;crystal phases, distinct from traditional ferroelectrics with either solid or liquid&#8208;crystal ferroelectric phases. Its solid&#8211;solid and solid&#8211;liquid crystal transition temperature (TS&#8211;S and TS&#8211;LC) and spontaneous polarization in solid and liquid&#8208;crystal phases can be regulated by halogen substitutions, which are unprecedented in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity has been separately found in numerous solid and liquid crystal materials since its first discovery in 1920. However, a single material with biferroelectricity existing in both solid and liquid crystal phases is very rare, and the regulation of biferroelectricity has never been studied. Here, solid&#8211;liquid crystal biphasic ferroelectrics, cholestanyl 4&#8208;X&#8208;benzoate (4X&#8208;CB, X = Cl, Br, and I), which exhibits biferroelectricity in both the solid and liquid crystal phases, is presented. It is noted that the ferroelectric liquid crystal phase of 4X&#8208;CB is a cholesteric one, distinct from the ordinary chiral smectic ferroelectric liquid crystal phase. Moreover, 4X&#8208;CB shows solid&#8211;solid and solid&#8211;liquid crystal phase transitions, of which the transition temperatures gradually increase from Cl to Br to I substitution. The spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 4X&#8208;CB in both solid and liquid crystal phases can also be regulated by different halogen substitutions, where the 4Br&#8208;CB has the optimal Ps because of the larger molecular dipole moment. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, 4X&#8208;CB is the first ferroelectric with tunable biferroelectricity, which offers a feasible case for the performance optimization of solid&#8211;liquid crystal biphasic ferroelectrics.

         <title>Augmenting Immunogenic Cell Death and Alleviating Myeloid&#8208;Derived Suppressor Cells by Sono&#8208;Activatable Semiconducting Polymer Nanopartners for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sono&#8208;activatable semiconducting polymer nanopartner is reported to overcome post&#8208;treatment hypoxia and target myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells for cancer immunotherapy. The release of drug partners in tumor microenvironment is precisely controlled by ultrasound activation, augmenting immunogenic cell death, and alleviating myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells simultaneously. This sono&#8208;activatable immunotherapeutic strategy greatly amplifies immunological effect for inhibiting bilateral tumor growths and preventing tumor metastases.








Abstract
Inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) by sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is promising for cancer immunotherapy, which however is inefficient due to oxygen depletion that compromises SDT effect and mediates recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The fabrication of sono&#8208;activatable semiconducting polymer nanopartners (SPNTi) to simultaneously augment ICD and alleviate MDSCs for immunotherapy is reported. A sonodynamic semiconducting polymer, hydrophobic hypoxia&#8208;responsive tirapazamine (TPZ)&#8208;conjugate, and MDSC&#8208;targeting drug (ibrutinib) are encapsulated inside such SPNTi with surface shell of a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;cleavable amphiphilic polymer. TPZ and ibrutinib serve as drug partners to enlarge immunotherapeutic effect. Upon sono&#8208;activation, SPNTi generate 1O2 to break 1O2&#8208;cleavable polymers for in situ liberations of TPZ&#8208;conjugate and ibrutinib in tumor sites, and oxygen is consumed to create severe hypoxic tumor microenvironment, in which, TPZ&#8208;conjugate is activated for augmenting ICD action, while ibrutinib alleviates MDSCs for promoting antitumor immunological effect. In a bilateral tumor mouse model, SPNTi&#8208;mediated sono&#8208;activatable immunotherapy results in growth restraints of primary and distant tumors and noteworthy precaution of tumor metastases.

     alt="Augmenting Immunogenic Cell Death and Alleviating Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells by Sono-Activatable Semiconducting Polymer Nanopartners for Immunotherapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sono-activatable semiconducting polymer nanopartner is reported to overcome post-treatment hypoxia and target myeloid-derived suppressor cells for cancer immunotherapy. The release of drug partners in tumor microenvironment is precisely controlled by ultrasound activation, augmenting immunogenic cell death, and alleviating myeloid-derived suppressor cells simultaneously. This sono-activatable immunotherapeutic strategy greatly amplifies immunological effect for inhibiting bilateral tumor growths and preventing tumor metastases.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) by sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is promising for cancer immunotherapy, which however is inefficient due to oxygen depletion that compromises SDT effect and mediates recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The fabrication of sono-activatable semiconducting polymer nanopartners (SPN&lt;sub&gt;Ti&lt;/sub&gt;) to simultaneously augment ICD and alleviate MDSCs for immunotherapy is reported. A sonodynamic semiconducting polymer, hydrophobic hypoxia-responsive tirapazamine (TPZ)-conjugate, and MDSC-targeting drug (ibrutinib) are encapsulated inside such SPN&lt;sub&gt;Ti&lt;/sub&gt; with surface shell of a singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-cleavable amphiphilic polymer. TPZ and ibrutinib serve as drug partners to enlarge immunotherapeutic effect. Upon sono-activation, SPN&lt;sub&gt;Ti&lt;/sub&gt; generate &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to break &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-cleavable polymers for in situ liberations of TPZ-conjugate and ibrutinib in tumor sites, and oxygen is consumed to create severe hypoxic tumor microenvironment, in which, TPZ-conjugate is activated for augmenting ICD action, while ibrutinib alleviates MDSCs for promoting antitumor immunological effect. In a bilateral tumor mouse model, SPN&lt;sub&gt;Ti&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated sono-activatable immunotherapy results in growth restraints of primary and distant tumors and noteworthy precaution of tumor metastases. This study thus provides a sono-activatable immunotherapeutic strategy with high precision and safety for cancer via overcoming post-treatment hypoxia and targeting MDSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Specific Clearance of Lipopolysaccharide from Blood Based on Peptide Bottlebrush Polymer for Sepsis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEP&#8208;1 exhibiting high affinity and specificity toward Escherichia coli&#160;lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#160;is discovered. Not only could it distinguish LPS from plasma proteins, but it can even distinguish the targeted LPS from other types of LPSs with &#8776;1000 times higher affinity. A hemocompatible bottlebrush polymer bearing PEP&#8208;1 achieves specific clearance of LPS from circulating blood for sepsis therapy.








Abstract
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the primary bacterial toxin that is vital to the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis associated with extremely high morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, specific clearance of LPS from circulating blood is highly challenging because of the structural complexity and its variation between/within bacterial species. Herein, a robust strategy based on phage display screening and hemocompatible peptide bottlebrush polymer design for specific clearance of targeted LPS from circulating blood is proposed. Using LPS extracted from Escherichia coli as an example, a novel peptide (HWKAVNWLKPWT) with high affinity (KD &lt; 1.0 n&#1084;), specificity, and neutralization activity (95.9 &#177; 0.1%) against the targeted LPS is discovered via iterative affinity selection coupled with endotoxin detoxification&#160;screening. A hemocompatible bottlebrush polymer bearing the short peptide [poly(PEGMEA&#8208;co&#8208;PEP&#8208;1)] exhibits high LPS selectivity to reduce circulating LPS level from 2.63 &#177; 0.01 to 0.78 &#177; 0.05 EU mL&#8722;1 in sepsis rabbits via extracorporeal hemoperfusion (LPS clearance ratio &gt; 70%), reversing the LPS&#8208;induced leukocytopenia and multiple organ damages significantly. This work provides a universal paradigm for developing a highly selective hemoadsorbent library fully covering the LPS family, which is promising to create a new era of precision medicine in sepsis therapy.

         <title>Multifunctional Magnetic Oxide&#8208;MoS2 Heterostructures on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exotic functionalities of transition metal oxides are appealing to multifunctional devices if integrated with low&#8208;dimensional materials on Si&#8208;based platforms. In this study, heterostructures of MoS2 and magnetic Sr&#8208;doped LaMnO3 are achieved on Si using a freestanding form of Sr&#8208;doped LaMnO3. The multifunctionality of the heterostructures is demonstrated based on three applications, including field&#8208;effect transistors, photodiodes, and magnetoresponsive heterostructure devices.








Abstract
Correlated oxides and related heterostructures are intriguing for developing future multifunctional devices by exploiting their exotic properties, but their integration with other materials, especially on Si&#8208;based platforms, is challenging. Here, van der Waals heterostructures of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) , a correlated manganite perovskite, and MoS2 are demonstrated on Si substrates with multiple functions. To overcome the problems due to the incompatible growth process, technologies involving freestanding LSMO membranes and van der Waals force&#8208;mediated transfer are used to fabricate the LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures. The LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures exhibit a gate&#8208;tunable rectifying behavior, based on which metal&#8208;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (MESFETs) with on&#8208;off ratios of over 104 can be achieved. The LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures can function as photodiodes displaying considerable open&#8208;circuit voltages and photocurrents. In addition, the colossal magnetoresistance of LSMO endows the LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures with an electrically tunable magnetoresponse at room temperature. This work not only proves the applicability of the LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure devices on Si&#8208;based platform but also demonstrates a paradigm to create multifunctional heterostructures from materials with disparate properties.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Stalactite Nanopores for Biosensing and Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a nature&#8208;inspired method for stalactite nanopores growth using atomic layer deposition of hafnium dioxide at the orifice of templated silicon nitride apertures. These nanostructures feature reduced sensing regions of 2&#8208;dimensional material nanopores with the asymmetry of capillaries, offering ionic selectivity, stability, and scalability. This nanopore platform has the potential in nanofluidic research: biosensing, energy science, and filtration. 








Abstract
Nature provides a wide range of self&#8208;assembled structures from the nanoscale to the macroscale. Under the right thermodynamic conditions and with the appropriate material supply, structures like stalactites, icicles, and corals can grow. However, the natural growth process is time&#8208;consuming. This work demonstrates a fast, nature&#8208;inspired method for growing stalactite nanopores using heterogeneous atomic deposition of hafnium dioxide at the orifice of templated silicon nitride apertures. The stalactite nanostructures combine the benefits of reduced sensing region typically for 2&#8208;dimensional material nanopores with the asymmetric geometry of capillaries, resulting in ionic selectivity, stability, and scalability. The proposed growing method provides an adaptable nanopore platform for basic and applied nanofluidic research, including biosensing, energy science, and filtration technologies.

The proposed growing method provides an adaptable nanopore platform for basic and applied nanofluidic research, including biosensing, energy science, and filtration technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Mechanism of Solvents Catalyzed Structural Transformation in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of 2D&#8211;3D structural transformation in metal halide compounds, in presence of protic solvents is elucidated. Hydrogen bonds between&#160;the solvent and different anions dictate the catalytic function, and the barrier reduction to allow the structural transformation. Interesting grain centers and grain boundaries are transformed differently, allowing design of artificial heterostructures.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites show the capability of performing structural transformation, allowing the formation of functional heterostructures. Unfortunately, the elusive mechanism governing these transformations limits their technological application. Herein, the mechanism of 2D&#8211;3D structural transformation is unraveled as catalyzed by solvents. By combining a spatial&#8208;temporal cation interdiffusivity simulation with experimental findings, it is&#160;validated that, protic solvents foster the dissociation degree of formadinium iodide (FAI) via dynamic hydrogen bond, then the stronger hydrogen bond of phenylethylamine (PEA) cation with selected solvents compared to dissociated FA cation facilitates 2D&#8211;3D transformation from (PEA)2PbI4 to FAPbI3. It is&#160;discovered that, the energy barrier of PEA out&#8208;diffusion and the lateral transition barrier of inorganic slab are diminished. For 2D films the protic solvents catalyze grain centers (GCs) and grain boundaries (GBs) transforme into 3D phases and quasi&#8208;2D phases, respectively. While in the solvent&#8208;free case, GCs transform into 3D&#8211;2D heterostructures along the direction perpendicular to the substrate, and most GBs evolve into 3D phases. Finally, memristor devices fabricated using the transformed films uncover that, GBs composed of 3D phases are more prone to ion migration. This work elucidates the fundamental mechanism of structural transformation in metal halide perovskites, allowing their use to fabricate complex heterostructures.

         <title>Multifunctional Filler&#8208;Free PEDOT:PSS Hydrogels with Ultrahigh Electrical Conductivity Induced by Lewis&#8208;Acid&#8208;Promoted Ion Exchange</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;halides&#8208;doped poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxy thiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hydrogels with an ultrahigh electrical conductivity up to 547 S&#160;cm&#8722;1 have been prepared that exhibited high performance in thermoelectrics, electromagnetic shielding, Joule heating, and sensing.








Abstract
Highly conductive hydrogels with biotissue&#8208;like mechanical properties are of great interest in the emerging field of hydrogel bioelectronics due to their good biocompatibility, deformability, and stability. Fully polymeric hydrogels may exhibit comparable Young's modulus to biotissues. However, most of these filler&#8208;free hydrogels have a low electrical conductivity of &lt;10 S&#160;cm&#8722;1, which limits their wide applications of them in digital circuits or bioelectronic devices. In this work, a series of metal&#8208;halides&#8208;doped poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hydrogels with an ultrahigh electrical conductivity up to 547 S&#160;cm&#8722;1 is reported, which is 1.5 times to 104 times higher than previously reported filler&#8208;free polymeric hydrogels. Theoretical calculation demonstrated that the ion exchange between PEDOT:PSS and the metal halides played an important role to promote phase separation in the hydrogels, which thus leads to ultrahigh electrical conductivity. The high electrical conductivity resulted in multifunctional hydrogels with high performance in thermoelectrics, electromagnetic shielding, Joule heating, and sensing. Such flexible and stretchable hydrogels with ultrahigh electrical conductivity and stability upon various deformations are promising for soft bioelectronics devices and wearable electronics.

         <title>Type I Photosensitization with Strong Hydroxyl Radical Generation in NIR Dye Boosted by Vigorous Intramolecular Motions for Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the relationship between type I photosensitization with strong hydroxyl radical (&#8729;OH) formation and intramolecular motions is established. The solid&#8208;state intramolecular motions are almost maximized by the double engineering which may lead to a strong &#8729;OH generation. Combined with the high photothermal conversion efficiency, the synergistic phototherapy toward in vivo tumor can be well performed.








Abstract
Development of type I photosensitizers (PSs) with strong hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) formation is particularly important in the anaerobic tumor treatment. On the other hand, it is challenging to obtain an efficient solid&#8208;state intramolecular motion to promote the development of molecular machine and molecular motor. However, the relationship between them is never revealed. In this work, a pyrazine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared type I PS with remarkable donor&#8211;acceptor effect is developed. Notably, the intramolecular motions are almost maximized by the combination of intramolecular and intermolecular engineering to simultaneously introduce the unlimited bond stretching vibration and boost the group rotation. The photothermal conversion caused by the intramolecular motions is realized with efficiency as high as 86.8%. The D&#8211;A conformation of PS can also induce a very small singlet&#8208;triplet splitting of 0.07&#160;eV, which is crucial to promote the intersystem crossing for the triplet sensitization. Interestingly, its photosensitization is closely related to the intramolecular motions, and a vigorous motion may give rise to a strong &#183;OH generation. In view of its excellent photosensitization and photothermal behavior, the biocompatible PS exhibits a superior imaging&#8208;guided cancer synergistic therapy. This work stimulates the development of advanced PS for the biomedical application and solid&#8208;state intramolecular motions.

         <title>Isotope Exchange Raman Spectroscopy (IERS): A Novel Technique to Probe Physicochemical Processes In Situ</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in situ technique for the direct characterization of mass&#8208;transport properties is presented, which is based on the coupling of Raman spectroscopy to isothermal isotope exchanges. Its original concept and unique strengths are demonstrated by studying Gd&#8208;doped ceria thin films. It is a new, rapid, cheap, and non&#8208;destructive approach to make O&#8208;transport visible that can be readily expanded to many laboratories worldwide.








Abstract
A novel in situ methodology for the direct study of mass&#8208;transport properties in oxides with spatial and unprecedented time resolution, based on Raman spectroscopy coupled to isothermal isotope exchanges, is developed. Changes in the isotope concentration, resulting in a Raman frequency shift, can be followed in real time, which is not accessible by conventional methods, enabling complementary insights for the study of ion&#8208;transport properties of electrode and electrolyte materials for advanced solid&#8208;state electrochemical devices. The proof of concept and strengths of isotope exchange Raman spectroscopy (IERS) is demonstrated by studying the oxygen isotope back&#8208;exchange in gadolinium&#8208;doped ceria (CGO) thin films. Resulting oxygen self&#8208;diffusion and surface exchange coefficients are compared to conventional time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) characterization and literature values, showing good agreement, while at the same time providing additional insight, challenging established assumptions. IERS captivates through its rapidity, simple setup, non&#8208;destructive nature, cost effectiveness, and versatile fields of application and thus can readily be integrated as new standard tool for in situ and operando characterization in many laboratories worldwide. The applicability of this method is expected to consolidate the&#160;understanding of elementary physicochemical processes and impact various emerging fields including solid oxide cells, battery research, and&#160;beyond.

A synergistic modulation strategy of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite with alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) and multisite ligand 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (MTD) is proposed to fabricate high&#8208;quality methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite films. The significantly inhibited nonradiative recombination enables the realization of high&#8208;efficiency inverted devices with a fascinating power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.58%, which is one of the highest PCEs reported for inverted devices.








Abstract
The preparation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films is key to realize efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells. The trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination at grain boundary (GB) and surface poses a serious challenge for fabricating high&#8208;quality perovskite films. Here, a synergistic modulation strategy of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite with alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) and multisite ligand 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (MTD) for fabricating high&#8208;quality methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite films is reported. The formation of ACI 2D perovskite promotes the nucleation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites, suppresses the generation of yellow phase, and promotes the formation of black phase, leading to increased grain size and crystallinity. Due to the synergistic effect of ACI 2D perovskite and MTD, the defects at GBs and surface are healed simultaneously. The significantly inhibited nonradiative recombination enables realization of high&#8208;efficiency inverted devices with a fascinating power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.58%, which is one of the highest PCEs reported for inverted devices. The synergistically modified unsealed device demonstrates an excellent long&#8208;term ambient stability, retaining 90.5% of its initial PCE after 3000&#160;h under a relative humidity of 30&#8211;40%. This work provides deep insights into minimizing nonradiative recombination losses through the rational synergistic engineering of GB and surface toward efficient and stable inverted devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution, Highly Transparent, and Efficient Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

The strategy of electrostatic force&#8208;induced deposition (EF&#8208;ID) is proposed by introducing alternating polyethyleneimine and fluorosilane patterns to synergistically improve the quantum dot (QD) pattern pixel accuracy, boost device transmittance, and reduce the device leakage current, which enables high resolution ranging from 1104 to 3031 PPI and a high efficiency of 15.6%, as well as highly transparent quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) with a high transmittance of 90.7%, indicating an effective approach for high&#8208;resolution QLEDs with high efficiency and transparency.








Abstract
Aiming at next&#8208;generation displays, high&#8208;resolution quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) with high efficiency and transparency are highly desired. However, there is limited study involving the improvements of QLED pixel resolution, efficiency, and transparency simultaneously, which undoubtedly restricts the practical applications of QLED for next&#8208;generation displays. Here, the strategy of electrostatic force&#8208;induced deposition (EF&#8208;ID) is proposed by introducing alternating polyethyleneimine (PEI) and fluorosilane patterns to synergistically improve the pixel accuracy and transmittance of QD patterns. More importantly, the leakage current induced by the void spaces between pixels that is usually reported for high&#8208;resolution QLEDs is greatly suppressed by substrate&#8208;assisted insulating fluorosilane patterns. Finally, high&#8208;performance QLEDs with high resolution ranging from 1104 to 3031 pixels per inch (PPI) and a high efficiency of 15.6% are achieved, among the best performances of high resolution QLEDs. Notably, the high resolution QD pixels greatly enhance the transmittance of the QD patterns, thus prompting an impressive transmittance of 90.7% for the transparent QLEDs (2116 PPI), which represents the highest transmittance of transparent QLED devices. Consequently, this work contributes an effective and general approach for high&#8208;resolution QLEDs with high efficiency and transparency.

         <title>The Construction of a Microbial Synthesis System for Rare Earth Enrichment and Material Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomanufacturing of high&#8208;purity rare earth (RE) materials is achieved by establishing a microbial synthesis system. RE bioproducts can be extracellularly collected from RE tailings by microbial in situ synthesis. A series of RE&#8208;biosorbent columns with high affinity are developed by immobilizing specifically designed proteins with an agarose matrix. Moreover, the lanthanide&#8208;immobilized methanol dehydrogenase is biofabricated for high&#8208;value utilization of RE.








Abstract
Rare earth materials play an irreplaceable role in biomedical and high technology fields. However, typical mining and extraction approaches to rare earth elements (REEs) often lead to severe environmental problems and resource wastage due to the involvement of hazardous chemicals. Although biomining shows elegant alternatives, there are still grand challenges to sustainably isolate and recover REEs in nature because of insufficient metal&#8208;extracting microbes and RE&#8208;scavenging macromolecular tools. To obtain high&#8208;performance rare earth materials directly from rare earth ore, a new generation of biological synthesis strategies needs to be developed for the efficient preparation of REEs. The microbial synthesis system established here has achieved active biomanufacturing of high&#8208;purity rare earth products. Further, through employing robust affinity columns bioconjugated with structurally engineered proteins, outstanding separation of Eu/Lu and Dy/La is acquired with the purity of 99.9% (Eu), 97.1% (La), and 92.7% (Dy). More importantly, in situ one&#8208;pot synthesis of lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenase is well harnessed and exclusively adsorbs La, Ce, Pr, and Nd in RE tailing for advanced biocatalysis, indicating high value&#8208;added application. Therefore, this novel biosynthetic platform provides an insightful roadmap to expand the scope of chassis engineering in terms of biofoundry and to manufacture valuable bioproducts related to REEs.

         <title>PAF&#8208;6 Doped with Phosphoric Acid through Alkaline Nitrogen Atoms Boosting High&#8208;Temperature Proton&#8208;Exchange Membranes for High Performance of Fuel Cells</title>

PAF&#8208;6&#160;with ordered porous structure and abundant alkaline sites&#160;are doped with phosphoric acid to obtain PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA. It is applied to the OPBI&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;exchange membrane toward superb mechanical properties and excellent proton conduction performance. The peak power density of the H2/O2 fuel cell at 200&#160;&#176;C reaches 437.7&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 with the catalyst Pt dosage only 0.3&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) can offer improved energy efficiency and tolerance to fuel/air impurities. The high expense of the high&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;exchange membranes (HT&#8208;PEMs) and their low durability at high temperature still impede their further practical applications. In this work, a phosphoric acid (PA)&#8208;doped porous aromatic framework&#160;(PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA) is incorporated into poly[2,2&#8242;&#8208;(p&#8208;oxydiphenylene)&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;benzimidazole] (OPBI) to fabricate novel PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA/OPBI composite HT&#8208;PEMs through solution&#8208;casting. The alkaline nitrogen structure in PAF&#8208;6 can be protonated with PA to provide proton hopping sites, and its porous structure can enhance the PA retention in the membranes, thus creating fast pathways for proton transfer. The hydrogen bond interaction between the rigid PAF&#8208;6 and OPBI can also enhance the mechanical properties and chemical stability of the composite membranes. Consequently, PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA/OPBI exhibits&#160;an optimal proton conductivity of 0.089 S cm&#8722;1 at 200&#160;&#176;C, and peak power density of 437.7&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 (Pt: 0.3 mg cm&#8722;2), which is significantly higher than that of the OPBI. &#160; The PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA/OPBI provides&#160;a novel strategy for the practical application of PBI&#8208;based HT&#8208;PEMs.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of Chemically Bonded 2D/2D Covalent Organic Frameworks/O&#8208;Vacancy WO3 Z&#8208;Scheme Heterostructure for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed 2D/2D covalent organic framework (COF)/WO3&#8208;Ov Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction is synthesized for highly effective and long&#8208;term photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and overall water splitting, exceeding most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the outstanding activity is mainly attributed to the suitable band level, surface oxygen vacancies, robust build&#8208;in electric field, and strong 2D/2D interfacial coupling with precisely connected chemical bonds.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown great promise for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via water splitting. However, the four&#8208;electron oxidation of water remains elusive toward oxygen evolution. Enabling this water oxidation pathway is critical to improve the yield and maximize atom utilization efficiency. A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction is proposed for overcoming fundamental issues in COF&#8208;based photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS), such as inefficient light absorption, charge recombination, and poor water oxidation ability. It is shown that the construction of a novel 2D/2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction through in situ growth of COFs on the O&#8208;vacancy WO3 nanosheets (Ov&#8208;WO3) via the W&#63743;O&#63743;C chemical bond can remarkably promote photocatalytic OWS. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the enhanced built&#8208;in electric field by the interfacial W&#63743;O&#63743;C bond, the strong water oxidation ability of Ov&#8208;WO3, and the ultrathin structure of TSCOF, both separation and utilization efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs can be significantly enhanced. An impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution half&#8208;rection rate of 593&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and overall water splitting rate of 146 (hydrogen) and 68 (oxygen) &#181;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 are achieved on the COF&#8208;WO3 (TSCOFW) composite. This 2D/2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction with two&#8208;step excitation and precisely cascaded charge&#8208;transfer pathway makes it responsible for the efficient solar&#8208;driven OWS without a sacrificial agent.

         <title>Flexible, Transparent, and Wafer&#8208;Scale Artificial Synapse Array Based on TiOx/Ti3C2Tx Film for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible, high transmittance artificial synapse array based on TiOx/Ti3C2Tx film is developed. The memristor shows low device&#8208;to&#8208;device variability, long memory retention and endurance, a high ON/OFF ratio, and fundamental synaptic behavior.








Abstract
A high&#8208;density neuromorphic computing memristor array based on 2D&#160;materials paves the way for next&#8208;generation information&#8208;processing components and in&#8208;memory computing systems. However, the traditional 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based memristor devices suffer from poor flexibility and opacity, which hinders the application of memristors in flexible electronics. Here, a flexible artificial synapse array based on TiOx/Ti3C2Tx film is fabricated by a convenient and energy&#8208;efficient solution&#8208;processing technique, which realizes high transmittance (&#8776;90%) and oxidation resistance (&gt;30 days). The TiOx/Ti3C2Tx memristor shows low device&#8208;to&#8208;device variability, long memory retention and endurance, a high ON/OFF ratio, and fundamental synaptic behavior. Furthermore, satisfactory flexibility (R = 1.0&#160;mm) and mechanical endurance (104 bending cycles) of the TiOx/Ti3C2Tx memristor are achieved, which is superior to other film memristors prepared by chemical vapor deposition. In addition, high&#8208;precision (&gt;96.44%) MNIST handwritten digits recognition classification simulation indicates that the TiOx/Ti3C2Tx artificial synapse array holds promise for future neuromorphic computing applications, and provides excellent high&#8208;density neuron circuits for new flexible intelligent electronic equipment.

         <title>Mechanochemical Degradation of Poly(vinyl chloride) into Nontoxic Water&#8208;Soluble Products via Sequential Dechlorination, Heterolytic Oxirane Ring&#8208;Opening, and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical degradation of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) into water&#8208;soluble biocompatible products is demonstrated. The solid&#8208;state mechanochemical dechlorination followed by epoxidation offers a more environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional solution&#8208;based reaction. This work exploits the force&#8208;induced heterolytic oxirane ring&#8208;opening which aids PVC degradation into smaller fragments upon hydrolysis.








Abstract
As one of the most widely used commodity plastics, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is extensively used worldwide, yet is difficult to recycle and is often discarded immediately after use. Its end&#8208;of&#8208;life treatment often generates toxic hydrogen chloride and dioxins that pose a critical threat to ecosystems. To address this challenge, the mechanochemical degradation of PVC into water&#8208;soluble biocompatible products is presented herein. Oxirane mechanophores are strategically introduced into the polymeric backbone via sequential dechlorination followed by epoxidation. The oxirane mechanophore in the polymer backbone undergoes a force&#8208;induced heterolytic ring&#8208;opening to carbonyl ylide intermediates, which eventually generates acetals during the course of the reaction. The subsequent hydrolysis of the backbone acetals affords the scission of the polymeric chain into water&#8208;soluble low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fragments. Combined with its low cytotoxicity and phytotoxicity, this solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical degradation process offers a green alternative for the degradation of PVC.

         <title>Plasmonic Coupling on an Optical Microfiber Surface: Enabling Single&#8208;Molecule and Noninvasive Dopamine Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical microfiber biosensor for dopamine (DA) detection based on the DA&#8208;binding&#8208;induced aptamer conformational transitions that occur at plasmonic coupling sites on a double&#8208;amplified nanointerface is demonstrated. The sensor exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity when detecting DA molecules at the single&#8208;molecule level. It provides an approach for overcoming optical device sensitivity limits, extending optical fiber single&#8208;molecule detection to a small molecule range.








Abstract
Optical fibers can be effective biosensors when employed in early&#8208;stage diagnostic point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices as they can avoid interference from molecules with similar redox potentials. Nevertheless, their sensitivity needs to be improved for real&#8208;world applications, especially for small&#8208;molecule detection. This work demonstrates an optical microfiber biosensor for dopamine (DA) detection based on the DA&#8208;binding&#8208;induced aptamer conformational transitions that occur at plasmonic coupling sites on a double&#8208;amplified nanointerface. The sensor exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity when detecting DA molecules at the single&#8208;molecule level; additionally, this work provides an approach for overcoming optical device sensitivity limits, further extending optical fiber single&#8208;molecule detection to a small molecule range (e.g., DA and metal ions). The selective energy enhancement and signal amplification at the binding sites effectively avoid nonspecific amplification of the whole fiber surface which may lead to false&#8208;positive results. The sensor can detect single&#8208;molecule DA signals in body&#8208;fluids. It can detect the released extracellular DA levels and monitor the DA oxidation process. An appropriate aptamer replacement allows the sensor to be used for the detection of other target small molecules and ions at the single&#8208;molecule level. This technology offers alternative opportunities for developing noninvasive early&#8208;stage diagnostic point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices and flexible single&#8208;molecule detection techniques in theoretical research.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Metastable Hidden Skyrmion Phase in the Mott Insulator Cu2OSeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored laser pulses are found to drive the multiferroic insulating material Cu2OSeO3 into a metastable hidden phase hosting magnetic skyrmions. Such a phase cannot be accessed otherwise, via adiabatic protocols sweeping temperature or magnetic fields. These results highlight the potential of non&#8208;adiabatic stimuli to control magnetism by directly modifying the free energy landscape at ultrafast timescales.








Abstract
The discovery of a novel long&#8208;lived metastable skyrmion phase in the multiferroic insulator Cu2OSeO3 visualized with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy for magnetic fields below the equilibrium skyrmion pocket is reported. This phase can be accessed by exciting the sample non&#8208;adiabatically with near&#8208;infrared femtosecond laser pulses and cannot be reached by any conventional field&#8208;cooling protocol, referred as a hidden phase. From the strong wavelength dependence of the photocreation process and via spin&#8208;dynamics simulations, the magnetoelastic effect is identified as the most likely photocreation mechanism. This effect results in a transient modification of the magnetic free energy landscape extending the equilibrium skyrmion pocket to lower magnetic fields. The evolution of the photoinduced phase is monitored for over 15 min and no decay is found. Because such a time is much longer than the duration of any transient effect induced by a laser pulse in a material, it is assumed that the newly discovered skyrmion state is stable for practical purposes, thus breaking ground for a novel approach to control magnetic state on demand at ultrafast timescales and drastically reducing heat dissipation relevant for next&#8208;generation spintronic&#160;devices.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Loading Manganese&#8208;Based Electrodes for Aqueous Batteries via Polymorph Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical performance of MnO2 differs with its polymorph states. By tuning the temperature, the deposited phase can be manipulated from &#603;&#8208;MnO2 to &#947;&#8208;MnO2 with &#8776;200&#8208;fold enhancement in conductivity for both MnO2&#8211;H2 and MnO2&#8211;Zn aqueous batteries. Such polymorph tuning technologies have validated the application potential for ultrahigh normalized areal loading electrodes and good cyclability at high areal capacities.








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based aqueous batteries utilizing Mn2+/MnO2 redox reactions are promising choices for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high theoretical specific capacity, high power capability, low&#8208;cost, and intrinsic safety with water&#8208;based electrolytes. However, the application of such systems is hindered by the insulating nature of deposited MnO2, resulting in low normalized areal loading (0.005&#8211;0.05&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) during the charge/discharge cycle. In this work, the electrochemical performance of various MnO2 polymorphs in Mn2+/MnO2 redox reactions is investigated, and &#603;&#8208;MnO2 with low conductivity is determined to be the primary electrochemically deposited phase in normal acidic aqueous electrolyte. It is found that increasing the temperature can change the deposited phase from &#603;&#8208;MnO2 with low conductivity to &#947;&#8208;MnO2 with two order of magnitude increase in conductivity. It is demonstrated that the highly conductive &#947;&#8208;MnO2 can be effectively exploited for ultrahigh areal loading electrode, and a normalized areal loading of 33&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved. At a mild temperature of 50&#160;&#176;C, cells are cycled with an ultrahigh areal loading of 20&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 (1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than previous studies) for over 200 cycles with only 13% capacity loss.

         <title>Energy Storage Mechanism in Supercapacitors with Porous Graphdiynes: Effects of Pore Topology and Electrode Metallicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work builds a modeling method from the atomic scale to the macroscale for porous electrodes. Simulations reveal that supercapacitors based on porous graphdiynes of AB stacking structure can&#160;achieve both higher capacitance and ionic conductivity than AA stacking. This is ascribed to more intense image forces in AB stacking.








Abstract
Porous graphdiynes are a new class of porous 2D materials with tunable electronic structures and various pore structures. They have potential applications as well&#8208;defined nanostructured electrodes and can provide platforms for understanding energy storage mechanisms underlying supercapacitors. Herein, the effect of stacking structure and metallicity on energy storage with such electrodes is investigated. Simulations reveal that supercapacitors based on porous graphdiynes of AB stacking structure can achieve both higher double&#8208;layer capacitance and ionic conductivity than AA stacking. This phenomenon is ascribed to more intense image forces in AB stacking, leading to a breakdown of ionic ordering and the formation of effective &#8220;free ions&#8221;. Macroscale analysis shows that doped porous graphdiynes can deliver outstanding gravimetric and volumetric energy and power densities due to their enhanced quantum capacitance. These findings pave the way for designing high&#8208;performance supercapacitors by regulating pore topology and metallicity of electrode materials.

         <title>Open and Close&#8208;Packed, Shape&#8208;Engineered Polygonal Nanoparticle Metamolecules with Tailorable Fano Resonances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticles (NPs) are produced with lithographic fabrication and assembled into open or close&#8208;packed structures using a template&#8208;assisted assembly technique. The NP assemblies&#8217; coordination number, interparticle gap size, disorder, and voids are controlled by the shapes and sizes of the NPs and templates. Tuneable Fano resonances are obtained in the dark&#8208;field scattering spectra of the assembly.








Abstract
A top&#8208;down lithographic patterning and deposition process is reported for producing nanoparticles (NPs) with well&#8208;defined sizes, shapes, and compositions that are often not accessible by wet&#8208;chemical synthetic methods. These NPs are ligated and harvested from the substrate surface to prepare colloidal NP dispersions. Using a template&#8208;assisted assembly technique, fabricated NPs are driven by capillary forces to assemble into size&#8208; and shape&#8208;engineered templates and organize into open or close&#8208;packed multi&#8208;NP structures or NP metamolecules. The sizes and shapes of the NPs and of the templates control the NP number, coordination, interparticle gap size, disorder, and location of defects such as voids in the NP metamolecules. The plasmonic resonances of polygonal&#8208;shaped Au NPs are exploited to correlate the structure and optical properties of assembled NP metamolecules. Comparing open and close&#8208;packed architectures highlights that introduction of a center NP to form close&#8208;packed assemblies supports collective interactions, altering magnetic optical modes and multipolar interactions in Fano resonances. Decreasing the distance between NPs strengthens the plasmonic coupling, and the structural symmetries of the NP metamolecules determine the orientation&#8208;dependent scattering response.

         <title>Two&#8208;Tailed Dynamic Covalent Amphiphile Combats Bacterial Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of non&#8208;antibiotic two&#8208;tailed antimicrobial amphiphile (T2A2) via dynamic covalent bonding is reported. T2A2 prevents biofilm formation and eradicates the mature biofilms via multiple mechanisms, suggestions applications in addressing the ever&#8208;growing threat of drug resistance in bacteria.








Abstract
Drug combination provides an efficient pathway to combat drug resistance in bacteria and bacterial biofilms. However, the facile methodology to construct the drug combinations and their applications in nanocomposites is still lacking. Here the two&#8208;tailed antimicrobial amphiphiles (T2A2) composed of nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;donor (diethylenetriamine NONOate, DN) and various natural aldehydes are reported. T2A2 self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles due to their amphiphilic nature, with remarkably low critical aggregation concentration. The representative cinnamaldehyde (Cin)&#8208;derived T2A2 (Cin&#8208;T2A2) assemblies demonstrate excellent bactericidal efficacy, notably higher than free Cin and free DN. Cin&#8208;T2A2 assemblies kill multidrug&#8208;resistant staphylococci and eradicate their biofilms via multiple mechanisms, as proved by mechanism studies, molecular dynamics simulations, proteomics, and metabolomics. Furthermore, Cin&#8208;T2A2 assemblies rapidly eradicate bacteria and alleviate inflammation in the subsequent murine infection models. Together, the Cin&#8208;T2A2 assemblies may provide an efficient, non&#8208;antibiotic alternative in combating the ever&#8208;increasing threat of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and their biofilms.

&lt;p&gt;The first example of non-antibiotic two-tailed antimicrobial amphiphile (T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) via dynamic covalent bonding is reported.

Magnetic Skyrmions
Magnetic skyrmions are chiral solitons that possess inherent dynamic modes. During dynamic excitation spin waves are ejected, which interfere to generate a turbulent magnetic sea. In article number 2300416, using small&#8208;angle neutron scattering, Dustin A. Gilbert and co&#8208;workers measure the structure of the turbulent spin wave sea and find it to be a fractal. The structure of the fractal is determined by features within the skyrmion and skyrmion lattice.

Graphdiyne Supercapacitors
In article number 2301118, Guang Feng and co&#8208;workers develop a multiscale modeling method to investigate the effect of pore topology and electrode metallicity on supercapacitor performance using porous graphdiynes. The reported simulations quantitively unveil the effect of image charges on energy storage in nanopores. Based on this understanding, they predict that doped porous graphdiynes can deliver both outstanding energy and power densities.

Liquid Crystalline Nanostructures
In article number 2301714, Peng Chen, Yan&#8208;Qing Lu, and co&#8208;workers report a functional bichiral nanostructure containing opposite&#8208;handed cholesteric liquid crystals. Such a bichiral structure exhibits a reflective and dynamic version of the common optical rotatory dispersion, leading to hybrid multiplexed and color&#8208;tunable holography. This study extends the ingenious building of soft chiral nanostructures and facilitates multifunctional light harnessing.

Perovskite Solar Cells
In article number 2301852, Licheng Tan, Yiwang Chen, and co&#8208;workers report how ZIF&#8208;8@formamidinium iodide multifunctional capsules induce porous channels in a PbI2 layer, which can enhance the degree of solid&#8211;liquid reaction and convert the underlying PbI2 into perovskite sufficiently. Most importantly, the multifunctional capsules can also improve light utilization by the downconversion effect, which can mitigate the decomposition of the perovskite under UV illumination.

Synthetic Organelles
In article number 2301856, Hang Zhao, S&#233;bastien Lecommandoux, and co&#8208;workers report mimicking of intracellular stress membraneless organelles, elastin&#8208;like polypeptide&#8208;derived components that are enclosed in partially dewetted liposomes, which enables rapid response to hyperosmotic stress through liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation.

         <title>Harnessing Nanomaterials for Cancer Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonodynamic immunotherapy has emerged as a rising star on the horizon of cancer immunotherapy in recent years. Specially, the advances of nanotechnology hold great promise to enhance such treatment efficacy and reduce toxicity simultaneously. An overview of nanomaterials&#8208;assisted cancer sonodynamic immunotherapy is presented with a view to achieve its clinical patient benefits in the near future.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has made remarkable strides in cancer therapy over the past decade. However, such emerging therapy still suffers from the low response rates and immune&#8208;related adverse events. Various strategies have been developed to overcome these serious challenges. Therein, sonodynamic therapy (SDT), as a non&#8208;invasive treatment, has received ever&#8208;increasing attention especially in the treatment of deep&#8208;seated tumors. Significantly, SDT can effectively induce immunogenic cell death to trigger systemic anti&#8208;tumor immune response, termed sonodynamic immunotherapy. The rapid development of nanotechnology has revolutionized SDT effects with robust immune response induction. As a result, more and more innovative nanosonosensitizers and synergistic treatment modalities are established with superior efficacy and safe profile. In this review, the recent advances in cancer sonodynamic immunotherapy are summarized with a particular emphasis on how nanotechnology can be explored to harness SDT for amplifying anti&#8208;tumor immune response. Moreover, the current challenges in this field and the prospects for its clinical translation are also presented. It is anticipated that this review can provide rational guidance and facilitate the development of nanomaterials&#8208;assisted sonodynamic immunotherapy, helping to pave the way for next&#8208;generation cancer therapy and eventually achieve a durable response in patients.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered Cascade Amplification of Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Numerous well&#8208;designed nanosystems have emerged that incorporate presupposed cascade amplification processes and can be activated by exogenous ultrasound stimulation or ultrasound&#8208;actuated specific substances to trigger chemotherapy, chemodynamic therapy, immunotherapy, ferroptosis, and other therapeutic modalities, with the aim of maximizing antitumor efficacy and minimizing detrimental effects.








Abstract
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered cascade amplification of nanotherapies has attracted considerable attention as an effective strategy for cancer treatment. With the remarkable advances in materials chemistry and nanotechnology, a large number of well&#8208;designed nanosystems have emerged that incorporate presupposed cascade amplification processes and can be activated to trigger therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and ferroptosis, under exogenous US stimulation or specific substances generated by US actuation, to maximize antitumor efficacy and minimize detrimental effects. Therefore, summarizing the corresponding nanotherapies and applications based on US&#8208;triggered cascade amplification is essential. This review comprehensively summarizes and highlights the recent advances in the design of intelligent modalities, consisting of unique components, distinctive properties, and specific cascade processes. These ingenious strategies confer unparalleled potential to nanotherapies based on ultrasound&#8208;triggered cascade amplification and provide superior controllability, thus overcoming the unmet requirements of precision medicine and personalized treatment. Finally, the challenges and prospects of this emerging strategy are discussed and it is expected to encourage more innovative ideas and promote their further development.

         <title>Organic Electroactive Materials for Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous batteries coupled with highly designable organic electrode materials have received extensive attention owing to the requirements of sustainable development. This review aims to provide the recent progress in organic electroactive materials for aqueous redox flow batteries and a general guideline to design those aqueous organic redox flow batteries by deciphering the relationship between properties and structures of organic electroactive materials.








Abstract
Organic electroactive materials take advantage of potentially sustainable production and structural tunability compared to present commercial inorganic materials. Unfortunately, traditional redox flow batteries based on toxic redox&#8208;active metal ions have certain deficiencies in resource utilization and environmental protection. In comparison, organic electroactive materials in aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) have received extensive attention in recent years for low&#8208;cost and sustainable energy storage systems due to their inherent safety. This review aims to provide the recent progress in organic electroactive materials for ARFBs. The main reaction types of organic electroactive materials are classified in ARFBs to provide an overview of how to regulate their solubility, potential, stability, and viscosity. Then, the organic anolyte and catholyte in ARFBs are summarized according to the types of quinones, viologens, nitroxide radicals, hydroquinones, etc, and how to increase the solubility by designing various functional groups is emphasized. The research advances are presented next in the characterization of organic electroactive materials for ARFBs. Future efforts are finally suggested to focus on building neutral ARFBs, designing advanced electroactive materials through molecular engineering, and resolving problems of commercial applications.

         <title>Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) Actuators: The Role of Material, Form, and Scaling Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 33, August 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators exhibit complex behaviors through simple structures at various scales. This review analyzes different SMA actuators based on material, form, and scale. With state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art actuators and limitations of current technologies, this review offers insights into how to synergize these three aspects. It will serve soft and micro&#8208;robotics researchers as a guideline for future developments.









Abstract
Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are smart materials that are widely used to create intelligent devices because of their high energy density, actuation strain, and biocompatibility characteristics. Given their unique properties, SMAs are found to have significant potential for implementation in many emerging applications in mobile robots, robotic hands, wearable devices, aerospace/automotive components, and biomedical devices. Here, the state&#8211;of&#8211;the&#8211;art of thermal and magnetic SMA actuators in terms of their constituent materials, form, and scaling effects are summarized, including their surface treatments and functionalities. The motion performance of various SMA architectures (wires, springs, smart soft composites, and knitted/woven actuators) is also analyzed. Based on the assessment, current challenges of SMAs that need to be addressed for their practical application are emphasized. Finally, how to advance SMAs by synergistically considering the effects of material, form, and scale is suggested.

         <title>Chiroptical Response Inversion And Enhancement of Room&#8208;Temperature Exciton&#8208;Polaritons Using Two&#8208;Dimensional Chirality in Perovskites</title>

Abstract
Although chiral semiconductors have shown promising progress in direct circularly polarized light (CPL) detection and emission, they still face potential challenges. A chirality&#8208;switching mechanism or approach integrating two enantiomers is needed to discriminate the handedness of a given CPL; additionally, a large material volume is required for sufficient chiroptical interaction. These two requirements pose significant obstacles to the simplification and miniaturization of the devices. Here, w e demonstrate room&#8208;temperature chiral polaritons fulfilling dual&#8208;handedness functions and exhibiting a more&#8208;than&#8208;two&#8208;order enhancement of the chiroptical signal, by embedding a 40&#8208;nm&#8208;thick perovskite film with a two&#8208;dimensional chiroptical effect into a Fabry&#8208;Perot cavity. By mixing chiral perovskites with different crystal structures, w e accomplish a pronounced two&#8208;dimensional chiroptical effect in the perovskite film, featured by an inverted chiroptical response for counter&#8208;propagating CPL. This inversion behavior matches the photonic handedness switch during CPL circulation in the Fabry&#8208;Perot cavity, thus harvesting giant enhancement of the chiroptical response. Furthermore, affected by the unique quarter&#8208;wave&#8208;plate effects, the polariton emission achieves a chiral dissymmetry of &#177;4% (for the emission from the front and the back sides). The room&#8208;temperature polaritons with the strong dissymmetric chiroptical interaction should have implications on a fundamental level and future on&#8208;chip applications for bio&#8208;molecule analysis and quantum computing.

         <title>Computationally Guided Synthesis of MXenes by Dry Selective Extraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
MXenes are a rapidly growing family of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides which are promising for various applications, including energy storage and conversion, electronics, and healthcare. Hydrofluoric acid&#8208;based etchants are typically used for large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;throughput synthesis of MXenes, which also leads to mixed surface terminations that impede MXene properties. Herein, we present a computational thermodynamic model with experimental validations to explore the feasibility of fluorine&#8208;free synthesis of MXenes with uniform surface terminations by dry selective extraction (DSE) from precursor MAX phases using iodine vapors. A range of MXene and respective precursor compositions are systematically screened using first&#8208;principles calculations to find candidates with high phase stability and low etching energy. We further demonstrate a thermodynamic model based on the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach, using Ti3C2I2 as an example, to assess the Gibbs free energy of the DSE reaction and the state of the byproducts as a function of temperature and pressure. Based on the assessment, the optimal synthesis temperature and vapor pressure are predicted, and further verified by experiments. This work opens an avenue for scalable, fluorine&#8208;free dry synthesis of MXenes with compositions and surface chemistries that are not accessible using wet chemical etching.

         <title>Nanotargeted Delivery of Immune Therapeutics in Type 1 Diabetes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeted delivery platform for type 1 diabetes (T1D) treatment using high endothelial venule (HEV)&#8208;targeted nanoparticles is developed. The HEV&#8208;targeting nanoplatform delivers anti&#8208;CD3 antibodies simultaneously to pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreata, thereby suppressing effector T cells and prolonging the reversal of T1D in a nonobese diabetic mouse model.








Abstract
Immune therapeutics holds great promise in the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Nonetheless, their progress is hampered by limited efficacy, equipoise, or issues of safety. To address this, a novel and specific nanodelivery platform for T1D that targets high endothelial venules (HEVs) presented in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs) and pancreas is developed. Data indicate that the pancreata of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and patients with T1D are unique in their expression of newly formed HEVs. Anti&#8208;CD3 mAb is encapsulated in poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid)&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles (NPs), the surfaces of which are conjugated with MECA79 mAb that recognizes HEVs. Targeted delivery of these NPs improves accumulation of anti&#8208;CD3 mAb in both the PLNs and pancreata of NOD mice. Treatment of hyperglycemic NOD mice with MECA79&#8208;anti&#8208;CD3&#8208;NPs results in significant reversal of T1D compared to those that are untreated, treated with empty NPs, or provided free anti&#8208;CD3. This effect is associated with a significant reduction of T effector cell populations in the PLNs and a decreased production of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine in the mice treated with MECA79&#8208;anti&#8208;CD3&#8208;NPs. In summary, HEV&#8208;targeted therapeutics may be used as a means by which immune therapeutics can be delivered to PLNs and pancreata to suppress autoimmune diabetes effectively.

         <title>Conversion of Dielectric Surface Effect into Volume Effect for High Output Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion of the dielectric surface effect into a volume effect is proposed for a high output energy of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). In this work, the physics mechanism of thick dielectric films used in TENGs is identified and a new approach to promote the output and durability of TENGs is provided.








Abstract
Improving the output energy and durability of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) remains a considerable challenge for their practical applications. Owing to the interface effect of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction, thinner films with higher dielectric constants yield a higher output; however, they are not durable for practical applications. Herein, the dielectric surface effect is changed into a volume effect by adopting a millimeter&#8208;thick dielectric film with an inner porous network structure so that charges can hop in the surface state of the network. Charge migration inside the dielectric film is the key factor affecting the output of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)&#160;with a thick film, based on which each working stage follows the energy&#8208;maximization principle in the voltage&#8211;charge plot. The maximum peak and average power densities of the TENG with polyurethane foam film in 1&#160;mm thickness reach 40.9 and 20.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;Hz&#8722;1, respectively, under environmental conditions, and the output charge density is 5.14&#160;times that of TENGs with a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) film of the same thickness. Superdurability is achieved in the rotary&#8208;mode TENG&#160;after 200&#160;000 operation cycles. This study identifies the physical mechanism of the thick dielectric film used in TENGs and provides a new approach to promote the output and durability of TENGs.

         <title>2D&#8208;Layer&#8208;Structure Bi to Quasi&#8208;1D&#8208;Structure NiBi3: Structural Dimensionality Reduction to Superior Sodium and Potassium Ion Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
A structural dimensionality reduction strategy is proposed and developed by converting 2D&#8208;layer&#8208;structured Bi into a quasi&#8208;1D structured NiBi3 to improve the reaction kinetics and cycling stability for Na/K&#8208;ion storage. As a proof of concept, the quasi&#8208;1D NiBi3 with metallic conductivity and 3D Na/K&#8208;ion diffusion pathways delivers high&#8208;rate capability and superior cycling performance for Na/K storage.








Abstract
Layer&#8208;structured bismuth (Bi) is an attractive anode for Na&#8208;ion and K&#8208;ion batteries due to its large volumetric capacity and suitable redox potentials. However, the cycling stability and rate capability of the Bi anode are restricted by the large volume expansion and sluggish Na/K&#8208;storage kinetics. Herein, a structural dimensionality reduction strategy is proposed and developed by converting&#160;2D&#8208;layer&#8208;structured Bi into a quasi&#8208;1D structured NiBi3 with enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility to realize high&#8208;rate and stable cycling performance for Na/K&#8208;ion storage. As a proof of concept, the quasi&#8208;1D intermetallic NiBi3 with low formation energy, metallic conductivity, and 3D Na/K&#8208;ion diffusion pathways delivers outstanding capacity retention of 94.1% (332 mAh g&#8722;1) after 15&#160;000 cycles for Na&#8208;ion storage, and high initial coulombic efficiency of 93.4% with improved capacity retention for K&#8208;ion storage. Moreover, investigations on the highly reversible Na/K&#8208;storage reaction mechanisms and cycling&#8208;driven morphology reconstruction further reveal the origins of the high reversibility and the accommodation to volume expansion. The finding of this work provides a new strategy for high&#8208;performance anode design by structural dimensionality manipulation and cycling&#8208;driven morphology reconstruction.

         <title>Self&#8208;Oxidation Resistance of the Curved Surface of Achromatic Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of achromatic Cu films with semi&#8208;permanent stability and switchable superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic states on rough or curved surfaces is realized by an innovative strategy. Comprehensive atomic&#8208;resolution microscopy reveals that their surfaces are of a series of monoatomic steps and have a counterintuitive lattice contraction, which demonstrates the self&#8208;oxidation resistance of copper.








Abstract
Copper surfaces that exhibit a wide range of achromatic colors while still metallic have not been studied, despite advancements in antireflection coatings. A series of achromatic copper films grown with [111] preferred orientation by depositing 3D&#160;porous nanostructures is introduced via coherent/incoherent atomic sputtering epitaxy. The porous copper nanostructures self&#8208;regulate the giant oxidation resistance by constructing a curved surface that generates a series of monoatomic steps, followed by shrinkage of the lattice spacing of one or two surface layers. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm that these structural components cooperatively increase the energy barrier against oxygen penetration. The achromaticity of the single&#8208;crystalline porous copper films is systematically tuned by geometrical parameters such as pore size distribution and 3D linkage. The optimized achromatic copper films with high oxidation resistance show an unusual switching effect between superhydrophilicity and superhydrophobicity. The tailored 3D porous nanostructures can be a candidate material&#160;for numerous applications, such as antireflection coatings, microfluidic devices, droplet tweezers, and reversible wettability switches.

Following oral administration in mice, &#946;&#8208;glucans&#8208;functionalized zinc&#8211;doxorubicin nanoparticles (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs) target and transpass intestinal M cells, overcome the epithelial barrier, and undergo phagocytosis by macrophages (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;). As hitchhiking cellular vehicles, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981; pass through the lymphatic system, enter systemic circulation, and then spontaneously target a primary tumor and metastatic lesions, functioning like &#8220;precision&#8208;guided stealth missiles&#8221;, improving the effectiveness of antitumor therapy.








Abstract
The prognosis in cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with current treatment modalities is poor owing to the highly desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a &#946;&#8208;glucans&#8208;functionalized zinc&#8211;doxorubicin nanoparticle system (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs) that can be orally administered, is developed for targeted PDAC therapy. Following oral administration in PDAC&#8208;bearing mice, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs actively target/transpass microfold cells, overcome the intestinal epithelial barrier, and then undergo subsequent phagocytosis by endogenous macrophages (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;). As hitchhiking cellular vehicles, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981; transits through the intestinal lymphatic system and enters systemic circulation, ultimately accumulating in the tumor tissue as a result of the tumor&#8208;homing and &#8220;stealth&#8221; properties that are conferred by endogenous M&#981;. Meanwhile, the M&#981; that hitchhikes&#160;&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs&#160;is activated to produce matrix metalloproteinases, destroying the desmoplastic stromal barrier, and differentiates toward the M1&#8208;like phenotype, modulating the TME and recruiting effector T cells, ultimately inducing apoptosis of the tumor cells. The combination of &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;&#160;and immune checkpoint blockade effectively inhibits the growth of the primary tumor and suppresses the development of metastasis. It thus represents an appealing approach to targeted PDAC therapy.

         <title>Perovskite Cathodes for Aqueous and Organic Iodine Batteries Operating Under One and Two Electrons Redox Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although conversion&#8208;type iodine&#8208;based batteries are considered promising for energy storage systems, stable electrode materials are scarce, especially for high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;electron reactions. We suggest using tin&#8208;based iodine&#8208;rich two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) ODASnI4 (ODA: 1,8&#8208;octanediamine) perovskite materials as cathode materials for iodine&#8208;based batteries. As a proof of concept, organic lithium&#8208;perovskite and aqueous zinc&#8208;perovskite batteries are fabricated and they can be operated based on the conventional one&#8208;electron and advanced two&#8208;electron transfer modes. The active elemental iodine in the perovskite cathode provides capacity through a reversible I&#8722;/I+ redox pair conversion at full depth, and the rapid electron injection/extraction leads to excellent reaction kinetics. Consequently, high discharge plateaus (1.71&#160;V versus Zn2+/Zn; 3.41&#160;V versus Li+/Li), large capacity (421 mAh g&#8722;1I), and a low decay rate (1.74&#160;mV/mAh g&#8722;1I) are achieved for lithium and zinc ion batteries, respectively. This study demonstrates the promising potential of perovskite materials for high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;iodine batteries. Their reactions based on the two&#8208;electron transfer mechanism shed light on similar battery systems aiming for decent operational stability and high energy density.

         <title>KERS&#8208;inspired Nanostructured Mineral Coatings Boost IFN&#947; Mrna Therapeutic Index for Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM) reprogramming is a promising therapeutic approach for cancer immunotherapy; however, its efficacy remains modest due to the low bioactivity of the recombinant cytokines used for TAM reprogramming. mRNA therapeutics are capable of generating fully functional proteins for various therapeutic purposes but accused for its poor sustainability. Inspired by kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS) in hybrid vehicles, a cytokine efficacy recovery system (CERS) is designed to substantially augment the therapeutic index of mRNA&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy via a &#8220;capture and stabilize&#8221; mechanism exerted by a nanostructured mineral coating carrying therapeutic cytokine mRNA. CERS remarkably recycled nearly 40% expressed cytokines by capturing them onto the mineral coating to extend its therapeutic timeframe, further polarizing the macrophages to strengthen their tumoricidal activity and activate adaptive immunity against tumors. Notably, interferon&#8208;&#947; (IFN&#947;) produced by CERS exhibits &#8764;42&#8208;fold higher biological activity than recombinant IFN&#947;, remarkably decreasing the required IFN&#947; dosage for TAM reprogramming. In tumor&#8208;bearing mice, IFN&#947;@CERS effectively polarizes TAMs to inhibit osteosarcoma progression. When combined with the PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody, IFN&#947;@CERS significantly boosts antitumor immune responses, and substantially prevents malignant lung metastases. Thus, CERS&#8208;mediated mRNA delivery represents a promising strategy to boost antitumor immunity for tumor treatment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) reprogramming is a promising therapeutic approach for cancer immunotherapy; however, its efficacy remains modest due to the low bioactivity of the recombinant cytokines used for TAM reprogramming. mRNA therapeutics are capable of generating fully functional proteins for various therapeutic purposes but accused for its poor sustainability. Inspired by kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS) in hybrid vehicles, a cytokine efficacy recovery system (CERS) is designed to substantially augment the therapeutic index of mRNA-based tumor immunotherapy via a &#8220;capture and stabilize&#8221; mechanism exerted by a nanostructured mineral coating carrying therapeutic cytokine mRNA. CERS remarkably recycled nearly 40% expressed cytokines by capturing them onto the mineral coating to extend its therapeutic timeframe, further polarizing the macrophages to strengthen their tumoricidal activity and activate adaptive immunity against tumors. Notably, interferon-&#947; (IFN&#947;) produced by CERS exhibits &#8764;42-fold higher biological activity than recombinant IFN&#947;, remarkably decreasing the required IFN&#947; dosage for TAM reprogramming. In tumor-bearing mice, IFN&#947;@CERS effectively polarizes TAMs to inhibit osteosarcoma progression. When combined with the PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, IFN&#947;@CERS significantly boosts antitumor immune responses, and substantially prevents malignant lung metastases. Thus, CERS-mediated mRNA delivery represents a promising strategy to boost antitumor immunity for tumor treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Erasable, Rewritable, and Reprogrammable Dual Information Encryption Based on Photoluminescent Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Recognition and Hydrogel Shape Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular strategy is demonstrated to achieve multimodal, erasable, reprogrammable, and reusable information encryption by reversibly modulating the fluorescence of a well&#8208;designed self&#8208;inclusion supramolecular fluorescent ink immobilized in a polymer brush on a hydrogel surface through host&#8211;guest recognition. This supramolecular recognition is combined with the shape&#8208;memory effect of responsive hydrogel to achieve dual&#8208;encryption.








Abstract
Information encryption technologies are very important for security, health, commodity, and communications, etc. Novel information encryption mechanisms and materials are desired to achieve multimode and reprogrammable encryption. Here, a supramolecular strategy is demonstrated to achieve multimodal, erasable, reprogrammable, and reusable information encryption by reversibly modulating fluorescence. A butyl&#8208;naphthalimide with flexible ethylenediamine functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (N&#8208;CD) is utilized as a fluorescent responsive ink for printing or patterning information on polymer brushes with dangling adamantane group grafted on responsive hydrogels. The photoluminescent naphthalimide moiety is bonded to &#946;&#8208;CD and entrapped in the cavity. Its fluorescence is highly weakened in &#946;&#8208;CD cavity and recovers after being expelled from the cavity by a competing guest molecule to emit bright green photoluminescence under UV. Experiments and theoretical calculations suggest &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and ICT as the primary mechanism for the naphthalimides assembly and fluorescence, which can be quenched through insertion of conjugated molecules and recover by removing the insert. Such reversible quenching and recovering are used to achieve repeated writing, erasing, and re&#8208;writing of information. Supramolecular recognition and hydrogel shape memory are further combined to achieve reversible dual&#8208;encryption. This study provides a novel strategy to develop smart materials with improved information security for broad applications.

         <title>Enhanced Operational Stability by Cavity Control of Single&#8208;Layer Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been realized in recent years, but the device lifetime needs further improvement for practical display or lighting applications. In this work, we present a device design principle by tuning the optical cavity of single&#8208;layer undoped devices, to realize efficient and long&#8208;lived TADF OLEDs. Extending the cavity length to the second&#8208;order interference maximum by increasing the emissive layer thickness broadens the recombination zone, while the optical outcoupling efficiency remains close to that of the thinner first&#8208;order devices. Such a device design leads to efficient and stable single&#8208;layer undoped OLEDs with a maximum EQE of 16%, a LT90 of 452&#160;h and LT50 of 3693&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which is doubled compared to the first&#8208;order counterparts. We further demonstrate that the widely&#8208;used empirical relation between OLED lifetime and light&#8208;intensity originates from triplet&#8208;polaron annihilation, resulting in an extrapolated LT50 at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 of close to 90,000&#160;h, approaching the demands for practical backlight applications.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Cosmetic Contact Lenses for Ocular Surface Diseases Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficiently balancing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by various factors on the ocular surface is a promising strategy for preventing the development of ocular surface diseases (OSDs). Nevertheless, the conventional topical administration of antioxidants is limited in efficacy due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and irreversible depletion, which impede their performance. To address this issue, we have developed contact lenses embedded with antioxidant nanozymes that can continuously scavenge ROS, thereby providing an excellent preventive effect against OSDs. Specifically, we chose Prussian blue (PB) family nanozymes based on their multiple antioxidant enzyme&#8208;like activities and excellent biocompatibility. The diverse range of colors makes them promising candidates for the development of cosmetic contact lenses (CCLs) as a substitute for conventional pigments. The efficacy of nanozyme&#8208;CCLs was demonstrated in rabbits and rats exposed to a high risk of developing OSDs. Our OSDs prevention nanozyme&#8208;CCLs can pave the way of CCLs towards powerful wearable biomedical devices and provide novel strategies for the rational utilization of nanomaterials in clinical practice.

         <title>A Nanodisc&#8208;Paved Biobridge Facilitates Stem Cell Membrane Fusogenicity for Intracerebral Shuttling and Bystander Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane fusogenicity technology using toolkits of discoidal high&#8208;density lipoprotein (HDL)&#8208;containing biomimicking 4F peptides is designed to functionalize mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through a lipid raft&#8208;mediated membrane fusion pathway. For Alzheimer's disease therapy, 4F&#8211;VBP (HDL) is assembled for MSC4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) fabrication. After systemic infusion, MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) recognize pathological vascular clues for efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier crossing, achieving bystander effects on neurons and microglia.








Abstract
Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies experience steadfast clinical advances but are still hindered by inefficient site&#8208;specific migration. An adaptable MSC membrane fusogenicity technology is conceptualized for lipid raft&#8208;mediated targeting ligand embedding by using toolkits of discoidal high&#8208;density lipoprotein (HDL)&#8208;containing biomimicking 4F peptides. According to the pathological clues of brain diseases, the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 specialized VBP peptide is fused with 4F to assemble 4F&#8208;VBP (HDL), which acts as a biobridge and transfers VBP onto the living cell membrane via lipid rafts for surface engineering of MSCs in suspension. When compared with the membrane&#8208;modifying strategies of PEGylated phospholipids, 4F&#8208;VBP (HDL) provides a 3.86 higher linkage efficiency to obtain MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL), which can recognize and adhere to the inflammatory endothelium for efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier crossing and brain accumulation. In APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the transcriptomic analysis reveals that systemic administration of MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) can activate pathways associated with neuronal activity and diminish neuroinflammation for rewiring AD brains. This customizable HDL&#8208;mediated membrane fusogenicity platform primes MSC inflammatory brain delivery, which can be expanded to other disease treatments by simply fusing 4F with relevant ligands for living cell engineering.

         <title>Iridium Based Selective Emitters for Thermophotovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The long&#8208;term operation of refractory&#8208;metal&#8208;based metamaterials is crucial for applications such as thermophotovoltaics. The metamaterials based on refractory metals like W, Mo, Ta, Nb and Re fail primarily by oxidation. Here &#160;we propose the use of the noble metal Ir as an alternative to refractory metals, stable to oxidation and having optical properties comparable to gold. &#160;We demonstrate the thermal endurance of Ir in a 3&#8208;layer&#8208;system, consisting of HfO2/Ir/HfO2, by performing annealing experiments up to 1240&#176;C in a pressure range from 2 &#215; 10&#8722;6&#160;mbar to 1&#160;bar. The Ir layer shows no oxidation in vacuum and inert gas atmosphere. At temperatures above 1100&#176;C, the Ir layer starts to agglomerate due to the degradation of the confining HfO2 layers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term operation of refractory-metal-based metamaterials is crucial for applications such as thermophotovoltaics. The metamaterials based on refractory metals like W, Mo, Ta, Nb and Re fail primarily by oxidation. Here &#160;we propose the use of the noble metal Ir as an alternative to refractory metals, stable to oxidation and having optical properties comparable to gold. &#160;We demonstrate the thermal endurance of Ir in a 3-layer-system, consisting of HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ir/HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, by performing annealing experiments up to 1240&#176;C in a pressure range from 2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mbar to 1&#160;bar. The Ir layer shows no oxidation in vacuum and inert gas atmosphere. At temperatures above 1100&#176;C, the Ir layer starts to agglomerate due to the degradation of the confining HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers. Alternative dielectric layers are required to further increase the application temperature. An in-situ x-ray diffraction experimental comparison between 1D multilayered Ir/HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and W/HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selective emitters annealed at 1000&#176;C, 2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mbar over 100&#160;h confirms oxidation stability of Ir while W multilayers gradually disappear. The results of this work show that metamaterials based on oxidizing refractory metals, such as tungsten, are not long-term stable even at 1000&#176;C.

Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a devastating prognosis without effective treatment options. Thus, there is an urgent need for more effective and safe therapies. Here, we present inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid nanoparticles (GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs) as novel drug&#8208;delivery system for the selective delivery of extraordinarily high concentrations of gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP) not only to the primary tumor but also to metastatic sites. GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs have a composition [ZrO]2+[GMP]2&#8211; with GMP as drug anion (76% of total IOH&#8208;NP mass). Multiscale fluorescence imaging confirms an efficient uptake in tumor cells, independent of the activity of the human&#8208;equilibrative&#8208;nucleoside transporter (hENT1), being responsible for gemcitabine (GEM) transport into cells and a key factor for GEM resistance. Delivering already phosphorylated GMP via GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs into tumor cells also allows to overcome cellular resistance induced by the down&#8208;regulation of deoxycytidine kinase. GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs show high accumulation in tumor lesions and only minor liver trapping when given intraperitoneally. GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs result in a higher anti&#8208;tumor efficacy compared to free GEM and is further enhanced applying cetuximab&#8208;functionalized GMP&#8208;CTX&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs. By maximizing the therapeutic benefits with high drug load, tumor&#8208;specific delivery, minimizing undesired side effects, overcoming mechanisms of chemoresistance, and preventing systemic GEM inactivation, we anticipate GMP&#8208;IOH&#8208;NPs to have a high chance to significantly improve current PDAC&#8208;patient outcome.

         <title>Intense Hydrochromic Photon Upconversion from Lead&#8208;Free 0D Metal Halides For Water Detection and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new 0D lead&#8208;free metal halide upconversion smart material is developed and applied as a moisture sensor. It exhibits excellent repeatability and is particularly suitable for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term water monitoring. Additionally, this upconversion smart material is applied to cipher text information encryption via a laser&#8208;based optical lighting method.








Abstract
Hydrochromic materials that change their luminescence color upon exposure to moisture have attracted considerable attention owing to their applications in sensing and information encryption. However, the existing materials lack high hydrochromic response and color tunability. This study reports the development of a new and bright 0D Cs3GdCl6 metal halide as the host for hydrochromic photon upconversion in the form of polycrystals (PCs) and nanocrystals. Lanthanides co&#8208;doped cesium gadolinium chloride metal halides exhibit upconversion luminescence (UCL) in the visible&#8211;infrared region upon 980&#160;nm laser excitation. In particular, PCs co&#8208;doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ exhibit hydrochromic UCL color change from green to red. These hydrochromic properties are quantitatively confirmed through the sensitive detection of water in tetrahydrofuran solvent via UCL color changes. This water&#8208;sensing probe exhibits excellent repeatability and is particularly suitable for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term water monitoring. Furthermore, the hydrochromic UCL property is exploited for stimuli&#8208;responsive information encryption via cyphertexts. These findings will pave the way for the development of new hydrochromic upconverting materials for emerging applications, such as noncontact sensors, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Like Li&#8208;Ion Conduction in Oxides Enabling Anomalously Stable Charge Transport across the Li/Electrolyte Interface in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D liquid&#8208;like Li&#8208;ion conduction is unveiled, which features a low activation energy (0.2 eV) and short mean residence time (&lt;1&#160;ps) of Li ions on interstitial sites, caused by the Li&#8211;O polyhedra distortion and the Li&#8208;ion correlation. High Li&#8208;ion conductivities (1.2&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C) and anomalously stable charge transport across Li/LiTa2PO8 without interfacial modifications are thereby induced.








Abstract
The softness of sulfur sublattice and rotational PS4 tetrahedra in thiophosphates result in liquid&#8208;like ionic conduction, leading to enhanced ionic conductivities and stable electrode/thiophosphate interfacial ionic transport. However, the existence of liquid&#8208;like ionic conduction in rigid oxides remains unclear, and modifications are deemed necessary to achieve stable Li/oxide solid electrolyte interfacial charge transport. In this study, by combining the neutron diffraction survey, geometrical analysis, bond valence site energy analysis, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, 1D liquid&#8208;like Li&#8208;ion conduction is discovered in LiTa2PO8 and its derivatives, wherein Li&#8208;ion migration channels are connected by four&#8208; or five&#8208;fold oxygen&#8208;coordinated interstitial sites. This conduction features a low activation energy (0.2&#160;eV) and short mean residence time (&lt;1&#160;ps) of Li ions on the interstitial sites, originating from the Li&#8211;O polyhedral distortion and Li&#8208;ion correlation, which are controlled by doping strategies. The liquid&#8208;like conduction enables a high ionic conductivity (1.2&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C), and a 700&#160;h anomalously stable cycling under 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for Li/LiTa2PO8/Li cells without interfacial modifications. These findings provide principles for the future discovery and design of improved solid electrolytes that do not require modifications to the Li/solid electrolyte interface to achieve stable ionic transport.

         <title>Doping Engineering to Modulate Lattice and Electronic Structure for Enhanced Piezocatalytic Therapy and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable, mesoporous, piezoelectric Mn&#8208;doped ZnO nanocluster is first constructed via a facile doping engineering strategy. The peizocatalytic performance of Mn&#8211;ZnO is significantly enhanced due to the generation of built&#8208;in electric field and oxygen vacancy by regulation of lattice space and electronic structure, thereby remarkably enhancing the ROS generation for piezocatalytic therapy and ferroptosis.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic therapy, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) under mechanical force, has garnered extensive attention for its use in cancer therapy owing to its deep tissue penetration depth and less O2&#8208;dependence. However, the piezocatalytic therapeutic efficiency is limited owing to the poor piezoresponse, low separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs, and complicated tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a biodegradable, porous Mn&#8208;doped ZnO (Mn&#8211;ZnO)&#160;nanocluster with enhanced piezoelectric effect is constructed via doping engineering. Mn&#8208;doping not only induces lattice distortion to increase polarization but also creates rich oxygen vacancies (OV) for suppressing the recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs, leading to high&#8208;efficiency generation of ROS under ultrasound irradiation. Moreover, Mn&#8208;doped ZnO shows TME&#8208;responsive multienzyme&#8208;mimicking activity&#160;and&#160;glutathione (GSH) depletion ability owing to the mixed valence of Mn (II/III), further aggravating oxidative stress. Density functional theory calculations show that Mn&#8208;doping can improve the piezocatalytic performance and enzyme activity of Mn&#8211;ZnO due to the presence of OV. Benefiting from the boosting of ROS generation and GSH depletion ability, Mn&#8211;ZnO can significantly accelerate the accumulation of lipid peroxide and inactivate glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to induce ferroptosis. The work may provide new guidance for exploring novel piezoelectric sonosensitizers for tumor therapy.

Benefiting from the boosting of ROS generation and GSH depletion ability, Mn&#8211;ZnO can significantly accelerate the accumulation of lipid peroxide and inactivate glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to induce ferroptosis. The work may provide new guidance for exploring novel piezoelectric sonosensitizers for tumor therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Performance Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Activation of In&#8208;Layer Channels for Enhanced Ion Storage and Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study proposes an electrochemical phase transformation approach for the in situ synthesis of layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O (E&#8208;VOPO) for ammonium&#8208;ion batteries. The in&#8208;layer channels provide additional NH4+ storage sites and rapid cross&#8208;layer migration pathways. The E&#8208;VOPO shows exceptional NH4+ storage performance with increased capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. The resulting full cell operates stably for 12&#160;500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles.








Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries, leveraging non&#8208;metallic ammonium ions, have arisen as a promising electrochemical energy storage system; however, their advancement has been hindered by the scarcity of high&#8208;performance ammonium&#8208;ion storage materials. In this study, an electrochemical phase transformation approach is proposed for the in situ synthesis of layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O (E&#8208;VOPO) with predominant growth on the (200) plane, corresponding to the tetragonal channels on the (001) layers. The findings reveal that these tetragonal in&#8208;layer channels not only furnish NH4+ storage sites but also enhance transfer kinetics by providing rapid cross&#8208;layer migration pathways. This crucial aspect has been largely overlooked in previous studies. The E&#8208;VOPO electrode exhibits exceptional ammonium&#8208;ion storage performance, including significantly increased specific capacity, enhanced rate capability, and robust cycling stability. The resulting full cell can be stably operated for 12&#160;500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 for over 70 days. The proposed approach offers a new strategy for meticulously engineering electrode materials with facilitated ion storage and migration, thereby paving the way for developing more efficient and sustainable energy storage systems.

         <title>Fully Printed, High&#8208;Temperature Micro&#8208;Supercapacitor Arrays Enabled by a Hexagonal Boron Nitride Ionogel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible micro&#8208;supercapacitor device arrays are fabricated via sequential high&#8208;speed screen printing of conductive graphene electrodes and a high&#8208;temperature hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) ionogel electrolyte. Unlike incumbent polymer electrolytes, the hBN ionogel electrolyte enables stable micro&#8208;supercapacitor functionality at temperatures as high as 180 &#176;C, thus broadening the operating conditions and application space for on&#8208;chip energy storage.








Abstract
The proliferation and miniaturization of portable electronics require energy&#8208;storage devices that are simultaneously compact, flexible, and amenable to scalable manufacturing. In this work, mechanically flexible micro&#8208;supercapacitor arrays are demonstrated via sequential high&#8208;speed screen printing of conductive graphene electrodes and a high&#8208;temperature hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) ionogel electrolyte. By combining the superlative dielectric properties of 2D hBN with the high ionic conductivity of ionic liquids, the resulting hBN ionogel electrolyte enables micro&#8208;supercapacitors with exceptional areal capacitances that approach 1 mF cm&#8722;2. Unlike incumbent polymer&#8208;based electrolytes, the high&#8208;temperature stability of the hBN ionogel electrolyte implies that the printed micro&#8208;supercapacitors can be operated at unprecedentedly high temperatures up to 180 &#176;C. These elevated operating temperatures result in increased power densities that make these printed micro&#8208;supercapacitors particularly promising for applications in harsh environments such as underground exploration, aviation, and electric vehicles. The combination of enhanced functionality in extreme conditions and high&#8208;speed production via scalable additive manufacturing significantly broadens the technological phase space for on&#8208;chip energy storage.

         <title>Beyond Rattling: Tetrahedrites as Incipient Ionic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Materials with ultralow thermal conductivity are crucial to many technological applications, including thermoelectric energy harvesting, thermal barrier coatings, and optoelectronics. Liquid&#8208;like mobile ions are effective at disrupting phonon propagation, hence suppressing thermal conduction. However, high ionic mobility leads to degradation of liquid&#8208;like thermoelectric materials under operating conditions due to ion migration and metal deposition at the cathode, hindering their practical application. Here, we identify a new type of behaviour, incipient ionic conduction, which leads to ultralow thermal conductivity, while overcoming the issues of degradation inherent in liquid&#8208;like materials. Using neutron spectroscopy and molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that in tetrahedrite, an established thermoelectric material with a remarkably low thermal conductivity, copper ions although mobile above 200 K, are predominantly confined to cages within the crystal structure. Hence the undesirable migration of cations to the cathode can be avoided. These findings unveil a new approach for the design of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity, by exploring systems in which incipient ionic conduction may be present.

Abstract
Anti&#8208;ambipolar heterojunctions are vital in constructing high&#8208;frequency oscillators, fast switches, and multivalued logic (MVL) devices, which hold promising potential for next&#8208;generation integrated circuit chips and telecommunication technologies. Thanks to strategic material design and device integration, anti&#8208;ambipolar heterojunctions have demonstrated unparalleled device and circuit performance that surpasses other semiconducting material systems. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the achievements in the field of anti&#8208;ambipolar heterojunctions. First, we discuss the fundamental operating mechanisms of anti&#8208;ambipolar devices. After that, potential materials used in anti&#8208;ambipolar devices are discussed with particular attention to 2D&#8208;based, 1D&#8208;based, and organic&#8208;based heterojunctions. Next, we overview the primary device applications employing anti&#8208;ambipolar heterojunctions, including anti&#8208;ambipolar transistors (AATs), photodetectors, frequency doublers, and synaptic devices. Furthermore, alongside the advancements in individual devices, the practical integration of these devices at the circuit level, including topics such as MVL circuits, complex logic gates, and spiking neuron circuits, is also discussed. Lastly, the present key challenges and future research directions concerning anti&#8208;ambipolar heterojunctions and their applications are also emphasized.

         <title>Mechanically Gated Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based field effect transistors (FETs) have underpinned the information revolution in the last 60 years, and there is a strong desire for new materials, devices and architectures that can help sustain the computing power in the age of big data and artificial intelligence. Inspired by the Piezo channels, we develop a mechanically gated transistor (MGT) abandoning electric gating altogether, achieving ON/OFF ratio over three orders of magnitude under a mechanical force of hundreds of nN. The two&#8208;terminal device utilizes flexoelectric polarization induced by strain gradient, which modulates the carrier concentration in a Van der Waals (vdW) structure significantly, and it mimics Piezo channels for artificial tactile perception. This simple device concept can be easily adapted in a wide range of semiconducting materials, helping promote the fusion between mechanics and electronics in a similar way as mechanobiology.

Abstract
Ruptured wide&#8208;neck aneurysms (WNAs), especially in a setting of coagulopathy, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We show that by trapping a sub&#8208;millimeter clinical catheter inside the aneurysm sac using a flow diverter stent (FDS), we can achieve instant hemostasis by filling the aneurysm sac using a novel biomaterial rescuing catastrophic bleeding in large animal models. Here, multiple formulations of a biomaterial comprising gelatin, nanoclay, and iohexol were developed, optimized, and extensively tested in vitro to select the lead candidate for further testing in vivo in rat, porcine and canine models of WNAs, including in a subset with aneurysm rupture. The catheter&#8208;injectable and x&#8208;ray visible versions of the gel embolic agent (GEA) with the optimized mechanical properties outperformed control groups, including a subset that received a clinically used liquid embolic (Onyx, Medtronic), with and without aneurysm rupture. A combinatorial approach to ruptured WNAs with GEA and FDS may change the standard of medical practice and save lives.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Mechanical Cloaking of Diarylethene&#8208;Crosslinked Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The serial connection of multiple stimuli&#8208;responses in polymer architectures enables the logically conjunctive gating of functional material processes on demand. Here, a photoswitchable diarylethene (DAE) acts as crosslinker in poly(N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) microgels and allows the light&#8208;induced shift of the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT). While swollen microgels below the VPTT are susceptible to force and undergo breakage&#8208;aggregation processes, collapsed microgels above the VPTT stay intact in mechanical fields induced by ultrasonication. Within a VPTT shift regime, photoswitching of the DAE transfers microgels from the swollen to the collapsed state and thereby gates their response to force as demonstrated on the light&#8208;gated activation of an embedded fluorogenic mechanophore. This photo&#8208;induced mechanical cloaking system operates on the polymer topology level and is thereby principally universally applicable.

         <title>Intermediate Phase Free &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite via Green Solvent Assisted Perovskite Single Crystal Redissolution Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite single crystal redissolution (PSCR) strategy is highly desired for efficient formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite photovoltaics with enhanced phase purity, improved film quality, low trap&#8208;state density, and good stability. However, the phase transition and crystallization dynamics of FAPbI3 remain unclear in the PSCR process compared to the conventional fabrication from the mixing of precursor materials. In this work, a green&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted (GSA) method is employed to synthesize centimeter&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 single crystals, which serve as the high&#8208;purity precursor to fabricate perovskite films. The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 PSCR strategy facilitates direct &#945;&#8208;phase formation and inhibits the complex intermediate phases monitored by in&#8208;situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS). Moreover, the &#945;&#8208;phase stability is prolonged due to the relaxation of the residual lattice strain through the isotropic orientation phase growth. Consequently, the GSA&#8208;assisted PSCR strategy effectively promotes crystallization and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which boosted the device efficiency from 22.08% to 23.92% with significantly enhanced open circuit voltage. Our findings provide deeper insight into the PSCR process in terms of its efficacy in phase formation and lattice strain release. The green low&#8208;cost solvent may also offer a new and ideal solvent candidate for large&#8208;scale production of perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Intermittent Defect Fluctuations in Oxide Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The heterogeneous nature, local presence, and dynamic evolution of defects typically govern the ionic and electronic properties of a wide variety of functional materials. While the last 50 years have seen considerable efforts into development of new methods to identify the nature of defects in complex materials, such as the perovskite oxides, very little is known about defect dynamics and its influence on the functionality of a material. Here, we&#160; report the discovery of the intermittent behavior of point defects (oxygen vacancies) in oxide heterostructures employing X&#8208;ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy. We&#160; observe local fluctuations between two ordered phases in strained SrCoOx with different degrees of stability of the oxygen vacancies. Ab initio&#8208;informed phase&#8208;field modeling reveals that fluctuations between the competing ordered phases are modulated by the oxygen ion / vacancy interaction energy and epitaxial strain. The results demonstrate how defect dynamics, evidenced by measurement and modeling of their temporal fluctuations, give rise to stochastic properties that now can be fully characterized using coherent x&#8208;rays, coupled for the first time to multiscale modeling in functional complex oxide heterostructures. Our&#160; study and its findings open new avenues for engineering the dynamical response of functional materials used in neuromorphic and electrochemical&#160;applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Co&#8208;Free O3&#8208;type Layered Oxyfluoride: A Promising Air&#8208;Stable Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Na&#8208;ion batteries have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Li&#8208;based batteries, driven by an ever&#8208;growing demand for electricity storage systems. In the present work, we&#160;propose a cobalt&#8208;free high&#8208;capacity cathode for Na&#8208;ion batteries, synthesized using a high&#8208;entropy approach. The high&#8208;entropy approach entails mixing more than five elements in a single phase; hence, obtaining the desired properties is a challenge since this involves the interplay between different elements. Here, instead of oxide, oxyfluoride is chosen to suppress oxygen loss during long&#8208;term cycling. Supplement to this, Li was&#160;introduced in the composition to obtain high configurational entropy and Na vacant sites, thus stabilizing the crystal structure, accelerating the kinetics of intercalation/deintercalation, and improving the air stability of the material. With the optimization of the cathode composition, a reversible capacity of 109 mAh g&#8722;1 (2&#8208;4&#160;V) and 144 mAh g&#8722;1 (2&#8208;4.3&#160;V) is observed in the first few cycles, along with a significant improvement in stability during prolonged cycling. Furthermore, in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ diffraction studies during charging/discharging reveal that the high&#8208;entropy strategy is successful in suppressing the complex phase transition. The impressive outcomes of the present work strongly motivate the pursuit of the high&#8208;entropy approach to develop efficient cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>The Synthescope: A Vision for Combining Synthesis with Atomic Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efforts toward atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom fabrication have gathered momentum. Recent results with electron&#8208;beam manipulation illustrate a significant advance toward atomic&#8208;scale patterning. In this work, the case is made that future efforts in this direction will benefit from reconceptualizing the scanning transmission electron microscope as a combined synthesis and manipulation platform, and simple strategies to incorporate synthesis processes with existing hardware are provided.








Abstract
The scanning transmission electron microscope, a workhorse instrument in materials characterization, is being transformed into an atomic&#8208;scale material&#8208;manipulation platform. With an eye on the trajectory of recent developments and the obstacles toward progress in this field, a vision for a path toward an expanded set of capabilities and applications is provided. The microscope is reconceptualized as an instrument for fabrication and synthesis with the capability to image and characterize atomic&#8208;scale structural formation as it occurs. Further development and refinement of this approach may have substantial impact on research in microelectronics, quantum information science, and catalysis, where precise control over atomic&#8208;scale structure and chemistry of a few &#8220;active sites&#8221; can have a dramatic impact on larger&#8208;scale functionality and where developing a better understanding of atomic&#8208;scale processes can help point the way to larger&#8208;scale synthesis approaches.

         <title>Ultrastrong Ionotronic Films Showing Electrochemical Osmotic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastrong nanocomposite is introduced, which is formed based on the two nanoscopic building blocks: large&#8208;size 2D MXene and 1D nanocellulose with very high aspect ratio. In the wet state, the hierarchical structures of the nanocomposite provide high ionotronic conductivity and enable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane actuation with reversible giant strain reaching 85% at only 1 V.








Abstract
A multifunctional soft material with high ionic and electrical conductivity, combined with high mechanical properties and the ability to change shape can enable bioinspired responsive devices and systems. The incorporation of all these characteristics in a single material is very challenging, as the improvement of one property tends to reduce other properties. Here, a nanocomposite film based on charged, high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio 1D flexible nanocellulose fibrils, and 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is presented. The self&#8208;assembly process results in a stratified structure with the nanoparticles aligned in&#8208;plane, providing high ionotronic conductivity and mechanical strength, as well as large water uptake. In hydrogel form with 20&#160;wt% liquid, the electrical conductivity is over 200 S cm&#8722;1 and the in&#8208;plane tensile strength is close to 100&#160;MPa. This multifunctional performance results from the uniquely layered composite structure at nano&#8208; and mesoscales. A new type of electrical soft actuator is assembled where voltage as low as &#177;1&#160;V resulted in osmotic effects and giant reversible out&#8208;of&#8208;plane swelling, reaching 85% strain.

         <title>Cooperative Copper Single Atom Catalyst in Two&#8208;dimensional Carbon Nitride for Enhanced CO2 Electrolysis to Methane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Renewable electricity powered carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction (eCO2R) to high&#8208;value fuels like methane (CH4) holds the potential to close the carbon cycle at meaningful scales. However, this kinetically staggered 8&#8208;electron multistep reduction still suffers from inadequate catalytic efficiency and current density. Atomic Cu&#8208;structures can boost eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity due to enhanced intermediate binding energies (BEs) resulting from favorably shifted d&#8208;band centers. Herein, we exploit two&#8208;dimensional carbon nitride (CN) matrices, viz. Na&#8208;polyheptazine (PHI) and Li&#8208;polytriazine imides (PTI), to host Cu&#8208;N2 type single atom sites with high density (&#8764;1.5 at%), via a facile metal ion exchange process. Optimized Cu loading in nanocrystalline Cu&#8208;PTI maximizes eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 performance with Faradaic efficiency (FECH4) of &#8776;68% and a high partial current density of 348&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low potential of &#8208;0.84&#160;V versus RHE, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Multi&#8208;Cu substituted N&#8208;appended nanopores in the CN frameworks yield thermodynamically stable quasi&#8208;dual/triple sites with large interatomic distances dictated by the pore dimensions. First&#8208;principles calculations elucidate the relative Cu&#8208;CN cooperative effects between the two matrices and how the Cu&#8208;Cu distance and local environment dictate the adsorbate BEs, density of states, and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 energy profile landscape. The 9N pores in Cu&#8208;PTI yield cooperative Cu&#8208;Cu sites that synergistically enhance the kinetics of the rate&#8208;limiting steps in the eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 pathway.

         <title>Geometric Control And Optical Properties of Intrinsically Chiral Plasmonic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials exhibit intriguing geometry&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties, which is due to the combination of plasmonic features with geometric chirality. Thus, chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have become promising candidates for applications in biosensing, asymmetric catalysis, biomedicine, photonics, etc. Recent advances in geometric control and optical tuning of intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have further opened up a unique opportunity for their widespread applications in many emerging technological areas. Here, we review the recent developments in the geometric control of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials with special attention given to the quantitative understanding of the chiroptical structure&#8208;property relationship. We also discuss several important optical spectroscopic tools for characterizing the optical chirality of plasmonic nanomaterials at both ensemble and single&#8208;particle levels. We further highlight three emerging applications of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials including enantioselective sensing, enantioselective catalysis, and biomedicine. We envision that these advanced studies in chiral plasmonic nanomaterials will pave the way toward the rational design of chiral nanomaterials with desired optical properties for diverse emerging technological applications.

         <title>Synchronous and Fully Steerable Active Particle Systems for Enhanced Mimicking of Collective Motion in Nature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The collective motion observed in living active matter, such as fish schools and bird flocks, is characterized by its dynamic and complex nature, involving various moving states and transitions. By tailoring physical interactions or incorporating information exchange capabilities, inanimate active particles can exhibit similar behavior. However, the lack of synchronous and arbitrary control over individual particles hinders their use as a test system for the study of more intricate collective motions in living species. Herein, we propose a novel optical feedback control system that enables the mimicry of collective motion observed in living objects using active particles. This system allows for the experimental investigation of the velocity alignment, a seminal model of collective motion (known as the Vicsek model), in a microscale perturbed environment with controllable and realistic conditions. We observe the spontaneous formation of different moving states and dynamic transitions between these states. Additionally, we quantitatively validate the high robustness of the active&#8208;particle group at the critical density under the influence of different perturbations. Our findings support the effectiveness of velocity alignment in real perturbed environments, thereby providing a versatile platform for fundamental studies on collective motion and the development of innovative swarm microrobotics.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Speed Aqueous Copper Electrodes Stabilized by Phosphorylated Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;energy metal anodes for large&#8208;scale reversible batteries with inexpensive and non&#8208;flammable aqueous electrolytes promise the capability of supporting higher current density, satisfactory lifetime, non&#8208;toxicity, and low&#8208;cost commercial manufacturing, yet remain out of reach due to the lack of reliable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase engineering. Herein, we demonstrate in situ formed robust interphase on copper metal electrodes (CMEs) induced by a trace amount of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (0.05&#160;M in 1&#160;M CuSO4&#8208;H2O electrolyte) to fulfill all aforementioned requirements. Impressively, an unprecedented ultrahigh&#8208;speed copper plating/stripping capability is achieved at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2&#160;for over 12000 cycles, corresponding to an accumulative areal capacity up to tens of times higher than previously reported CMEs. The use of SEI&#8208;protection strategy brings at least an order of magnitude improvement in cycling stability for symmetric cells (Cu||Cu, 2800&#160;h) and full batteries with CMEs using either sulfur cathodes (S||Cu, 1000 cycles without capacity decay) or zinc anodes (Cu||Zn with all&#8208;metal electrodes, discharge voltage &#8764;1.02&#160;V). The comprehensive analysis reveals that the hydrophilic phosphate&#8208;rich interphase nanostructures homogenized copper&#8208;ion deposition and suppressed nucleation overpotential, enabling dendrite&#8208;free CMEs with sustainability and ability to tolerate unusual&#8208;high power densities. Our findings represent an&#160;elegant&#160;forerunner&#160;toward the promising goal of metal electrode applications.

Alternative approaches, such as neuromorphic or reservoir computing, are rapidly gaining interest where data processing is relatively slow, but can be performed in a more comprehensive way or massively in parallel, like in neuronal circuits. Here we discover time&#8208;domain all&#8208;optical information processing capabilities of photon avalanching (PA) nanoparticles at room temperature. Demonstrated functionality resembles properties found in neuronal synapses, such as: paired&#8208;pulse facilitation and short&#8208;term internal memory, in&#8208;situ plasticity, multiple inputs processing, and all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing threshold response. The PA memory&#8208;like behavior shows capability of machine&#8208;learning&#8208;algorithms&#8208;free feature extraction and further recognition of 2D patterns with simple 2 input artificial neural network (ANN). Additionally, high&#8208;nonlinearity of luminescence intensity in response to photoexcitation mimics and enhances spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity that is coherent in nature with the way a sound source is localized in animals neuronal circuits. Not only yet unexplored fundamental properties of photon avalanche luminescence kinetics are studied, but our approach, combined with recent achievements in photonics, light confinement and guiding, promises all&#8208;optical data processing, control, adaptive responsivity and storage on photonic chips.

         <title>Obviating Ligand Exchange Preserves the Intact Surface of HgTe Colloidal Quantum Dots and Enhances Performance of Short Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A large volume, scalable, synthesis procedure of HgTe quantum dots (QDs) capped initially with short&#8208;chain conductive ligands, ensures ligand exchange&#8208;free and simple device fabrication. An effective n&#8208; or p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping of HgTe QDs is achieved by varying the cation&#8208;anion ratio, as well as shifting the Fermi level position by introducing single&#8208; or double&#8208;cyclic thiol ligands, i.e., 2&#8208;furanmethanethiol (FMT) or 2,5&#8208;dimercapto&#8208;3,4&#8208;thiadiasole (DMTD) in the synthesis. This allows for the preservation of the intact surface of the HgTe QDs, thus ensuring a one order of magnitude reduced surface trap density compared with HgTe subjected to solid&#8208;state ligand exchange. The charge carrier diffusion length can be extended from 50 to 90&#160;nm when the device active area consists of a bi&#8208;layer of cation&#8208;rich HgTe QDs capped with DMTD and FMT respectively. As a result, the responsivity under 1340&#160;nm illumination is boosted to 1 AW&#8722;1 at zero bias and up to 40 AW&#8722;1 under &#8208;1&#160;V bias at room temperature. Due to high noise current density, the specific detectivity of these photodetectors&#8217; reaches up to 1010 Jones at room temperature and under inert atmosphere. Meanwhile, high photoconductive gain ensures a rise in the external quantum efficiency of up to 1000% under reverse bias.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Amorphous Iron Selenide Sulfide Nanosheets for Stable and Rapid Sodium&#8208;ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) suffer from large electrode volume change and sluggish redox kinetics for the relatively large ionic radius of sodium ions, raising a significant challenge to improve their long&#8208;term cyclability and rate capacity. Here, we propose to apply a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) amorphous iron selenide sulfide nanosheets (a&#8208;FeSeS NSs) as an anode material for SIBs, and demonstrate that they exhibit remarkable rate capability of 528.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and long&#8208;life cycle (10000 cycles) performance (300.4 mAh g&#8722;1). This performance is much more superior to that of the previously reported Fe&#8208;based anode materials, which is attributed to their amorphous structure that alleviates volume expansion of electrode, 2D nature that facilitates electrons/ions transfer, and the S/Se double anions that offer more reaction sites and stabilize the amorphous structure. Such a 2D amorphous strategy provides a fertile platform for structural engineering of other electrode materials, making a more secure energy prospect closer to a reality.

         <title>Microfibrous Scaffolds Guide Stem Cell Lumenogenesis and Brain Organoid Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
3D organoids have been widely used as tractable in vitro models capable of elucidating aspects of human development and disease. However, the manual and low throughput culture methods coupled with a low reproducibility and geometric heterogeneity restricts the scope and application of organoid research. Combining expertise from stem cell biology and bioengineering offers a promising approach to address some of these limitations. Here, we use melt electrospinning writing to generate tuneable grid scaffolds that can guide the self&#8208;organization of pluripotent stem cells into patterned arrays of embryoid bodies. We show that grid geometry is a key determinant of stem cell self&#8208;organization, guiding the position and size of emerging lumens via curvature&#8208;controlled tissue growth. We report two distinct methods for culturing scaffold&#8208;grown embryoid bodies into either interconnected or spatially discrete cerebral organoids. These scaffolds provide a high&#8208;throughput method to generate, culture and analyse large numbers of organoids, substantially reducing the time investment and manual labour involved in conventional methods of organoid culture. We anticipate that this methodological development will open up new opportunities for guiding pluripotent stem cell culture, studying lumenogenesis, and generating large numbers of uniform organoids for high throughput screening.

         <title>Power&#8208;Efficient Multisensory Reservoir Computing Based on Zr&#8208;doped HfO2 Memcapacitive Synapse Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hardware implementations tailored to requirements in reservoir computing would facilitate lightweight and powerful temporal processing. Capacitive reservoirs would boost power efficiency due to their ultralow static power consumption but haven't been experimentally exploited yet. Here we&#160;report an oxide&#8208;based memcapacitive synapse (OMC) based on Zr&#8208;doped HfO2 (HZO) for a power&#8208;efficient and multisensory processing reservoir computing system. The nonlinearity and state richness required for reservoir computing could be originated from the capacitively coupled polarization switching and charge trapping of hafnium oxide&#8208;based devices. The power consumption (&#8764;113.4 fJ/spike) and temporal processing versatility outperform most resistive reservoirs. Our&#160;system has been verified by common benchmark tasks, and it exhibits high accuracy (&gt;94%) in recognizing multisensory information, including acoustic, electrophysiological, and mechanic modalities. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a touchless user interface for virtual shopping is demonstrated based on our&#160;OMC&#8208;based reservoir computing system, benefiting from its interference&#8208;robust acoustic and electrophysiological perception. Our&#160;results would shed light on the development of high power&#8208;efficient human&#8208;machine interfaces and machine&#8208;learning platforms.

         <title>Hapten/Myristoyl Functionalized Poly(Propylene IMINE) Dendrimers as Potent Cell Surface Recruiters of Antibodies for Mediating Innate Immune Killing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recruiting endogenous antibodies to the surface of cancer cells using antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules has the potential to unleash innate immune effector killing mechanisms against antibody&#8208;bound cancer cells. However, the affinity of endogenous antibodies is relatively low, and many currently explored antibody&#8208;recruiting strategies rely on targeting over&#8208;expressed receptors, which have not yet been identified in most solid tumors. In this study, we aimed to address both challenges by functionalizing poly(propyleneimine) (PPI) dendrimers with both multiple dinitrophenyl (DNP) motifs, as anti&#8208;hapten antibody&#8208;recruiting motifs, and myristoyl motifs, as universal phospholipid cell membrane anchoring motifs, to recruit anti&#8208;hapten antibodies to cell surfaces. By exploiting the multivalency of the ligand exposure on the dendrimer scaffold, we demonstrated that dendrimers featuring ten myristoyl and six DNP motifs exhibited the highest antibody&#8208;recruiting capacity in vitro. Furthermore, we showed that treating cancer cells with these dendrimers in vitro marked them for phagocytosis by macrophages in the presence of anti&#8208;hapten antibodies. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we showed that intratumoral injection of these dendrimers in vivo in tumor&#8208;bearing mice, resulted in the recruitment of anti&#8208;DNP antibodies to the surface of cells in the tumor microenvironment. Our findings highlight the potential of dendrimers as a promising class of novel antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules for use in cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract
In recent decades, the rapid growth in flexible materials, new manufacturing technologies, and wearable electronics design techniques has help establish the foundations for noninvasive photoelectric sensing systems with shape&#8208;adaptability and &#8220;skin&#8208;like&#8221; properties. Physiological sensing includes humidity, mechanical, thermal, photoelectric, and other aspects. Photoplethysmography (PPG), an important non&#8208;invasive method for measuring pulse rate, blood pressure and blood oxygen, uses the attenuated signal obtained by the light absorbed and reflected from living tissue to a light source to realize real&#8208;time monitoring of human health status. Our work illustrates a patch&#8208;type optoelectronic system that integrates a flexible perovskite photodetector and all&#8208;inorganic light&#8208;emitting diodes to realize the real&#8208;time monitoring of human PPG signals. The pulse rate of the human body and the swelling degree of finger joints can be extracted and analyzed using photodetectors, thus monitoring human health for the prevention and early diagnosis of certain diseases. Specifically, we developed a 3D wrinkled&#8208;serpentine interconnection wire that increased the shape adaptability of the device in practical applications. The PPG signal sensor reported in this study has considerable potential for future wearable intelligent medical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Polymeric Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors: The Impacts of Halogen Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECs) is a grand challenge, which largely determines their applications in organic electronic devices based on logic circuits and p&#8208;n junctions, such as organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, we report two halogen&#8208;functionalized PMIECs f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTF and f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCl built from fused bithiophene imide dimer (f&#8208;BTI2) bearing branched oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain as the acceptor unit and halogenated thienylene&#8211;vinylene&#8211;thienylene (TVT) as the donor co&#8208;unit. Compared to the control polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVT, the fluorinated f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTF shows lower&#8208;positioned LUMO, improved charge transport property, and greater ion uptake capacity. As a result, f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTF delivers a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#956;C* of 90.2 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 with a remarkable electron mobility of 0.41 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in OECTs and an excellent power factor of 64.2 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 in OTEs, higher than those of f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCl and parent f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVT. Using f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTF, we further demonstrate an OECT&#8208;based inverter amplifier with voltage gain up to 148&#160;V V&#8722;1, which is among the highest values for OECT inverters. Such results shed light on the impacts of halogen atoms for developing high&#8208;performing n&#8208;type PMIECs and pave the way for realizing highly efficient n&#8208;type OECT and OTE devices.

         <title>The Electrical Behaviors of Grain Boundaries in Polycrystalline Optoelectronic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polycrystalline optoelectronic materials are widely used for photoelectric signal conversion and energy harvesting, and play an irreplaceable role in the semiconductor field. As an important factor in determining the optoelectronic properties of polycrystalline materials, grain boundaries (GBs) have been the focus of research. Particular emphases have been placed on the generation and height of GB barriers, how carriers move at GBs, whether GBs act as carrier transport channels or recombination sites, and how to change the device performance by altering the electrical behaviors of GBs. This review introduces the evolution of GB theory and experimental observation history, classifies GB electrical behaviors from the perspective of carrier dynamics, summarizes carrier transport state under the external conditions such as bias and illumination and the related band bending. Then the carrier scattering at GBs and the electrical differences between GBs and twin boundaries are discussed. Lastly, the review describes how the electrical behaviors of GBs can be influenced and modified by treatments such as passivation or by consciously adjusting the distribution of grain boundary elements. By studying the carrier dynamics and the relevant electrical behaviors of GBs in polycrystalline materials, researchers can develop optoelectronics with higher performance.

         <title>Genetically Encoded Oligomerization for Protein&#8208;Based Lighting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Implementing proteins in optoelectronics represents a fresh idea towards a sustainable new class of materials with bio&#8208;functions that can replace environmentally unfriendly and/or toxic components without losing device performance. However, their native activity (fluorescence, catalysis, etc.) is easily lost under device fabrication/operation as non&#8208;native environments (organic solvents, organic/inorganic interfaces, etc.) and severe stress (temperature, irradiation, etc.) are involved. Herein, we showcase a gift bow genetically&#8208;encoded macro&#8208;oligomerization strategy to promote protein&#8208;protein solid interaction enabling i) high versatility with arbitrary proteins, ii) straightforward electrostatic driven control of the macro&#8208;oligomer size by ionic strength, and iii) stabilities over months in pure organic solvents and stress scenarios, allowing to integrate them into classical water&#8208;free polymer&#8208;based materials/components for optoelectronics. Indeed, rainbow&#8208;/white&#8208;emitting protein&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes were fabricated, attesting a first&#8208;class performance compared to those with their respective native proteins: significantly enhanced device stabilities from a few minutes up to 100&#160;h keeping device efficiency at high power driving conditions. Thus, the oligomerization concept is a solid bridge between biological systems and materials/components to meet expectations in bio&#8208;optoelectronics, in general, and lighting schemes, in particular.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Diode&#8208;Like Heterojunction for Improving Electricity Generation from Water Droplets by Capillary Infiltration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the continuous power generation from water droplets by capillary infiltration, an Al2O3/PVDF based hydrovoltaic electricity generator with an ion&#8208;diode&#8208;like heterojunction is developed. With a drop of water, this device can generate a peak short&#8208;circuit current density of 160 &#181;A cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.7 V, and an accumulated charge of 60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s.








Abstract
Water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based electricity generators are emerging hydrovoltaic technologies that harvest energy from water circulation through strong interactions between water and nanomaterials. However, such devices exhibit poor current performance owing to their unclear driving force (evaporation or infiltration) and undesirable reverse diffusion current. Herein, a water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based hydrovoltaic electricity generator induced by capillary infiltration with an asymmetric structure composed of a diode&#8208;like heterojunction formed by negatively and positively charged materials is fabricated. This device can generate current densities of 160 and 450&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 65 &#176;C, respectively. The heterojunction achieves a rectification ratio of 12, which effectively suppresses the reverse current caused by concentration differences. This results in an improved charge accumulation of &#8776;60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s, which is three times the value observed in the control device. When the area of the device is increased to 6 cm2, the current increases linearly to 1&#160;mA, thus demonstrating the scale&#8208;up potential of the generator. It has been proven that the streaming potential originates from&#160;capillary infiltration, and the presence of ion rectification. The proposed method of constructing ion&#8208;diode&#8208;like structures provides a new strategy for improving generator performance.

         <title>Skin Thermal Management for Subcutaneous Photoelectric Conversion Reaching 500&#160;mW</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subcutaneous power supply device utilizing second near&#8208;infrared light is proposed with the synergistic combination of photovoltaic cells and a thermoelectric generator. Skin thermal management is used to turn photothermal toxicity into a favorable factor for photoelectric conversion. In in vivo experiment, its output power can be higher than 500&#160;mW with a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.4%.








Abstract
Despite possessing higher tissue transmittance and maximum permissible exposure power density for skin relative to other electromagnetic waves, second near&#8208;infrared light (1000&#8211;1350&#160;nm) is scarcely applicable to subcutaneous photoelectric conversion, owing to the companion photothermal effect. Here, skin thermal management is conceived to utmostly utilize the photothermal effect of a photovoltaic cell, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency but also eliminates skin hyperthermia. In vivo, the output power can be higher than 500&#160;mW with a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.4%. This output power is promising to recharge all the clinically applied implantable devices via wireless power transmission, that is, clinical pacemakers (6&#8211;200&#160;&#181;W), drug pumps (0.5&#8211;2&#160;mW), cochlear (5&#8211;40&#160;mW), and wireless endo&#8208;photo cameras (&#8776;100&#160;mW).

         <title>Exogenous Antigen Upregulation Empowers Antibody Targeted Nanochemotherapy of Leukemia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acute myeloid leukemia remains largely incurable due to the lack of suitable surface antigens and targeted therapeutics. This study presents a facile combination strategy of exogenous antigen upregulation with daratumumab antibody&#8208;directed polymersomal nanotherapeutics (DPV) that allows super&#8208;targeting and high&#8208;efficacy elimination of leukemia cells, leading to striking survival benefits with 20&#8211;40% complete cure.








Abstract
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is afflicted by a high&#8208;mortality rate and few treatment options. The lack of specific surface antigens severely hampers the development of targeted therapeutics and cell therapy. Here, it is shown that exogenous all&#8208;trans retinoic acid (ATRA) mediates selective and transient CD38 upregulation on leukemia cells by up to 20&#8208;fold, which enables high&#8208;efficiency targeted nanochemotherapy of leukemia with daratumumab antibody&#8208;directed polymersomal vincristine sulfate (DPV). Strikingly, treatment of two CD38&#8208;low expressing AML orthotopic models with ATRA and DPV portfolio strategies effectively eliminates circulating leukemia cells and leukemia invasion into bone marrow and organs, leading to exceptional survival benefits with 20&#8211;40% of mice becoming leukemia&#8208;free. The combination of exogenous CD38 upregulation and antibody&#8208;directed nanotherapeutics provides a unique and powerful targeted therapy for leukemia.

         <title>Multifunctional Additive CdAc2 for Efficient Perovskite&#8208;Based Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective method by using the multifunctional additive cadmium acetate (CdAc2) to obtain high&#8208;quality perovskite films for efficient flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs). The resulting FPSCs and TSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.78% and 29.25% (under AM 1.5G illumination), respectively.








Abstract
Polycrystalline perovskite films fabricated on flexible and textured substrates often are highly defective, leading to poor performance of perovskite devices. Finding substrate&#8208;tolerant perovskite fabrication strategies is therefore paramount. Herein, this study shows that adding a small amount of Cadmium Acetate (CdAc2) in the PbI2 precursor solution results in nano&#8208;hole array films and improves the diffusion of organic salts in PbI2 and promotes favorable crystal orientation and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination. Polycrystalline perovskite films on the flexible substrate with ultra&#8208;long carrier lifetimes exceeding 6&#160;&#181;s are achieved. Eventually, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.78% is obtained for single&#8208;junction flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs). Furthermore, it is found that the strategy is also applicable for textured tandem solar cells. A champion PCE of 29.25% (0.5003&#160;cm2) is demonstrated for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs) with CdAc2. Moreover, the un&#8208;encapsulated TSCs maintains 109.78% of its initial efficiency after 300&#160;h operational at 45&#160;&#176;C in a&#160; nitrogen atmosphere. This study provides a facile strategy for achieving high&#8208;efficiency perovskite&#8208;based solar cells.

         <title>Reactive Deposition Versus Strong Electrostatic Adsorption (SEA): A Key to Highly Active Single Atom Co&#8208;Catalysts in Photocatalytic H2 Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive attachment based on hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid is shown to lead directly to single atom configuration with a significantly higher specific H2 evolution activity than achieved with strong electrostatic adsorption &#8211; and this is at a significantly lower Pt loading without any post&#8208;deposition treatment.








Abstract
In recent years, the use of single atoms (SAs) has become of a rapidly increasing significance in photocatalytic H2 generation; here SA&#160;noble metals (mainly Pt SAs) can act as highly effective co&#8208;catalysts. The classic strategy to decorate oxide semiconductor surfaces with maximally dispersed SAs relies on &#8220;strong electrostatic adsorption&#8221; (SEA) of suitable noble metal complexes. In the case of TiO2 &#8211; the classic benchmark photocatalyst &#8211; SEA calls for adsorption of cationic Pt complexes such as [(NH3)4Pt]2+ which then are thermally reacted to surface&#8208;bound SAs. While SEA is widely used in literature, in the present work it is shown by a direct comparison that reactive attachment based on the reductive anchoring of SAs, e.g., from hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid (H2PtCl6)&#160;leads directly to SAs in a configuration with a significantly higher specific activity than SAs deposited with SEA &#8211; and this at a significantly lower Pt loading and without any thermal post&#8208;deposition treatments. Overall, the work demonstrates that the reactive deposition strategy is superior to the classic SEA concept as it provides a direct electronically well&#8208;connected SA&#8208;anchoring and thus leads to highly active single&#8208;atom sites in photocatalysis.

         <title>Toward High&#8208;Performance Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes: Tunable Structures and Electrochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of nanocrystalline MOFs with similar morphology but various topologic structures is synthesized as platform to systematically study the structure&#8211;property relationship of MOF&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes for lithium batteries.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been reported as promising materials for electrochemical applications owing to their tunable porous structures and ion&#8208;sieving capability. However, it remains challenging to rationally design MOF&#8208;based electrolytes for high&#8208;energy lithium batteries. In this work, by combining advanced characterization and modeling tools, a series of nanocrystalline MOFs is designed, and the effects of pore apertures and open metal sites on ion&#8208;transport properties and electrochemical stability of MOF quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes are systematically studied. It isdemonstrated that MOFs with non&#8208;redox&#8208;active metal centers can&#160;lead to a much wider electrochemical stability window than those with redox&#8208;active centers. Furthermore, the pore aperture of MOFs is found to be a dominating factor that determines the uptake of lithium salt and thus ionic conductivity. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that open metal sites of MOFs can facilitate the dissociation of lithium salt and immobilize anions via Lewis acid&#8211;base interaction, leading to good lithium&#8208;ion mobility and high transference number. The MOF quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte demonstrates great battery performance with commercial LiFePO4 and LiCoO2 cathodes at 30&#160;&#176;C. This work provides new insights into structure&#8211;property relationships between tunable structure and electrochemical properties of MOFs that can lead to the development of advanced quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes for high&#8208;energy lithium batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A series of nanocrystalline MOFs with similar morphology but various topologic structures is synthesized as platform to systematically study the structure&#8211;property relationship of MOF-based quasi-solid-state electrolytes for lithium batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been reported as promising materials for electrochemical applications owing to their tunable porous structures and ion-sieving capability. However, it remains challenging to rationally design MOF-based electrolytes for high-energy lithium batteries. In this work, by combining advanced characterization and modeling tools, a series of nanocrystalline MOFs is designed, and the effects of pore apertures and open metal sites on ion-transport properties and electrochemical stability of MOF quasi-solid-state electrolytes are systematically studied. It isdemonstrated that MOFs with non-redox-active metal centers can&#160;lead to a much wider electrochemical stability window than those with redox-active centers. Furthermore, the pore aperture of MOFs is found to be a dominating factor that determines the uptake of lithium salt and thus ionic conductivity. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that open metal sites of MOFs can facilitate the dissociation of lithium salt and immobilize anions via Lewis acid&#8211;base interaction, leading to good lithium-ion mobility and high transference number. The MOF quasi-solid-state electrolyte demonstrates great battery performance with commercial LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes at 30&#160;&#176;C. This work provides new insights into structure&#8211;property relationships between tunable structure and electrochemical properties of MOFs that can lead to the development of advanced quasi-solid-state electrolytes for high-energy lithium batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mimosa&#8208;Inspired Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Curling Bioadhesive Tape Promotes Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Mimosa pudica, a stimulated curling bioadhesive tape (SCT) hydrogel is developed that responds rapidly to curl and transient adhesion on moist tissues, adapts to the curvature of different nerve diameters to achieve conformal contact, and is also biocompatible. SCT hydrogel thus reduces the risk of surgical suturing for nerve injury repair.








Abstract
Trauma often results in peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs). These injuries are particularly challenging therapeutically because of variable nerve diameters, slow axonal regeneration, infection of severed ends, fragility of the nerve tissue, and the intricacy of surgical intervention. Surgical suturing is likely to cause additional damage to peripheral nerves. Therefore, an ideal nerve scaffold should possess good biocompatibility, diameter adaptability, and a stable biological interface for seamless biointegration with tissues. Inspired by the curl of Mimosa pudica, this study aimed to design and develop a diameter&#8208;adaptable, suture&#8208;free, stimulated curling bioadhesive tape (SCT) hydrogel for repairing PNI. The hydrogel is fabricated from chitosan and acrylic acid&#8208;N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide lipid via gradient crosslinking using glutaraldehyde. It closely matches the nerves of different individuals and regions, thereby providing a bionic scaffold for axonal regeneration. In addition, this hydrogel rapidly absorbs tissue fluid from the nerve surface achieving durable wet&#8208;interface adhesion. Furthermore, the chitosan&#8208;based SCT hydrogel loaded with insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;I effectively promotes peripheral nerve regeneration with excellent bioactivity. This procedure for peripheral nerve injury repair using the SCT hydrogel is simple and reduces the difficulty and duration of surgery, thereby advancing adaptive biointerfaces and reliable materials for nerve repair.

         <title>Artificial Spider Silk with Buckled Sheath by Nano&#8208;Pulley Combing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The artificial spider silk with buckled sheath&#8211;core structure is developed by nano&#8208;pulley combing of polyrotaxane through cyclic stretch&#8211;release training. Its breaking strength and toughness reach 1.61&#160;GPa and 466&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, respectively, exceeding those of Caerostris darwini silk. This work provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance and intelligent fiber materials.








Abstract
The axial orientation of molecular chains always results in an increase in fiber strength and a decrease in toughness. Here, taking inspiration from the skin structure, artificial spider silk with a buckled sheath&#8211;core structure is developed, with mechanical strength and toughness reaching 1.61&#160;GPa and 466&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, respectively, exceeding those of Caerostris darwini silk. The buckled structure is achieved by nano&#8208;pulley combing of polyrotaxane hydrogel fibers through cyclic stretch&#8211;release training, which exhibits axial alignment of the polymer chains in the fiber core and buckling in the fiber sheath. The artificial spider silk also exhibits excellent supercontraction behavior, achieving a work capacity of 1.89&#160;kJ&#160;kg&#8722;1, and an actuation stroke of 82%. This work provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance and intelligent fiber materials.

         <title>Controlled Electronic and Magnetic Landscape in Self&#8208;Assembled Complex Oxide Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a new conceptual method for self&#8208;assembly bottom&#8208;up thin film growth evoking a transient growth &#8211; a 2D layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth, followed by a vertically aligned two&#8208;phase nanocomposite oxide growth, based on a miscible LaAlO3:LaBO3 composite, grown on SrTiO3(001). This transition exhbits unique strain orderings, coupled with the the generation of electronic and magnetic properties&#160;at the horizontal and vertical interfaces.








Abstract
Complex oxide heterointerfaces contain a rich playground of novel physical properties and functionalities, which give rise to emerging technologies. Among designing and controlling the functional properties of complex oxide film heterostructures, vertically aligned nanostructure (VAN) films using a self&#8208;assembling bottom&#8208;up deposition method presents great promise in terms of structural flexibility and property tunability. Here, the bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly is extended to a new approach using a mixture containing a 2Dlayer&#8208;by&#8208;layer film growth, followed by a 3D VAN film growth. In this work, the two&#8208;phase nanocomposite thin films are based on LaAlO3:LaBO3, grown on a lattice&#8208;mismatched SrTiO3001 (001) single crystal.&#160;The 2D&#8208;to&#8208;3D transient structural assembly is primarily controlled by the composition ratio, leading to the coexistence of multiple interfacial properties, 2D electron gas, and magnetic anisotropy. This approach provides multidimensional film heterostructures which enrich the emergent phenomena for multifunctional applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Electrical Pulse Synthesis of Highly Active Electrocatalysts for Beyond&#8208;Industrial&#8208;Level Hydrogen Gas Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalysts with low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;activity, such as RuNi/C, are developed by an ultrafast electrical pulse approach for beyond&#8208;industrial&#8208;level Ni&#63743;H2 batteries. The low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety, long&#8208;life, and all&#8208;climate Ni&#63743;H2 batteries provide great opportunities for practical grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications.








Abstract
The high reliability and proven ultra&#8208;longevity make aqueous hydrogen gas (H2) batteries ideal for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the low alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) activities of expensive platinum catalysts severely hamper their widespread applications in H2 batteries. Here, cost&#8208;effective, highly active electrocatalysts, with a model of ruthenium&#8208;nickel alloy nanoparticles in &#8776;3&#160;nm anchored on carbon black (RuNi/C) as an example, are developed by an ultrafast electrical pulse approach for nickel&#8208;hydrogen gas (Ni&#63743;H2) batteries. Having a competitive low cost of about one fifth of Pt/C benckmark, this ultrafine RuNi/C catalyst displays an ultrahigh HOR mass activity of 2.34 A mg&#8722;1 at 50 mV (vs RHE) and an ultralow HER overpotential of 19.5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. As a result, the advanced Ni&#63743;H2 battery can efficiently operate under all&#8208;climate conditions (from &#8722;25 to +50 &#176;C) with excellent durability. Notably, the Ni&#63743;H2 cell stack achieves an energy density up to 183&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and an estimated cost of &#8776;49 $ kWh&#8722;1 under an ultrahigh cathode Ni(OH)2 loading of 280&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and a low anode Ru loading of &#8776;62.5&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2. The advanced beyond&#8208;industrial&#8208;level hydrogen gas batteries provide great opportunities for practical grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

Having a competitive low cost of about one fifth of Pt/C benckmark, this ultrafine RuNi/C catalyst displays an ultrahigh HOR mass activity of 2.34 A mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 50 mV (vs RHE) and an ultralow HER overpotential of 19.5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, the advanced Ni&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery can efficiently operate under all-climate conditions (from &#8722;25 to +50 &#176;C) with excellent durability. Notably, the Ni&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cell stack achieves an energy density up to 183&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an estimated cost of &#8776;49 $ kWh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under an ultrahigh cathode Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loading of 280&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a low anode Ru loading of &#8776;62.5&#160;&#181;g cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The advanced beyond-industrial-level hydrogen gas batteries provide great opportunities for practical grid-scale energy storage applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interlayer&#8208;Confined NiFe Dual Atoms within MoS2 Electrocatalyst for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingenious approach is proposed to assemble Ni and Fe dual atoms into the interlayer of MoS2. Combined with the diatomic species, this interlayer&#8211;confined structure with confinement effect, displays the high catalytic activity towards water splitting and high stablity even in harsh acidic reaction condition. This work provides a new direction for single&#8211;atom catalysts development in the future.








Abstract
Confining dual atoms (DAs) within the van der Waals gap of 2D layered materials is expected to expedite the kinetic and energetic strength in catalytic process, yet is a huge challenge in atomic&#8208;scale precise assembling DAs within two adjacent layers in the 2D limit. Here, an ingenious approach is proposed to assemble DAs of Ni and Fe into the interlayer of MoS2. While inheriting the exceptional merits of diatomic species, this interlayer&#8208;confined structure arms itself with confinement effect, displaying the more favorable adsorption strength on the confined metal active center and higher catalytic activity towards acidic water splitting, as verified by intensive research efforts of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. Moreover, the interlayer&#8208;confined structure also renders metal DAs a protective shelter to survive in harsh acidic environment. The findings embodied the confinement effects at the atom level, and interlayer&#8208;confined assembling of multiple species highlights a general pathway to advance interlayer&#8208;confined DAs catalysts within various 2D materials.

         <title>Strong Tough Thermogalvanic Hydrogel Thermocell With Extraordinarily High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable polyvinyl alcohol thermogalvanic thermocell (SPTC) is prepared by combining stretching&#8208;induced crystallization and thermoelectric effects. The SPTC provides the best comprehensive mechanical and thermoelectric properties among reported quasi&#8208;solid stretchable thermogalvanic hydrogel thermocells. The SPTC&#8208;based systems are demonstrated in energy&#8208;autonomous strain sensors and health monitoring. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device can provide a reference for the design of flexible and robust wearable electronics.








Abstract
Thermocells can continuously convert heat into electricity, and they are widely used to power wearable electronic devices. However, they have a risk of leakage and poor mechanical properties. Although quasi&#8208;solid ionic thermocells can overcome the issue of electrolyte leakage, the trade&#8208;off between their excellent mechanical properties and high thermopower remains a major challenge. In this study, stretching&#8208;induced crystallization and the thermoelectric effect are combined to propose a high&#8208;strength quasi&#8208;solid stretchable polyvinyl alcohol thermogalvanic thermocell (SPTC) with a large tensile strength of 19&#160;MPa and high thermopower of 6.5&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1. The SPTC exhibits a high stretchability of 1300%, ultrahigh toughness of 163.4&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, and high specific output power density of 1969&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2. These comprehensive properties are superior to those of previously reported quasi&#8208;solid stretchable thermogalvanic thermocells. The use of SPTC&#8208;based systems in wearable devices for energy&#8208;autonomous strain sensors and health monitoring is demonstrated. This can facilitate the rapid implementation of sustainable wearable electronics in the Internet of Things era.

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Inspired Sticky Artificial Spider Silk for Signal Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuron&#8208;inspired sticky artificial spider silk is prepared based on proton donor&#8208;acceptor (PrDA) hydrogel fibers, which exhibits excellent mechanical robustness and ionic conductivity. It provides a new design strategy for signal transmission and regulation applications in bioelectrodes and artificial synapse.








Abstract
Neurons exhibit excellent signal transmission capacity, which inspire artificial neuron materials for applications in the field of wearable electronics and soft robotics. In addition, the neuron fibers exhibit good mechanical robustness by sticking to the organs, which currently has rarely been studied. Here, a sticky artificial spider silk is developed by employing a proton donor&#8208;acceptor (PrDA) hydrogel fiber for application as artificial neuron fibers. Tuning the molecular electrostatic interactions by modulating the sequences of proton donors and acceptors, enables combination of excellent mechanical properties, stickiness, and ion conductivity. In addition, the PrDA hydrogel exhibits high spinning capacity for a wide range of donor&#8208;acceptor combinations. The PrDA artificial spider silk would shed light on the design of new generation of artificial neuron materials, bio&#8208;electrodes, and artificial synapses.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Carbons with Highly Curved Surfaces for Hosting Single Metal FeN4 Sites as Outstanding Oxygen Reduction Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability of a single&#8208;atom Fe&#63743;N&#63743;C electrocatalyst&#160;are promoted by engineering FeN4 active sites on hierarchical carbons comprising highly curved surfaces (FeN4&#8208;hcC). The achieved FeN4&#8208;hcC displays&#160;outstanding oxygen reduction reaction performance in acidic media and promising activity in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells.








Abstract
Iron&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Fe&#63743;N&#63743;C) materials have emerged as a promising alternative to platinum&#8208;group metals for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells. However, their low intrinsic activity and stability are major impediments. Herein, an Fe&#63743;N&#8211;C electrocatalyst with dense FeN4 sites on hierarchically porous carbons with highly curved surfaces (denoted as FeN4&#8208;hcC) is reported. The FeN4&#8208;hcC catalyst displays exceptional ORR activity in acidic media, with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4. When integrated into a membrane electrode assembly, the corresponding cathode displays a high maximum peak power density of 0.592&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and demonstrates operating durability over 30&#160;000 cycles under harsh H2/air conditions, outperforming previously reported Fe&#8211;N&#63743;C electrocatalysts. These experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the curved carbon support fine&#8208;tunes the local coordination environment, lowers the energies of the Fe d&#8208;band centers, and inhibits the adsorption of oxygenated species, which can enhance the ORR activity and stability. This work provides new insight into the carbon nanostructure&#8211;activity correlation for ORR catalysis. It also offers a new approach to designing advanced single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts for energy&#8208;conversion applications.

         <title>Multifunctionality through Embedding Patterned Nanostructures in High&#8208;Performance Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable spray coating is introduced for controlled deposition of nanomaterials with tailorable patterns. Guided by the droplet's internal currents, amphiphilicity of the nanomaterials grants control over the specific surface area and bonding energy values. Controlling the ring&#8208;disk pattern transition regulates theinterfaces, crack containment, and electrical&#8208;thermal conductivity, which is lacking in conventional manufacturing with the random inclusion of nanoparticles.








Abstract
Despite being a pillar of high&#8208;performance materials in industry, manufacturing carbon fiber composites with simultaneously enhanced multifunctionality and structural properties has remained elusive due to the lack of practical bottom&#8208;up approaches with control over nanoscale interactions. Guided by the droplet's internal currents and amphiphilicity of&#160;nanomaterials, herein, a programmable spray coating is introduced for the deposition of multiple nanomaterials with tailorable patterns in composite.&#160;&#160;It is shown that such patterns regulate&#160;the formation of interfaces, damage containment, and electrical&#8208;thermal conductivity of the composites, which is absent in conventional manufacturing that primarily rely on incorporating nanomaterials to achieve specific functionalities. Molecular dynamics simulations show that increasing the hydrophilicity of the hybrid nanomaterials, which is synchronous with shifting patterns from disk to ring, improves the interactions between the carbon surfaces and epoxy at the interfaces,manifested in enhanced&#160;interlaminar and flexural performance. Transitioning from ring to disk creates a larger interconnected network &#160;leading to improved thermal and electrical properties without penalty in&#160;mechanical properties. This novel approach introduces a new design , where the mechanical and multifunctional performance is controlled by the shape of the deposited patterns, thus&#160;eliminating the trade&#8208;off between properties that are considered paradoxical in today's manufacturing of hierarchical composites.

         <title>Versatile Mesoporous Microblocks Prepared by Pattern&#8208;Induced Cracking of Colloidal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile mesoporous microblocks are fabricated through the controlling crack template, which is an economic and environmentally friendly process. Various sizes of rectangular microblocks demonstrate anticounterfeit functions by encoding the rotation angles with different colors. In addition, size&#8208;tunable functionalized microblocks selectively separate chemicals and collect or eliminate them for environmental applications.








Abstract
Mesoporous microparticles have the potential to be used in various fields, such as energy generation, sensing, and the environmental field. Recently, the process of making homogeneous microparticles in an economical and environmentally friendly way has gained much attention. Herein, rectangular mesoporous microblocks of various designs are produced by manipulating the fragmentation of colloidal films consisting of micropyramids while controlling the notch angles of pyramidal edges. During calcination of the colloidal films, cracks are generated in the valleys of micropyramids acting as notches, and the angle of notches can be controlled by the prepattern underneath the micropyramids. By changing the location of notches with sharp angles, the shape of microblocks can be controlled with excellent uniformity. After detaching the microblocks from substrates, mesoporous microparticles of various sizes with multiple functions are easily produced. This study demonstrates anti&#8208;counterfeiting functions by encoding the rotation angles of rectangular microblocks of various sizes. In addition, the mesoporous microparticles can be utilized for separating desired chemicals mixed with chemicals of different charges. The method of fabricating size&#8208;tunable functionalized mesoporous microblocks can be a platform technology to prepare special films and catalysts and for environmental applications.

         <title>Circadian Clock Regulation via Biomaterials for Nucleus Pulposus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the regulation of cellular circadian clock on tissue regeneration, circadian clock&#8208;regulating biomaterials that can effectively activate the intrinsic circadian clock of nucleus pulposus and improve disc regeneration are fabricated via air&#8211;microfluidic technique and the chemical cross&#8208;linking between polyvinyl alcohol and modified&#8208;phenylboronic acid.








Abstract
Circadian clock disorder during tissue degeneration has been considered the potential pathogenesis for various chronic diseases, such as intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). In this study, circadian clock&#8208;regulating biomaterials (ClockMPs) that can effectively activate the intrinsic circadian clock of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) in IVDD and improve the physiological function of NPCs for disc regeneration are fabricated via air&#8208;microfluidic technique and the chemical cross&#8208;linking between polyvinyl alcohol and modified&#8208;phenylboronic acid. In vitro experiments verified that ClockMPs can scavenge reactive oxygen species to maintain a stable microenvironment for the circadian clock by promoting the binding of BMAL1 and CLOCK proteins. ClockMPs can regulate the expression of core circadian clock genes by activating the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway in NPCs to remodel the intrinsic circadian clock and promote extracellular matrix synthesis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments of IVDD treated with ClockMPs proved that ClockMPs can promote disc regeneration by regulating the circadian clock of NPCs. In conclusion, ClockMPs provided a novel and promising strategy for circadian clock regulation during tissue regeneration.

         <title>Ultrafast&#8208;Programmable 2D Homojunctions Based on van der Waals Heterostructures on a Silicon Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;floating&#8208;gate&#8208;controlled 2D lateral homojunctions based on InSe (MoS2)/hBN/graphite van der Waals heterostructures with an atomically sharp interface on a Si substrate, can be ultrafast&#8208;programmed in &#8776;20&#160;ns. The high rectification ratio of &#8776;105 and four dynamically switchable non&#8208;volatile memory states make them work as rectifiers, non&#8208;volatile memories, and reconfigurable multi&#8208;valued logic inverters.








Abstract
The development of electrically ultrafast&#8208;programmable semiconductor homojunctions can lead to transformative multifunctional electronic devices. However, silicon&#8208;based homojunctions are not programmable so that alternative materials need to be explored. Here 2D, multi&#8208;functional, lateral homojunctions made of van der Waals heterostructures with a semi&#8208;floating&#8208;gate configuration on a p++ Si substrate feature atomically sharp interfaces and can be electrostatically programmed in nanoseconds, more than seven orders of magnitude faster than other 2D&#8208;based homojunctions. By applying voltage pulses with different polarities, lateral p&#8722;n, n+&#8722;n and other types of homojunctions can be formed, varied, and reversed. The p&#8722;n homojunctions possess a high rectification ratio of up to &#8776;105 and can be dynamically switched between four distinct conduction states with the current spanning over nine orders of magnitude, enabling them to function as logic rectifiers, memories, and multi&#8208;valued logic inverters. Built on a p++ Si substrate, which acts as the control gate, the devices are compatible with Si technology.

         <title>Imitating Architectural Mortise&#8208;Tenon Structure for Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 material with implanted architectural mortise&#8208;tenon (MT) structures is developed. These MT structures not only improve the mechanochemical stability by suppressing the intrinsic anisotropic volume change but also provide an expressway for fast Li&#8208;ion transport. This layered LiNi0.8C0.1Mn0.1O2 exhibits a capacity retention of 82% over 1200 cycles (1C) and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 97.5%.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are the most promising cathodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries, but chemo&#8208;mechanical failures during cycling and large first&#8208;cycle capacity loss hinder their applications in high&#8208;energy batteries. Herein, by introducing spinel&#8208;like mortise&#8208;tenon structures into the layered phase of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811), the adverse volume variations in cathode materials can be significantly suppressed.

&lt;p&gt;A layered LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; material with implanted architectural mortise-tenon (MT) structures is developed. These MT structures not only improve the mechanochemical stability by suppressing the intrinsic anisotropic volume change but also provide an expressway for fast Li-ion transport. This layered LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a capacity retention of 82% over 1200 cycles (1C) and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 97.5%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ni-rich layered oxides are the most promising cathodes for Li-ion batteries, but chemo-mechanical failures during cycling and large first-cycle capacity loss hinder their applications in high-energy batteries. Herein, by introducing spinel-like mortise-tenon structures into the layered phase of LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM811), the adverse volume variations in cathode materials can be significantly suppressed. Meanwhile, these mortise-tenon structures play the role of the expressway for fast lithium-ion transport, which is substantiated by experiments and calculations. Moreover, the particles with mortise-tenon structures usually terminate with the most stable (003) facet. The new cathode exhibits a discharge capacity of 215&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#160;C with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 97.5%, and capacity retention of 82.2% after 1200 cycles at 1&#160;C. This work offers a viable lattice engineering to address the stability and low initial Coulombic efficiency of the Ni-rich layered oxides, and facilitates the implementation of Li-ion batteries with high-energy density and long durability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Mixed Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells via Natural Tin Oxide Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrow&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films doped with SnOx exhibit improved film morphology, crystallization, optical properties, and more interestingly, an upshifted Fermi level. Consequently, SnOx&#8208;doped devices have considerably reduced defects and improved transport of major carriers, resulting in a maximum efficiency of 22.16% for Sn&#8208;Pb single&#8208;junction cells and a remarkable efficiency of 26.01% for two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) mixed tin/lead&#8208;based (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention for use in tandem solar cells. However, they are still plagued by serious carrier recombination due to inferior film properties resulting from the alloying of Sn with Pb elements, which leads to p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping behaviors. This work reports an effective tin oxide (SnOx) doping strategy to produce high&#8208;quality Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films for utilization in efficient single&#8208;junction and tandem PSCs. SnOx can be naturally oxidized from tin diiodide raw powders and successfully incorporated into Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films. Consequently, Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films doped with SnOx exhibit dramatically improved morphology, crystallization, absorption, and more interestingly, upward&#8208;shifted Fermi levels. The resulting narrow&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with natural SnOx doping have considerably reduced carrier recombination, therefore delivering a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16% for single&#8208;junction cells and a remarkable PCE of 26.01% (with a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 25.33%) for two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells. This work introduces a facile doping strategy for the manufacture of efficient single&#8208;junction narrow&#8208;bandgap PSCs and their tandem solar cells.

         <title>Single&#8208;Gate In&#8208;Transistor Readout of Current Superposition and Collapse Utilizing Quantum Tunneling and Ferroelectric Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superposition and collapse of nanostructured in&#8208;transistor current networks are demonstrated to be read and decoded by quantum tunneling and ferroelectric switching in gate&#8208;all&#8208;around polysilicon nanosheet arrays and planar&#8208;gated nanofilms. The drain current output is therefore endowed with polymorphism due to the interplay of the polysilicon and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanostructures.








Abstract
In nanostructure assemblies, the superposition of current paths forms microscopic electric circuits, and different circuit networks produce varying results, particularly when utilized as transistor channels for computing applications. However, the intricate nature of assembly networks and the winding paths of commensurate currents hinder standard circuit modeling. Inspired by the quantum collapse of superposition states for information decoding in quantum circuits, the implementation of analogous current path collapse to facilitate the detection of microscopic circuits by modifying their network topology is explored. Here, the superposition and collapse of current paths in gate&#8208;all&#8208;around polysilicon nanosheet arrays are demonstrated to enrich the computational resources within transistors by engineering the channel length and quantity. Switching the ferroelectric polarization of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 gate dielectric, which drives these transistors out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, decodes the output polymorphism through circuit topological modifications. Furthermore, a protocol for the single&#8208;electron readout of ferroelectric polarization is presented with tailoring the channel coherence. The introduction of lateral path superposition results into intriguing metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transitions due to transient behavior of ferroelectric switching. This ability to adjust the current networks within transistors and their interaction with ferroelectric polarization in polycrystalline nanostructures lays the groundwork for generating diverse current characteristics as potential physical databases for optimization&#8208;based computing.

         <title>Highly Reliable Textile&#8208;Type Memristor by Designing Aligned Nanochannels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly reliable textile&#8208;type memristor is fabricated by designing Pt/CuZnS memristive fiber with aligned nanochannels, showing small set voltage variation (&lt;5.6%) under ultralow set voltage (&#8776;0.089&#160;V). The resultant textile&#8208;type memristor array with high device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity could seamlessly unify with sensing, power&#8208;supplying, and displaying textiles/fibers to form all&#8208;textile integrated electronic systems for new&#8208;generation human&#8211;machine interactions.








Abstract
Information&#8208;processing devices are the core components of modern electronics. Integrating them into textiles is the indispensable demand for electronic textiles to form close&#8208;loop functional systems. Memristors with crossbar configuration are regarded as promising building blocks to design woven information&#8208;processing devices that seamlessly unify with textiles. However, the memristors always suffer from severe temporal and spatial variations due to the random growth of conductive filaments during filamentary switching processes. Here, inspired by the ion nanochannels across synaptic membranes, a highly reliable textile&#8208;type memristor made of Pt/CuZnS memristive fiber with aligned nanochannels, showing small set voltage variation (&lt;5.6%) under ultralow set voltage (&#8776;0.089&#160;V), high on/off ratio (&#8776;106), and low power consumption (0.1&#160;nW), is reported. Experimental evidence indicate that nanochannels with abundant active S defects can anchor silver ions and confine their migrations to form orderly and efficient conductive filaments. Such memristive performances enable the resultant textile&#8208;type memristor array to have high device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity and process complex physiological data like brainwave signals with high recognition accuracy (95%). The textile&#8208;type memristor arrays are mechanically durable to withstand hundreds of bending and sliding deformations, and seamlessly unified with sensing, power&#8208;supplying, and displaying textiles/fibers to form all&#8208;textile integrated electronic systems for new generation human&#8208;machine interactions.

         <title>Large Anomalous Nernst Effects at Room Temperature in Fe3Pt Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the discovery of a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) of Syx &#8776; 2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in ferromagnetic Fe3Pt, which also shows a remarkable coercive field of about 1300&#160;Oe. The results highlight the important roles of both Berry curvature and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in achieving large ANE without an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Heat current in ferromagnets can generate a transverse electric voltage perpendicular to magnetization, known as anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). ANE originates intrinsically from the combination of large Berry curvature and density of states near the Fermi energy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat current in ferromagnets can generate a transverse electric voltage perpendicular to magnetization, known as anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). ANE originates intrinsically from the combination of large Berry curvature and density of states near the Fermi energy. It shows technical advantages over the conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect in converting waste heat to electricity due to its unique transverse geometry. However, materials showing giant ANE remain to be explored. Herein,&#160;&#160;a large ANE thermopower of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;yx&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; &#8776; 2 &#181;V K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature in ferromagnetic Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pt epitaxial films is reported, which also show a giant transverse thermoelectric conductivity of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;sub&gt;yx&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; &#8776; 4 A K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a remarkable coercive field of 1300&#160;Oe. The theoretical analysis reveals that the strong spin-orbit interaction in addition to the hybridization between Pt 5&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; and Fe 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; electrons leads to a series of distinct energy gaps and large Berry curvature in the Brillouin zone, which is the key for the large ANE. These results highlight the important roles of both Berry curvature and spin-orbit coupling in achieving large ANE at zero magnetic field, providing pathways to explore materials with giant transverse thermoelectric effect without an external magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aging Property of Halide Solid Electrolyte at the Cathode Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide solid electrolytes (SEs) are anticipated as high&#8208;voltage cathode compatible SEs with their superior oxidation stability. However, the calendar aging of halide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8208;batteries reveal that halide SEs could be vulnerable to interfacial instability with layered oxide cathodes. This unexpected instability originates from the reduction tendency of metal ions in the SE, where Li3InCl6 with In3+ shows high aging susceptibility.








Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes have recently emerged as a promising option for cathode&#8208;compatible catholytes in solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs), owing to their superior oxidation stability at high voltage and their interfacial stability. However, their day&#8208; to month&#8208;scale aging at the cathode interface has remained unexplored until now, while its elucidation is indispensable for practical deployment. Herein, the stability of halide solid electrolytes (e.g., Li3InCl6) when used with conventional layered oxide cathodes during extended calendar aging is investigated. It is found that, contrary to their well&#8208;known oxidation stability, halide solid electrolytes can be vulnerable to reductive side reactions with oxide cathodes (e.g., LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) in the long term. More importantly, the calendar aging at a low state of charge or as&#8208;fabricated state causes more significant degradation than at a high state of charge, in contrast to typical lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which are more susceptible to high&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;charge calendar aging. This unique characteristic of halide&#8208;based SSBs is related to the reduction propensity of metal ions in halide solid electrolytes and correlated to the formation of an interphase due to the reductive decomposition triggered by the oxide cathode in a lithiated state. This understanding of the long&#8208;term aging properties provides new guidelines for the development of cathode&#8208;compatible halide solid electrolytes.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Molecular Fingerprint Retrieval Using Strongly Detuned Overcoupled Plasmonic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;pixel modulation&#8208;free plasmonic nanoantenna design strategy based on loss engineering is proposed. This strategy allows a single device to enhance and capture the full and complex fingerprint vibrations in the mid&#8208;infrared range. With the aid of machine learning, the absorption fingerprints of various molecules are successfully detected and distinguished.








Abstract
Tailoring light&#8208;matter interactions via plasmonic nanoantennas (PNAs) has emerged as a breakthrough technology for spectroscopic applications. The detuning between molecular vibrations and plasmonic resonances, as a fundamental and inevitable optical phenomenon in light&#8208;matter interactions, reduces the interaction efficiency, resulting in a weak molecule sensing signal at the strong detuning state. Here, it is demonstrated that the low interaction efficiency from detuning can be tackled by overcoupled PNAs (OC&#8208;PNAs) with a high ratio of the radiative to intrinsic loss rates, which can be used for ultrasensitive spectroscopy at strong plasmonic&#8208;molecular detuning. In OC&#8208;PNAs, the ultrasensitive molecule signals are achieved within a wavelength detuning range of 248&#160;cm&#8722;1, which is 173&#160;cm&#8722;1 wider than previous works. Meanwhile, the OC&#8208;PNAs are immune to the distortion of molecular signals and maintain a lineshape consistent with the molecular signature fingerprint. This strategy allows a single device to enhance and capture the full and complex fingerprint vibrations in the mid&#8208;infrared range. In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, 13 kinds of molecules with some vibration fingerprints strongly detuning by the OC&#8208;PNAs are identified with 100% accuracy with the assistance of machine&#8208;learning algorithms. This work gains new insights into detuning&#8208;state nanophotonics for potential applications including spectroscopy and sensors.

Abstract
Severe issues including volume change and dendrite growth on sodium metal anodes hinder the pursuit of applicable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium metal batteries. Herein, an in situ reaction approach is developed that takes metal&#8211;organic frameworks as nano&#8208;reactor and pore&#8208;former to produce a mesoporous host comprised of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon fibers embedded with monodispersed Sn clusters (SnNCNFs). The hybrid host shows outstanding sodiophilicity that enables rapid Na infusion and ultralow Na nucleation overpotential of 2&#160;mV. Its porous structure holds a high Na content and guides uniform Na deposition. Such host provides favorable Na plating/stripping with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.96% over 2000 cycles (at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 3&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2). The Na&#8208;infused SnNCNF anode delivers extreme Na utilization of 86% in symmetric cells (at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 10&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2), outstanding rate capability and cycle life in Na&#8208;SnNCNF||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells (at 1 A g&#8722;1 for over 1000 cycles with capacity retention of 92.1%). Furthermore, high&#8208;energy/power&#8208;density anode&#8208;less and anode&#8208;free Na cells are achieved. This work presents an effective heteroatom&#8208;doping approach for fabricating multifunctional porous carbon materials and developing high&#8208;performance metal batteries.

         <title>Ionic Accumulation as a Diagnostic Tool in Perovskite Solar Cells: Characterizing Band Alignment with Rapid Voltage Pulses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To accelerate the optimisation of perovskite solar cell efficiencies, a pulsed measurement technique that reconstructs the current&#8208;voltage&#160;curve for a range of stabilization biases is developed to probe the band energy alignment of charge extraction layers. Determining the intersection of low and high applied bias behaviour allows the study of complete devices employing a simple source meter.








Abstract
Despite record&#8208;breaking devices, interfaces in perovskite solar cells are still poorly understood, inhibiting further progress. Their mixed ionic&#8208;electronic nature results in compositional variations at the interfaces, depending on the history of externally applied biases.

&lt;p&gt;To accelerate the optimisation of perovskite solar cell efficiencies, a pulsed measurement technique that reconstructs the current-voltage&#160;curve for a range of stabilization biases is developed to probe the band energy alignment of charge extraction layers. Determining the intersection of low and high applied bias behaviour allows the study of complete devices employing a simple source meter.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite record-breaking devices, interfaces in perovskite solar cells are still poorly understood, inhibiting further progress. Their mixed ionic-electronic nature results in compositional variations at the interfaces, depending on the history of externally applied biases. This makes it difficult to measure the band energy alignment of charge extraction layers accurately. As a result, the field often resorts to a trial-and-error process to optimize these interfaces. Current approaches are typically carried out in a vacuum and on incomplete cells, hence values may not reflect those found in working devices. To address this, a pulsed measurement technique characterizing the electrostatic potential energy drop across the perovskite layer in a functioning device is developed. This method reconstructs the current-voltage (JV) curve for a range of stabilization biases, holding the ion distribution &#8220;static&#8221; during subsequent rapid voltage pulses. Two different regimes are observed: at low biases, the reconstructed JV curve is &#8220;s-shaped&#8221;, whereas, at high biases, typical diode-shaped curves are returned. Using drift-diffusion simulations, it is demonstrated that the intersection of the two regimes reflects&#160;the band offsets at the interfaces.

         <title>Metallic Powder Promotes Nitridation Kinetics for Facile Synthesis of (Oxy)Nitride Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metallic (oxy)nitrides can be synthesized with reduced nitridation temperature and a shortened nitridation period due to the enhanced nitridation kinetics, benefiting from the nitridation assistance of metallic powder with low work function.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing semiconductors (including metal nitrides, metal oxynitrides, and nitrogen&#8208;doped metal oxides) have been widely researched for their application in energy conversion and environmental purification because of their unique characteristics; however, their synthesis generally encounters significant challenges owing to sluggish nitridation kinetics. Herein, a metallic&#8208;powder&#8208;assisted nitridation method is developed that effectively promotes the kinetics of nitrogen insertion into oxide precursors and exhibits good generality. By employing metallic powders with low work functions as electronic modulators, a series of oxynitrides (i.e., LnTaON2 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd), Zr2ON2, and LaTiO2N) can be prepared at lower nitridation temperatures and shorter nitridation periods to obtain comparable or even lower defect concentrations compared to those of the conventional thermal nitridation method, leading to superior photocatalytic performance. Moreover, some novel nitrogen&#8208;doped oxides (i.e., SrTiO3&#8722;xNy and Y2Zr2O7&#8722;xNy) with visible&#8208;light responses can be exploited. As revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the nitridation kinetics are enhanced via the effective electron transfer from the metallic powder to the oxide precursors, reducing the activation energy of nitrogen insertion. The modified nitridation route developed in this work&#160;is an alternative method for preparing (oxy)nitride&#8208;based materials for energy/environment&#8208;related heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Precise Strain Tuning Boosts Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely and continuously controlling the surface tensile strain of Pd&#8208;based nanooctahedrons coated with two Ir atomic layers, core/shell nanocrystals with 1.7% tensile strain relative to Ir demonstrate optimized d&#8208;band centers and boosted hydrogen evolution performance.








Abstract
Strain engineering has been utilized as an effective approach to regulate the binding of reaction intermediates and modify catalytic behavior on noble metal nanocatalysts. However, the continuous, precise control of strain for a depiction of strain&#8208;activity correlation remains a challenge. Herein, Pd&#8208;based nanooctahedrons coated with two Ir overlayers are constructed, and subject to different postsynthetic treatments to alter the amount of H intercalated into Pd core for achieving three different surface strains (o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.2%, o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.7%, and o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;2.1% NPs). It is demonstrated that the catalytic performances of o&#8208;Pd/Ir NPs display a volcano&#8208;shaped curve against strains toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.7% NPs exhibit superior catalytic performance with a mass activity of 9.38 A mgIr&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.02&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, 10.8&#8208; and 18.8&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Ir/C, respectively, making it one of the most active HER electrocatalysts reported to date. Density function theory calculations verify that the moderate tensile strain on Ir(111) surfaces plays a pivotal role in optimizing the H binding energy. This work highlights a new strategy for precise control over the surface strain of nanocrystals for more efficient electrocatalysis.

A multi&#8208;time programmable non&#8208;volatile memory is realized by utilizing light programming on a ReS2 device. The device exhibits more than 128 extremely stable states with linearly increasing conductance and shows superior wavelength discrimination capability. This device represents a significant contribution to memory technology by offering the ability to store information in multistate memory and enabling filter&#8208;free color image recorder applications.








Abstract
Mainstream non&#8208;volatile memory (NVM) devices based on floating gate structures or phase&#8208;change/ferroelectric materials face inherent limitations that compromise their suitability for long&#8208;term data storage. To address this challenge, a novel memory device based on light&#8208;programmed lattice engineering of thin rhenium disulfide&#160;(ReS2 ) flakes is proposed. By inducing sulfur vacancies in the ReS2 channel through light illumination, the device's electrical conductivity is modified accordingly and multiple conductance states for data storage therefore are generated. The device exhibits more than 128 distinct states with linearly increasing conductance, corresponding to a sevenfold increase in storage density. Through further optimization to achieve atomic&#8208;level precision in defect creation, it is possible to achieve even higher storage densities. These states are extremely stable in vacuum or inert ambient showing long retention of &gt;10 years, while they can be erased upon exposure to the air. The ReS2 memory device can maintain its stability over multiple program&#8208;erase operation cycles and shows superior wavelength discrimination capability for incident light in the range of 405&#8211;785&#160;nm. This device represents a significant contribution to NVM technology by offering the ability to store information in multistate memory and enabling filter&#8208;free color image recorder applications.

         <title>As&#8208;Grown Miniaturized True Zero&#8208;Order Waveplates Based on Low&#8208;Dimensional Ferrocene Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrocene crystals are grown using a bottom&#8208;up method and self&#8208;assembled at liquid&#8211;liquid capillary interfaces. Their unique molecular arrangement results in high birefringence, low dichroism, and low loss over a broad range (&#8776;550&#160;nm &#8211; 20&#160;&#181;m). Facet orientations along the b&#8208;axis are synthesized at the acetone&#8211;water interface, and the naturally grown a&#8211;c planes, exhibiting the highest birefringence and suit for on&#8208;chip applications.








Abstract
As basic optical elements, waveplates with anisotropic electromagnetic responses are imperative for manipulating light polarization. Conventional waveplates are manufactured from bulk crystals (e.g., quartz and calcite) through a series of precision cutting and grinding steps, which typically result in large size, low yield, and high cost. In this study, a bottom&#8208;up method is used to grow ferrocene crystals with large anisotropy to demonstrate self&#8208;assembled ultrathin true zero&#8208;order waveplates without additional machining processing, which is particularly suited for nanophotonic integration. The van der Waals ferrocene crystals exhibit high birefringence (&#916;n (experiment) = 0.149&#8197; &#177; &#8197;0.002 at 636&#160;nm), low dichroism &#916;&#954; (experiment) = &#8722;0.0007 at 636&#160;nm), and a potentially broad operating range (550&#160;nm to 20&#160;&#181;m) as suggested by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. In addition, the grown waveplate's highest and the lowest principal axes (n1 and n3, respectively) are in the a&#8211;c plane, where the fast axis is along one natural edge of the ferrocene crystal, rendering them readily usable. The as&#8208;grown, wavelength&#8208;scale&#8208;thick waveplate allows the development of further miniaturized systems via tandem integration.

Their unique molecular arrangement results in high birefringence, low dichroism, and low loss over a broad range (&#8776;550&#160;nm &#8211; 20&#160;&#181;m). Facet orientations along the b-axis are synthesized at the acetone&#8211;water interface, and the naturally grown a&#8211;c planes, exhibiting the highest birefringence and suit for on-chip applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As basic optical elements, waveplates with anisotropic electromagnetic responses are imperative for manipulating light polarization. Conventional waveplates are manufactured from bulk crystals (e.g., quartz and calcite) through a series of precision cutting and grinding steps, which typically result in large size, low yield, and high cost. In this study, a bottom-up method is used to grow ferrocene crystals with large anisotropy to demonstrate self-assembled ultrathin true zero-order waveplates without additional machining processing, which is particularly suited for nanophotonic integration. The van der Waals ferrocene crystals exhibit high birefringence (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; (experiment) = 0.149&#8197; &#177; &#8197;0.002 at 636&#160;nm), low dichroism &#916;&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt; (experiment) = &#8722;0.0007 at 636&#160;nm), and a potentially broad operating range (550&#160;nm to 20&#160;&#181;m) as suggested by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. In addition, the grown waveplate's highest and the lowest principal axes (n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively) are in the a&#8211;c plane, where the fast axis is along one natural edge of the ferrocene crystal, rendering them readily usable. The as-grown, wavelength-scale-thick waveplate allows the development of further miniaturized systems via tandem integration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highest&#8208;Efficiency Flexible Perovskite Solar Module by Interface Engineering for Efficient Charge&#8208;Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A record efficiency of 18.71% for flexible perovskite solar modules is achieved, with negligible hysteresis and excellent mechanical stability, by employing interface engineering. The good performance is due to the reduced defect density, better energy band alignment, good wettable surface, and the provided&#160;charge&#8208;transfer channel between the perovskite and the interface.








Abstract
The electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) plays an important role in improving the performance of flexible perovskite solar cells (F&#8208;PSCs). Herein, a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed SnO2:OH ETL is demonstrated, that exhibits reduced defect density, in particular lower oxygen vacancy concentration, with better energy band alignment and more wettable surface for quality perovskite deposition. More importantly, an efficient electron&#8208;transfer channel is produced between the ETL and the perovskite layer due to the formation of hydrogen bonds at the interface, resulting in enhanced electron extraction from the perovskite. As a result, the efficiency of a large&#8208;area (36.50 cm2) flexible perovskite solar module based on MAPbI3 is increased to as high as 18.71%; this is thought to be the highest reported PCE value for flexible perovskite solar modules to date. In addition, it exhibits high durability while maintaining over 83% of its initial PCE after flexing test cycles. Further, F&#8208;PSCs with SnO2:OH show remarkably long&#8208;term stability, owing to a high quality of the perovskite film and a strong coupling between the SnO2:OH and perovskite layer caused by hydrogen bonds, which successfully inhibits moisture permeation.

         <title>Revolutionizing Porous Liquids: Stabilization and Structural Engineering Achieved by a Surface Deposition Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface deposition approach is demonstrated to afford type III porous liquids (PLs) with ultra&#8208;high stability and surface structure modification by leveraging the expeditious and homogeneous precipitation of selected metal salts (e.g., AgBr and BaSO4). Ag(I)&#8208; or Ba(II)&#8208;functionalized zeolite nanosheets and ionic liquids with Br&#8722; or SO42&#8722; anion are deployed to produce PLs with enhanced gas storage and conversion.








Abstract
Facile approaches capable of constructing stable and structurally diverse porous liquids (PLs) that can deliver high&#8208;performance applications are a long&#8208;standing, captivating, and challenging research area that requires significant attention. Herein, a facile surface deposition strategy is demonstrated to afford diverse type III&#8208;PLs possessing ultra&#8208;stable dispersion, external structure modification, and enhanced performance in gas storage and transformation by leveraging the expeditious and uniform precipitation of selected metal salts. The Ag(I) species&#8208;modified zeolite nanosheets are deployed as the porous host to construct type III&#8208;PLs with ionic liquids (ILs) containing bromide anion , leading to stable dispersion driven by the formation of AgBr nanoparticles. The as&#8208;afforded type&#8208;III PLs display promising performance in CO2 capture/conversion and ethylene/ethane separation. Property and performance of the as&#8208;produced PLs can be tuned by the cation structure of the ILs, which can be harnessed to achieve polarity reversal of the porous host via ionic exchange. The surface deposition procedure can be further extended to produce PLs from Ba(II)&#8208;functionalized zeolite and ILs containing [SO4]2&#8722; anion driven by the formation of BaSO4 salts. The as&#8208;produced PLs are featured by well&#8208;maintained crystallinity of the porous host, good fluidity and stability, enhanced gas uptake capacity, and attractive performance in small gas molecule utilization.

         <title>Sequential&#8208;Stimuli Induced Stepwise&#8208;Response of Pyridylpyrenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique phenomenon of sequential&#8208;stimuli induced stepwise&#8208;response generated from a single&#8208;component organic material is reported. In contrast to multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, the response of these materials strictly relies on the sequence of stimuli, allowing logicality, rigidity, and accuracy integrated into one single&#8208;component material. This work provides a fundamental design strategy for new generation of high&#8208;performance stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, especially multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, can sense external stimuli such as light, heat, and force, have shown great potential in drug delivery, data storage, encryption, energy&#8208;harvesting, and artificial intelligence. Conventional multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive materials are sensitive to each independent stimulus, causing losses in the diversity and accuracy of the identification for practical application. Herein, a unique phenomenon of sequential&#8208;stimuli induced stepwise&#8208;response generated from elaborately designed single&#8208;component organic materials is reported, which shows large bathochromic shifts up to 5800&#160;cm&#8722;1 under sequential stimuli of force and light. In contrast to multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, the response of these materials strictly relies on the sequence of stimuli, allowing logicality, rigidity, and accuracy to be integrated into one single&#8208;component material. The molecular keypad lock is built based on these materials, pointing promising to a future for this logical response in significant practical applications. This breakthrough gives a new drive to classical stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and provides a fundamental design strategy for new generations of high&#8208;performance stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Longitudinal Through&#8208;Hole Architecture for Efficient and Thickness&#8208;Insensitive Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel semitransparent organic solar cell constructed by longitudinal through&#8208;hole strategy is proposed to eliminate the dependence of transparent devices on ultrathin active layer and electrode and applied into thick&#8208;film devices with record&#8208;breaking light utilization efficiency, which greatly expands the printing process window. Additionally, through&#8208;hole allows the organic materials to deform slightly and disperse extrusion stresses, thus exhibiting excellent flexural endurance.








Abstract
Semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) have great potential for application in vehicle&#8208; or building&#8208;integrated solar energy harvesting. Ultrathin active layers and electrodes are typically utilized to guarantee high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and high average visible transmittance (AVT)&#160;simultaneously; however, such ultrathin parts are unsuitable for industrial high&#8208;throughput manufacturing. In this study, ST&#8208;OSCs are fabricated using a longitudinal through&#8208;hole architecture to achieve functional region division and to eliminate the dependence on ultrathin films. A complete circuit that vertically corresponds to the silver grid is responsible for obtaining high PCE, and the longitudinal through&#8208;holes embedded in it allow most of the light to pass through,where the overall transparency is associated with the through&#8208;hole specification rather than the thicknesses of active layer and electrode. Excellent photovoltaic performance over a wide range of transparency (9.80&#8211;60.03%), with PCEs ranging from 6.04% to 15.34% is achieved. More critically, this architecture allows printable 300&#8208;nm&#8208;thick devices to achieve a record&#8208;breaking light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 3.25%, and enables flexible ST&#8208;OSCs to exhibit better flexural endurance by dispersing the extrusion stress into the through&#8208;holes. This study paves the way for fabricating high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OSCs and shows great promise for the commercialization of organic photovoltaics.

More critically, this architecture allows printable 300-nm-thick devices to achieve a record-breaking light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 3.25%, and enables flexible ST-OSCs to exhibit better flexural endurance by dispersing the extrusion stress into the through-holes. This study paves the way for fabricating high-performance ST-OSCs and shows great promise for the commercialization of organic photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phonon Polaritonics in Broad Terahertz Frequency Range with Quantum Paraelectric SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quantum paraelectric SrTiO3 offers low&#8208;loss, ultra&#8208;broadband, and temperature insensitive phonon&#8211;polaritons in the frequency range of 7&#8211;13&#160;THz within the &#8220;new terahertz gap&#8221;. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept phonon&#8211;polaritonic concentrators are experimentally realized to enhance electric field to the order of GV m&#8208;1 over a large volume resolvable by far&#8208;field optics for potential applications in non&#8208;equilibrium quantum materials and infrared molecular spectroscopy.








Abstract
Photonics in the frequency range of 5&#8211;15&#160;terahertz (THz) potentially open a new realm of quantum materials manipulation and biosensing. This range, sometimes called &#8220;the new terahertz gap&#8221;, is traditionally difficult to access due to prevalent phonon absorption bands in solids. Low&#8208;loss phonon&#8211;polariton materials may realize sub&#8208;wavelength, on&#8208;chip photonic devices, but typically operate in mid&#8208;infrared frequencies with narrow bandwidths and are difficult to manufacture on a large scale. Here, for the first time, quantum paraelectric SrTiO3 enables broadband surface phonon&#8211;polaritonic devices in 7&#8211;13&#160;THz. As a proof of concept, polarization&#8208;independent field concentrators are designed and fabricated to locally enhance intense, multicycle THz pulses by a factor of 6 and increase the spectral intensity by over 90 times. The time&#8208;resolved electric field inside the concentrators is experimentally measured by THz&#8208;field&#8208;induced second harmonic generation. Illuminated by a table&#8208;top light source, the average field reaches 0.5&#160;GV&#160;m&#8722;1 over a large volume resolvable by far&#8208;field optics. These&#160;results potentially enable scalable THz photonics with high breakdown fields made of various commercially available phonon&#8211;polariton crystals for studying driven phases in quantum materials and nonlinear molecular spectroscopy.

         <title>Implantable Zinc&#8211;Oxygen Battery for In Situ Electrical Stimulation&#8208;Promoted Neural Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tubular implantable zinc&#8211;oxygen battery is designed to work as a power source in vivo. It exhibits a high volumetric energy density of 231.4&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;3 in vivo and can be wrapped around a nerve to provide electrical stimulation with a minimal size of 0.86&#160;mm3. Animal experiments demonstrate the battery&#8208;based nerve conduit promotes the regeneration of injured sciatic nerve.








Abstract
Electrical stimulation is a promising strategy for treating neural diseases. However, current energy suppliers cannot provide effective power for in situ electrical stimulation. Here, an implantable tubular zinc&#8211;oxygen battery is reported as the power source for in situ electrical stimulation during the neural repair. The battery exhibited a high volumetric energy density of 231.4&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;3 based on the entire anode and cathode in vivo. Due to its superior electrochemical properties and biosafety, the battery can be directly wrapped around the nerve to provide in situ electrical stimulation with a minimal size of 0.86&#160;mm3. The cell and animal experiments demonstrated that the zinc&#8211;oxygen battery&#8208;based nerve tissue engineering conduit effectively promoted regeneration of the injured long&#8208;segment sciatic nerve, proving its promising applications for powering implantable neural electronics in the future.

         <title>Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Efficiency over Linear Assemblies of Copper&#8208;Cobalt Nanophases Stabilized by Redox Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical redox&#8208;driven linear assembly of sub&#8208;5&#160;nm CuCo nanocrystals, coupled with a specifically designed protective redox polymer, is first reported for designing an inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid catalyst with enzyme&#8208;like properties, which enables enhanced nitrate (NO3&#8722;) adsorption and tandem catalysis of NO3&#8722; to ammonia (NH3) with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;97% at low overpotentials, leading to a record&#8208;high half&#8208;cell energy efficiency of &#8776;42.0%.








Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;powered nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a net&#8208;zero carbon route to the realization of high ammonia (NH3) productivity. However, this route suffers from low energy efficiency (EE, with a half&#8208;cell EE commonly &lt;36%), since high overpotentials are required to overcome the weak NO3&#8722; binding affinity and sluggish NO3RR kinetics. To alleviate this, a rational catalyst design strategy that involves the linear assembly of sub&#8208;5&#160;nm Cu/Co nanophases into sub&#8208;20&#160;nm thick nanoribbons is suggested. The theoretical and experimental studies show that the Cu&#8208;Co nanoribbons, similar to enzymes, enable strong NO3&#8722; adsorption and rapid tandem catalysis of NO3&#8722; to NH3, owing to their richly exposed binary phase boundaries and adjacent Cu&#8208;Co sites at sub&#8208;5&#160;nm distance. In situ Raman spectroscopy further reveals that at low applied overpotentials, the Cu/Co nanophases are rapidly activated and subsequently stabilized by a specifically designed redox polymer that in situ scavenges intermediately formed highly oxidative nitrogen dioxide (NO2). As a result, a stable NO3RR with a current density of &#8776;450&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved, a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;97% for the formation of NH3, and an unprecedented half&#8208;cell EE of &#8776;42%.

         <title>Discrete Mononuclear Platinum(II) Complexes Realize High&#8208;Performance Red Phosphorescent OLEDs with EQEs of up to 31.8% and Superb Device Stability</title>

Robust red emission phosphor Pt(II) complexes with rigid molecular configuration, short&#8208;excited lifetimes and high PLQYs enable high&#8208;performance red OLEDs with EQEmax over 30% and T90@1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8208;2 over 14000&#160;h.









Abstract
Designing mononuclear platinum(II) complexes that do not rely on intermolecular aggregation for high&#8208;performance red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes remains a formidable challenge. In this work, three robust red&#8208;emitting Pt(II) complexes are&#160;created by utilizing a rigid 4&#8208;coordination configuration, where the ligands are&#160;formed by linking electron&#8208;donor of triphenylamine (TPA) moieties with electron&#8208;acceptor of pyridine, isoquinoline, and/or &#948;&#8208;carboline units. The thermal stability, electrochemical, and photophysical properties of the complexes are&#160;thoroughly examined. The complexes display efficient red phosphorescence, with high photoluminescence quantum yields and short excited lifetimes. The OLEDs dope with these complexes exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 31.8% with minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off even at high brightness. Significantly, the devices demonstrate exceptional long operational lifetime, with a T90 lifetime of over 14000&#160;h at initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, indicating the potential for these complexes to be practically utilizes.

Significantly, the devices demonstrate exceptional long operational lifetime, with a T&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; lifetime of over 14000&#160;h at initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating the potential for these complexes to be practically utilizes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evidence for Anisotropic Superconductivity Beyond Pauli Limit in Infinite&#8208;Layer Lanthanum Nickelates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that the superconductivity is intrinsically anisotropic in lanthanum nickelates with enhanced crystalline quality and superconductivity by systematic magnetotransport measurements. Therefore, the quasi&#8208;2D hole bands from Ni may be dominant in formation of Cooper pairs and a cuprate&#8208;like picture may be still valid in describing the superconductivity in infinite&#8208;layer nickelates.








Abstract
After being expected to be a promising analog to cuprates for decades, superconductivity has recently been discovered in infinite&#8208;layer nickelates, providing new opportunities to explore mechanisms of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity. However, in sharp contrast to the single&#8208;band and anisotropic superconductivity in cuprates, nickelates exhibit a multi&#8208;band electronic structure and an unexpected isotropic superconductivity as reported recently, which challenges the cuprate&#8208;like picture in nickelates. Here, it is shown that strong anisotropic magnetotransport behaviors exist in La&#8208;based nickelate films with enhanced crystallinity and superconductivity (Tconset$T_{\rm{c}}^{{\rm{onset}}}$ = 18.8 K, Tczero$T_{\rm{c}}^{{\rm{zero}}}$ = 16.5 K). The upper critical fields are anisotropic and violate the estimated Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer (BCS) Pauli limit (HPauli,&#956;=1&#956;B=1.86&#215;Tc,H=0${H}_{\mathrm{Pauli},\mu =1{\mu}_{B}}=1.86\ensuremath{\times{}}{T}_{\mathrm{c},H=0}$) for in&#8208;plane magnetic fields. Moreover, the anisotropic superconductivity is further manifested by the cusp&#8208;like peak of the angle&#8208;dependent Tc and the vortex motion anisotropy under external magnetic fields.

         <title>Intense Pulsed Light Thermal Treatment of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3/Metglas Heterostructured Films Resulting in Extreme Magnetoelectric Coupling of over 20&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;Oe&#8722;1</title>

The fabrication of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3/Metglas magnetoelectric (ME) film heterostructures with an ultrahigh ME coupling by employing the synergetic approach of combining aerosol deposition and instantaneous thermal treatment based on intense pulsed light radiation, is reported.








Abstract
Magnetoelectric (ME) film composites consisting of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials are promising candidates for application in magnetic field sensors, energy harvesters, and ME antennas. Conventionally, high&#8208;temperature annealing is required to crystallize piezoelectric films, restricting the use of heat&#8208;sensitive magnetostrictive substrates that enhance ME coupling. Herein, a synergetic approach is demonstrated for fabricating ME film composites that combines aerosol deposition and instantaneous thermal treatment based on intense pulsed light (IPL) radiation to form piezoelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) thick films on an amorphous Metglas substrate. IPL rapidly anneals PZT films within a few milliseconds without damaging the underlying Metglas. To optimize the IPL irradiation conditions, the temperature distribution inside the PZT/Metglas film is determined using transient photothermal computational simulation. The PZT/Metglas films are annealed using different IPL pulse durations to determine the structure&#8211;property relationship. IPL treatment results in an enhanced crystallinity of the PZT, thus improving the dielectric, piezoelectric, and ME properties of the composite films. An ultrahigh off&#8208;resonance ME coupling (&#8776;20&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;Oe&#8722;1) is obtained for the PZT/Metglas film that is IPL annealed at a pulse width of 0.75&#160;ms (an order of magnitude higher than that reported for other ME films), confirming the potential for next&#8208;generation, miniaturized, and high&#8208;performance ME devices.

         <title>High Toughness Combined with High Strength in Oxide Ceramic Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;templated electrospinning strategy is proposed for the formation of oxide ceramic nanofibers, which exhibit high strength and high toughness simultaneously owing to their ideally homogeneous, dense, and defect&#8208;free structure.








Abstract
Traditional oxide ceramics are inherently brittle and highly sensitive to defects, making them vulnerable to failure under external stress. As such, endowing these materials with high strength and high toughness simultaneously is crucial to improve their performance in most safety&#8208;critical applications. Fibrillation of the ceramic materials and further refinement of the fiber diameter, as realized by electrospinning, are expected to achieve the transformation from brittleness to flexibility owing to the structural uniqueness. Currently, the synthesis of electrospun oxide ceramic nanofibers must rely on an organic polymer template to regulate the spinnability of the inorganic sol, whose thermal decomposition during ceramization will inevitably lead to pore defects, and seriously weaken the mechanical properties of the final nanofibers. Here, a self&#8208;templated electrospinning strategy is proposed for the formation of oxide ceramic nanofibers without adding any organic polymer template. An example is given to show that individual silica nanofibers have an ideally homogeneous, dense, and defect&#8208;free structure, with tensile strength as high as 1.41&#160;GPa and toughness up to 34.29&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, both of which are far superior to the counterparts prepared by polymer&#8208;templated electrospinning. This work provides a new strategy to develop oxide ceramic materials that are strong and tough.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site W&#8208;O&#8208;CoP Catalysts for Active and Selective Nitrate Conversion to Ammonia in a Broad Concentration Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade catalyst of [W&#8208;O]&#8208;doped CoP nanosheets (0.6W&#8208;O&#8208;CoP@NF) is designed to effectively separate the active sites of nitrate reduction and hydrolysis by dual sites of Co and [W&#8208;O] as well as optimize proton supply for nitrate reduction, resulting in high ammonia (NH3) yield and selectivity for nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8211;RR) in a wide NO3&#8211; concentration window.








Abstract
Environmentally friendly electrochemical reduction of contaminated nitrate to ammonia (NO3&#8722;RR) is a promising solution for large quantity ammonia (NH3) production, which, however, is a complex multi&#8208;reaction process involving coordination between different reaction intermediates of nitrate reduction and water decomposition&#8208;provided active hydrogen (Hads) species. Here, a dual&#8208;site catalyst of [W&#8208;O] group&#8208;doped CoP nanosheets (0.6W&#8208;O&#8208;CoP@NF) has been designed to synergistically catalyze the NO3&#8722;RR and water decomposition, especially the reactions between the intermediates of NO3&#8722;RR and water decomposition&#8208;provided Hads species. This catalytic NO3&#8722;RR exhibits an extremely high NH3 yield of 80.92&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.2% in 1&#160;m KOH containing 0.1&#160;m NO3&#8722;. Significantly, 0.6W&#8208;O&#8208;CoP@NF presents greatly enhanced NH3 yield and FE in a wide NO3&#8722; concentration ranges of 0.001&#8211;0.1&#160;m compared to the reported. The excellent NO3&#8722;RR performance is attributed to a synergistic catalytic effect between [W&#8208;O] and CoP active sites, in which the doped [W&#8208;O] group promotes the water decomposition to supply abundant Hads, and meanwhile modulates the electronic structure of Co for strengthened adsorption of Hads and the hydrogen (H2) release prevention, resultantly facilitating the NO3&#8722;RR. Finally, a Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery has been assembled to simultaneously achieve three functions: electricity output, ammonia production, and nitrate treatment in wastewater.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ranges of 0.001&#8211;0.1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; compared to the reported. The excellent NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR performance is attributed to a synergistic catalytic effect between [W-O] and CoP active sites, in which the doped [W-O] group promotes the water decomposition to supply abundant H&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;, and meanwhile modulates the electronic structure of Co for strengthened adsorption of H&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt; and the hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) release prevention, resultantly facilitating the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR. Finally, a Zn-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; battery has been assembled to simultaneously achieve three functions: electricity output, ammonia production, and nitrate treatment in wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design and Acoustic Assembly of Human Cerebral Cortex&#8208;Like Microtissues from hiPSC&#8208;Derived Neural Progenitors and Neurons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustic assembly technique is employed to generate human&#8211;sourced brain&#8208;like cortical tissue models by reverse engineering and bionic design, including the six&#8208;layered neuronal architecture, 400&#8208;&#181;m interlayer distance, synaptic connections between interlayers, and neuroelectrophysiological transmission. Furthermore, these microtissues with herpes simplex virus type I&#160;infection show pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease, including the expression of A&#946;, neuronal loss, and dysfunctional synaptic connections.









Abstract
Development of biologically relevant and clinically relevant human cerebral cortex models is demanded by mechanistic studies of human cerebral cortex&#8208;associated neurological diseases and discovery of preclinical neurological drug candidates. Here, rational design of human&#8211;sourced brain&#8208;like cortical tissue models is demonstrated by reverse engineering and bionic design. To implement this design, the acoustic assembly technique is employed to assemble hiPSC&#8208;derived neural progenitors and neurons separately in a label&#8208;free and contact&#8208;free manner followed by subsequent neural differentiation and culture. The generated microtissues encapsulate the neuronal microanatomy of human cerebral&#8208;cortex tissue that contains six&#8208;layered neuronal architecture, a 400&#8208;&#181;m interlayer distance, synaptic connections between interlayers, and neuroelectrophysiological transmission. Furthermore, these microtissues are infected with herpes simplex virus type I (HSV&#8208;1)&#160;virus, and the HSV&#8208;induced pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease is determined, including neuron loss and the expression of A&#946;. Overall, a high&#8208;fidelity human&#8208;relevant in vitro histotypic model is provided for the&#160;cerebral cortex, which will facilitate wide applications in probing the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and screening the candidates for neuroprotective agents.

         <title>Metasurfaces&#8208;Driven Hyperspectral Imaging via Multiplexed Plasmonic Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexed metasurface&#8211;driven plasmonic resonance energy transfer (PRET) hyperspectral imaging is created to probe biological light&#8211;matter interactions. Pixelated metasurfaces with engineered scattering spectra over the entire visible range, by the precision nanoengineering of gap plasmon and optical effects of metasurface clusters, are designed, fabricated, characterized by their full dark&#8208;field coloration, and are demonstrated for multiplexed real&#8208;time molecular sensing and imaging methods.








Abstract
Obtaining single&#8211;molecular&#8211;level fingerprints of biomolecules and electron&#8211;transfer dynamic imaging in living cells are critically demanded in postgenomic life sciences and medicine. However, the possible solution called plasmonic resonance energy transfer (PRET) spectroscopy remains challenging due to the fixed scattering spectrum of a plasmonic nanoparticle and limited multiplexing. Here, multiplexed metasurfaces&#8208;driven PRET hyperspectral imaging, to probe biological light&#8211;matter interactions, is reported. Pixelated metasurfaces with engineered scattering spectra are first designed over the entire visible range by the precision nanoengineering of gap plasmon and grating effects of metasurface clusters. Pixelated metasurfaces are created and their full dark&#8208;field coloration is optically characterized with visible color palettes and high&#8208;resolution color printings of the art pieces. Furthermore, three different biomolecules (i.e., chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and cytochrome c) are applied on metasurfaces for color palettes to obtain selective molecular fingerprint imaging due to the unique biological light&#8211;matter interactions with application&#8208;specific biomedical metasurfaces. This metasurface&#8208;driven PRET hyperspectral imaging will open up a new path for multiplexed real&#8208;time molecular sensing and imaging methods.

         <title>Organic Solar Cells with Over 19% Efficiency Enabled by a 2D&#8208;Conjugated Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor Featuring Favorable Electronic and Aggregation Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#960;&#8208;expansion of phenazine&#8208;fused core on AQx&#8208;18 affords a 2D&#8208;congjugated non&#8208;fullerene acceptor with favorable electronic and aggregation structures. AQx&#8208;18&#8208;based devices exhibit a PCE of 19.1%, which is among the highest value ever reported for organic solar cells (OSCs) with a high Voc of 0.928&#160;V. Such a 2D &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy is promising for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance OSCs.








Abstract
The &#960;&#8208;expansion of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors is a promising method for boosting the organic photovoltaic performance by allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and molecular packing. In this work, highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) are fabricated using a 2D &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy to design new non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. Compared with the quinoxaline&#8208;fused cores of AQx&#8208;16, the &#960;&#8208;expanded phenazine&#8208;fused cores of AQx&#8208;18 induce more ordered and compact packing between adjacent molecules, affording an optimized morphology with rational phase separation in the blend film. This facilitates efficient exciton dissociation and inhibited charge recombination. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with simultaneously increasing Voc, Jsc, and fill factor is achieved in the AQx&#8208;18&#8208;based binary OSCs. Significantly, AQx&#8208;18&#8208;based ternary devices fabricated via a two&#8208;in&#8208;one alloy acceptor strategy exhibit a superior PCE of 19.1%, one of the highest values ever reported for OSCs, along with a high Voc of 0.928&#160;V. These results indicate the importance of the 2D &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy for the delicate regulation of the electronic structures and crystalline behaviors of the non&#8208;fullerene acceptors to achieve superior photovoltaic performance, aimed at significantly promoting further development of OSCs.

         <title>Volumetric Printing Across Melt Electrowritten Scaffolds Fabricates Multi&#8208;Material Living Constructs with Tunable Architecture and Mechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of melt electrowriting and volumetric bioprinting (VolMEW) improves the mechanical performance of the structures while maintaining high printing resolution, design freedom, and choice of material. VolMEW enables the fabrication of multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cell, functional scaffolds with physiological relevance in seconds.








Abstract
Major challenges in biofabrication revolve around capturing the complex, hierarchical composition of native tissues. However, individual 3D printing techniques have limited capacity to produce composite biomaterials with multi&#8208;scale resolution. Volumetric bioprinting recently emerged as a paradigm&#8208;shift in biofabrication. This ultrafast, light&#8208;based technique sculpts cell&#8208;laden hydrogel bioresins into 3D structures in a layerless fashion, providing enhanced design freedom over conventional bioprinting. However, it yields prints with low mechanical stability, since soft, cell&#8208;friendly hydrogels are used. Herein, the possibility to converge volumetric bioprinting with melt electrowriting, which excels at patterning microfibers, is shown for the fabrication of tubular hydrogel&#8208;based composites with enhanced mechanical behavior. Despite including non&#8208;transparent melt electrowritten scaffolds in the volumetric printing process, high&#8208;resolution bioprinted structures are successfully achieved. Tensile, burst, and bending mechanical properties of printed tubes are tuned altering the electrowritten mesh design, resulting in complex, multi&#8208;material tubular constructs with customizable, anisotropic geometries that better mimic intricate biological tubular structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, engineered tubular structures are obtained by building trilayered cell&#8208;laden vessels, and features (valves, branches, fenestrations) that can be rapidly printed using this hybrid approach. This multi&#8208;technology convergence offers a new toolbox for manufacturing hierarchical and mechanically tunable multi&#8208;material living structures.

However, individual 3D printing techniques have limited capacity to produce composite biomaterials with multi-scale resolution. Volumetric bioprinting recently emerged as a paradigm-shift in biofabrication. This ultrafast, light-based technique sculpts cell-laden hydrogel bioresins into 3D structures in a layerless fashion, providing enhanced design freedom over conventional bioprinting. However, it yields prints with low mechanical stability, since soft, cell-friendly hydrogels are used. Herein, the possibility to converge volumetric bioprinting with melt electrowriting, which excels at patterning microfibers, is shown for the fabrication of tubular hydrogel-based composites with enhanced mechanical behavior. Despite including non-transparent melt electrowritten scaffolds in the volumetric printing process, high-resolution bioprinted structures are successfully achieved. Tensile, burst, and bending mechanical properties of printed tubes are tuned altering the electrowritten mesh design, resulting in complex, multi-material tubular constructs with customizable, anisotropic geometries that better mimic intricate biological tubular structures. As a proof-of-concept, engineered tubular structures are obtained by building trilayered cell-laden vessels, and features (valves, branches, fenestrations) that can be rapidly printed using this hybrid approach. This multi-technology convergence offers a new toolbox for manufacturing hierarchical and mechanically tunable multi-material living structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the Role of Removable Solid Additives: Selective Interaction Contributes to Vertical Component Distributions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid additives with varied electrostatic potential and steric hinderance are introduced to investigate the impact of both evaporation dynamics and selective interaction on vertical component distribution. The removal of solid additives can drive the more strongly interacting component upward to the surface, delivering a high performance of 19.2%, among the highest efficiencies achieved in organic solar cells.








Abstract
Sequentially deposited organic solar cells (SD&#8208;OSCs) have attracted great attention owing to their ability in achieving a more favorable, vertically phase&#8208;separated morphology to avoid the accumulation of counter charges at absorber/transporting layer interfaces. However, the processing of SD&#8208;OSCs is still quite challenging in preventing the penetration of small&#8208;molecule acceptors into the polymer donor layer via erosion or swelling. Herein, solid additives (SAs) with varied electrostatic potential distributions and steric hinderance are introduced into SD&#8208;OSCs to investigate the effect of evaporation dynamics and selective interaction on vertical component distribution. Multiple modelings indicate that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction dominates the interactions between aromatic SAs and active layer components. Among them, p&#8208;dibromobenzene shows a stronger interaction with the donor while 2&#8208;chloronaphthalene (2&#8208;CN) interacts more preferably with acceptor. Combining the depth&#8208;dependent morphological study aided by multiple X&#8208;ray scattering methods, it is concluded that the evaporation of SAs can drive the stronger&#8208;interaction component upward to the surface, while having minor impact on the overall molecular packing. Ultimately, the 2&#8208;CN&#8208;treated devices with reduced acceptor concentration at the bottom surface deliver a high power conversion efficiency of 19.2%, demonstrating the effectiveness of applying selective interactions to improve the vertical morphology of OSCs by using SAs with proper structure.

         <title>Top&#8208;Down Fabrication of Atomic Patterns in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precision patterning of Cu atoms in twisted bilayer graphene using a top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approach is presented. The process involves utilizing controlled ejection of carbon atoms from the graphene lattice with an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The e&#8208;beam defines attachment points for Cu atoms, and thermally induced migration of source atoms allows impurities and clusters to be attached with limited human interaction.








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale engineering typically involves bottom&#8208;up approaches, leveraging parameters such as temperature, partial pressures, and chemical affinity to promote spontaneous arrangement of atoms. These parameters are applied globally, resulting in atomic&#8208;scale features scattered probabilistically throughout the material. In a top&#8208;down approach, different regions of the material are exposed to different parameters, resulting in structural changes varying on the scale of the resolution. In this work, the application of global and local parameters is combined in an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to demonstrate atomic&#8208;scale precision patterning of atoms in twisted bilayer graphene. The focused electron beam is used to define attachment points for foreign atoms through the controlled ejection of carbon atoms from the graphene lattice. The sample environment is staged with nearby source materials such that the sample temperature can induce migration of the source atoms across the sample surface. Under these conditions, the electron&#8208;beam (top&#8208;down) enables carbon atoms in the graphene to be replaced spontaneously by diffusing adatoms (bottom&#8208;up). Using image&#8208;based feedback control, arbitrary patterns of atoms and atom clusters are attached to the twisted bilayer graphene with limited human interaction. The role of substrate temperature on adatom and vacancy diffusion is explored by first&#8208;principles simulations.

         <title>In Situ Anchoring Ultrafine ZnS Nanodots on 2D MXene Nanosheets for Accelerating Polysulfide Redox and Regulating Li Plating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafine ZnS nanodots grown on 2D MXene nanosheets by a low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal method with abundant active site can not only act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of lithium polysulfides and mitigate the shutting effect, but also as a regulator for enabling uniform Li plating/stripping to inhibit the growth of Li dendrite.








Abstract
Lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery is a promising energy storage system due to its cost effectiveness and high energy density. However, formation of Li dendrites from Li metal anode and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) from S cathode impede its practical application. Herein, ultrafine ZnS nanodots are uniformly grown on 2D MXene nanosheets by a low&#8208;temperature (60 &#176;C) hydrothermal method for the first time. Distinctively, the ZnS nanodot&#8208;decorated MXene nanosheets (ZnS/MXene) can be easily filtered to be a flexible and freestanding film in several minutes. The ZnS/MXene film can be used as a current collector for Li&#8208;metal anode to promote uniform Li deposition due to the superior lithiophilicity of ZnS nanodots. ZnS/MXene powders obtained by freeze drying can be used as separator decorator to address the shuttle effect of LiPSs due to their excellent adsorbability. Theoretical calculation proves that the existence of ZnS nanodots on MXene can obviously improve the adsorption ability of ZnS/MXene with Li+ and LiPSs. Li&#8722;S full cells with composite Li&#8208;metal anode and modified separator exhibit remarkable rate and cycling performance. Other transition metal sulfides (CdS, CuS, etc.) can be also grown on 2D MXene nanosheets by the low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal strategy.

Plasmonic Nanoantennas
In article number 2301787, Dongxiao Li, Hong Zhou, Chengkuo Lee, Xiaojing Mu, and co&#8208;workers propose a design strategy for single&#8208;pixel modulation&#8208;free plasmonic nanoantennas based on loss engineering. This strategy allows a single device to enhance and capture full and complex fingerprint vibrations in the mid&#8208;infrared range. With the aid of machine learning, the device successfully detects and distinguishes the absorption fingerprints of various molecules.

Water Splitting
In article number 2300505, Cailei Yuan and co&#8208;workers report an ingenious approach to assemble Ni and Fe dual atoms into the interlayer of MoS2. The interlayer&#8208;confined structure provides a microenvironment highly boosting the catalytic process, and meanwhile a protective &#8220;shelter&#8221; for active metal atoms away from acid corrosion, agglomeration, and detachment. The interlayer&#8208;confined strategy provides a new direction for single&#8208;atom catalysts development in the future.

Graphene
In article number 2302906 by Ondrej Dyck and co&#8208;workers, automated atomic patterning of twisted bilayer graphene is demonstrated using a scanning transmission electron microscope. Top&#8208;down electron beam irradiation is used to define attachment points in the graphene. A bottom&#8208;up, thermally controlled, atomization and diffusion process is used to supply Cu atoms, which spontaneously bond to the attachment points. This strategy holds promise for atomic precision manufacturing.

Tissue Regeneration
Inspired by the regulation of cellular circadian clock on tissue regeneration, in article number 2301037, Huitong Ruan, Wenguo Cui, Lianfu Deng, and co&#8208;workers report circadian&#8208;clock&#8208;regulating biomaterials that are fabricated using the air&#8208;microfluidic technique. The chemical cross&#8208;linking between poly(vinyl alcohol) and modified phenylboronic acid can effectively activate the intrinsic circadian clock of nucleus pulposus cells via the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway, thus improving the regeneration of intervertebral discs.

         <dc:description>
Soft acoustic/vibration sensors have gained tremendous interest recently due to their unique ability to detect broadband stimuli. When used synergistically with machine learning (ML), they play an important role in driving the development of numerous Internet of Things applications. This review offers an overview of recent progress in the development of soft acoustic/vibration sensors and their signal processing using ML.








Abstract
In the last decade, soft acoustic/vibration sensors have gained tremendous research interest due to their unique ability to detect broadband acoustic/vibration stimuli, potentializing futuristic applications including voice biometrics, voice&#8208;controlled human&#8211;machine&#8208;interfaces, electronic skin, and skin&#8208;mountable healthcare devices. Importantly, to benefit most from these sensors, it is inevitable to use machine learning (ML) to process their output signals; with ML, a more accurate and efficient interpretation of original data is possible. This paper is dedicated to offering an overview of recent advances empowering the development of soft acoustic/vibration sensors and their signal processing using ML. First, the key performance parameters of the sensors are discussed. Second, popular transduction mechanisms for the sensors are addressed, followed by an in&#8208;depth overview of each type, covering materials used, structural designs, and sensing performances. Third, potential applications of the sensors are elaborated and fourth, a thorough discussion on ML is conducted, exploring different types of ML, specific ML algorithms suitable for processing acoustic/vibration signals, and current trends in ML&#8208;assisted applications. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities in soft acoustic/vibration sensor and ML research are revealed to offer new insights into future prospects in these fields.

         <title>Flexible Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Device for Emerging Multifunctional and Smart Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a comprehensive review of flexible electroluminescent quantum dot light emitting technologies including quantum dot materials, working mechanisms, flexible/stretchable strategies and patterning strategies, and the highlights of emerging multifunctional integrations and intelligent applications. The review is expected to offer a systematic understanding and valuable inspiration for flexible quantum dot light emitting devices and their intriguing future application scenario.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), owing to their exceptional performances in device efficiency, color purity/tunability in the visible region and solution&#8208;processing ability on various substrates, become a potential candidate for flexible and ultrathin electroluminescent (EL) lighting and display. Moreover, beyond the lighting and display, flexible QLEDs are enabled with endless possibilities in the era of the internet of things and artificial intelligence by acting as input/output ports in wearable integrated systems. Challenges remain in the development of flexible QLEDs with the goals for high performance, excellent flexibility/even stretchability, and emerging applications. In this paper, the recent developments of QLEDs including quantum dot materials, working mechanism, flexible/stretchable strategies and patterning strategies, and highlight its emerging multifunctional integrations and smart applications covering wearable optical medical devices, pressure&#8208;sensing EL devices, and neural smart EL devices, are reviewed. The remaining challenges are also summarized and an outlook on the future development of flexible QLEDs made. The review is expected to offer a systematic understanding and valuable inspiration for flexible QLEDs to simultaneously satisfy optoelectronic and flexible properties for emerging applications.

         <title>Recent Progress for Concurrent Realization of Shuttle&#8208;Inhibition and Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>

To settle the shuttle effect and Li&#8208;dendrite growth issues of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries simultaneously, the &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; host materials toward Li&#8211;S full cell, &#8220;two&#8208;birds&#8208;with&#8208;one&#8208;stone&#8221; modified separators, and tailored electrolyte additives for stabilizing sulfur/lithium electrodes are regarded as efficient strategies. Herein, a systematic and comprehensive review of recent studies, perspectives, and challenges confronted with Li&#8211;S batteries is presented.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have become one of the most promising new&#8208;generation energy storage systems owing to their ultrahigh energy density (2600&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), cost&#8208;effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, their practical applications are seriously impeded by the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and the uncontrolled dendrite growth of metallic Li, which result in rapid capacity fading and battery safety problems. A systematic and comprehensive review of the cooperative combination effect and tackling the fundamental problems in terms of cathode and anode synchronously is still lacking. Herein, for the first time, the strategies for inhibiting shuttle behavior and dendrite&#8208;free Li&#8211;S batteries simultaneously are summarized and classified into three parts, including &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; S&#8208;cathode and Li&#8208;anode host materials toward Li&#8211;S full cell, &#8220;two birds with one stone&#8221; modified functional separators, and tailoring electrolyte for stabilizing sulfur and lithium electrodes. This review also emphasizes the fundamental Li&#8211;S chemistry mechanism and catalyst principles for improving electrochemical performance; advanced characterization technologies to monitor real&#8208;time LiPS evolution are also discussed in detail. The problems, perspectives, and challenges with respect to inhibiting the shuttle effect and dendrite growth issues as well as the practical application of Li&#8211;S batteries are also proposed.

         <title>Interfacing Biology and Electronics with Memristive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nowadays, there is an imperative need for more efficient interaction and communication between electronics and biology. This review article represents an extensive overview of contemporary memristive technologies for biointerfacing.








Abstract
Memristive technologies promise to have a large impact on modern electronics, particularly in the areas of reconfigurable computing and artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. Meanwhile, the evolution of memristive materials alongside the technological progress is opening application perspectives also in the biomedical field, particularly for implantable and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices where advanced sensing technologies generate a large amount of data. Memristive devices are emerging as bioelectronic links merging biosensing with computation, acting as physical processors of analog signals or in the framework of advanced digital computing architectures. Recent developments in the processing of electrical neural signals, as well as on transduction and processing of chemical biomarkers of neural and endocrine functions, are reviewed. It is concluded with a critical perspective on the future applicability of memristive devices as pivotal building blocks in bio&#8208;AI fusion concepts and bionic schemes.

         <title>Conventional Non&#8208;Fluorescent Polymers: Unconventional Security Inks for Data Storage and Multidimensional Photonic Cryptography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly secure photonic cryptography based on the non&#8208;fluorescent polymer inks, rather than conventional fluorescent/phosphorescent inks, is developed. The stored data in the polymer inks can only be lit up&#160;by a anti&#8208;rigidochromic fluorophore, with their emission wavelength, intensity, and chirality prescribed by the polymer structures. Therefore, the data is triply encrypted and naturally gains a much higher security level.








Abstract
Traditional security inks relying on fluorescent/phosphorescent molecules are facing increasing risks of forgery or tampering due to their simple readout scheme (i.e., UV&#8208;light irradiation) and the advancement of counterfeiting technologies. In this work, a multidimensional data&#8208;encryption method based on non&#8208;fluorescent polymers via a &#8220;lock&#8211;key&#8221; mechanism is developed. The non&#8208;fluorescent invisible polymer inks serve as the &#8220;lock&#8221; for data&#8208;encryption, while the anti&#8208;rigidochromic fluorophores that can distinctively light up the polymer inks with programed emissions are &#8220;keys&#8221; for decryption. The emission of decrypted data is prescribed by polymer chemical structure, molecular weight, topology, copolymer sequence, and phase structure, and shows distinct intensity, wavelength, and chirality compared with the intrinsic emission of fluorophores. Therefore, the data is triply encrypted and naturally gains a high&#8208;security level, e.g., only one out of 20&#160;000 keys can access the only correct readout from 40&#160;000&#160;000 possible outputs in a three&#8208;polymers&#8208;based data&#8208;encryption matrix. Note that fluorophores lacking anti&#8208;rigidochrimism cannot selectively light up the inks and fail in data&#8208;decryption. Further, the diverse topologies, less well&#8208;defined structures, and random&#8208;coiled shapes of polymers make it impossible for them to be imitated. This work offers a new design for security inks and boosts data security levels beyond the reach of conventional fluorescent inks.

         <title>Advancing In Situ Food Monitoring through a Smart Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package System Demonstrated by the Detection of Salmonella in Whole Chicken</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of &#8220;Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package&#8221;, a novel food packaging platform, consisting of a redesigned tray for sample localization, a membrane for reagent immobilization, and a Salmonella&#8208;specific sensor, is reported. Performance is substantiated with ready&#8208;to&#8208;eat chicken products, including ones that are contaminated using knives, gloves, and surfaces. Real&#8208;world use is also simulated using a handheld fluorescence scanner with smartphone connectivity.








Abstract
With food production shifting away from traditional farm&#8208;to&#8208;table approaches to efficient multistep supply chains, the incidence of food contamination has increased. Consequently, pathogen testing via inefficient culture&#8208;based methods has increased, despite its lack of real&#8208;time capabilities and need for centralized facilities. While in situ pathogen detection would address these limitations and enable individual product monitoring, accurate detection within unprocessed, packaged food products without user manipulation has proven elusive.

&lt;p&gt;The development of &#8220;Lab-in-a-Package&#8221;, a novel food packaging platform, consisting of a redesigned tray for sample localization, a membrane for reagent immobilization, and a &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt;-specific sensor, is reported. Performance is substantiated with ready-to-eat chicken products, including ones that are contaminated using knives, gloves, and surfaces. Real-world use is also simulated using a handheld fluorescence scanner with smartphone connectivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With food production shifting away from traditional farm-to-table approaches to efficient multistep supply chains, the incidence of food contamination has increased. Consequently, pathogen testing via inefficient culture-based methods has increased, despite its lack of real-time capabilities and need for centralized facilities. While in situ pathogen detection would address these limitations and enable individual product monitoring, accurate detection within unprocessed, packaged food products without user manipulation has proven elusive. Herein, &#8220;Lab-in-a-Package&#8221; is presented, a platform capable of sampling, concentrating, and detecting target pathogens within closed food packaging, without intervention. This system consists of a newly designed packaging tray and reagent-infused membrane that can be paired universally with diverse pathogen sensors. The inclined food packaging tray maximizes fluid localization onto the sensing interface, while the membrane acts as a reagent-immobilizing matrix and an antifouling barrier for the sensor. The platform is substantiated using a newly discovered &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt;-responsive nucleic acid probe, which enables hands-free detection of 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; colony forming units (CFU) g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; target pathogen in a packaged whole chicken. The platform remains effective when contamination is introduced with toolsand surfaces, ensuring widespread efficacy. Its real-world use for in situ detection is simulated using a handheld fluorescence scanner with smartphone connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hot&#8208;Exciton Mechanism and AIE Effect Boost the Performance of Deep&#8208;Red Emitters in Non&#8208;Doped OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile strategy achieves hot exciton fluorescence with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties via elevation of the first singlet excited state by modulating the conjugation length of the acceptor unit to match the energy of high&#8208;lying triplet states. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter DT&#8208;IPD affords deep&#8208;red non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diode at 685 nm with an external quantum efficiency of 12.2%.








Abstract
Luminescent materials possessing a &#8220;hot&#8208;exciton&#8221; mechanism and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) qualities are well&#8208;suited for use as emitting materials in nondoped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), particularly in deep&#8208;red regions where their ground state and singlet excited state surfaces are in proximity, leading to the formation of multiple nonradiative channels. However, designing molecules that artificially combine the hot&#8208;exciton mechanism and AIE attributes remains a formidable task. In this study, a versatile strategy is presented to achieve hot&#8208;exciton fluorescence with AIE property by increasing the first singlet excited (S1) state through modulation of the conjugation length of the newly created acceptor unit, matching the energy level of high&#8208;lying triplet (Tn) states, and enhancing exciton utilization efficiency by employing suitable donor moieties. This approach reduces the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in the aggregate state, resulting in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter DT&#8208;IPD, which produces an unprecedented external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12.2% and Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage&#160;(CIE)&#160;coordinates of (0.69, 0.30) in a deep&#8208;red non&#8208;doped OLED at 685&#160;nm, representing the highest performance among all deep&#8208;red OLEDs based on materials with hot&#8208;exciton mechanisms. This work provides novel insights into the design of more efficient hot&#8208;exciton emitters with AIE properties.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence and Photoluminescence Heterojunction for Superior Multimode Sensing Platform of Friction, Force, Pressure, and Temperature in Fibers and 3D&#8208;Printed Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a multifunctional sensing platform in the form of photo&#8208;/mechano&#8208;luminescent powder, fibers, and 3D&#8208;printed polymers for optical detection of pressure, temperature, force, and friction is reported. The combination of 3D&#8208;printing with fiber spinning demonstrates the possibility of mass production of mechanoluminescence&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.








Abstract
Endowing a single material with various types of luminescence, that is, exhibiting a simultaneous optical response to different stimuli, is vital in various fields. A photoluminescence (PL)&#8208; and mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based multifunctional sensing platform is built by combining heterojunctioned ZnS/CaZnOS:Mn2+ mechano&#8208;photonic materials using a 3D&#8208;printing technique and fiber spinning. ML&#8208;active particles are embedded in micrometer&#8208;sized cellulose fibers for flexible optical devices capable of emitting light driven by mechanical force. Individually modified 3D&#8208;printed hard units that exhibit intense ML in response to mechanical deformation, such as impact and friction, are also fabricated. Importantly, they also allow low&#8208;pressure sensing up to &#8776;100&#160;bar, a range previously inaccessible by any other optical sensing technique. Moreover, the developed optical manometer based on the PL of the materials demonstrates a superior high&#8208;pressure sensitivity of &#8776;6.20&#160;nm&#160;GPa&#8722;1. Using this sensing platform, four modes of temperature detection can be achieved: excitation&#8208;band spectral shifts, emission&#8208;band spectral shifts, bandwidth broadening, and lifetime shortening. This work supports the possibility of mass production of ML&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.

         <title>Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cell Derived Exosomes Promote Keratinocytes and Fibroblasts Embedded in Collagen/Platelet&#8208;Rich Plasma Scaffold and Accelerate Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation and application of an exosome/cell&#8208;loaded COL/PRP scaffold for wound healing are assessed. The scaffold is applied on the dorsum wound of the mouse, wherein it promotes wound healing by reducing the level of inflammation, triggering proliferation of cells embedded in the scaffold, and promoting angiogenesis.








Abstract
Engineered skin substitutes derived from human skin significantly reduce inflammatory reactions mediated by foreign/artificial materials and are consequently easier to use for clinical application. Type I collagen is a main component of the extracellular matrix during wound healing and has excellent biocompatibility, and platelet&#8208;rich plasma can be used as the initiator of the healing cascade. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes are crucial for tissue repair and play key roles in enhancing cell regeneration, promoting angiogenesis, regulating inflammation, and remodeling extracellular matrix. Herein, Type I collagen and platelet&#8208;rich plasma, which provide natural supports for keratinocyte and fibroblast adhesion, migration, and proliferation, are mixed to form a stable 3D scaffold. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes are added to the scaffold to improve the performance of the engineered skin. The physicochemical properties of this cellular scaffold are analyzed, and the repair effect is evaluated in a full&#8208;thickness skin defect mouse model. The cellular scaffold reduces the level of inflammation and promotes cell proliferation and angiogenesis to accelerate wound healing. Proteomic analysis shows that exosomes exhibit excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory and proangiogenic effects in collagen/platelet&#8208;rich plasma scaffolds. The proposed method provides a new therapeutic strategy and theoretical basis for tissue regeneration and wound repair.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry as a Universal Strategy for a Controlled Perovskite Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a green solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is widely used in the processing of perovskite to control its morphology and orientation. Unfortunately, the highly coordinating DMSO is not easily expelled from the thin films, which negatively affects the long&#8208;term stability of resulting perovskite solar cells. In this work, dimethyl sulfide is introduced to facilitate perovskite formation by expelling the DMSO from the DMSO&#8208;intermediate phase compositions.








Abstract
The most efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are made from a complex mixture of precursors. Typically, to then form a thin film, an extreme oversaturation of the perovskite precursor is initiated to trigger nucleation sites, e.g., by vacuum, an airstream, or a so&#8208;called antisolvent. Unfortunately, most oversaturation triggers do not expel the lingering (and highly coordinating) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is used as a precursor solvent, from the thin films; this detrimentally affects long&#8208;term stability. In this work, (the green) dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is introduced as a novel nucleation trigger for perovskite films combining, uniquely, high coordination and high vapor pressure. This gives DMS a universal scope: DMS replaces other solvents by coordinating more strongly and removes itself once the film formation is finished. To demonstrate this novel coordination chemistry approach, MAPbI3 PSCs are processed, typically dissolved in hard&#8208;to&#8208;remove (and green) DMSO achieving 21.6% efficiency, among the highest reported efficiencies for this system. To confirm the universality of the strategy, DMS is tested for FAPbI3 as another composition, which shows higher efficiency of 23.5% compared to 20.9% for a device fabricated with chlorobenzene. This work provides a universal strategy to control perovskite crystallization using coordination chemistry, heralding the revival of perovskite compositions with pure DMSO.

         <title>Simultaneous Control of Spectral And Directional Emissivity with Gradient Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero InAs Photonic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally generated light is ubiquitous and its control is critical to a broad range of energy and sensing technologies. Semiconductor photonic films with tailored spatial doping gradients are demonstrated to deliver simultaneous control of both directional and spectral aspects of their thermal emission due to the spatial gradient in the epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero frequency they support.








Abstract
Controlling both the spectral bandwidth and directionality of emitted thermal radiation is a fundamental challenge in contemporary photonics. Recent work has shown that materials with a spatial gradient in the frequency range of their epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) response can support broad spectrum directionality in their emissivity, enabling high total radiance to specific angles of incidence. However, this capability is limited spectrally and directionally by the availability of materials with phonon&#8208;polariton resonances over long&#8208;wave infrared wavelengths. Here, an approach is designed and experimentally demonstrated using doped III&#8211;V semiconductors that can simultaneously tailor spectral peak, bandwidth, and directionality of infrared emissivity. InAs&#8208;based gradient ENZ photonic structures that exhibit broadband directional emission with varying spectral bandwidths and directional ranges as a function of their doping concentration profile and thickness are epitaxially grown and characterized. Due to its easy&#8208;to&#8208;fabricate geometry, it is believed that this approach provides a versatile photonic platform to dynamically control broadband spectral and directional emissivity for a range of emerging applications in heat transfer and infrared sensing.

         <title>Interfacial &#8220;Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;in&#8208;Defects&#8221; Catalysts Accelerating Li+ Desolvation Kinetics for Long&#8208;Lifespan Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The desolvation of Li+&#8208;solvents complex and Li0 diffusion kinetics are investigated experimentally and theoretically by applying atomic iron&#8208;in&#8208;defects (SAC&#8208;in&#8208;Defects) as the catalytic kinetics promotor, significantly reducing the related energy barriers of desolvation and diffusion. Consequently, the half and full cells stabilize long lifespans with high utilizations.








Abstract
The lithium&#8208;metal anode is a promising candidate for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries owing to its high capacity and low potential. However, several rate&#8208;limiting kinetic obstacles, such as the desolvation of Li+ solvation structure to liberate Li+, Li0 nucleation, and atom diffusion, cause heterogeneous spatial Li&#8208;ion distribution and fractal plating morphology with dendrite formation, leading to low Coulombic efficiency and depressive electrochemical stability. Herein, differing from pore sieving effect or electrolyte engineering, atomic iron anchors to cation vacancy&#8208;rich Co1&#8722;xS embedded in 3D porous carbon (SAFe/CVRCS@3DPC) is&#160;proposed and demonstrated as catalytic kinetic promoters. Numerous free Li ions are electrocatalytically dissociated from the Li+ solvation complex structure for uniform lateral diffusion by reducing desolvation and diffusion barriers via SAFe/CVRCS@3DPC, realizing smooth dendrite&#8208;free Li morphologies, as comprehensively understood by combined in&#160;situ/ex&#160;situ characterizations. Encouraged by SAFe/CVRCS@3DPC catalytic promotor, the modified Li&#8208;metal anodes achieve smooth plating with a long lifespan (1600&#160;h) and high Coulombic efficiency without any dendrite formation. Paired with the LiFePO4 cathode, the full cell (10.7&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) stabilizes a capacity retention of 90.3% after 300 cycles at 0.5&#160;C, signifying the feasibility of using interfacial catalysts for modulating Li behaviors toward practical applications.

         <title>Integrated Construction of a Long&#8208;Life Stretchable Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a series of physicochemically tunable self&#8208;healing polyurethanes, an elastic current collector with &#8220;geometric&#8208;intrinsic&#8221; dual stretchability is prepared through a swelling&#8208;induced wrinkling method, and a stretchable zinc negative electrode with triple&#8208;layer coaxial heterostructure is further prepared through in situ confined electroplating. Furthermore, fully polyurethane&#8208;based stretchable zinc&#8208;ion capacitors are assembled through in situ electrospinning and hot&#8208;pressing techniques. Due to the high stretchability of the components and the interfusion of the matrixes, the device exhibits excellent deformability and desirable electrochemical stability.








Abstract
The major challenge in achieving high&#8208;performance stretchable zinc&#8208;ion energy&#8208;storage devices is the combination of stretchable dendrite&#8208;free zinc negative electrodes and sufficient bonding between components (current collector, electrode, separator, and package). Herein, based on a series of physicochemically tunable self&#8208;healing polyurethanes, an elastic current collector is prepared through a swelling&#8208;induced wrinkling method, and then a stretchable zinc negative electrode prepared through in situ confined electroplating. The elastic current collector has a nano&#8208;network structure with polyurethane encapsulation, and exhibits both geometric and intrinsic stretchability. The stretchable zinc negative electrode formed in situ has high electrochemical activity and exhibits an excellent cycle life under the protection of a Zn2+&#8208;permeable coating. Furthermore, fully polyurethane&#8208;based stretchable zinc&#8208;ion capacitors are assembled through in situ electrospinning and hot&#8208;pressing techniques. Due to the high stretchability of the components and the interfusion of the matrixes, the integrated device exhibits excellent deformability and desirable electrochemical stability. This work provides a systematic construction plan for stretchable zinc&#8208;ion energy&#8208;storage devices in three aspects: material synthesis, component preparation, and device assembly.

         <title>Direct Observation of Atomic Step&#8208;Assisted Stabilization of&#160;Polar Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations discovers a hitherto unknown stabilization mechanism of polar oxide surfaces. The dynamic motion of atomic steps activated at a high temperature converts the LaAlO3 (001) polar surface to a nonpolar (015) vicinal surface via step reconstruction involving cation vacancy formation, which completely cancels the electric fields along all radial directions.








Abstract
Polar surfaces are intrinsically unstable and thus highly reactive due to the uncompensated surface charges. The charge compensation is accompanied by various surface reconstructions, establishing novel functionality for their applications. The present&#160;in situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy study directly shows that the atomic step and step&#8208;assisted reconstruction play central roles in the charge compensation of polar oxide surfaces. The&#160;flat (LaO)+&#8208;terminated LaAlO3 (001) polar surface, when annealed at high temperature in vacuum, transits to the (015) vicinal surface via the dynamic motion and interaction of atomic steps. While the (015) vicinal surface possesses zero polarization along the surface normal, a thermodynamic ground state is achieved when the in&#8208;plane polarization is fully compensated via the reconstruction of step&#8208;edge atoms; the step&#8208;edge La atoms are displaced from their ordinary atomic sites toward the adjacent Al step&#8208;edge sites, resulting in the formation of negatively charged La vacancies at the corresponding step edges. As confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations, the observed step reconstruction of (015) vicinal surface can completely cancel both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane electric fields. This hitherto unknown mechanism reveals the central role of step reconstruction in stabilizing a polar surface, providing valuable insights for understanding the novel charge compensation mechanism accompanied by the step reconstruction.

         <title>Unraveling Size&#8208;Dependent Ion&#8208;Migration for Stable Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile path toward high&#8208;quality mixed&#8208;halide perovskites without halide segregation is developed. Two factors contribute to this improvement: composition homogeneity is a prerequisite for realizing high thermodynamic stability, and further reduction of the grain size strengthens the ability to resist stimuli. Consequently, efficient and color&#8208;stable deep&#8208;blue CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5 and yellow CsPbBr1.5I1.5 PeLEDs are presented, showing the potential for full&#8208;color&#8208;gamut displays and solid&#8208;state lighting.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halide perovskites show tunable emission wavelength across the visible&#8208;light range, with optimum control of the light color. However, color stability remains limited due to the notorious halide segregation under illumination or an electric field. Here, a versatile path toward high&#8208;quality mixed&#8208;halide perovskites with high emission properties and resistance to halide segregation is presented. Through systematic in and ex situ characterizations, key features for this advancement are proposed: a slowed and controllable crystallization process can promote achievement of halide homogeneity, which in turn ensures thermodynamic stability; meanwhile, downsizing perovskite nanoparticle to nanometer&#8208;scale dimensions can enhance their resistance to external stimuli, strengthening the phase stability. Leveraging this strategy, devices are developed based on CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 perovskite that achieves a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.8% at 464&#160;nm, making it one of the most efficient deep&#8208;blue mixed&#8208;halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) to date. Particularly, the device demonstrates excellent spectral stability, maintaining a constant emission profile and position for over 60 min of continuous operation. The versatility of this approach with CsPbBr1.5I1.5 PeLEDs is further showcased, achieving an impressive EQE of 12.7% at 576&#160;nm.

&lt;p&gt;A versatile path toward high-quality mixed-halide perovskites without halide segregation is developed. Two factors contribute to this improvement: composition homogeneity is a prerequisite for realizing high thermodynamic stability, and further reduction of the grain size strengthens the ability to resist stimuli. Consequently, efficient and color-stable deep-blue CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt; and yellow CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt; PeLEDs are presented, showing the potential for full-color-gamut displays and solid-state lighting.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed-halide perovskites show tunable emission wavelength across the visible-light range, with optimum control of the light color. However, color stability remains limited due to the notorious halide segregation under illumination or an electric field. Here, a versatile path toward high-quality mixed-halide perovskites with high emission properties and resistance to halide segregation is presented. Through systematic in and ex situ characterizations, key features for this advancement are proposed: a slowed and controllable crystallization process can promote achievement of halide homogeneity, which in turn ensures thermodynamic stability; meanwhile, downsizing perovskite nanoparticle to nanometer-scale dimensions can enhance their resistance to external stimuli, strengthening the phase stability. Leveraging this strategy, devices are developed based on CsPbCl&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite that achieves a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.8% at 464&#160;nm, making it one of the most efficient deep-blue mixed-halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) to date. Particularly, the device demonstrates excellent spectral stability, maintaining a constant emission profile and position for over 60 min of continuous operation.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Diffusion Management Enables All&#8208;Interface Defect Passivation of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;diffusion management strategy using dual passivating reagents of octylammonium iodide (OAI) and guanidinium chloride is demonstrated to realize all&#8208;interface passivation via one&#8208;step post&#8208;treatment, outperforming the traditional passivation with OAI. This strategy delivers a superior efficiency&#160;of 25.43% and an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.202&#160;V, representing 94.05% of the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit VOC for the 1.55&#8208;eV perovskite absorber.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have demonstrated over 25% power conversion efficiency (PCE) via efficient surface passivation. Unfortunately, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite post&#8208;treatment strategies can solely heal the top interface defects. Herein, an ion&#8208;diffusion management strategy is proposed to concurrently modulate the top interfaces, buried interfaces, and bulk interfaces (i.e., grain boundaries) of perovskite film, enabling all&#8208;interface defect passivation. Specifically, this method is enabled by applying double interactive salts of octylammonium iodide (OAI) and guanidinium chloride (GACl) onto the 3D&#160;perovskite surface. It is revealed that the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between OA+ and GA+ decelerates the OA+ diffusion and therefore forms a dimensionally broadened 2D capping layer. Additionally, the diffusion of GA+ and Cl&#8722; determines the composition of the bulk and buried interface of PSCs. As a result, n&#8211;inter&#8211;i&#8211;inter&#8211;p, i.e., five&#8208;layer structured PSCs can be obtained with a champion PCE of 25.43% (certified 24.4%). This approach also enables the substantially improved operational stability of perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Curbing Exosome Communications via Introducing Artificial Membrane Receptors for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ac4ManNAz&#8208;DP nanoparticles first generate receptor&#8208;like azide groups on the membranes of pancreatic tumor cells and tumor derived exosomes by metabolic glycoengineering. DBCO&#8208;GEM/ISO&#8208;DP nanoparticles then can precisely bind to the azide&#8208;labeled tumor cells and tumor derived exosomes via bio&#8208;orthogonal click chemistry, thus suppressing the primary tumors and the exosome communications between primary tumors and distal organs.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;derived exosomes (TDEs) carry various biomolecular cargos and play crucial roles in metastasis. TDEs migrate to distal organs for intercellular communication and induce the formation of pre&#8208;metastatic niches (PMNs) to support tumor implantation and proliferation. Precise interference in the bioprocess of TDEs is expected to be efficacious for suppressing tumor metastasis. However, targeting both TDEs and the primary tumor is challenging. Here, based on metabolic glycoengineering and bio&#8208;orthogonal click chemistry, a two&#8208;step delivery strategy is designed to overcome this. During the first step, the tetraacetylated&#160;N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;d&#8208;mannosamine&#8208;loaded nanoparticle responds to the metabolic activity of tumor cells in the primary tumor, tagging both tumor cells and TDEs with azide groups; dibenzyl&#8208;cyclootyne&#8208;modified nanoparticles then can, as the second step, specifically react with tumor cells and TDEs through a bio&#8208;orthogonal click reaction. This strategy not only inhibits tumor growth in pancreatic cancer models but also curbs the communicative role of TDEs in inducing liver PMNs and metastasis by tracking and downregulating the exosomal macrophage migration inhibitory factor.

         <title>Correlating the Valence State with the Adsorption Behavior of a Cu&#8208;Based Electrocatalyst for Furfural Oxidation with Anodic Hydrogen Production Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;side H2 production device with ultralow energy input is built up, and the energy input is only 1/17 of water splitting. The deactivation mechanism of the anodic hydrogen production reaction is revealed as the changed adsorption ability of Cu&#8208;based catalysts. This study provides guidelines for the design of a stable Cu&#8208;based catalyst in anodic hydrogen production reactions.








Abstract
The low&#8208;potential furfural oxidation reaction (FFOR) on a Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst can produce H2 at the anode, thereby providing a bipolar H2 production system with an ultralow cell voltage. However, the intrinsic activity and stability of the Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst for the FFOR remain unsatisfactory for practical applications. This study investigates the correlation between the valence state and the adsorption behavior of the Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst in furfural oxidation. Cu0 is the adsorption site with low intrinsic activity. Cu+, which exists in the form of Cu(OH)ads in alkaline electrolytes, has no adsorption ability but can improve the performance of Cu0 by promoting the adsorption of FF. Moreover, a mixed&#8208;valence Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst (MV Cu) with high intrinsic activity and stability is prepared electrochemically. With the MV Cu catalyst, the assembled dual&#8208;side H2 production electrolyzer has a low electricity requirement of only 0.24&#160;kWh&#160;mH2&#8722;3 at an ultralow cell voltage of 0.3&#160;V, and it exhibits sufficient stability. This study not only correlates the valence state with the adsorption behavior of the Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst for the low&#8208;potential FFOR with anodic H2 production but also reveals the mechanism of deactivation to provide design principles for Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts with satisfactory stability.

         <title>Organic Polarized Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic polarized light&#8208;emitting transistors (OPLETs), which integrate electroluminescence, current switching, and polarized emission into one device, are demonstrated with a degree of polarization of 0.97. The high polarization characteristics of the OPLETs are assigned to the intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy of molecular properties. High&#8208;contrast optical imaging and modern anti&#8208;counterfeit security based on OPLETs are demonstrated, establishing a new direction for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Electrically driven polarized light&#8208;emitting sources are central to various applications including quantum computers, optical communication, and 3D displays, but serious challenges remain due to the inevitable incorporation of complex optical elements in conventional devices. Here, organic polarized light&#8208;emitting transistors (OPLETs), a kind of novel device that integrates the functions of organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, and polarizers into one unique device, are demonstrated with a degree of polarization (DOP) as high as 0.97, which is comparable to completely linearly polarized light (DOP = 1). Under the modulation of gate voltage, robust and efficient polarization emission is proven, ascribed to the intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy of the molecular transition dipole moment in organic semiconductors and the open&#8208;ended feature of OPLETs instead of other factors. As a result, high&#8208;contrast optical imaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting security are successfully demonstrated based on OPLETs, establishing a new direction for photonic and electronic integration toward on&#8208;chip miniaturized optoelectronic applications.

As a result, high-contrast optical imaging and anti-counterfeiting security are successfully demonstrated based on OPLETs, establishing a new direction for photonic and electronic integration toward on-chip miniaturized optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MoS2@Polyaniline for Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NH4+ is made of extremely abundant elements and has a lower molar mass (18&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1) and a smaller hydrated radius (3.3&#160;&#197;) than most metal ions. These characteristics and the formation of hydrogen bonds between the metal oxide and NH4+ facilitate fast diffusion kinetics and reversible reaction. This work demonstrates the great potential of composite engineering in optimizing the performance of ammonium&#8208;ion insertion electrodes.








Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion aqueous supercapacitors are raising notable attention owing to their cost, safety, and environmental advantages, but the development of optimized electrode materials for ammonium&#8208;ion storage still lacks behind expectations. To overcome current challenges, here, a sulfide&#8208;based composite electrode based on MoS2 and polyaniline (MoS2@PANI) is proposed as an ammonium&#8208;ion host. The optimized composite possesses specific capacitances above 450&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and 86.3% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles in a three&#8208;electrode configuration. PANI not only contributes to the electrochemical performance but also plays a key role in defining the final MoS2 architecture. Symmetric supercapacitors assembled with such electrodes display energy densities above 60&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 725&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1. Compared with Li+ and K+ ions, the surface capacitive contribution in NH4+&#8208;based devices is lower at every scan rate, which points to an effective generation/breaking of H&#8208;bonds as the mechanism controlling the rate of NH4+ insertion/de&#8208;insertion. This result is supported by density functional theory calculations, which also show that sulfur vacancies effectively enhance the NH4+ adsorption energy and improve the electrical conductivity of the whole composite. Overall, this work demonstrates the great potential of composite engineering in optimizing the performance of ammonium&#8208;ion insertion electrodes.

         <title>Tunable, Wide&#8208;Temperature, and Macroscale Superlubricity Enabled by Nanoscale Van Der Waals Heterojunction&#8208;to&#8208;Homojunction Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By van der Waals (vdW) composite (graphene/MoS2 etc.) nanopowder&#8208;to&#8208;heterojunction conversion under graphene edge&#8208;oxygen incorporation, a coexistent structure of nanoscale homojunctions and heterojunctions is formed on the grinding balls. Tunable, wide&#8208;temperature (&#8722;200 to 300&#160;&#176;C) and macroscale superlubricity (0.005) is achieved on diamond&#8208;like carbon surfaces by nanoscale vdW heterojunction&#8208;to&#8208;homojunction transformation unlike traditional incommensurability&#8208;to&#8208;commensurability theory.








Abstract
Achieving macroscale superlubricity of van der Waals (vdW) nanopowders is particularly challenging, due to the difficulty in forming ordered junctions before friction and the friction&#8208;induced complex contact restructuration among multiple nanometer&#8208;sized junctions. Here, a facile way is reported to achieve vdW nanopowder&#8208;to&#8208;heterojunction conversion by graphene edge&#8208;oxygen (GEO) incorporation. The GEO effectively weakens the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane edge&#8211;edge and in&#8208;plane plane&#8211;edge states of the vdW nanopowder, leading to a coexistent structure of nanoscale homojunctions and heterojunctions on the grinding balls. When sliding on diamond&#8208;like carbon surfaces, the ball&#8208;supported structure governs macroscale superlubricity by heterojunction&#8208;to&#8208;homojunction transformation among the countless nanoscale junctions. Furthermore, the transformation guides the tunable design of superlubricity, achieving superlubricity (&#181;&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.005) at wide ranges of load, velocity, and temperature (&#8722;200 to 300&#160;&#176;C). Atomistic simulations reveal the GEO&#8208;enhanced conversion of vdW nanopowder to heterojunctions and demonstrate the heterojunction&#8208;to&#8208;homojunction transformation superlubricity mechanism. The findings are of significance for the macroscopic scale&#8208;up and engineering application of structural superlubricity.

Solvent&#8208;free and skin&#8208;like supramolecular ion&#8208;conductive elastomers with high stability and excellent biocompatibility are reported, which can be simply processed into scalable and customized ionic&#8208;tattoos (I&#8208;tattoos) by painting and printing methods. The I&#8208;tattoos can work as ultraconformal on&#8208;skin electrodes for long&#8208;term and high&#8208;fidelity acquisition of various electrophysiological signals with extraordinary immunity to motion artifacts, enabling human&#8211;machine interactions and multichannel digital diagnosis.








Abstract
The development of stable and biocompatible soft ionic conductors, alternatives to hydrogels and ionogels, will open up new avenues for the construction of stretchable electronics. Here, a brand&#8208;new design, encapsulating a naturally occurring ionizable compound by a biocompatible polymer via high&#8208;density hydrogen bonds, resulting in a solvent&#8208;free supramolecular ion&#8208;conductive elastomer (SF&#8208;supra&#8208;ICE) that eliminates the dehydration problem of hydrogels and possesses excellent biocompatibility, is reported. The SF&#8208;supra&#8208;ICE with high ionic conductivity (&gt;3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1) exhibits skin&#8208;like softness and strain&#8208;stiffening behaviors, excellent elasticity, breathability, and self&#8208;adhesiveness. Importantly, the SF&#8208;supra&#8208;ICE can be obtained by a simple water evaporation step to solidify the aqueous precursor into a solvent&#8208;free nature. Therefore, the aqueous precursor can act as inks to be painted and printed into customized ionic tattoos (I&#8208;tattoos) for the construction of multifunctional on&#8208;skin bioelectronics. The painted I&#8208;tattoos exhibit ultraconformal and seamless contact with human skin, enabling long&#8208;term and high&#8208;fidelity recording of various electrophysiological signals with extraordinary immunity to motion artifacts. Human&#8211;machine interactions are achieved by exploiting the painted I&#8208;tattoos to transmit the electrophysiological signals of human beings. Stretchable I&#8208;tattoo electrode arrays, manufactured by the printing method, are demonstrated for multichannel digital diagnosis of the health condition of human back muscles and spine.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Uniform and Functionalized Nano&#8208;Ion Divider for Regulating Ion Distribution toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional ion&#8208;divider (M&#8208;NC@MXene) with homogeneous nanopores and doped single atoms is designed and fabricated to enable physical and chemical redistribution of Li ions, impede the transport of anions, and prevent the formation of Li dendrites in various Li&#8208;metal battery systems. The multifunctionality of the divider is validated through experiments, first&#8208;principles simulations, and phase&#8208;field modeling.








Abstract
Ionic dividers with uniform pores and functionalized surfaces display significant potential for solving Li&#8208;dendrite issues in Li&#8208;metal batteries. In this study, single metal and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;sandwiched MXene (M&#8208;NC@MXene) nanosheets are designed and fabricated, which possess highly ordered nanochannels with a diameter of &#8776;10&#160;nm. The experiments and computational calculations verified that the M&#8208;NC@MXene nanosheets eliminate Li dendrites in several ways: (1) redistributing the Li&#8208;ion flux via the highly ordered ion channels, (2) selectively conducting Li ions and anchoring anions by heteroatom doping to extend the nucleation time for Li dendrites, and (3) tightly staggering on a routine polypropylene (PP) separator to obstruct the growth path of Li dendrites. With a Zn&#8208;NC@MXene&#8208;coated PP divider, the assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows an ultralow overpotential of &#8776;25&#160;mV and a cycle life of 1500&#160;h at a high current density of 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and high capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, the life of a Li||Ni83 pouch cell with an energy density of 305&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is improved by fivefold. Moreover, the remarkable performance of Li||Li, Li||LiFePO4, and Li||sulfur batteries reveal the significant potential of the well&#8208;designed multifunctional ion divider for further practical applications.

Moreover, the remarkable performance of Li||Li, Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and Li||sulfur batteries reveal the significant potential of the well-designed multifunctional ion divider for further practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantitative Mapping of Chemical Defects at Charged Grain Boundaries in a Ferroelectric Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic properties and chemical composition at grain boundaries in ferroelectric ErMnO3 polycrystals are studied. Atom probe tomography shows that the chemical structure at grain boundaries is substantially different from the bulk, revealing the microscopic origin of their distinct electronic responses. The work demonstrates the benefit of quantitative atomic&#8208;scale measurements and additional opportunities for property engineering at polar oxide interfaces.








Abstract
Polar discontinuities, as well as compositional and structural changes at oxide interfaces can give rise to a large variety of electronic and ionic phenomena. In contrast to earlier work focused on domain walls and epitaxial systems, this work investigates the relation between polar discontinuities and the local chemistry at grain boundaries in polycrystalline ferroelectric ErMnO3. Using orientation mapping and scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques, the polycrystalline material is demonstrated to develop charged grain boundaries with enhanced electronic conductance. By performing atom probe tomography (APT) measurements, an enrichment of erbium and a depletion of oxygen at all grain boundaries are found. The observed compositional changes translate into a charge that exceeds possible polarization&#8208;driven effects, demonstrating that structural phenomena rather than electrostatics determine the local chemical composition and related changes in the electronic transport behavior. The study shows that the charged grain boundaries behave distinctly different from charged domain walls, giving additional opportunities for property engineering at polar oxide interfaces.

         <title>Stabilizing Supersaturation with Extreme Grain Refinement in Spinodal Aluminum Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is challenging to stabilize supersaturated solid solutions against the spinodal decomposition that occurs via chemical fluctuations without energy barriers to nucleation. It is found that spinodal decomposition in supersaturated Al(Zn) solid solutions can be inhibited by straining&#8208;induced grain refinement into the nanoscale when a stable Schwarz crystal structure is formed.








Abstract
Supersaturated solid solutions can be formed in alloys from various non&#8208;equilibrium processes, but stabilizing the metastable phases against decomposition is challenging,&#160;particularly the spinodal decomposition that occurs via chemical fluctuations without energy barriers to nucleation. In this work, it is found that spinodal decomposition in supersaturated Al(Zn) solid solutions can be inhibited with straining&#8208;induced extreme grain refinement. For the refined supersaturated grains at the nanoscale, their spinodal decomposition is obviously resisted by the relaxed grain boundaries and reduced lattice defects. As grains are refined below 10&#160;nm the decomposition is completely inhibited, in which atomic diffusion is blocked by the stable Schwarz crystal structure with vacancy&#8208;free grains. Extreme grain refinement offers a general approach to stabilize supersaturated phases with broadened compositional windows for property modulation of alloys.

         <title>Lattice Strain Regulation Enables High&#8208;Performance Formamidinium Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PYBA cation is used as a template for the crystallization of FAPbI3 perovskite, which induces a highly oriented crystal and a pure &#945;&#8208;phase film. The external compression strain provided by the PYBA pairs compensates for the inherent tension strain of the FAPbI3 crystals. As a result, the strain&#8208;regulated formamidinium PSC exhibits an improved PCE.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite possesses an ideal optical bandgap and is a potential material for fabricating the most efficient single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Nevertheless, large formamidinium (FA) cations result in residual lattice strain, which reduces the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability of PSCs. Herein, the modulation of lattice strain in FAPbI3 crystals via a &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic amine, i.e., 4&#8208;pyrene oxy butylamine (PYBA), is proposed. PYBA pairs at the grain boundary serve as a template for the crystallization of FAPbI3 perovskite, thereby inducing a highly oriented crystal and a pure &#945;&#8208;phase film. The PYBA pairs with strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions provide a solid fulcrum for external compression strain, thus compensating for the inherent tension strain of FAPbI3 crystals. The strain release elevates the valence band of the perovskite crystals, thereby decreasing the bandgap and trap density. Consequently, the PYBA&#8208;regulated FAPbI3 PSC achieves an excellent PCE of 24.76%. Moreover, the resulting device exhibits improves operational stability and maintains over 80% of its initial PCE after 1500&#160;h under maximum power point tracking conditions.

         <title>Realizing Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting by Modulating the Thickness&#8208;Induced Reaction Energy Barrier of Fluorenone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ultrathin three&#8208;layer structure of fluorenone&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is successfully constructed to realize photocatalytic overall water splitting. Reducing the thickness of the COF nanosheets is found to increase&#160;the number of&#160;accessible active sites, reduce the distance for charge migration distance, prolong the lifetimes of photogenerated carriers, and decrease the Gibbs free energy of rate&#8208;limiting step for oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Direct photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution from water splitting is an attractive approach for producing chemical fuels. In this work, a novel fluorenone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2) is successfully exfoliated into ultrathin three&#8208;layer nanosheets (UCOF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2) for photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) under visible light. The ultrathin structures of UCOF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2 greatly enhance carrier separation, utilization efficiency, and the exposure of active surface sites. Surprisingly, UCOF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2 exhibits efficient photocatalytic OWS performance, with hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates reaching 0.046 and 0.021 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, respectively,&#160;under visible&#8208;light irradiation, whereas bulk COF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2 shows no activity for photocatalytic OWS. Charge&#8208;carrier kinetic analysis and DFT calculations confirm that reducing the thickness of the COF nanosheets increases&#160;the number of&#160;accessible active sites, reduces the distance for charge migration, prolongs the lifetimes of photogenerated carriers, and decreases the Gibbs free energy of the rate&#8208;limiting step compared to nonexfoliated COFs. This work offers new insights into the effect of the layer thickness of COFs on photocatalytic OWS.

         <title>Linker Engineering of Sandwich&#8208;Structured Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composites for Optimized Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sandwich&#8208;like UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X = &#9472;H, &#9472;Br, &#9472;NA (naphthalene for short), &#9472;OCH3, &#9472;Cl, &#9472;NO2) composites are constructed for visible&#8208;light photocatalytic H2 production. The &#9472;X group reversely regulates the charge separation of the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 core and the proton reduction ability of Pt, giving rise to a volcano&#8208;like activity trend of the composites along with increasing electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the &#9472;X group.








Abstract
While the microenvironment around catalytic sites is recognized to be crucial in thermocatalysis, its roles in photocatalysis remain subtle. In this work, a series of sandwich&#8208;structured metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composites, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X means functional groups), is rationally constructed for visible&#8208;light photocatalytic H2 production. By varying the &#9472;X groups of the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X shell, the microenvironment of the Pt sites and photosensitive UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 core can be simultaneously modulated. Significantly, the MOF composites with identical light absorption and Pt loading present distinctly different photocatalytic H2 production rates, following the &#9472;X group sequence of &#9472;H&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;Br&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;NA (naphthalene)&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;OCH3&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;Cl&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;NO2. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H demonstrates H2 production rate up to 2708.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;222 times that of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2. Mechanism investigations suggest that the variation of the &#9472;X group can balance the charge separation of the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 core and the proton reduction ability of Pt, leading to an optimal activity of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H at the equilibrium point.

&lt;p&gt;Sandwich-like UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Pt@UiO-66-X (X = &#9472;H, &#9472;Br, &#9472;NA (naphthalene for short), &#9472;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &#9472;Cl, &#9472;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) composites are constructed for visible-light photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. The &#9472;X group reversely regulates the charge separation of the UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core and the proton reduction ability of Pt, giving rise to a volcano-like activity trend of the composites along with increasing electron-withdrawing ability of the &#9472;X group.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the microenvironment around catalytic sites is recognized to be crucial in thermocatalysis, its roles in photocatalysis remain subtle. In this work, a series of sandwich-structured metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composites, UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Pt@UiO-66-X (X means functional groups), is rationally constructed for visible-light photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. By varying the &#9472;X groups of the UiO-66-X shell, the microenvironment of the Pt sites and photosensitive UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core can be simultaneously modulated. Significantly, the MOF composites with identical light absorption and Pt loading present distinctly different photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rates, following the &#9472;X group sequence of &#9472;H&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;&#9472;Br&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;&#9472;NA (naphthalene)&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;&#9472;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;&#9472;Cl&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;&#9472;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Pt@UiO-66-H demonstrates H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate up to 2708.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &#8776;222 times that of UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Pt@UiO-66-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Mechanism investigations suggest that the variation of the &#9472;X group can balance the charge separation of the UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core and the proton reduction ability of Pt, leading to an optimal activity of UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Pt@UiO-66-H at the equilibrium point.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Bonded Atomic Layers of Transition Metal Carbides (MXenes)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accordion&#8208;like metal&#8208;bonded transition metal carbides (MXenes) are produced through a topological reaction between Cl&#8208;terminated MXenes and selected metals, which is driven by the crystal symmetry of the MAX phases. After the delamination and assembling, the films composed of Al&#8208;bonded Ti3C2Clx MXene atomic layers exhibit high oxidation resistance and low sheet resistances, affording a significantly enhanced property in electromagnetic interference (EMI) sheilding.








Abstract
Although 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have fantastic physical and chemical properties as well as wide applications, it remains challenging to produce stable MXenes due to their rapid structural degradation. Here, unique metal&#8208;bonded atomic layers of transition metal carbides with high stabilities are produced via a simple topological reaction between chlorine&#8208;terminated MXenes and selected metals, where the metals enable them to not only remove partially Cl terminations, but also bond with adjacent atomic MXene slabs, driven by the symmetry of MAX phases. The films constructed from Al&#8208;bonded Ti3C2Clx atomic layers show high oxidation resistance up to 400&#160;&#176;C and low sheet resistance of 9.3&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1. Coupled to the multilayer structure, the Al&#8208;bonded Ti3C2Clx film displays a significantly improved electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding capability with a total shielding effectiveness value of 39&#160;dB at a low thickness of 3.1&#160;&#181;m, outperforming pure Ti3C2Clx film.

         <title>Macrocyclic Engineering of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters for High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of delayed fluorescent macrocycles is successfully synthesized via a modular strategy. Among them, MC&#8208;XT and MC&#8208;X show perfect photoluminescence quantum yields (&#8776;100%) due to more ideal macrocyclic structure and larger oscillator strength. Therefore, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on MC&#8208;XT and MC&#8208;X achieve record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 26.9% and 31.6%, respectively.








Abstract
Several thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials&#160;have been studied and developed to realize high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, TADF macrocycles have not been sufficiently investigated owing to the synthetic challenges, resulting in limited exploration of their luminescent properties and the corresponding highly efficient OLEDs. In this study, a series of TADF macrocycles is synthesized using a modularly tunable strategy by introducing xanthones as acceptors and phenylamine derivatives as donors. A detailed analysis of their photophysical properties combined with fragment molecules reveals characteristics of high&#8208;performance macrocycles. The results indicate that: a) the ideal structure decreases the energy loss, which in turn reduces the non&#8208;radiative transitions; b) reasonable building blocks increase the oscillator strength providing a higher radiation transition rate; c) the horizontal dipole orientation (&#920;) of the extended macrocyclic emitters is increased. Owing to the high photoluminescence quantum yields of &#8776;100% and 92% and excellent &#920; of 80 and 79% for macrocycles MC&#8208;X and MC&#8208;XT in 5&#160;wt% doped films, the corresponding devices exhibit record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies of 31.6% and 26.9%, respectively, in the field of TADF macrocycles.

         <title>Biodegradable NIR&#8208;II Pseudo Conjugate Polymeric Nanoparticles Amplify Photodynamic Immunotherapy via Alleviation of Tumor Hypoxia and Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II biodegradable pseudo&#8208;conjugate polymer (PSP)&#8208;based photodynamic polymer is designed to deliver a vascular normalization agent, i.e., regorafenib (Reg) in nanoparticles (NP&#8208;PDT@Reg). Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, NP&#8208;PDT@Reg can on the one hand efficiently release Reg to improve the tumor hypoxia via vascular normalization, making more NP&#8208;PDT@Reg and oxygen enter the tumors. On the other hand, NP&#8208;PDT@Reg + L can further result in more ROS generation to eradicate tumor cells while inducing ICD to activate anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. Furthermore, Reg can reprogram TAMs from a pro&#8208;tumor M2 phenotype to a tumor&#8208;killing M1 phenotype as well, thereby reversing the immunosuppressive TME.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has achieved great success in cancer treatment. Despite its great promise, the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy can be limited by the hypoxia in solid tumors which is closely related to the abnormal tumor vasculature. These abnormal vasculatures are a hallmark of most solid tumors and facilitate immune evasion. Therefore, tumor vascular normalization is developed as a promising strategy to overcome tumor hypoxia, resulting in improved cancer therapy. Here, a NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;degradable pseudo&#8208;conjugate polymer (PSP)&#8208;based photodynamic polymer is designed to deliver a vascular normalization agent, i.e., regorafenib (Reg) in nanoparticles (NP&#8208;PDT@Reg). NP&#8208;PDT@Reg under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation (NP&#8208;PDT@Reg + L) can efficiently release Reg to improve the tumor hypoxia via vascular normalization, making more NP&#8208;PDT@Reg and oxygen enter the tumors. Moreover, NP&#8208;PDT@Reg + L can further result in generation of more reactive oxygen species (ROS) to eradicate tumor cells while inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) to activate anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. In addition, Reg can reprogram TAM from a pro&#8208;tumor M2 phenotype to a tumor&#8208;killing M1 phenotype as well, thereby reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Taken together, the current study provides an innovative perspective on the development of novel nanomaterials to overcome the limitations in photodynamic immunotherapy.

         <title>Composite Spin Hall Conductivity from Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnetic Order</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low symmetry non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets allow longitudinal and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin currents with x&#770;,z&#770;$\hat{x},\hat{z}$ polarization that are anisotropic in orientation to the magnetic lattice. Here, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin Hall conductivities with &#963;xzx,$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{x}},$ &#963;xzy,&#963;xzz$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{y}},\ \sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{z}}$ components are found in L12&#8208;ordered antiferromagnetic PtMn3 thin films with large spin torque efficiencies and orientation&#8208;dependent anisotropy, a pathway to efficient spintronic devices with selectable spin polarization.








Abstract
Non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets (AFMs) are an exciting new platform for studying intrinsic spin Hall effects (SHEs), phenomena that arise from the materials&#8217; band structure, Berry phase curvature, and linear response to an external electric field. In contrast to conventional SHE materials, symmetry analysis of non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets does not forbid non&#8208;zero longitudinal and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin currents with x&#770;,z&#770;$\hat{x},\hat{z}$ polarization and predicts an anisotropy with current orientation to the magnetic lattice.

&lt;p&gt;Low symmetry non-collinear antiferromagnets allow longitudinal and out-of-plane spin currents with x&#770;,z&#770;$\hat{x},\hat{z}$ polarization that are anisotropic in orientation to the magnetic lattice. Here, out-of-plane spin Hall conductivities with &#963;xzx,$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{x}},$ &#963;xzy,&#963;xzz$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{y}},\ \sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{z}}$ components are found in L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ordered antiferromagnetic PtMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thin films with large spin torque efficiencies and orientation-dependent anisotropy, a pathway to efficient spintronic devices with selectable spin polarization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-collinear antiferromagnets (AFMs) are an exciting new platform for studying intrinsic spin Hall effects (SHEs), phenomena that arise from the materials&#8217; band structure, Berry phase curvature, and linear response to an external electric field. In contrast to conventional SHE materials, symmetry analysis of non-collinear antiferromagnets does not forbid non-zero longitudinal and out-of-plane spin currents with x&#770;,z&#770;$\hat{x},\hat{z}$ polarization and predicts an anisotropy with current orientation to the magnetic lattice. Here, multi-component out-of-plane spin Hall conductivities &#963;xzx,$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{x}},$ &#963;xzy,&#963;xzz$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{y}},\ \sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{z}}$ are reported in L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ordered antiferromagnetic PtMn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thin films that are uniquely generated in the non-collinear state. The maximum spin torque efficiencies (&lt;i&gt;&#958;&lt;/i&gt;&#8197; = &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&#8197;/&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&#8197;&#8776; 0.3) are significantly larger than in Pt (&lt;i&gt;&#958;&lt;/i&gt;&#8197; &#8776; &#8197;0.1). Additionally, the spin Hall conductivities in the non-collinear state exhibit the predicted orientation-dependent anisotropy, opening the possibility for new devices with selectable spin polarization.

         <title>Ion&#8211;Dipole Interaction Enabling Highly Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amino naphthalene sulfonates (ANS) molecules are incorporated as a dipolar interlayer at the buried interface to fabricate CsPbI3 perovskite indoor photovoltaics (PIPVs). The strong ion&#8211;dipole interaction between polar ANS molecules and ionic perovskites enables the target PIPVs to deliver a record indoor PCE of up to 41.2% (Pout:137.66&#8201;&#181;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under a standard LED light source (2956&#8201;K, 1062&#8201;lux).








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are ideal candidates for indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) because of their easy&#8208;to&#8208;adjust bandgaps, which can be designed to cover the spectrum of any artificial light source. However, the serious non&#8208;radiative carrier recombination under low light illumination restrains the application of perovskite&#8208;based IPVs (PIPVs). Herein, polar molecules of amino naphthalene sulfonates are employed to functionalize the TiO2 substrate, anchoring the CsPbI3 perovskite crystal grains with a strong ion&#8211;dipole interaction between the molecule&#8208;level polar interlayer and the ionic perovskite film. The resulting high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films with the merit of defect&#8208;immunity and large shunt resistance under low light conditions enable the corresponding PIPVs with an indoor power conversion efficiency of up to 41.2% (Pin: 334.11&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, Pout: 137.66&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) under illumination from a commonly used indoor light&#8208;emitting diode light source (2956 K, 1062 lux). Furthermore, the device also achieves efficiencies of 29.45% (Pout: 9.80&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) and 32.54% (Pout: 54.34&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) at 106 (Pin: 33.84&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) and 522 lux (Pin: 168.21&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2), respectively.

         <title>Engineering of Defective MOF&#8208;801 Nanostructures within Macroporous Spheres for Highly Efficient and Stable Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization of MOF&#8208;801 on the surface of macroporous poly (N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) spheres via a facile in situ confinement growth strategy to easily form smart spherical composite with temperature&#8208;responsive function. The composite is successfully produced in kilogram&#8208;scale. The reduced crystals size and the formation of abundant defects endow the composite with an unprecedented high water&#8208;collection efficiency.








Abstract
Water harvesting using the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;801 is restricted by limited working capacity, powder structuring, and finite stability. To overcome these issues, MOF&#8208;801 is crystallized on the surface of macroporous poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) spheres, called P(NIPAM&#8208;GMA), through an in situ confined growth strategy, forming spherical MOF&#8208;801@P(NIPAM&#8208;GMA) composite with temperature&#8208;responsive function. By lowering the nucleation energy barrier, the average size of the MOF&#8208;801 crystals decreases by 20 times. Thus, abundant defects as adsorption sites for water can be installed in the crystals lattices. As a consequence, the composite provides an unprecedented high water harvesting efficiency. The composite is produced in the kilogram&#8208;scale and can capture 1.60&#160;kg H2O/kg composite/day from 20% relative humidity between 25 and 85&#160;&#176;C. This study provides an effective methodology for improving the adsorption capacity through controlled defects formation as adsorption sites and to improve the kinetics through the design of a composite with macroporous transport channel network.

A series of cyano&#8208;functionalized bithiophene imide dimerbased n&#8208;type polymers are synthesized, featuring good solubility, deep&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels, and favorable polymer chain orientation. By adopting solution&#8208;shearing assisted film&#8208;forming technology, acceptor&#8211;acceptor polymer PCNI2&#8208;BTI delivered a record power factor of 110.3 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2. The study is informative for development of high&#8208;performance organic thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Doped n&#8208;type polymers usually exhibit low electrical conductivities and thermoelectric power factors (PFs), restricting the development of high&#8208;performance p&#8211;n&#8208;junction&#8208;based organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, the design and synthesis of a new cyano&#8208;functionalized fused bithiophene imide dimer (f&#8208;BTI2), CNI2, is reported, which synergistically combines the advantages of both cyano and imide functionalities, thus leading to substantially higher electron deficiency than the parent f&#8208;BTI2. On the basis of this novel building block, a series of n&#8208;type donor&#8211;acceptor and acceptor&#8211;acceptor polymers are successfully synthesized, all of which show good solubility, deep&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels, and favorable polymer chain orientation. Among them, the acceptor&#8211;acceptor polymer PCNI2&#8208;BTI delivers an excellent electrical conductivity up to 150.2&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a highest PF of 110.3&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 in n&#8208;type OTEs, attributed to the optimized polymer electronic properties and film morphology with improved molecular packing and higher crystallinity assisted by solution&#8208;shearing technology. The PF value is the record of n&#8208;type polymers for OTEs to date. This work demonstrates a facile approach to designing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers and fabricating high&#8208;quality films for OTE applications.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Assisted Crystallization Enables Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Quasi&#8208;Monocrystalline Film for High&#8208;Sensitive X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>

A large&#8208;area (10&#8201;cm&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8201;cm) high&#8208;quality quasi&#8208;monocrystalline film (QCF) of mixed&#8208;cation perovskite MA0.42FA0.58PbI3 is achieved via ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization combined with the hot&#8208;pressing method. The device based on MA0.42FA0.58PbI3 QCF reaches an impressively high sensitivity of 1.16&#8201;&#215;&#8201;106 &#181;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low limit of detection of 37.4&#8201;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, demonstrating the high potential toward X&#8208;ray detection and imaging applications.








Abstract
In recent years, halide perovskites have shown great application potential in X&#8208;ray detection due to their superior optoelectronic properties and high X&#8208;ray attenuation coefficient. However, large&#8208;area perovskite fabrication for high performance X&#8208;ray detectors remains extremely challenging. Herein, ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization combined with the hot&#8208;pressing method is proposed to prepare large&#8208;area (10&#160;cm &#215; 10&#160;cm) and high&#8208;quality quasi&#8208;monocrystalline thick film of a mixed&#8208;cation perovskite MA0.42FA0.58PbI3. The rapid ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization provides more homogeneous nucleation, which is essential to the fabrication of large&#8208;area and uniform perovskite microcrystalline film. Furthermore, the post hot&#8208;pressing treatment is implemented to fuse the crystal boundaries, rearrange the crystal grains, and eliminate the voids between crystals, resulting in a quasi&#8208;monocrystalline film. After the hot&#8208;pressing treatment, the carrier mobility and the carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime product increased about 13&#8208;fold (from 1.8 to 23.5 cm2 s&#8722;1 V&#8722;1) and 18 times (from 8.4 &#215; 10&#8722;6 to 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1), respectively. As a result, a high&#8208;performance MA0.42FA0.58PbI3 quasi&#8208;monocrystalline X&#8208;ray detector is achieved with an impressively high sensitivity (1.16 &#215; 106 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and low detection limit (37.4 nGyair s&#8722;1), demonstrating the potential of the ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization and hot&#8208;pressing strategy from an industrial perspective.

         <title>Entering Voltage Hysteresis in Phase&#8208;Separating Materials: Revealing the Electrochemical Signature of the Intraparticle Phase&#8208;Separated State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase&#8208;separating material can feature different potentials at the same bulk lithiation level and temperature when exposed to the same finite current within and outside voltage hysteresis. This fundamental material&#8208;related challenge is interrelated to a newly observed electrochemical signature of the intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state featuring different electrode potential compared to the interparticle phase&#8208;separated state.








Abstract
Hysteresis is a general phenomenon regularly observed in various materials. Usually, hysteretic behavior is an intrinsic property that cannot be circumvented in the nonequilibrium operation of the system. Herein, it is shown that, at least with regard to the hysteretic behavior of phase&#8208;separating battery materials, it is possible to enter (deeply) the hysteretic loop at finite battery currents. This newly observed electric response of the electrode, which is inherent to phase&#8208;separating materials, is related to its microscopic origin arising from a (significant) share of the active material residing in an intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state. This intriguing observation is further generalized by revealing that a phase&#8208;separating material can feature (significantly) different chemical potentials at the same bulk lithiation level and temperature when exposed to the same finite current and external voltage hysteresis. Therefore, the intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state significantly affects the DC and AC characteristics of the battery. The experimental evidence for entering the intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state is supported by thermodynamic reasoning and advanced modeling. The current findings will help advance the understanding, control, diagnostics, and monitoring of batteries composed of phase&#8208;separating materials while also providing pertinent motivation for the enhancement of battery design and performance.

         <title>Near&#8208;Theoretical Thermal Conductivity Silver Nanoflakes as Reinforcements in Gap&#8208;Filling Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Ag nanoflakes with intrinsic thermal conductivity (398.2&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) close to theoretical value are prepared using the &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; method. After directly blending with epoxy (18.6 vol%) without any complex surface modification, hybridization, and structural design, the interfacial heat&#8208;transfer efficiency of the obtained gap&#8208;filling adhesive is &#8776;1.4 times that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art counterpart.








Abstract
The rapid development of highly integrated microelectronic devices causes urgent demands for advanced thermally conductive adhesives (TCAs) to solve the interfacial heat&#8208;transfer issue. Due to their natural 2D structure and isotropic thermal conductivity, metal nanoflakes are promising fillers blended with polymer to develop high&#8208;performance TCAs. However, achieving corresponding TCAs with thermal conductivity over 10&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at filler content below 30 vol% remains challenging so far. This longstanding bottleneck is mainly attributed to the fact that most current metal nanoflakes are prepared by &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; processes (e.g., solution&#8208;based chemical synthesis) and inevitably contain lattice defects or impurities, resulting in lower intrinsic thermal conductivities, only 20&#8211;65% of the theoretical value. Here, a &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; strategy by splitting highly purified Ag foil with nanoscale thickness is adopted to prepare 2D Ag nanoflakes with an intrinsic thermal conductivity of 398.2&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, reaching 93% of the theoretical value. After directly blending with epoxy, the resultant Ag/epoxy exhibits a thermal conductivity of 15.1&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at low filler content of 18.6 vol%. Additionally, in practical microelectronic cooling performance evaluations, the interfacial heat&#8208;transfer efficiency of the Ag/epoxy achieves &#8776;1.4 times that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial TCA.

         <title>Immunostimulatory DNA Hydrogel Enhances Protective Efficacy of Nanotoxoids against Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanotoxoids formulated against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus are embedded into an immunostimulatory DNA hydrogel. When used to vaccinate mice, the resulting nanoparticle&#8211;hydrogel composite effectively elicits antigen&#8208;specific humoral and cellular immune responses. This enhanced immunity enables strong protection against live bacterial infection in models of pneumonia and skin infection.








Abstract
While vaccines have been highly successful in protecting against various infections, there are still many high&#8208;priority pathogens for which there are no clinically approved formulations. To overcome this challenge, researchers have explored the use of nanoparticulate strategies for more effective antigen delivery to the immune system. Along these lines, nanotoxoids are a promising biomimetic platform that leverages cell membrane coating technology to safely deliver otherwise toxic bacterial antigens in their native form for antivirulence vaccination. Here, in order to further boost their immunogenicity, nanotoxoids formulated against staphylococcal &#945;&#8208;hemolysin are embedded into a DNA&#8208;based hydrogel with immunostimulatory CpG motifs. The resulting nanoparticle&#8211;hydrogel composite is injectable and improves the in vivo delivery of vaccine antigens while simultaneously stimulating nearby immune cells. This leads to elevated antibody production and stronger antigen&#8208;specific cellular immune responses. In murine models of pneumonia and skin infection caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, mice vaccinated with the hybrid vaccine formulation are well&#8208;protected.

     alt="Immunostimulatory DNA Hydrogel Enhances Protective Efficacy of Nanotoxoids against Bacterial Infection"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanotoxoids formulated against methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; are embedded into an immunostimulatory DNA hydrogel. When used to vaccinate mice, the resulting nanoparticle&#8211;hydrogel composite effectively elicits antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. This enhanced immunity enables strong protection against live bacterial infection in models of pneumonia and skin infection.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While vaccines have been highly successful in protecting against various infections, there are still many high-priority pathogens for which there are no clinically approved formulations. To overcome this challenge, researchers have explored the use of nanoparticulate strategies for more effective antigen delivery to the immune system. Along these lines, nanotoxoids are a promising biomimetic platform that leverages cell membrane coating technology to safely deliver otherwise toxic bacterial antigens in their native form for antivirulence vaccination. Here, in order to further boost their immunogenicity, nanotoxoids formulated against staphylococcal &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-hemolysin are embedded into a DNA-based hydrogel with immunostimulatory CpG motifs. The resulting nanoparticle&#8211;hydrogel composite is injectable and improves the in vivo delivery of vaccine antigens while simultaneously stimulating nearby immune cells. This leads to elevated antibody production and stronger antigen-specific cellular immune responses. In murine models of pneumonia and skin infection caused by methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, mice vaccinated with the hybrid vaccine formulation are well-protected. This work highlights the benefits of combining nanoparticulate antigen delivery systems with immunostimulatory hydrogels into a single platform, and the approach can be readily generalized to a wide range of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Degeneracy Removal of Spin Bands in Collinear Antiferromagnets with Non&#8208;Interconvertible Spin&#8208;Structure Motif Pair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy bands in antiferromagnets with compensated magnetization are expected to maintain spin degeneracy without spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC). In this work, collinear antiferromagnets with a spin&#8208;structure motif pair are shown,whose components cannot be interconverted by certain spatial transformation; these will show spin splitting. Such a motif&#8208;based rule allows easy discerning of spin&#8208;split antiferromagnets from conventional spin&#8208;degenerate antiferromagnets.








Abstract
Energy bands in antiferromagnets are supposed to be spin degenerate in the absence of spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC). Recent studies have identified formal symmetry conditions for antiferromagnetic crystals in which this degeneracy can be lifted, spin splitting,even in the vanishing SOC (i.e., non&#8208;relativistic) limit. Materials having such symmetries could enable spin&#8208;split antiferromagnetic spintronics without the burden of using heavy&#8208;atom compounds. However, the symmetry conditions that involve spin and magnetic symmetry are not always effective as practical material selection filters. Furthermore, these symmetry conditions do not readily disclose trends in the magnitude and momentum dependence of the spin&#8208;splitting energy. Here, it is shown that the formal symmetry conditions enabling spin&#8208;split antiferromagnets can be interpreted in terms of local motif pairs, such as octahedra or tetrahedra, each carrying opposite magnetic moments. Collinear antiferromagnets with such a spin&#8208;structure motif pair, whose components interconvert by neither translation nor spatial inversion, will show spin splitting. Such a real&#8208;space motif&#8208;based approach enables an easy way to identify and design materials (illustrated in real example materials) having spin splitting without the need for SOC, and offers insights into the momentum dependence and magnitude of the spin splitting.

         <title>Data&#8208;Class&#8208;Specific All&#8208;Optical Transformations and Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Data&#8208;class&#8208;specific all&#8208;optical transformations are achieved using a diffractive neural network that is designed by deep learning. Experimentally validated at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including near&#8208;infrared and terahertz wavelengths, these class&#8208;specific diffractive optical processors provide a fast and energy&#8208;efficient method for image and data encryption, enhancing data security and privacy.








Abstract
Diffractive optical networks provide rich opportunities for visual computing tasks. Here, data&#8208;class&#8208;specific transformations that are all&#8208;optically performed between the input and output fields&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOVs) of a diffractive network are presented. The visual information of the objects is encoded into the amplitude (A), phase (P), or intensity (I) of the optical field at the input, which is all&#8208;optically processed by a data&#8208;class&#8208;specific diffractive network. At the output, an image sensor&#8208;array directly measures the transformed patterns, all&#8208;optically encrypted using the transformation matrices preassigned to different data classes, i.e., a separate matrix for each data class. The original input images can be recovered by applying the correct decryption key (the inverse transformation) corresponding to the matching data class, while applying any other key will lead to loss of information. All&#8208;optical class&#8208;specific transformations covering A &#8594; A, I &#8594; I, and P &#8594; I transformations using various image datasets are numerically demonstrated. The feasibility of this framework is also experimentally validated by fabricating class&#8208;specific I &#8594; I transformation diffractive networks and is successfully tested at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e., 1550 nm and 0.75 mm wavelengths. Data&#8208;class&#8208;specific all&#8208;optical transformations provide a fast and energy&#8208;efficient method for image and data encryption, enhancing data security and privacy.

         <title>Continuous Room&#8208;Temperature Spin&#8208;Injection Modulation Achieved by Spin&#8208;Filtering Competition in Molecular Spin Valves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative spin&#8208;filtering competition strategy is introduced to realize continuous and room&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;injection modulation in molecular spin valves. By precisely controlling the competition, the spin polarization and the magnetoresistance effect can be actively tuned or the sign can even be reversed. Both the experimental and calculation results further enrich the theory of spintronics and may bring novel functionalities.








Abstract
Abundant spin&#8208;related phenomena that originate from interfaces between ferromagnetic electrodes and molecular semiconductors have greatly enriched research in spintronics, and they are considered promising for realizing novel spintronic functionalities in the future. However, despite great effort, the interfacial effect cannot be precisely controlled to achieve steady and predictable functions, especially at room temperature, and this has gradually become a significant bottleneck in the development of molecular spintronics. In this study, an innovative spin&#8208;filtering&#8208;competition mechanism is proposed to continuously modulate the interfacial effect in molecular spin valves at room temperature. To form this novel mechanism, the original spin&#8208;filtering effect from pure cobalt competes with the newly generated one, which is induced by the bonding effect between cobalt and lithium fluoride. Subsequently, by precisely controlling competition through lithium fluoride coverage on the cobalt surface, continuous modulation of the spin&#8208;injection process can be successfully achieved at room temperature. Spin polarization of the injected current and magnetoresistance effect can be actively controlled or their sign can be completely reversed through this novel mechanism. This study provides an innovative approach and theory for precisely controlling spin&#8208;related interfacial effects, which may further promote the scientific and technological development of spintronics.

         <title>Ultracoherent Single&#8208;Electron Emission of Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double barrier structure is demonstrated to form at the carbon nanotube tip, evidenced by a staircase&#8208;like field&#8208;emission curve with equidistant conductance peaks. This enables single&#8208;electron emission with a large current of 1.5&#160;nA, ultralow energy spread of &#8776;10&#160;meV, and ultrasmall effective source radius of &#8776;0.85&#160;nm, paving the way to atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and sub&#8208;10&#160;nm electron beam lithography.








Abstract
A single&#8208;electron emitter, based on a single quantized energy level, can potentially achieve ultimate temporal and spatial coherence with a large emission current, which is desirable for atomic&#8208;resolution electron probes. This is first developed by constructing a nano&#8208;object on a metal tip to form a quantized double barrier structure. However, the single&#8208;electron&#8208;emission current can only achieve a picoampere level due to the low electron tunneling rate of the heterojunction with large barrier width, which limits the practical applications. In this study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) serve as a single&#8208;electron emitter and a current up to 1.5&#160;nA is demonstrated. The double barrier structure formed on the CNT tip enables a high tunneling rate (&#8776;1012&#160;s&#8722;1) due to the smaller barrier width. The emitter also shows high temporal coherence (energy dispersion of &#8776;10&#160;meV) and spatial coherence (effective source radius of &#8776;0.85&#160;nm). This work represents a highly coherent electron source to simplify the electron optics system of atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and sub&#8208;10&#160;nm electron beam lithography.

         <title>Exchange&#8208;Biased Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is realized in the magnetic topological insulator Cr&#8208;BST grown on an uncompensated antiferromagnetic insulator Al&#8208;doped Cr2O3. A strong exchange coupling is found to fix interfacial magnetic moments perpendicular and cause an exchange biased QAH effect. The magnitude and sign of the exchange bias are further shown to be controlled by a field training process.








Abstract
The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is characterized by a dissipationless chiral edge state with a quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field. Manipulating the QAH state is of great importance in both the understanding of topological quantum physics and the implementation of dissipationless electronics. Here, the QAH effect is realized in the magnetic topological insulator Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (CBST) grown on an uncompensated antiferromagnetic insulator Al&#8208;doped Cr2O3. Through polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR), a strong exchange coupling is found between CBST and Al&#8208;Cr2O3 surface spins fixing interfacial magnetic moments perpendicular to the film plane. The interfacial coupling results in an exchange&#8208;biased QAH effect. This study further demonstrates that the magnitude and sign of the exchange bias can be effectively controlled using a field training process to set the magnetization of the Al&#8208;Cr2O3 layer. It demonstrates the use of the exchange bias effect to effectively manipulate the QAH state, opening new possibilities in QAH&#8208;based spintronics.

         <title>Laser Derived Electron Transport Layers with Embedded p&#8211;n Heterointerfaces Enabling Planar Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 25%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Present work demonstrates an efficient strategy of the particle boundaries (PBs) embedding of multifunctional p&#8208;type semiconducting CdTe nanocrystals for inhibited carrier losses at PBs, which can serve as efficient PBs mediator for boosting the electrons mobility of TiO2 ETL by maximally three orders of magnitude and consequently result in a new benchmark PCE over 25% in planar PSCs.








Abstract
Electron transport layers (ETLs) with pronounced electron conducting capability are essential for high performance planar perovskite photovoltaics, with the great challenge being that the most widely used metal oxide ETLs unfortunately have intrinsically low carrier mobility. Herein is demonstrated that by simply addressing the carrier loss at particle boundaries of TiO2 ETLs, through embedding in ETL p&#8211;n heterointerfaces, the electron mobility of the ETLs can be boosted by three orders of magnitude. Such embedding is encouragingly favorable for both inhibiting the formation of rutile phase TiO2 in ETL, and initiating the growth of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with less defect states. By virtue of these merits, creation of formamidinium lead iodide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a champion efficiency of 25.05% is achieved, setting a new benchmark for planar PSCs employing TiO2 ETLs. Unencapsulated PSCs deliver much&#8208;improved environmental stability, i.e., more than 80% of their initial efficiency after 9000 h of air storage under RH of 40%, and over 90% of their initial efficiency at maximum power point under continuous illumination for 500 h. Further work exploring other p&#8208;type nanocrystals for embedding warrants the proposed strategy as a universal alternative for addressing the low&#8208;carrier mobility of metal oxide based ETLs.

         <title>Life&#8208;Cycle Assessment of Ti3C2Tx MXene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A life&#8208;cycle assessment (LCA) of Ti3C2Tx MXene as an EMI&#8208;shielding coating is presented. MXene synthesis, including laboratory&#8208;scale systems and precursor generation utilizing TiO2, is examined for energy demand and environmental impacts. Findings demonstrate that laboratory electricity usage has the greatest impact on MXene production. Sustainable MXene synthesis toward the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of this intriguing 2D material is discussed.








Abstract
MXenes, 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have been investigated for diverse applications since their discovery; however, their life&#8208;cycle assessment (LCA) has not been studied. Here, a &#8220;cradle to gate&#8221; LCA is performed to assess the cumulative energy demand (CED) and environmental impacts of lab&#8208;scale synthesis of Ti3C2Tx, the most researched MXene composition. Electromagnetic interface (EMI) shielding is selected as it is one of MXenes' most promising applications and LCA of Ti3C2Tx synthesis is compared to aluminum and copper foils, two typical EMI&#8208;shielding materials. Two laboratory&#8208;scale MXene synthesis systems&#8212;gram and kilogram batches&#8212;are examined. The CED and environmental implications of Ti3C2Tx synthesis are investigated based on its precursor production, selective etching, delamination processes, laboratory location, energy mix, and raw material type. These&#160;results show that laboratory electricity usage for the synthesis processes accounts for &gt;70% of the environmental impacts. Manufacturing 1.0&#160;kg of industrial&#8208;scale aluminum and copper foil releases 23.0&#160;kg and 8.75&#160;kg of CO2, respectively, while 1.0&#160;kg of lab&#8208;scale MXene synthesis releases 428.10&#160;kg. Chemical usage is less impactful than electricity, which suggests that&#160;recycled resources and renewable energy can make MXene synthesis more sustainable. Understanding MXene LCA helps the industrialization of this material.

         <title>Achieving Highly Proton&#8208;Resistant Zn&#8211;Pb Anode through Low Hydrogen Affinity and Strong Bonding for Long&#8208;Life Electrolytic Zn//MnO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pb&#8208;containing interface and Pb layer constructed in situ on a Zn substrate and Zn plating layer provide all&#8208;around protection for stable Zn anodes. Benefiting from the low H+ affinity and strong bonding, they show high hydrogen evolution corrosion resistance. Based on this, an electrolytic Zn//MnO2 battery achieves long&#8208;term cycling stability and ultra&#8208;high energy density in an acidic electrolyte.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy electrolytic Zn//MnO2 batteries show potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, but the severe hydrogen evolution corrosion (HEC) caused by acidic electrolytes results in subdued durability. Here, an all&#8208;around protection strategy is reported for achieving stable Zn metal anodes. First, a proton&#8208;resistant Pb&#8208;containing (Pb and Pb(OH)2) interface is constructed on a Zn anode (denoted as Zn@Pb), which in situ forms PbSO4 during H2SO4 corrosion and protects the Zn substrate from HEC. Second, to improve the plating/stripping reversibility of Zn@Pb, Pb(CH3COO)2 an additive (denoted as Zn@Pb&#8208;Ad) is introduced, which triggers PbSO4 precipitation and releases trace Pb2+ that can dynamically deposit a Pb layer on the Zn plating layer to suppress HEC. The superior HEC resistance stems from the low affinity of PbSO4 and Pb for H+, as well as strong bonding between Pb&#8211;Zn or Pb&#8211;Pb, which increase the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential and the H+ corrosion energy barrier. Consequently, the Zn@Pb&#8208;Ad//MnO2 battery runs stably for 630 and 795&#160;h in 0.2 and 0.1&#160;m H2SO4 electrolytes, respectively, which are &gt;40 times better than that of bare Zn. The as&#8208;prepared A h&#8208;level battery achieves a one&#8208;month calendar life, opening the door to the next generation of high&#8208;durable grid&#8208;scale Zn batteries.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom and Hierarchical&#8208;Pore Aerogel Confinement Strategy for Low&#8208;Platinum Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom and hierarchical&#8208;pore aerogels are used to support intermetallic ordered Pt alloys as oxygen&#8208;reduction&#8208;reaction catalysts for low Pt fuel cells, which can not only substantially reduce oxygen&#8208;related mass&#8208;transport resistance but also has long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
Achieving high catalytic performance through the lowest possible content of platinum (Pt) is the key to cost reduction of proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, lowering the Pt loading in PEMFCs leads to the high mass&#8208;transport resistance of oxygen originating from the limited active sites, and causes less stability of the catalysts due to Pt size growth after long&#8208;time operation. Herein, Pt&#8211;metal/metal&#8211;N&#8211;C aerogel catalysts are designed that substantially reduce oxygen&#8208;related mass transport resistance and have long&#8208;term durability. The tailoring of the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C aerogel support with hierarchical and interconnecting pores enable a low local oxygen transport resistance (0.18 s cm&#8722;1) for PEMFCs with ultralow Pt loading (50 &#177; 5 &#181;gPt cm&#8722;2). Chemical confinement of Fe&#9472;N sites ensures high stability of the loaded&#8208;Pt both in the processes of synthesis up to 1000 &#176;C and practical application in PEMFCs. The ultralow Pt PEMFC displays a low voltage loss of 8 mV at 0.80 A cm&#8722;2 and unchanged electrochemical surface area after 60 000 cycles of accelerated durability testing. The allying of the hierarchical pores, the aerogel, and the single atoms can fully reflect their structural advantages and expand the understanding for the synthesis of advanced fuel cell PEMFCs catalysts.

         <title>Atomically Unraveling the Structural Evolution of Surfaces and Interfaces in Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic imaging of bulk and local structures of CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs) by integrated differential&#8208;phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy is reported. Particularly, the changes in the surface and interface under various external conditions are revealed. The density functional theory calculations are also carried out to explain the relationship between structure and property of CsPbI3 QDs.








Abstract
Revealing the local structural change of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) induced by external conditions is important to understand its performance and stability in optoelectronic applications. However, previous studies on the properties and structures of MHPs are usually limited by the spatial resolution of the probe, and it is still challenging to obtain its atomic structural information in real space. In this work, the integrated differential&#8208;phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy is applied to the low&#8208;dose imaging of CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs). In particular, the local structures in QDs, such as surfaces and interfaces, can be atomically resolved. Then, the structural evolution of CsPbI3 QDs under various external conditions can be unraveled during in situ heating or ex situ treatments, where it lose cubic shapes and fuse to larger particles. The changes in surfaces and interfaces with missing Cs ions and PbI6 octahedrons can be semi&#8208;quantitatively studied by profile analysis and bond&#8208;length measurement in images. Finally, density functional theory calculations are performed to illustrate the properties and stabilities of the different structures that are observed. These results provide atomic&#8208;scale insights into the structural evolution of QDs, which is of great importance to modify the performance of perovskite materials and devices.

         <title>Epoxy Adhesives with Reversible Hardeners: Controllable Thermal Debonding in Bulk and at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of on&#8208;demand debondable epoxy adhesives showing fast debonding, while staying stable until high temperatures, is reported. In this context, two types of dynamic polyamidoamine curing agents are synthesized and their versatility is demonstrated in classical bulk adhesive formulations, as well as in dynamic covalent linking to functionalized surfaces.








Abstract
On&#8208;demand adhesive dismantling has the potential to improve multimaterial product recycling, but its implementation has been hampered by a critical trade&#8208;off between strong bonding and easy debonding. As a result, the temperature range in which these temporary adhesives can be used is relatively limited. Here, a new class of dynamic epoxy resins is reported that significantly extends this upper temperature limit and still achieves fast debonding. Specifically, two types of dynamic polyamidoamine curing agents for epoxy hardening are&#160;developed, being polysuccinamides (PSA) and polyglutaramides (PGA). As the dynamic debonding/rebonding process of PSA and especially PGA linkages is more thermally demanding and at the same time more thermally robust than previously reported dynamic covalent systems, the resulting materials can be triggered at high temperatures, and at the same time remain bonded over a wide temperature range. The versatility of the PSA and PGA dynamic adhesive curing system is&#160;demonstrated in classical bulk adhesive formulations, as well as in dynamic covalent linking to a PSA&#8208; or PGA&#8208;functionalized surface. As a result, an attractive drop&#8208;in strategy is&#160;achieved for producing debondable and rebondable epoxy adhesives, with high complementarity to existing adhesive resin technologies and applicable in an industrially relevant temperature window.

Fe93.5Si6.5 (wt%) toroidal cores with tailored structures fabricated by electron beam powder bed fusion using specifically developed hatching strategies (i.e., radial hatching and circle hatching) show promising magnetic properties (i.e., low power losses&#160;and high maximum magnetic flux density), outperforming some soft magnetic materials produced by conventional techniques and laser powder bed fusion.








Abstract
Fe93.5Si6.5 (wt%) soft magnetic materials in toroidal shape are additively manufactured by means of electron beam powder bed fusion (PBF&#8208;EB). Different hatching strategies are applied to realize specific patterns of molten material alternating with non&#8208;molten powder particles. The specimens produced using different hatching strategies show identical relative densities but various structural features resulting in different magnetic properties. The magnetic performance of the specimens is characterized by determining hysteresis loops (B&#8211;H curves), power losses, and maximum magnetic flux density at frequencies between 50 and 1000&#160;Hz. At constant mass, the different structures induced by using various hatching strategies have a strong influence on the hysteresis losses. These losses can be significantly reduced by applying a targeted structure design. The modified specimens show superior magnetic properties at sub&#8208;kHz compared to some soft magnetic materials fabricated by means of conventional methods and laser powder bed fusion (PBF&#8208;L).

         <title>Carbonization&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Dependent Electrical Properties of Carbon Nanofibers&#8212;From Nanoscale to Macroscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscopic electrical analysis of carbon nanofiber (CNF) networks reveals a homogeneous current distribution. However, high&#8208;resolution analysis of individual fibers exhibits heterogeneities. A significant CNF surface fraction is highly resistive, representing a severe limitation for the overall conductivity. The conductive surface domains of individual fibers increase with raising carbonization temperature. Microscopic and macroscopic electrical behavior correlates strongly.








Abstract
An exact understanding of the conductivity of individual fibers and their networks is crucial to tailor the overall macroscopic properties of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)&#8208;based carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Therefore, microelectrical properties of CNF networks and nanoelectrical properties of individual CNFs, carbonized at temperatures from 600 to 1000 &#176;C, are studied by means of conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM).

     alt="Carbonization-Temperature-Dependent Electrical Properties of Carbon Nanofibers&#8212;From Nanoscale to Macroscale"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microscopic electrical analysis of carbon nanofiber (CNF) networks reveals a homogeneous current distribution. However, high-resolution analysis of individual fibers exhibits heterogeneities. A significant CNF surface fraction is highly resistive, representing a severe limitation for the overall conductivity. The conductive surface domains of individual fibers increase with raising carbonization temperature. Microscopic and macroscopic electrical behavior correlates strongly.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exact understanding of the conductivity of individual fibers and their networks is crucial to tailor the overall macroscopic properties of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Therefore, microelectrical properties of CNF networks and nanoelectrical properties of individual CNFs, carbonized at temperatures from 600 to 1000 &#176;C, are studied by means of conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM). At the microscale, the CNF networks show good electrical interconnections enabling a homogeneously distributed current flow. The network's homogeneity is underlined by the strong correlation of macroscopic conductivities, determined by the four-point-method, and microscopic results. Both, microscopic and macroscopic electrical properties, solely depend on the carbonization temperature and the exact resulting fiber structure. Strikingly, nanoscale high-resolution current maps of individual CNFs reveal a large highly resistive surface fraction, representing a clear limitation. Highly resistive surface domains are either attributed to disordered highly resistive carbon structures at the surface or the absence of electron percolation paths in the bulk volume. With increased carbonization temperature, the conductive surface domains grow in size resulting in a higher conductivity. This work contributes to existing microstructural models of CNFs by extending them by electrical properties, especially electron percolation paths.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Periodic and Aperiodic NiFe Nanomagnet/Ferrimagnet Hybrid Structures for 2D Magnon Steering and Interferometry with High Extinction Ratio</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Periodic and aperiodic NiFe nanopillars with engineered resonances excite magnons down to 49 nm wavelength in underlying yttrium iron garnet when irradiated by GHz signals. Multidirectional steering and interferometry of coherently scattered magnons between three coplanar waveguides provide record extinction ratios over macroscopic distances. The properties are key to establish efficient magnon&#8208;based computing and nanoscale neural networks.








Abstract
Magnons, quanta of spin waves, are known to enable information processing with low power consumption at the nanoscale. So far, however, experimentally realized half&#8208;adders, wave&#8208;logic, and binary output operations are based on few &#181;m&#8208;long spin waves and restricted to one spatial direction. Here, magnons with wavelengths &#955; down to 50 nm in ferrimagnetic Y3Fe5O12 below 2D lattices of periodic and aperiodic ferromagnetic nanopillars are explored. Due to their high rotational symmetries and engineered magnetic resonances, the lattices allow short&#8208;wave magnons to propagate in arbitrarily chosen on&#8208;chip directions when excited by conventional coplanar waveguides. Performing interferometry with magnons over macroscopic distances of 350 &#215; &#955; without loss of coherency, unprecedentedly high extinction ratios of up to 26 (&#177;8) dB [31 (&#177;2) dB] for a binary 1/0 output operation at &#955; = 69&#160;nm (&#955; = 154&#160;nm) are achieved in this work. The reported findings and design criteria for 2D magnon interferometry are particularly important in view of the realization of complex neuronal networks recently proposed for interfering spin waves underneath&#160;nanomagnets.

         <title>A &#960;&#8208;Bridge Spacer Embedded Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Polymer for Flexible Electrochromic Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>

A &#8220;&#960;&#8208;bridge spacer&#8221;&#8208;embedded electron donor&#8211;acceptor polymer cathode combined with Zn2+&#8211;ion&#8208;conducting gel electrolyte is proposed for a smart and flexible Zn&#8211;ion batteries to provide high electrochromic&#8211;electrochemical performances. The &#960;&#8208;bridge spacer endows the polymeric skeleton with improved physical ion accessibility and sensitive charge transfer through the charging&#8211;discharging cycles, providing extremely stable cyclability with high specific capacity.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;ion batteries (ZIBs) have drawn much attention for next&#8208;generation energy storage for smart and wearable electronics due to their high theoretical gravimetric/volumetric energy capacities, safety from explosive hazards, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZIBs lack the energy capacity necessary to facilitate smart functionalities for intelligent electronics. In this work, a &#8220;&#960;&#8208;bridge spacer&#8221;&#8208;embedded electron donor&#8211;acceptor polymer cathode combined with a Zn2+&#8211;ion&#8208;conducting electrolyte is proposed for a smart and flexible ZIB to provide high electrochromic&#8211;electrochemical performances. The &#960;&#8208;bridge spacer endows the polymeric skeleton with improved physical ion accessibility and sensitive charge transfer through&#160;the cycles, providing extremely stable cyclability with high specific capacity (110 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) at very fast rates (8 A&#160;g&#8722;1) and large coloration efficiency (79.8 cm2&#160;C&#8722;1) under severe mechanical deformation over a long period. These results are markedly outstanding compared to the topological analogue without the &#960;&#8208;bridge spacer (80 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at current density of 8 A&#160;g&#8722;1, 63.0 cm2&#160;C&#8722;1). The design to incorporate a &#960;&#8208;bridge spacer realizes notable electrochromism behaviors and high electrochemical performance, which sheds light on the rational development of multifunctional flexible&#8208;ZIBs with color visualization properties for widespread usage in powering smart electronics.

         <title>Surface Restructuring of Zeolite&#8208;Encapsulated Halide Perovskite to Activate Lattice Oxygen Oxidation for Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MAPbX3 nanocrystals confined in zeolite are the first application to efficient oxygen electrocatalysis in aqueous solution via host&#8211;guest assembly. The absence of phase segregation and halide migration in halide perovskite MAPbBr3 results in markedly improved diffusion of OH&#8722; ions and ultimately leads to the optimal OER activity of MAPbBr3@AlPO&#8208;5 composite.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites possess great potential for electrochemical water splitting that has not been realized due to their intolerance to water. Here, methylammonium lead halide perovskites (MAPbX3) are used to electrocatalyze water oxidation in aqueous electrolytes by creating MAPbX3@AlPO&#8208;5 host&#8211;guest composites. Due to the protective feature of the zeolite matrix, halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) confined in aluminophosphate AlPO&#8208;5 zeolites achieve an excellent stability in water. The resultant electrocatalyst undergoes dynamic surface restructuring during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the formation of an edge&#8208;sharing &#945;&#8208;PbO2 active layer. The existence of charge&#8208;transfer interactions at the MAPbX3/&#945;&#8208;PbO2 interface significantly modulates the surface electron density of the &#945;&#8208;PbO2 and optimizes the adsorption free energy of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediate species. Furthermore, the soft&#8208;lattice nature of halide perovskites enables more facile triggering of lattice&#8208;oxygen oxidation of nanostructured &#945;&#8208;PbO2, exhibiting pH&#8208;dependent OER activity and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer for MAPbX3@AlPO&#8208;5 composite. As a result, the developed MAPbBr3@AlPO&#8208;5 composite manifests an ultralow overpotential of 233&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;m KOH. These findings offer facile access to halide perovskite applied to water electrolysis with enhanced intrinsic activity, providing a new paradigm for designing high&#8208;efficiency OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Supramolecular Photothermal Cascade Nano&#8208;Reactor Enables Photothermal Effect, Cascade Reaction, and In Situ Hydrogelation for Biofilm&#8208;Associated Tooth&#8208;Extraction Wound Healing</title>

         <dc:description>
A supramolecular photothermal cascade nano&#8208;reactor is constructed through a facile and efficient strategy. The supramolecular photothermal cascade reactor can realize synergistic antibacterial therapy. Moreover, combined with the process of hydrogelation in situ initiated by the cascade reaction, the supramolecular photothermal cascade reaction system is applied to treat infection in tooth&#8208;extraction wounds, significantly promoting the wound healing process.








Abstract
Due to the emergence of drug resistance in bacteria and biofilm protection, achieving a satisfactory therapeutic effect for bacteria&#8208;infected open wounds with conventional measures is problematic. Here, a photothermal cascade nano&#8208;reactor (CPNC@GOx&#8208;Fe2+) is constructed through a supramolecular strategy through hydrogen bonding and coordination interactions between chitosan&#8208;modified palladium nano&#8208;cube (CPNC), glucose oxidase (GOx), and ferrous iron (Fe2+). CPNC@GOx&#8208;Fe2+ exhibits excellent photothermal effects and powers the GOx&#8208;assisted cascade reaction to generate hydroxyl radicals, enabling photothermal and chemodynamic combination therapy against bacteria and biofilms. Further proteomics, metabolomics, and all&#8208;atom simulation results indicate that the damage of the hydroxyl radical to the function and structure of the cell membrane and the thermal effect enhance the fluidity and inhomogeneity of the bacterial cell membrane, resulting in the synergistic antibacterial effect. In the biofilm&#8208;associated tooth extraction wound model, the hydroxyl radical generated from the cascade reaction process can initiate the radical polymerization process to form a hydrogel in situ for wound protection. In vivo experiments confirm that synergistic antibacterial and wound protection can accelerate the healing of infected tooth&#8208;extraction wounds without affecting the oral commensal microbiota. This study provides a way to propose a multifunctional supramolecular system for the treatment of open wound infection.

         <title>Video&#8208;Rate Switching of High&#8208;Reflectivity Hybrid Cavities Spanning All Primary Colors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid nanocavities are utilized as tunable color pixels to generate high reflectance (&gt;40%) colors while retaining video refresh rates and energy consumption far below all existing display technologies.








Abstract
Dynamically tunable reflective structural colors are attractive for reflective displays (electronic paper). However, it is challenging to tune a thin layer of structural color across the full red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) basis set of colors at video rates and with long&#8208;term stability. In this work, this is achieved through a hybrid cavity built from metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal (MIM) &#8220;nanocaves&#8221; and an electrochromic polymer (PProDOTMe2). The reflective colors are modulated by electrochemically doping/dedoping the polymer. Compared with traditional subpixel&#8208;based systems, this hybrid structure provides high reflectivity (&gt;40%) due to its &#8220;monopixel&#8221; nature and switches at video rates. The polymer bistability helps deliver ultralow power consumption (&#8776;2.5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) for video display applications and negligible consumption (&#8776;3&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) for static images, compatible with fully photovoltaic powering. In addition, the color uniformity of the hybrid material is excellent (over cm&#8722;2) and the scalable fabrication enables large&#8208;area production.

         <title>Renally Clearable Ultraminiature Chain&#8208;Like Gold Nanoparticle Clusters for Multimodal Molecular Imaging of Choroidal Neovascularization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind multifunctional ultraminiature chain&#8208;like gold nanoparticle clusters (GNCs) are developed via self&#8208;assembly of 7&#8211;8&#160;nm spherical GNP monomers, the GNCs provides redshifted optical absorption and scattering contrasts in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) window which is highly desired by optical imaging modalities such as photoacoustic (PA) imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT). After disassembly, the GNCs turn back into ultraminiature GNPs with a size smaller than the renal glomerular filtration size cutoff, allowing them to be excreted via urine instead of being trapped in the liver and spleen. Renally clearable ultraminiature GNCs facilitate long&#8208;term multimodal molecular imaging of choroidal neovascularization in vivo.








Abstract
Currently, available gold nanoparticles (GNPs) typically accumulate in the liver and spleen, leading to concerns for their long&#8208;term biosafety. To address this long&#8208;standing problem, ultraminiature chain&#8208;like gold nanoparticle clusters (GNCs) are developed. Via self&#8208;assembly of 7&#8211;8&#160;nm GNP monomers, GNCs provide redshifted optical absorption and scattering contrast in the near&#8208;infrared window. After disassembly, GNCs turn back to GNPs with a size smaller than the renal glomerular filtration size cutoff, allowing their&#160;excretion via urine. A one&#8208;month longitudinal study in a rabbit eye model demonstrates that GNCs facilitate multimodal molecular imaging of choroidal neovascularization (CNV)&#160;in vivo, non&#8208;invasively, with excellent sensitivity and spatial resolution. GNCs targeting &#945;v&#946;3&#160;integrins enhance photoacoustic and optical coherence tomography (OCT) signals from CNV by 25.3&#8208;fold and 150%, respectively. With excellent biosafety and biocompatibility demonstrated,&#160;GNCs render a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind nanoplatform for biomedical imaging.

         <title>NiSi: A New Venue for Antiferromagnetic Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of high&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetism in NiSi with TN &#10878; 700 K is reported. The antiferromagnetism is accompanied by a small uncompensated ferromagnetic component, which can be independently tuned by a small magnetic field, resulting in a one&#8208;step magnetic switching transition. Thus, a new venue for spintronics research is envisaged in this technologically important material.








Abstract
Envisaging antiferromagnetic spintronics pivots on two key criteria of high transition temperature and tuning of underlying magnetic order using straightforward application of magnetic field or electric current. Here, it is shown that NiSi metal can provide suitable new platform in this quest. First, the study unveils high&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetism in single&#8208;crystal NiSi with N&#233;el temperature, TN &#10878; 700 K. Antiferromagnetic order in NiSi is accompanied by non&#8208;centrosymmetric magnetic character with small ferromagnetic component in the a&#8211;c plane. Second, it is found that NiSi manifests distinct magnetic and electronic hysteresis responses to field applications due to the disparity in two moment directions. While magnetic hysteresis is characterized by one&#8208;step switching between ferromagnetic states of uncompensated moment, electronic behavior is ascribed to metamagnetic switching phenomena between non&#8208;collinear spin configurations. Importantly, the switching behaviors persist to high temperature. The properties underscore the importance of NiSi in the pursuit of antiferromagnetic&#160;spintronics.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells by Tailoring Crystal Orientation and Passivating Surface Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple solution&#8208;processable passivator is introduced on the top surface of low&#8208;dimensional 2D perovskites. This passivator induces a vertical crystal orientation and simultaneously passivates the defects on the perovskites, leading to efficient charge transport with reduced recombination loss in the photoactive materials. The champion device exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 20.05% with negligible hysteresis and superior operational stability.








Abstract
Solar cells (PSCs) with quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites (RPP) exhibit greater environmental stability than 3D perovskites; however, the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) caused by anisotropic crystal orientations and defect sites in the bulk RPP materials limit future commercialization. Herein, a simple post&#8211;treatment is reported for the top surfaces of RPP thin films (RPP composition of PEA2MA4Pb5I16 &lt;n&gt; = 5) in which zwitterionic n&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;phenylnitrone (PBN) is used as the passivation material. The PBN molecules passivate the surface and grain boundary defects in the RPP and simultaneously induce vertical direction crystal orientations of the RPPs, which lead to efficient charge transport in the RPP photoactive materials. With this surface engineering methodology, the optimized devices exhibit a remarkably enhanced PCE of 20.05% as compared with the devices without PBN (&#8776;17.53%) and excellent long&#8208;term operational stability with 88% retention of the initial PCE under continuous 1&#8208;sun irradiation for over 1000&#160;h.

&lt;p&gt;A simple solution-processable passivator is introduced on the top surface of low-dimensional 2D perovskites. This passivator induces a vertical crystal orientation and simultaneously passivates the defects on the perovskites, leading to efficient charge transport with reduced recombination loss in the photoactive materials. The champion device exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 20.05% with negligible hysteresis and superior operational stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar cells (PSCs) with quasi-2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites (RPP) exhibit greater environmental stability than 3D perovskites; however, the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) caused by anisotropic crystal orientations and defect sites in the bulk RPP materials limit future commercialization. Herein, a simple post&#8211;treatment is reported for the top surfaces of RPP thin films (RPP composition of PEA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt; = 5) in which zwitterionic n-tert-butyl-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-phenylnitrone (PBN) is used as the passivation material. The PBN molecules passivate the surface and grain boundary defects in the RPP and simultaneously induce vertical direction crystal orientations of the RPPs, which lead to efficient charge transport in the RPP photoactive materials. With this surface engineering methodology, the optimized devices exhibit a remarkably enhanced PCE of 20.05% as compared with the devices without PBN (&#8776;17.53%) and excellent long-term operational stability with 88% retention of the initial PCE under continuous 1-sun irradiation for over 1000&#160;h. The proposed passivation strategy provides new insights into the development of efficient and stable RPP-based PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Post&#8208;Maturation Reinforcement of 3D&#8208;Printed Vascularized Cardiac Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for reinforcing fully cellularized tissue is shown. Vascularized cardiac tissues are printed. Following tissue maturation, a biocompatible, tissue&#8208;penetrating small&#8208;molecule is deployed to generate significant improvement in the tissue's mechanical properties.








Abstract
Despite advances in biomaterials engineering, a large gap remains between the weak mechanical properties that can be achieved with natural materials and the strength of synthetic materials. Here, a method is presented for reinforcing an engineered cardiac tissue fabricated from differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and an extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;based hydrogel in a manner that is fully biocompatible. The reinforcement occurs as a post&#8208;fabrication step, which allows for the use of 3D&#8208;printing technology to generate thick, fully cellularized, and vascularized cardiac tissues. After tissue assembly and during the maturation process in a soft hydrogel, a small, tissue&#8208;penetrating reinforcer is deployed, leading to a significant increase in the tissue's mechanical properties. The tissue's robustness is demonstrated by injecting the tissue in a simulated minimally invasive procedure and showing that the tissue is functional and undamaged at the nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and macroscales.

         <title>Lubricated Interfaces Enabling Simultaneous Pulsatile and Continuous Chemical Release Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The loading of chemicals in a porous polymeric coating prior to lubrication leads to a diffusion&#8208;based continuous release of chemicals, whereas the loading of dissolved water&#8208;soluble chemicals that disperse in the lubricated liquid crystals in the form of micrometer&#8208;sized aqueous droplets gives rise to a pulsatile release triggered by a liquid crystal phase transition.








Abstract
The release of chemicals following either pulsatile or continuous release modes is important for various potential applications, including programmed chemical reactions, mechanical actuation, and treatments of various diseases. However, the simultaneous application of both modes in a single material system has been challenging. Here, two chemical loading methods are reported in a liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;infused porous surface (LCIPS) that enables both a pulsatile and continuous release of chemicals simultaneously. Specifically, chemicals loaded in the porous substrate exhibit a liquid crystal (LC) mesophase&#8208;dependent continuous release, whereas the chemicals dissolved in micrometer&#8208;sized aqueous droplets dispersed in the LC surface follow a pulsatile release activated by a phase transition. Moreover, the loading method of distinct molecules can be controlled to program their release mode. Finally, the pulsatile and continuous release of two distinct bioactive small molecules, tetracycline and dexamethasone, are demonstrated which display antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities for applications such as chronic wound healing and biomedical implant coating.

         <title>Low&#8208;Power and Field&#8208;Free Perpendicular Magnetic Memory Driven by Topological Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the assistance of a small STT current across the MTJ stack during SOT, field&#8208;free deterministic SOT switching is realized, and the critical switching current density of SOT decreases with increasing the STT current density. TI&#8208;pMTJ devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have much higher thermal stability and much lower switching current density, to realize SOT&#8208;MRAM applications.








Abstract
Giant spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) from topological insulators (TIs) has great potential for low&#8208;power SOT&#8208;driven magnetic random&#8208;access memory (SOT&#8208;MRAM). In this work, a functional 3&#8208;terminal SOT&#8208;MRAM device is demonstrated by integrating the TI [(BiSb)2Te3] with perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs), where the tunneling magnetoresistance is employed for the effective reading method. An ultralow switching current density of 1.5 &#215; 105&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved in the TI&#8208;pMTJ device at room temperature, which is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude lower than that in conventional heavy&#8211;metals&#8208;based systems, due to the high SOT efficiency &#952;SH = 1.16 of (BiSb)2Te3. Furthermore, all&#8208;electrical field&#8208;free writing is realized by the synergistic effect of a small spin&#8208;transfer torque current during the SOT. The thermal stability factor (&#916; = 66) shows the high retention time (&gt;10 years) of the TI&#8208;pMTJ device. This work sheds light to the future low&#8208;power, high&#8208;density, and high&#8208;endurance/retention magnetic memory technology based on quantum materials.

         <title>Molybdenum Disulfide Nanoribbons with Enhanced Edge Nonlinear Response and Photoresponsivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) single&#8208;nanoribbon photodetectors are successfully demonstrated. The MoS2 nanoribbons grown using a dual pulsed laser deposition&#8208;chemical vapor deposition approach exhibit single&#8208;layer edges with enhanced nonlinear optical response and photoluminescence emission. The photoresponsivity of the nano&#8208;photodetector device reaches a value of 8.72&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at visible wavelengths.








Abstract
MoS2 nanoribbons have attracted increased interest due to their properties, which can be tailored by tuning their dimensions. Herein, the growth of MoS2 nanoribbons and triangular crystals formed by the reaction between films of MoOx (2&lt;x&lt;3)&#160;grown by pulsed laser deposition and NaF in a sulfur&#8208;rich environment is demonstrated. The nanoribbons can reach up to 10&#160;&#181;m in length, and feature single&#8208;layer&#160;edges, forming a monolayer&#8211;multilayer junction enabled by the lateral modulation in thickness. The single&#8208;layer edges show a pronounced second harmonic generation due to the symmetry breaking, in contrast to the centrosymmetric multilayer structure, which is unsusceptible to the second&#8208;order nonlinear process. A splitting of the Raman spectra is observed in MoS2 nanoribbons arising from distinct contributions from the single&#8211;layer edges and multilayer core. Nanoscale imaging reveals a blue&#8208;shifted exciton emission of the monolayer edge compared to the isolated MoS2 monolayers due to built&#8208;in local strain and disorder. We&#160;further report on an ultrasensitive photodetector made of a single MoS2 nanoribbon with a responsivity of 8.72&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 532&#160;nm, among the highest reported up&#8208;to&#8208;date for single&#8208;nanoribbon photodetectors. These findings can inspire the design of MoS2 semiconductors with tunable geometries for efficient optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Carbon Dots with Blue&#8208;to&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Lasing for Colorful Speckle&#8208;Free Laser Imaging and Dynamical Holographic Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable lasers span 238&#160;nm across from blue to near&#8208;infrared region are realized from full&#8208;color carbon dots (FC&#8208;CDs) in a mirrorless system. The lasers of the FC&#8208;CDs show high Q&#8208;factors, considerable gain coefficients, and better stability than common commercial organic dyes. Finally, high&#8208;quality, colorful speckle&#8208;free laser imaging and dynamic holographic display are successfully demonstrated using these lasers as light sources.








Abstract
As a new solution&#8208;processable laser material, carbon dots (CDs) offer advantages of non&#8208;toxicity, low&#8208;cost, and high&#8208;stability, which are conducive to the sustainable development of miniaturized lasers. Full&#8208;color CDs (FC&#8208;CDs) with bright&#8208;blue, green, yellow, red, deep&#8208;red, and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence are prepared. Their photoluminescence emission ranges from 431 to 714&#160;nm. The FC&#8208;CDs show narrow full widths at half maximum in the range of 44&#8211;76&#160;nm, with concurrent high radiative transition rates (KR) of 0.54&#8211;1.74 &#215; 108&#160;s&#8722;1; their performance is comparable to that of organic laser dyes, indicating their good gain potential for lasers. Laser pumping of the FC&#8208;CDs gives laser outputs at 467.3, 533.5, 577.4, 616.3, 653.5, and 705.1&#160;nm, spanning from blue to NIR region, and covering 140% of the NTSC color gamut. The FC&#8208;CDs show high Q&#8208;factors (2000&#8211;5500), appreciable gain coefficients (9&#8211;21.5&#160;cm&#8722;1), and better stability (&#8776;100%@4&#8211;7&#160;h) than commercial laser dyes. These excellent properties make them suitable for high&#8208;quality, colorful, speckle&#8208;free laser imaging and dynamic holographic display. The findings will be helpful in promoting the practical applications and development of solution&#8208;processable CD&#8208;based lasers.

         <title>Gradient Cationic Vacancies Enabling Inner&#8208;To&#8208;Outer Tandem Homojunctions: Strong Local Internal Electric Field and Reformed Basic Sites Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient cation (W6+) vacancies on the surface of Bi2WO6 nanosheets construct a local intrinsic electric field across the catalyst subsurface, which provides a driving force for the separation of photogenerated carriers. The W6+ vacancies also change the basic sites on the surface and the type of CO2 adsorption, thus lowering the barrier for the formation of the essential intermediate *COOH in the CO2 conversion process and ultimately improving the CO2 reduction ability.








Abstract
The slow charge dynamics and large activation energy of CO2 severely hinder the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction. Defect engineering is a well&#8208;established strategy, while the function of common zero&#8208;dimensional defects is always restricted to promoting surface adsorption. In this work, a gradient layer of tungsten vacancies with a thickness of 3&#8211;4&#160;nm is created across Bi2WO6 nanosheets. This gradient layer&#160;enables the formation of an inner&#8208;to&#8208;outer tandem homojunction with an internal electric field, which provides a strong driving force for the migration of photoelectrons from the bulk to the surface. Meanwhile, W vacancies change the coordination environment around O and W atoms, leading to an alteration in the basic sites and the mode of CO2 adsorption from weak/strong adsorption to moderate adsorption, which ultimately decreases the formation barrier of the key intermediate *COOH and facilitates the conversion thermodynamics for CO2. Without any cocatalyst and sacrificial reagent, W&#8208;vacant Bi2WO6 shows an outstanding photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance with a CO production rate of 30.62&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, being one of the best catalysts in similar reaction systems. This study reveals that gradient vacancies as a new type of defect will show huge potential in regulating charge dynamics and catalytic reaction thermodynamics.

         <title>Nanoengineered Design of inside&#8208;Heating Hot Nanoreactor Surrounded by Cool Environment for Selective Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;function nanocatalyst, integrating locally inside&#8208;heating, thermal insulation, and high&#8208;dispersed Pt into a whole, induces selective hydrogenations within heat&#8208;constrained nanoreactors (120&#160;&#176;C) surrounded by a cool environment (40&#160;&#176;C). A 20.1&#8208;fold increase in reaction rate is achieved compared to the conventional outside&#8208;in heating. The diffusion of target products into a cool environment ensures the high selectivity (&gt;98%) under high conversion (&#8776;100%).








Abstract
Catalysts with designable intelligent nanostructure may potentially drive the changes in chemical reaction techniques. Herein, a multi&#8208;function integrating nanocatalyst, Pt&#8208;containing magnetic yolk&#8208;shell carbonaceous structure, having catalysis function, microenvironment heating, thermal&#160;insulation, and elevated pressure into a whole is designed, which induces selective hydrogenation within heating&#8208;constrained nanoreactors surrounded by ambient environment.&#160;As a demonstration, carbonyl of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes/ketones are selectively hydrogenated to unsaturated alcohols with a &gt;98% selectivity at a nearly complete conversion under mild conditions of 40&#160;&#176;C and 3&#160;bar instead of harsh requirements of 120&#160;&#176;C and 30&#160;bar. It is creatively demonstrated that the locally increased temperature and endogenous pressure (estimated as &#8776;120&#160;&#176;C, 9.7&#160;bar) in the nano&#8208;sized space greatly facilitate the reaction kinetics under an alternating magnetic field. The outward&#8208;diffused products to the &#8220;cool environment&#8221; remain thermodynamically stable, avoiding the over&#8208;hydrogenation that often occurs under constantly heated conditions of 120&#160;&#176;C. Regulation of the electronic state of Pt by sulfur doping of carbon allows selective chemical adsorption of the &#63743;C&#63742;O group and consequently leads to selective hydrogenation. It is expected that such a multi&#8208;function integrated catalyst provides an ideal platform for precisely operating a variety of organic liquid&#8208;phase transformations under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Ferroelectric Modulation in Flexible Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Schottky Direct&#8208;Current Nanogenerator for Capsule&#8208;Like Magnetic Suspension Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a flexible and dynamic ferroelectric lead&#8208;free halide perovskite (3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium)2CuCl4 ((DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4)/Al Schottky junction tribovoltaic nanogenerator with high current output (93&#160;&#181;A) at the macroscale. More significantly, a stable and efficient ferroelectricity&#8208;modulated strategy, for the first time, is proposed, which realizes a 15&#8208;fold current enhancement via the electric poling field control.








Abstract
The tribovoltaic nanogenerator (TVNG), a promising semiconductor energy technology, displays outstanding advantages such as low matching impedance and continuous direct&#8208;current output. However, the lack of controllable and stable performance modulation strategies is still a major bottleneck that impedes further practical applications of TVNG. Herein, by leveraging the ferroelectricity&#8208;enhanced mechanism and the control of interfacial energy band bending, a lead&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;based (3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium)2CuCl4 ((DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4)/Al Schottky junction TVNG is constructed. The multiaxial ferroelectricity of (DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4 enables an excellent surface charge modulating capacity, realizing a high work function regulation of &#8776;0.7&#160;eV and over 15&#8208;fold current regulation (from 6 to 93&#160;&#181;A) via an electrical poling control. The controllable electrical poling leads to elevated work function difference between the Al electrode and (DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4 compared to traditional semiconductors and halide perovskites, which creates a stronger built&#8208;in electric field at the Schottky interface to enhance the electrical output. This TVNG device exhibits outstanding flexibility and long&#8208;term stability (&gt;20&#160;000 cycles) that can endure extreme mechanical deformations, and can also be used in a capsule&#8208;like magnetic suspension device capable of detecting vibration and weights of different objects as well as harvesting energy from human motions and water waves.

&lt;p&gt;This work reports a flexible and dynamic ferroelectric lead-free halide perovskite (3,3-difluorocyclobutylammonium)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ((DF-CBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)/Al Schottky junction tribovoltaic nanogenerator with high current output (93&#160;&#181;A) at the macroscale. More significantly, a stable and efficient ferroelectricity-modulated strategy, for the first time, is proposed, which realizes a 15-fold current enhancement via the electric poling field control.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribovoltaic nanogenerator (TVNG), a promising semiconductor energy technology, displays outstanding advantages such as low matching impedance and continuous direct-current output. However, the lack of controllable and stable performance modulation strategies is still a major bottleneck that impedes further practical applications of TVNG. Herein, by leveraging the ferroelectricity-enhanced mechanism and the control of interfacial energy band bending, a lead-free perovskite-based (3,3-difluorocyclobutylammonium)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ((DF-CBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)/Al Schottky junction TVNG is constructed. The multiaxial ferroelectricity of (DF-CBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; enables an excellent surface charge modulating capacity, realizing a high work function regulation of &#8776;0.7&#160;eV and over 15-fold current regulation (from 6 to 93&#160;&#181;A) via an electrical poling control. The controllable electrical poling leads to elevated work function difference between the Al electrode and (DF-CBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compared to traditional semiconductors and halide perovskites, which creates a stronger built-in electric field at the Schottky interface to enhance the electrical output. This TVNG device exhibits outstanding flexibility and long-term stability (&amp;gt;20&#160;000 cycles) that can endure extreme mechanical deformations, and can also be used in a capsule-like magnetic suspension device capable of detecting vibration and weights of different objects as well as harvesting energy from human motions and water waves.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Switching Chirality in Arrays of Shape&#8208;Reconfigurable Spindle Microparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microarrays consisting of individual shape&#8208;changeable microparticles with anisotropic and uniform&#8208;sized shapes enable symmetry breaking from achiral to chiral (with opposite signs) upon heating or light illumination. Chiral states at the boundary of the achiral/chiral domains are controllably created. This study will lead to rich structures and novel physics emerging from the interplay of symmetry and topology at the light&#8211;matter interface.








Abstract
The giant circular photo&#8208;galvanic effect is realized in chiral metals when illuminated by circularly polarized light. However, the structure itself is not switchable nor is the crystal chirality in the adjacent chiral domains. Here spindle&#8208;shaped liquid crystalline elastomer microparticles that can switch from prolate to spherical to oblate reversibly upon heating above the nematic to isotropic transition temperature are synthesized. When arranged in a honeycomb lattice, the continuous shape change of the microparticles leads to lattice reconfiguration, from a right&#8208;handed chiral state to an achiral one, then to a left&#8208;handed chiral state, without breaking the translational symmetry. Accordingly, the sign of rotation of the polarized light passing through the lattices changes as measured by time&#8208;domain terahertz spectroscopy. Further, it can locally alter the chirality in the adjacent domains using near&#8208;infrared light illumination. The reconfigurable chiral microarrays will allow us to explore non&#8208;trivial symmetry&#8208;protected transport modes of topological lattices at the light&#8211;matter interface. Specifically, the ability to controllably create chiral states at the boundary of the achiral/chiral domains will lead to rich structures emerging from the interplay of symmetry and topology.

         <title>Interface Modification for Efficient and Stable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Pb&#8211;S bonds between perovskite and 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole appreciably reduces surface trap and improves interfacial energy level alignment. The open circuit voltage of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells is enhanced by 120 mV, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 20.6%, along with improved ambient stability.








Abstract
Due to their excellent thermal stability and ideal bandgap, metal halide inorganic perovskite based solar cells (PSCs) with inverted structure are considered as an excellent choice for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still lags far behind that of conventional n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs due to interfacial energy level mismatch and high nonradiative charge recombination. Herein, the performance of inverted PSCs is significantly improved by interfacial engineering of CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx films with 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI). It is found that the mercapto group can preferably react with the undercoordinated Pb2+ from perovskite by forming Pb&#8211;S bonds, which appreciably reduces the surface trap density. Moreover, MMI modification results in a better energy level alignment with the electron&#8208;transporting material, promoting carrier transfer and reducing voltage deficit. The above combination results in an open&#8208;circuit voltage enhancement by 120&#160;mV, yielding a champion PCE of 20.6% for 0.09 cm2 area and 17.3% for 1 cm2 area. Furthermore, the ambient, operational and heat stabilities of inorganic PSCs with MMI modification are also greatly improved. The work demonstrates a simple but effective approach for fabricating highly efficient and stable inverted inorganic PSCs.

         <title>Induction of Bleb Structures in Lipid Nanoparticle Formulations of mRNA Leads to Improved Transfection Potency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA systems composed of optimized ionizable lipids often display distinctive mRNA&#8208;rich &#8220;bleb&#8221; structures. In this work, it is shown that such structures can also be induced for LNPs&#160;containing nominally less active ionizable lipids by formulating them in the presence of high concentrations of pH 4 buffer, leading to dramatically improved transfection potencies both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
The transfection potency of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA systems is critically dependent on the ionizable cationic lipid component. LNP mRNA systems composed of optimized ionizable lipids often display distinctive mRNA&#8208;rich &#8220;bleb&#8221; structures. Here, it is shown that such structures can also be induced for LNPs containing nominally less active ionizable lipids by formulating them in the presence of high concentrations of pH 4 buffers such as sodium citrate, leading to improved transfection potencies both in vitro and in vivo. Induction of bleb structure and improved potency is dependent on the type of pH 4 buffer employed, with LNP mRNA systems prepared using 300 mm sodium citrate buffer displaying maximum transfection. The improved transfection potencies of LNP mRNA systems displaying bleb structure can be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced integrity of the encapsulated mRNA. It is concluded that enhanced transfection can be achieved by optimizing formulation parameters to improve mRNA stability and that optimization of ionizable lipids to achieve enhanced potency may well lead to improvements in mRNA integrity through formation of the bleb structure rather than enhanced intracellular delivery.

         <title>Epitaxy of a Monocrystalline CsPbBr3&#8211;SrTiO3 Halide&#8211;Oxide Perovskite p&#8211;n Heterojunction with High Stability for Photodetection</title>

         <dc:description>
Perovskite heterojunctions are essential components of perovskite optoelectronics, but their construction and investigation have been impeded by the instability and severe anion interdiffusion of perovskites. A stable p&#8211;n heterojunction is formed with the epitaxy of p&#8208;type CsPbBr3 on n&#8208;type SrTiO3 (STO). The combination of vapor&#8208;phase&#8208;deposited monocrystalline CsPbBr3 and STO makes full use of the unique optoelectrical properties of halide perovskite and excellent stability of oxide perovskite, opening up a new method for the construction of perovskite heterojunction&#8211;based optoelectronics.








Abstract
Perovskite heterojunctions are essential components of perovskite optoelectronics, but their construction and investigation have been impeded by the instability and severe anion interdiffusion. This work epitaxially deposits p&#8208;type CsPbBr3 on n&#8208;type Nb:SrTiO3 (STO) to construct a functional perovskite heterojunction with high stability. The lattice match allows epitaxial growth of CsPbBr3 to occur over large scale, resulting in a monocrystalline thin film with excellent crystallinity and uniformity. The highly stable STO prevents the anion migration frequently happening in halide perovskites, forming a sharp interface of two perovskite with opposite conduction type, with which a diode is fabricated and a current rectification ratio of 374 is obtained. The diode is able to work as a photodetector with dark current of 2.01 &#215; 10&#8722;12 A at &#8722;1&#160;V and responsivity (R) of 8.26 A W&#8722;1, rendering a detectivity (D*) of 2.98 &#215; 1013 Jones. Owing to the all&#8208;inorganic architecture, effective photoresponse at temperature as high as 150 &#176;C is guaranteed with D* of &#8776;1.52 &#215; 1013 Jones. Combining the unique optoelectrical properties of halide perovskite and the rigidity of oxide perovskite, the epitaxy of CsPbBr3 on n&#8211;type STO opens up a new method to construct functional perovskite heterojunction for optoelectronics.

The lattice match allows epitaxial growth of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to occur over large scale, resulting in a monocrystalline thin film with excellent crystallinity and uniformity. The highly stable STO prevents the anion migration frequently happening in halide perovskites, forming a sharp interface of two perovskite with opposite conduction type, with which a diode is fabricated and a current rectification ratio of 374 is obtained. The diode is able to work as a photodetector with dark current of 2.01 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;12&lt;/sup&gt; A at &#8722;1&#160;V and responsivity (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) of 8.26 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, rendering a detectivity (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;*) of 2.98 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones. Owing to the all-inorganic architecture, effective photoresponse at temperature as high as 150 &#176;C is guaranteed with &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;* of &#8776;1.52 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones. Combining the unique optoelectrical properties of halide perovskite and the rigidity of oxide perovskite, the epitaxy of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on n&#8211;type STO opens up a new method to construct functional perovskite heterojunction for optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailored Cysteine&#8208;Derived Molecular Structures toward Efficient and Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A brand&#8208;new passivator, Boc&#8208;S&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine (BMBC), is demonstrated to post&#8208;treat CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite films. The synergistic effects of an energetic electron donor group and multiple Lewis&#8208;based functional groups in BMBC are purposefully designed to passivate majority of defects. Benefiting from a hydrophobic tert&#8208;butyl group in BMBC, the protection against water invasion is thus significantly enhanced. This study provides a useful understanding and rational design regarding the influence of the molecular configuration on the passivation efficacy in inorganic perovskite&#8208;type photovoltaics.








Abstract
Surface&#8211;defect&#8208;triggered non&#8208;radiative charge recombination and poor stability have become the main roadblock to continued improvement in inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, the main culprits are identified on the inorganic perovskite surface by first&#8208;principles calculations, and to purposefully design a brand&#8208;new passivator, Boc&#8208;S&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine (BMBC), whose multiple Lewis&#8208;based functional groups (NH&#63743;, S&#63743; and C&#63742;O) to suppress halide vacancies and coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ through typical Lewis baseacid reactions. The tailored electron&#8208;donating methoxyl group (CH3O&#8211;) can cause an increased electron density on the benzene ring, which strengthens the interaction with undercoordinated Pb2+ via electrostatic interactions. This BMBC passivation can reduce the surface trap density, enlarge grains, prolong the charge lifetime, and cause a more suitable energy&#8208;level alignment. In addition, the hydrophobic tert&#8208;butyl in butoxycarbonyl (Boc&#8208;) group ensures that BMBC is uniformly covered and prevents harmful aggregation through steric repulsion at the perovskite/hole&#8211;transporting layer (HTL) interface, thus providing a hydrophobic umbrella to resist moisture invasion. Consequently, the combination of the above increases the efficiency of CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx PSC from 18.6% to 21.8%, the highest efficiency for this type of inorganic metal halide PSCs so far, as far as it is known. Moreover, the device exhibits higher environmental and thermal stability.

         <title>BiFeO3 Nanoparticles: The &#8220;Holy&#8208;Grail&#8221; of Piezo&#8208;Photocatalysts?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and versatile BiFeO3 nanoparticle piezocatalysts are found to exhibit strong piezocatalytic and synergistic piezo&#8208;photocatalytic effects (100% degradation ratio of Rhodamine B within 5&#160;min) and are embedded into a P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) polymer to design a flexible, stable, and reusable multicatalytic system for wastewater treatment using mechanical forces and sunlight.








Abstract
Recently, piezoelectric&#8208;based catalysis has been demonstrated to be an efficient means and promising alternative to sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalysis, where mechanical vibrations trigger redox reactions. Here, 60&#160;nm&#8208;size BiFeO3 nanoparticles are shown to be very effective for piezo&#8208;degrading Rhodamine B (RhB) model dye with record degradation rate reaching 13&#160;810&#160;L&#160;mol&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, and even 41 750&#160;L&#160;mol&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1 (i.e., 100% RhB degradation within 5&#160;min) when piezocatalysis is synergistically combined with sunlight photocatalysis. These BiFeO3 piezocatalytic nanoparticles are also demonstrated to be versatile toward several dyes and pharmaceutical pollutants, with over 80% piezo&#8208;decomposition within 120&#160;min. The maintained high piezoelectric coefficient combined with low dielectric constant, high&#8208;elastic modulus, and the nanosized shape make these BiFeO3&#160;nanoparticles extremely efficient piezocatalysts. To avoid subsequent secondary pollution and enable their reusability, the BiFeO3 nanoparticles are further embedded in a polymer P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) matrix. The as&#8208;designed flexible, chemically stable, and recyclable nanocomposites still keep remarkable piezocatalytic and piezo&#8208;photocatalytic performances (i.e., 92% and 100% RhB degradation, respectively, within 20&#160;min). This work opens a new research avenue for BiFeO3 that is the model multiferroic and offers a new platform for water cleaning, as well as other applications such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, or surface purification.

         <title>Biomimetic Multicolor&#8208;Separating Photonic Skin using Electrically Stretchable Chiral Photonic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodulus chiral photonic elastomers (CPEs) are modulated, and multicolor control with dynamic wavelength change from a single color is realized. Multicolor separation by mechanical stretching or electrical stretching occurs via the exploitation of engineered modulus&#8208;adjusted CPEs. Moreover, stretchable multicolor separation using a mixed array of CPEs is investigated for potential photonic camouflage applications.








Abstract
Structural color can be produced by nanoperiodic dielectric structures using soft materials. Chiral photonic elastomers (CPEs) produced from elastic chiral liquid crystal molecules can self&#8208;organize into a helical nanostructure, and the chiral nanostructural color can be tuned by stretching. However, the ability to control the separation of biomimetic multicolors for practical applications beyond simple uniaxial stretching of single&#8208;colored structures has been limited until now. Here, stretchable CPEs with simultaneous multicolor control, including electrical control, are presented. By engineering the heterogeneous elastic modulus of the CPEs, stretchable and simultaneous multicolor separations from an initially homogeneous color are realized. Electrically stretchable multicolor separation is investigated using a hybrid CPE structure on dielectric elastomer actuators, and multiarrayed color binning and chameleon&#8208;like photonic e&#8208;skin are further developed for device applications. Moreover, multicolor concealed camouflage switching and control of invisible photonic e&#8208;skin are demonstrated. This multicolor control of stretchable photonic systems improves the functionality of various potential photonic applications.

MXene
In article number 2300422, Mostafa Dadashi Firouzjaei, Mark Elliott, Babak Ansori, and co&#8208;workers study the life&#8208;cycle assessment of the Ti3C2Tx MXene's synthesis. The cumulative energy demand and overall environmental impacts of synthesis for electromagnetic interface shielding applications are investigated. In addition, the environmental impacts and energy demand of each primary parameter playing a role in the synthesis of MXene are quantified. This study will aid in the industrialization of MXene.

Antiferromagnetic Materials
In article number 2302120, Deepak K. Singh and co&#8208;workers report the discovery of high&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetic properties in NiSi metal via neutron scattering measurements at the CORELLI spectrometer at SNS&#8208;ORNL, which can have strong implications toward spintronics research. The image shows the spin correlation of Ni ions on two non&#8208;equivalent sites, which is inferred from the modeling of elastic neutron data (shown in the background).

Perovskite Solar Cells
In article number 2302143, Ju&#8208;Hyeon Kim, Heejoo Kim, Kwanghee Lee, and co&#8208;workers describe an efficient quasi&#8208;2D&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based solar cell. They improve the photocurrent and stability of the cell through a simple post&#8208;treatment, which induces both defect passivation and crystal reconstruction effects, resulting in efficient charge transport. This approach provides an innovative technique for achieving high&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;2D&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

Multicolor Switching
In article number 2302456, Su Seok Choi and co&#8208;workers investigate biomimetic multicolor separation control of mechanochromic switching using electrically stretchable chiral liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs). With advanced engineering of electrically stretchable CLCEs, various multicolor switching devices are experimentally verified. A chameleon&#8208;like synthetic multicolor photonic skin control is also reported, with invisibility switching using electrically stretchable CLCEs. The conceived multicolor CLCEs are also validated with camouflage information control using color pixels reconfiguration and invisibility switching.

Tissue Bioprinting
In article number 2302229, Tal Dvir and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a biocompatible method for reinforcing engineered tissue post&#8208;fabrication. The technique enables 3D bioprinting of soft tissue and gives the cells time to establish intercellular communications before the tissue's mechanical properties are significantly improved by the reinforcement protocol. In the work, thick, vascularized cardiac tissues are enhanced to the point of injectability.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells by Tailoring of Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of perovskite solar cells is a significant challenge for commercialization due to the inherent instability of the perovskite material and the interface defects between different layers in the device. Tailoring the interfaces in perovskite solar cells can enhance the device's efficiency and stability. This review discusses the theory of interface improvement and various interface materials for efficient, stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The interface tailoring is crucial for the efficiency and stability of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs). The reported interface engineering primarily focuses on the energy level turning and trap state passivation to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In this review, molecule modifications are classified according to the basics of electron transfer mechanisms for the interface tailoring of materials. An in&#8208;depth analysis of energy level modification and trap passivation, as well as the universal Density Functional Theory (DFT) method employed in interface tailoring. In addition, strategies to address environmental protection and large&#8208;scale mini&#8208;modules fabrication by interface engineering are also discussed. This review can guide the researchers in understanding interface engineering to design interface materials for efficient, stable, and eco&#8208;friendly PSCs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are seen as potentially promising candidates for novel light&#8208;emission applications, owing to their unique characteristics. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress made in the development of 2D TMDC&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting devices and highlights the remaining challenges.








Abstract
2D monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) show great promise for the development of next&#8208;generation light&#8208;emitting devices owing to their unique electronic and optoelectronic properties. The dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface and direct&#8208;bandgap structure of monolayer TMDCs allow for near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies. The excellent mechanical and optical characteristics of 2D TMDCs offer great potential to fabricate TMDC&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) featuring good flexibility and transparency. Great progress has been made in the fabrication of bright and efficient LEDs with varying device structures. In this review, the aim is to provide a comprehensive summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress made in the construction of bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs. After a brief introduction to the research background, the preparation of 2D TMDCs used for LEDs is briefly discussed. The requirements and the corresponding challenges to achieve bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs are introduced. Thereafter, various strategies to enhance the brightness of monolayer 2D TMDCs are described. Following that, the carrier&#8208;injection schemes enabling bright and efficient TMDC&#8208;based LEDs along with the device performance are summarized. Finally, the challenges and future prospects regarding the accomplishment of TMDC&#8208;LEDs with ultimate brightness and efficiency are discussed.

         <title>Microenvironment Engineering of Single/Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Electrocatalytic Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the microenvironment engineering of single/dual&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs/DACs) for electrocatalytic applications are systematically reviewed. The microenvironment regulation principles of carbon&#8208;based single/dual&#8208;atom sites, corresponding structure&#8211;performance relationships with reaction mechanism study over several electrochemical processes for SACs and DACs are thoroughly discussed. This review aims to provide an inspiration on the development of atomically dispersed catalysts in electrocatalysis field.








Abstract
Single/dual&#8208;metal atoms supported on carbon matrix can be modulated by coordination structure and neighboring active sites. Precisely designing the geometric and electronic structure and uncovering the structure&#8211;property relationships of single/dual&#8208;metal atoms confront with grand challenges. Herein, this review summarizes the latest progress in microenvironment engineering of single/dual&#8208;atom active sites via a comprehensive comparison of single&#8208;atom catalyst (SACs) and dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) in term of design principles, modulation strategy, and theoretical understanding of structure&#8211;performance correlations. Subsequently, recent advances in several typical electrocatalysis process are discussed to get general understanding of the reaction mechanisms on finely&#8208;tuned SACs and DACs. Finally, full&#8208;scaled summaries of the challenges and prospects are given for microenvironment engineering of SACs and DACs. This review will provide new inspiration on the development of atomically dispersed catalysts for electrocatalytic application.

         <title>Reconfiguring Hard Carbons with Emerging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights three critical structural features of hard carbons for practical use in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, namely crystallites, defects, and nanopores. The impact of these structural features upon sodium storage is systematically discussed and an ideal configuration, namely sieving carbons with tightened pore entrance and enlarged pore body, is finally proposed for superior sodium storage.








Abstract
Hard carbons, an important category of amorphous carbons, are non&#8208;graphitizable and are widely accepted as the most promising anode materials for emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs)&#65292; because of their changeable low&#8208;potential charge/discharge plateaus. However, their microstructures are not fixed and are difficult to accurately demonstrate as graphites do. The successful use of hard carbons in SIBs revives the interest to clearly picture their complicated microstructures that are in close relevance to sodium storage. In this review, the past definitions and structural models of hard carbons are revisited first, and a renewed understanding of their sodium storage is presented. Three critical structural features are highlighted for hard carbons, namely crystallites, defects, and nanopores, which are directly responsible for the presence of the low&#8208;potential plateaus and their reversible extension. The impact of these structural features upon the sodium storage is then deeply discussed and sieving carbons is finally proposed as an ideal configuration of carbon anode for superhigh sodium storage. This review is expected to offer a clear picture of hard carbons, and help realize a truly rational design of high&#8208;capacity carbon anodes, driving the industrialization of SIBs, and more promisingly open up a window for exploring their possible new uses.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review is proposed on the recent advances of sonosensitive nanomaterials in advancing four ultrasound&#8208;related biological applications and disease treatments. In addition to the mostly explored nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT), the summary and discussion of other sono&#8208;therapies and progresses/achievements are also conducted, including sonomechanical therapy (SMT), sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT), and sonothermal therapy (STT).








Abstract
Nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented ultrasound (US) medicine is a unique area of interdisciplinary research that focuses on designing and engineering functional nanosystems to address the challenging issues in US&#8208;based biomedicine, overcoming the shortcomings of traditional microbubbles and optimizing the design of contrast and sonosensitive agents. The single&#8208;faceted summary of available US&#8208;related therapies is still a significant drawback. Here, The proposal of a comprehensive review on the recent advances of sonosensitive nanomaterials in advancing four US&#8208;related biological applications and disease theranostics is aimed. In addition to the mostly explored nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT), the summary and discussion of other sono&#8208;therapies and progresses/achievements are relatively lacking, including sonomechanical therapy (SMT), sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT), and sonothermal therapy (STT). The design concepts of the specific sono&#8208;therapies based on nanomedicines are initially introduced. Furthermore, the representative paradigms for nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/enhanced US therapies are elaborated according to therapeutic principles and diversity. This review provides an updated and comprehensive review of the field of nanoultrasonic biomedicine, and comprehensively discusses the progress of versatile ultrasonic disease treatments. Finally, the deep discussion on the facing challenges and prospects is expected to promote the emergence and establishment of a new branch of US biomedicine through the rational combination of nanomedicine and US clinical biomedicine.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Deficient Bioceramics: Combination of Diagnosis, Therapy, and Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fourth generation of bioceramics called colored/oxygen&#8208;deficient for biomedical applications are introduced in this review. The importance of this class of bioceramics can be defined through multifunctionality since they are regarded as the connection between the past and future. The microstructure, applications, potential challenges, future trends, and perspectives are discussed in detail.








Abstract
The journey of ceramics in medicine has been synchronized with an evolution from the first generation&#8212;alumina, zirconia, etc.&#8212;to the third &#8212;3D scaffolds. There is an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming member called oxygen&#8208;deficient or colored bioceramics, which have recently found their way through biomedical applications. The oxygen vacancy steers the light absorption toward visible and near infrared regions, making the colored bioceramics multifunctional&#8212;therapeutic, diagnostic, and regenerative. Oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics are capable of turning light into heat and reactive oxygen species for photothermal and photodynamic therapies, respectively, and concomitantly yield infrared and photoacoustic images. Different types of oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics have been recently developed through various synthesis routes. Some of them like TiO2&#8722;x, MoO3&#8722;x, and WOx have been more investigated for biomedical applications, whereas the rest have yet to be scrutinized. The most prominent advantage of these bioceramics over the other biomaterials is their multifunctionality endowed with a change in the microstructure. There are some challenges ahead of this category discussed at the end of the present review. By shedding light on this recently born bioceramics subcategory, it is believed that the field will undergo a big step further as these platforms are naturally multifunctional.

         <title>The Oxygen Evolution Reaction Drives Passivity Breakdown for Ni&#8211;Cr&#8211;Mo&#160;Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passivity breakdown of Cr&#8208;containing alloys upon anodic polarization is traditionally believed to be caused by oxidation of stable Cr3+ oxide to soluble Cr6+ species leading to fast metal dissolution. By using multimodal in situ synchrotron measurements of highly alloyed Ni&#8211;base alloys, a new passivity breakdown mechanism is reported, namely oxygen evolution reaction (OER) induced metal dissolution occurring at lower anodic potentials.








Abstract
Corrosion is the main factor limiting the lifetime of metallic materials, and a fundamental understanding of the governing mechanism and surface processes is difficult to achieve since the thin oxide films at the metal&#8211;liquid interface governing passivity are notoriously challenging to study. In this work, a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based techniques and electrochemical methods is used to investigate the passive film breakdown of a Ni&#8211;Cr&#8211;Mo alloy, which is&#160;used in many industrial applications. This alloy is found to be active toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the OER onset coincides with the loss of passivity and severe metal dissolution. The OER mechanism involves the oxidation of Mo4+ sites in the oxide film to Mo6+ that can be dissolved, which results in passivity breakdown. This is fundamentally different from typical transpassive breakdown of Cr&#8208;containing alloys where Cr6+ is postulated to be dissolved at high anodic potentials, which is not observed here. At high current densities, OER also leads to acidification of the solution near the surface, further triggering metal dissolution. The OER plays an important role in the mechanism of passivity breakdown of Ni&#8211;Cr&#8211;Mo alloys due to their catalytic activity, and this effect needs to be considered when studying the corrosion of catalytically active alloys.
