         <title>Bio&#8208;Organic Chiral Nematic Materials with Adaptive Light Emission and On&#8208;Demand Handedness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust and flexible chiral emissive bio&#8208;nanocomposite with chiral nematic&#8208;like organization that mimic biological photonic mesostructure observed in nature are demonstrated. Small molecules built in chiral mesostructure are assembled along helical arrangement, allowing to generate strong active circularly polarized light emission. Real&#8208;time phase transition of the molecules integrated into biophotonic structure enables highly asymmetric circularly polarized light emission with on&#8208;demand handedness.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time active control of the handedness of circularly polarized light emission requires sophisticated manufacturing and structural reconfigurations of inorganic optical components that can rarely be achieved in traditional passive optical structures. Here, robust and flexible emissive optically&#8208;doped biophotonic materials that facilitate the dynamic optical activity are reported. These optically active bio&#8208;enabled materials with a chiral nematic&#8208;like organization of cellulose nanocrystals with intercalated organic dye generated strong circularly polarized photoluminescence with a high asymmetric factor. Reversible phase&#8208;shifting of the photochromic molecules intercalated into chiral nematic organization enables alternating circularly polarized light emission with on&#8208;demand handedness. Real&#8208;time alternating handedness can be triggered by either remote light illumination or changes in the acidic environment. This unique dynamic chiro&#8208;optical behavior presents an efficient way to design emissive bio&#8208;derived materials for dynamic programmable active photonic materials for optical communication, optical coding, visual protection, and visual adaptation.

         <title>In Situ Chemical Lithiation Transforms Diamond&#8208;Like Carbon into an Ultrastrong Ion Conductor for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ lithiated DLC/PP separator suppresses Li&#8208;dendrite growth and redistributes Li ions to render dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition, which results in stable cycling of lithium plating/stripping (over 4500 h) at 3.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and more than 200 stable cycles at 0.2 C in a Li || LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 pouch cell with a cathode mass loading of &#8776;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anodes are of great promise for next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, Li&#8208;dendrite growth during cycling imposes a tremendous safety concern on the practical application of Li&#8208;metal anodes. Herein, an effective approach to suppress Li&#8208;dendrite growth by coating a polypropylene (PP) separator with a thin layer of ultrastrong diamond&#8208;like carbon (DLC) is reported. Theoretical calculations indicate that the DLC coating layer undergoes in situ chemical lithiation once assembled with the lithium&#8208;metal anode, transforming the DLC/PP separator into an excellent 3D Li&#8208;ion conductor. This in situ lithiated DLC/PP separator can not only mechanically suppress Li&#8208;dendrite growth by its intrinsically high modulus (&#8776;100&#160;GPa), but also uniformly redistributes Li ions to render dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition. The twofold effects of the DLC/PP separator result in stable cycling of lithium plating/stripping (over 4500 h) at a high current density of 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, this approach enables more than 1000 stable cycles at 5 C with a capacity retention of &#8776;71% in a Li || LiFePO4 coin cell and more than 200 stable cycles at 0.2 C in a Li || LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 pouch cell with cathode mass loading of &#8776;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Bulk Excitons and Surface Defects for Ultrastable and Highly Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inventive molten strategy is used to synthesize homogeneously B&#8208;doped BiOCl nanosheets. Bulk B mitigates the strong excitonic effect confined in 2D BiOCl, whereas surface B induces a reactive B&#8208;OV associate for CO2 activation. The simultaneous tailoring bulk excitons and surface defects enable ultrastable and highly selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction in pure water.








Abstract
The objective of photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCR) is to achieve high selectivity for a single energy&#8208;bearing product with high efficiency and stability. The bulk configuration usually determines charge carrier kinetics, whereas surface atomic arrangement defines the PCR thermodynamic pathway. Concurrent engineering of bulk and surface structures is therefore crucial for achieving the goal of PCR. Herein, an ultrastable and highly selective PCR using homogeneously doped BiOCl nanosheets synthesized via an inventive molten strategy is presented. With B2O3 as both the molten salt and doping precursor, this new doping approach ensures boron (B) doping from the surface into the bulk with dual functionalities. Bulk B doping mitigates strong excitonic effects confined in 2D BiOCl by significantly reducing exciton binding energies, whereas surface&#8208;doped B atoms reconstruct the BiOCl surface by extracting lattice hydroxyl groups, resulting in intimate B&#8208;oxygen vacancy (B&#8208;OV) associates. These exclusive B&#8208;OV associates enable spontaneous CO2 activation, suppress competitive hydrogen evolution and promote the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer step by stabilizing *COOH for selective CO generation. As a result, the homogeneous B&#8208;doped BiOCl nanosheets exhibit 98% selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction under visible light, with an impressive rate of 83.64&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and ultrastability for long&#8208;term testing of 120 h.

         <title>Highly Efficient Uniaxial In&#8208;Plane Stretching of a 2D Material via Ion Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion insertion in between the 2D layers of WTe2 is shown to induce an exotic crystallographic phase. This novel phase is linked to uniquely large uniaxial in&#8208;plane strain. On&#8208;chip electrochemical control over the lithium content in single flakes of WTe2 is demonstrated as an efficient, fast, and reversible way to control the strain, making LixWTe2 a promising microscale actuator.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip dynamic strain engineering requires efficient micro&#8208;actuators that can generate large in&#8208;plane strains. Inorganic electrochemical actuators are unique in that they are driven by low voltages (&#8776;1&#160;V) and produce considerable strains (&#8776;1%). However, actuation speed and efficiency are limited by mass transport of ions. Minimizing the number of ions required to actuate is thus key to enabling useful &#8220;straintronic&#8221; devices. Here, it is shown that the electrochemical intercalation of exceptionally few lithium ions into WTe2 causes large anisotropic in&#8208;plane strain: 5% in one in&#8208;plane direction and 0.1% in the other. This efficient stretching of the 2D WTe2 layers contrasts to intercalation&#8208;induced strains in related materials which are predominantly in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. The unusual actuation of LixWTe2 is linked to the formation of a newly discovered crystallographic phase, referred to as Td', with an exotic atomic arrangement. On&#8208;chip low&#8208;voltage (&lt;0.2&#160;V) control is demonstrated over the transition to the novel phase and its composition. Within the Td'&#8208;Li0.5&#8722;&#948;WTe2 phase, a uniaxial in&#8208;plane strain of 1.4% is achieved with a change of &#948; of only 0.075. This makes the in&#8208;plane chemical expansion coefficient of Td'&#8208;Li0.5&#8722;&#948;WTe2 far greater than of any other single&#8208;phase material, enabling fast and efficient planar electrochemical actuation.

         <title>Enhancing Thermoelectric Power Factor of 2D Organometal Halide Perovskites by Suppressing 2D/3D Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing the dimension of the perovskite structure from 3D (MASnI3) to 2D [(PEA)2(MA)n&#8722;1SnnI3n+1 (n&#160;= 1, 2, 3, 4)] enables a facile control of carrier concentration and induces the quantum confinement effect. Both the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity increase at an optimum n, which results in a high thermoelectric power factor of 111 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2.








Abstract
Organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) exhibit superior charge transport characteristics and ultralow thermal conductivities. However, thermoelectric (TE) applications of OHPs have been limited because of difficulties in controlling their carrier concentration, which is a key to optimizing their TE properties. Here, facile control of the carrier concentration in Sn&#8208;based OHPs is achieved by developing 2D crystal structures. The 2D OHP crystals are laterally oriented using a mixed solvent, and the morphology and crystal structure of the coexisting 2D/3D hybrid structures are systematically controlled via doping with methylammonium chloride. The effective number neff of inorganic octahedron layers in the 2D OHPs shows a strong positive correlation with the carrier concentration. Moreover, the 2D structure induces the quantum confinement effect, which enhances both the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity. A 2D OHP shows a high power factor of 111 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, which is an order of magnitude greater than the power factor of its 3D counterpart.

         <title>Tellurium Single&#8208;Crystal Arrays by Low&#8208;Temperature Evaporation and Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetics and dynamics of the crystallization of thermally evaporated amorphous Te films are studied. Single crystalline tellurium arrays are demonstrated by controlling the crystallization pathway of the evaporated Te films. Field&#8208;effect transistors based on the evaporated Te single crystals exhibit an average effective hole mobility of &#8776;100 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and on/off ratio of &#8776;3 &#215; 104.








Abstract
Thermally evaporated tellurium possesses an intriguing crystallization behavior, where an amorphous to crystalline phase transition happens at near&#8208;ambient temperature. However, a comprehensive understanding and delicate control of the crystallization process for the evaporated Te films is lacking. Here, the kinetics and dynamics of the crystallization of thermally evaporated Te films is visualized and modeled. Low&#8208;temperature processing of highly crystalline tellurium films with large grain size and preferred out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation ((100) plane parallel to the surface) is demonstrated by controlling the crystallization process. Tellurium single crystals with a lateral dimension of up to 6&#160;&#181;m are realized on various substrates including glass and plastic. Field&#8208;effect transistors based on 5&#160;&#176;C crystallized Te single grains (6&#8208;nm&#8208;thick) exhibit an average effective hole mobility of &#8776;100 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and on/off current ratio of &#8776;3 &#215; 104.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Fast Na Storage Kinetics in Ether Electrolytes for Hard Carbon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monodispersed nanospherules hard carbon anode is successfully synthesized, showing excellent electrochemical performances when matched with an ether&#8208;based electrolyte in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The unique solvated Na+ and Na+ co&#8208;intercalation mechanism and the formed thin solid electrolyte interphase film with low interface impedance in ether&#8208;based electrolytes can significantly accelerate Na storage kinetics for hard carbon anodes.








Abstract
The sodium storage performance of a hard carbon (HC) anode in ether electrolytes exhibits a higher initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and better rate performance compared to conventional ester electrolytes. However, the mechanism behind faster Na storage kinetics for HC in ether electrolytes remains unclear. Herein, a unique solvated Na+ and Na+ co&#8208;intercalation mechanism in ether electrolytes is reported using designed monodispersed HC nanospheres. In addition, a thin solid electrolyte interphase film with a high inorganic proportion formed in an ether electrolyte is visualized by cryo transmission electron microscopy and depth&#8208;profiling X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which facilitates Na+ transportation, and results in a high ICE. Furthermore, the fast solvated Na+ diffusion kinetics in ether electrolytes are also revealed via molecular dynamics simulation. Owing to the contribution of the ether electrolytes, an excellent rate performance (214&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 with an ultrahigh plateau capacity of 120 mAh g&#8722;1) and a high ICE (84.93% at 1 A g&#8722;1) are observed in a half cell; in a full cell, an attractive specific capacity of 110.3 mAh g&#8722;1 is achieved after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1.

         <title>Black Phosphorus/Polymers: Status and Challenges</title>

         <dc:description>
In this review, recent progress in black phosphorus/polymer (BP/polymers) research is highlighted, including the preparation methods, a comprehensive introduction of their properties and a detailed account of their applications in optoelectronics, bio&#8208;medicine, energy storage devices, flame retardancy, and information storage. Forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the current challenges are also provided.








Abstract
As a newly emerged mono&#8208;elemental nanomaterial, black phosphorus (BP) has been widely investigated for its fascinating physical properties, including layer&#8208;dependent tunable band gap (0.3&#8211;1.5 eV), high ON/OFF ratio (104), high carrier mobility (103 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), excellent mechanical resistance, as well as special in&#8208;plane anisotropic optical, thermal, and vibrational characteristics. However, the instability caused by chemical degradation of its surface has posed a severe challenge for its further applications. A focused BP/polymer strategy has more recently been developed and implemented to hurdle this issue, so at present BP/polymers have been developed that exhibit enhanced stability, as well as outstanding optical, thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. This has promoted researchers to further explore the potential applications of black phosphorous. In this review, the preparation processes and the key properties of BP/polymers are reviewed, followed by a detailed account of their diversified applications, including areas like optoelectronics, bio&#8208;medicine, and energy storage. Finally, in accordance with the current progress, the prospective challenges and future directions are highlighted and discussed.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Binding Assay Using Nanopores and Dimeric NP Conjugates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule nanopore&#8208;based sensing strategy is developed to screen for biomarkers. In the presence of the target biomolecules, AuNPs dimerize and are detected electrically using a nanopore. This approach is highly sensitive and selective and can potentially be used for diagnosis and screening of diseases without the need for sample processing or amplification.








Abstract
The ability to measure biomarkers, both specifically and selectively at the single&#8208;molecule level in biological fluids, has the potential to transform the diagnosis, monitoring, and therapeutic intervention of diseases. The use of nanopores has been gaining prominence in this area, not only for sequencing but more recently in screening applications. The selectivity of nanopore sensing can be substantially improved with the use of labels, but substantial challenges remain, especially when trying to differentiate between bound from unbound targets. Here highly sensitive and selective molecular probes made from nanoparticles (NPs) that self&#8208;assemble and dimerize upon binding to a biological target are designed. It is shown that both single and paired NPs can be successfully resolved and detected at the single&#8208;molecule nanopore sensing and can be used for applications such as antigen/antibody detection and microRNA (miRNA) sequence analysis. It is expected that such technology will contribute significantly to developing highly sensitive and selective strategies for the diagnosis and screening of diseases without the need for sample processing or amplification while requiring minimal sample volume.

In the presence of the target biomolecules, AuNPs dimerize and are detected electrically using a nanopore. This approach is highly sensitive and selective and can potentially be used for diagnosis and screening of diseases without the need for sample processing or amplification.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to measure biomarkers, both specifically and selectively at the single-molecule level in biological fluids, has the potential to transform the diagnosis, monitoring, and therapeutic intervention of diseases. The use of nanopores has been gaining prominence in this area, not only for sequencing but more recently in screening applications. The selectivity of nanopore sensing can be substantially improved with the use of labels, but substantial challenges remain, especially when trying to differentiate between bound from unbound targets. Here highly sensitive and selective molecular probes made from nanoparticles (NPs) that self-assemble and dimerize upon binding to a biological target are designed. It is shown that both single and paired NPs can be successfully resolved and detected at the single-molecule nanopore sensing and can be used for applications such as antigen/antibody detection and microRNA (miRNA) sequence analysis. It is expected that such technology will contribute significantly to developing highly sensitive and selective strategies for the diagnosis and screening of diseases without the need for sample processing or amplification while requiring minimal sample volume.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Barium Titanate&#8208;on&#8208;Oxide Insulator Optoelectronics Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A barium titanate&#8208;on&#8208;insulator platform with high quality of barium titanate single&#8208;crystal growth and excellent vertical optical confinement is introduced. The phase&#8208;transition temperature of barium titanate in the platform is extended to at least 700&#160;&#176;C, which helps avoiding difficulties in device fabrication caused by heating such as cracking. A low propagation loss is verified in the resultant fabricated waveguide.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;optic modulators are among the most important building blocks in optical communication networks. Lithium niobate, for example, has traditionally been widely used to fabricate high&#8208;speed optical modulators due to its large Pockels effect. Another material, barium titanate, nominally has a 50&#160;times stronger r&#8208;parameter and would ordinarily be a more attractive material choice for such modulators or other applications. In practice, barium titanate thin films for optical waveguide devices are usually grown on magnesium oxide due to its low refractive index, allowing vertical mode confinement. However, the crystal quality is normally degraded. Here, a group of scandate&#8208;based substrates with small lattice mismatch and low refractive index compared to that of barium titanate is identified, thus concurrently satisfying high crystal quality and vertical optical mode confinement. This work provides a platform for nonlinear on&#8208;chip optoelectronics and can be promising for waveguide&#8208;based optical devices such as Mach&#8211;Zehnder modulators, wavelength division multiplexing, and quantum optics&#8208;on&#8208;chip.

         <title>Mechanochromic, Structurally Colored, and Edible Hydrogels Prepared from Hydroxypropyl Cellulose and Gelatin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;supporting and structurally colored hydrogel is produced by combining hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and gelatin in a scalable formulation process. By retaining the lyotropic, liquid crystalline behavior of the HPC into the gelled state, a spectrum of dynamic colors is produced. Rheological studies confirm a desirable non&#8208;Newtonian shear&#8208;thinning behavior and an increased stiffness, which result in a much quicker mechanochromic relaxation time.








Abstract
Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) is an edible, cost&#8208;effective and widely used derivative of cellulose. Under lyotropic conditions in water, HPC forms a photonic, liquid crystalline mesophase with an exceptional mechanochromic response. However, due to insufficient physical cross&#8208;linking photonic HPC can flow freely as a viscous liquid, preventing the exploitation of this mechanochromic material in the absence of any external encapsulation or structural confinement. Here this challenge is addressed by mixing HPC and gelatin in water to form a self&#8208;supporting, viscoelastic, and edible supramolecular photonic hydrogel. It is demonstrated that the structural coloration, mechanochromism and non&#8208;Newtonian shear&#8208;thinning behavior of the lyotropic HPC solutions can all be retained into the gel state. Moreover, the rigidity of the HPC&#8208;gel provides a 69% shorter mechanochromic relaxation time back to its initial color when compared to the liquid HPC&#8211;water only system, broadening the dynamic color range of HPC by approximately 2.5&#215; in response to a compressive pressure. Finally, the ability to formulate the HPC&#8208;gels in a scalable fashion from only water and &#8220;food&#8208;grade&#8221; constituents unlocks a wide range of potential applications, from response&#8209;tunable mechanochromic materials and colorant&#8208;free food decoration, to short&#8208;term sensors in, for example, biodegradable &#8220;smart labels&#8221; for food packaging.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Forces in Rock&#8208;Salt&#8208;Type Tellurides and How they Mirror the Underlying Chemical Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examining the chemical bonding in rock&#8208;salt&#8208;type IV&#8211;VI functional materials by projected force constants as derived from ab initio thermochemistry yields unusually strong long&#8208;range forces along the cubic lattice vectors, impossible to account for by either two&#8208;center covalent or ionic bonding. The full analysis, including orbital&#8208;based bonding descriptors, points toward hyperbonding, thereby explaining certain unique properties of this material class.








Abstract
Chemical bonding in main&#8208;group IV chalcogenides is an intensely discussed topic, easily understandable because of their remarkable physical properties that predestine these solid&#8208;state materials for their widespread use in, for instance, thermoelectrics and phase&#8208;change memory applications. The atomistic origin of their unusual property portfolio remains somewhat unclear, however, even though different and sometimes conflicting chemical&#8208;bonding concepts have been introduced in the recent years. Here, it is proposed that projecting phononic force&#8208;constant tensors for pairs of atoms along differing directions and ranges provide a suitable and quantitative descriptor of the bonding nature for these materials. In combination with orbital&#8208;based quantitative measures of covalency such as crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP), it is concluded that the well&#8208;established many&#8208;center and even n&#8208;center bonding is an appropriate picture of the underlying quantum&#8208;chemical bonding mechanism, supporting the recent proposal of hyperbonded phase&#8208;change materials.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made Polyhydroxyalkanoates by Reconstructing Pseudomonas Entomophila</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performing bacterial platform for customized SCL&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL PHA synthesis is developed via rational fine&#8208;tuning approaches, based on which, a series of P(3HB&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL 3HA) copolymers are generated with 3HA ranging from 9 to 18 carbon atoms. The PHA copolymer family has thus been further expanded, generating various novel material properties and broader prospects for value&#8208;added applications.








Abstract
Microbial polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) containing short&#8208; and medium/long&#8208;chain&#8208;length monomers, abbreviated as SCL&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL PHAs, generate suitable thermal and mechanical properties. However, SCL&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL PHAs with carbon chain longer than nine are difficult to synthesize due to the low specificity of PHA synthase PhaC and the lack of either SCL&#8208; or MCL/LCL monomer precursor fluxes. This study succeeds in reprogramming a &#946;&#8208;oxidation weakened Pseudomonas entomophila containing synthesis pathways of SCL 3&#8208;hydroxybutyryl&#8208;CoA (3HB) from glucose and MCL/LCL 3&#8208;hydroxyalkanoyl&#8208;CoA from fatty acids with carbon chain lengths from 9 to 18, respectively, that are polymerized under a low specificity PhaC61&#8208;3 to form P(3HB&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL 3HA) copolymers. Through rational flux&#8208;tuning approaches, the optimized recombinant P. entomophila accumulates 55 wt% poly&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate in 8.4&#160;g L&#8722;1 cell dry weight. Combined with weakened &#946;&#8208;oxidation, a series of novel P(3HB&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL 3HA) copolymers with over 60 wt% PHA in 9&#160;g L&#8722;1 cell dry weight have been synthesized for the first time. P. entomophila has become a high&#8208;performing platform to generate tailor&#8208;made new SCL&#8208;co&#8208;MCL/LCL PHAs.

Through this reaction, highly nonplanar small molecules (NSMs) containing Michler's base donors and a tricyanoquinodimethane acceptor are rationally designed and synthesized in high yields. The assembled nanoparticles (NSMN) with ultrafast nonradiative decay achieve effective in vivo photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy against tumor.








Abstract
There has been much recent progress in the development of photothermal agents (PTAs) for biomedical and energy applications. Synthesis of organic PTAs typically involves noble metal catalysts and high temperatures. On the other hand, photochemical synthesis, as an alternative and green chemical technology, has obvious merits such as low cost, energy efficiency, and high yields. However, photochemical reactions have rarely been employed for the synthesis of PTAs. Herein, a facile and high&#8208;yield photochemical reaction is exploited for synthesizing nonplanar small molecules (NSMs) containing strong Michler's base donors and a tricyanoquinodimethane acceptor as high&#8208;performance PTAs. The synthesized NSMs show interesting photophysical properties including good absorption for photons of over 1000&#160;nm wavelength, high near&#8208;infrared extinction coefficients, and excellent photothermal performance. Upon assembling the NSMs into nanoparticles (NSMN), they exhibit good biocompatibility, high photostability, and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of 75%. Excited&#8208;state dynamic studies reveal that the NSMN has ultrafast nonradiative decay after photoexcitation. With these unique properties, the NSMN achieves efficient in vivo photoacoustic imaging and photothermal tumor ablation. This work demonstrates the superior potential of photochemical reactions for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance molecular PTAs.

         <title>Antiperovskite Gd3SnC: Unusual Coexistence of Ferromagnetism and Heavy Fermions in Gd Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronically inverted structures with switched crystallographic positions of cations and anions from the original structure allow an exotic phenomenon to be accessed. Antiperovskite Gd3SnC exhibits unusual coexistence of ferromagnetism and heavy fermions, contradicting the common belief that heavy&#8208;fermion behavior cannot emerge in ferromagnetic 4f&#8208;block elements. These unusual phenomena originate from the mixed bonding nature of antiperovskite structure.








Abstract
Inverted structures of common crystal lattices, referred to as antistructures, are rare in nature due to their thermodynamic constraints imposed by the switched cation and anion positions in reference to the original structure. However, a stable antistructure formed with mixed bonding characters of constituent elements in unusual valence states can provide unexpected material properties. Here, a heavy&#8208;fermion behavior of ferromagnetic gadolinium lattice in Gd3SnC antiperovskite is reported, contradicting the common belief that ferromagnetic gadolinium cannot be a heavy&#8208;fermion system due to the deep energy level of localized 4f&#8208;electrons. The specific heat shows an unusually large Sommerfeld coefficient of &#8776;1114 mJ mol&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 with a logarithmic behavior of non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;liquid state. It is demonstrated that the heavy&#8208;fermion behavior in the non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;liquid state appears to arise from the hybridized electronic states of gadolinium 5d&#8208;electrons participating in metallic Gd&#63743;Gd and covalent Gd&#63743;C bonds. These results accentuate the unusual chemical bonds in CGd6 octahedra with the dual characters of gadolinium 5d&#8208;electrons for the emergence of heavy fermions.

         <title>Modulation of Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque from SrRuO3 by Epitaxial&#8208;Strain&#8208;Induced Octahedral Rotation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal oxide perovskite oxides can have pronounced Berry phase curvatures and moderate electric conductivity, making them good sources of spin&#8211;orbit torque. The spin&#8211;orbit torque efficiency of SrRuO3 of three different crystal phases is investigated. Both experimental and theoretical results suggest that the spin&#8211;orbit torque efficiency is strongly correlated to the in&#8208;plane octahedral rotation in SrRuO3.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT), which arises from the spin&#8211;orbit coupling of conduction electrons, is believed to be the key route for developing low&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed, and nonvolatile memory devices. Despite the theoretical prediction of pronounced Berry phase curvatures in certain transition&#8208;metal perovskite oxides, which lead to considerable intrinsic spin Hall conductivity, SOT from this class of materials has rarely been reported until recently. Here, the SOT generated by epitaxial SrRuO3 of three different crystal structures is systematically studied. The results of both spin&#8208;torque ferromagnetic resonance and in&#8208;plane harmonic Hall voltage measurements concurrently reveal that the intrinsic SOT efficiency of SrRuO3 decreases when the epitaxial strain changes from tensile to compressive. The X&#8208;ray diffraction data demonstrate a strong correlation between the magnitude of SOT and octahedral rotation around the in&#8208;plane axes of SrRuO3, consistent with the theoretical prediction. This work offers new possibilities of tuning SOT with crystal structures and novel opportunities of integrating the unique properties of perovskite oxides with spintronic functionalities.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Field Effect on Excitonic Photoluminescence in Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature intrinsic magnetic field effect is realized in perovskite nanocrystals. The circular polarization of exciton photoluminescence in CsPbCl3 is enhanced by sp&#8211;d interactions with Mn doping, and is further stabilized by exciton orbital ordering with partial Br substitution, which induces 4.6% circular polarization ratio at room temperature in a 35 T magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced spin&#8208;polarized electronic/optical properties in semiconductors are crucial for fabricating various spintronic devices. However, this spin polarization is governed by weak spin exchange interactions and easily randomized by thermal fluctuations; therefore, it is only produced at cryogenic temperatures, which severely limits the applications. Herein, a room&#8208;temperature intrinsic magnetic field effect (MFE) on excitonic photoluminescence is achieved in CsPbX3:Mn (X = Cl, Br) perovskite nanocrystals. Through moderate Mn doping, the MFE is enhanced by exciton&#8211;Mn interactions, and through partial Br substitution, the MFE is stabilized at room temperature by exciton orbital ordering. The orbital ordering significantly enhances the g&#8208;factor difference between electrons and holes, which is evidenced by a parallel orbit&#8211;orbit interaction among excitons generated by circular polarized laser excitation. This study provides a clear avenue for engineering spintronic materials based on orbital interactions in perovskites.

How to achieve simulated microgravity conditions on Earth? The art of growing and processing 2D porous crystalline molecular frameworks in simulated microgravity is presented.








Abstract
To date, crystallization studies conducted in space laboratories, which are prohibitively costly and unsuitable to most research laboratories, have shown the valuable effects of microgravity during crystal growth and morphogenesis. Herein, an easy and highly efficient method is shown to achieve space&#8208;like experimentation conditions on Earth employing custom&#8208;made microfluidic devices to fabricate 2D porous crystalline molecular frameworks. It is confirmed that experimentation under these simulated microgravity conditions has unprecedented effects on the orientation, compactness and crack&#8208;free generation of 2D porous crystalline molecular frameworks as well as in their integration and crystal morphogenesis. It is believed that this work will provide a new &#8220;playground&#8221; to chemists, physicists, and materials scientists that desire to process unprecedented 2D functional materials and devices.

         <title>Poly(ionic liquid)s Containing Alkoxy Chains and Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide Anions as Highly Adhesive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel, non&#8208;catechol, and efficient poly(ionic liquid)s adhesives are obtained by appending alkoxy chains onto the cationic backbone. These poly(ionic liquid)s exhibit tough and long&#8208;term adhesion toward various substrates and can be further designed as photosensitive or electronically conductive materials when combined with carbon nanotubes or silver nanofibers. Particularly, the adhesive strength can be improved by 35% when applying an electric field.








Abstract
Adhesive materials have wide applications in diverse fields, but the development of a novel and multipurpose adhesive is a great challenge. This study demonstrates that conventional poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) can be designed as highly efficient adhesives by simply introducing alkoxy moieties into the cationic backbone of PILs containing bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) (TFSI&#8722;) anions. The incorporated flexible alkoxy chain not only reduces the glass transition temperature of PILs but also endows these materials with strong hydrogen bonding interactions, which, together with the unique electrostatic interaction of the PILs, simultaneously contributes to a high cohesive energy and interfacial adhesive energy. Consequently, these alkoxy PILs are highly adhesive on various substrates such as glass, ceramic, stainless steel, aluminum, and polymers, in contrast to the nonadhesive behavior of conventional PILs. Photosensitive or electronically conductive composite adhesives are fabricated by virtue of the compatibility between ionic liquids and carbon nanotubes or silver nanofibers. Interestingly, the PIL&#8208;2&#8208;TFSI adhesive possesses a unique and reversible response to electric fields and achieves up to 35% improvement in adhesive strength.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Acrylate Liquid Single Crystal Elastomers Reinforced by Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chemical approach to fabricating monodomain LCE based on aza&#8208;Michael addition is developed, compatible with both liquid and gel alignment techniques, to manufacture actuators with versatile shapes. The facile process involving simply mixing two components is enabled by the two&#8208;stage differentiated kinetics of primary amines toward acrylates, generating hydrogen bonding, enhancing the mechanical properties of the elastomer.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) have been considered one of the most promising material concepts for artificial muscles. However, accomplishing actuation of LCEs requires macroscopic alignment of the liquid&#8208;crystalline orientation in the rubbery network, which imposes challenges in the materials chemistry and processing. A two&#8208;stage curing strategy has been the dominating approach during last three decades. Despite its many successes, the method is difficult in practice and requires delicate experiential skills, dealing with intrinsic fragility of intermediate gels after the first crosslinking stage. Here, a robust fabrication method for monodomain LCE based on the amine&#8208;acrylate aza&#8208;Michael addition is developed, involving two readily commercially available components with no catalyst. The method is based on the large kinetic difference of hydrogen addition in primary amines to acrylates, which offers a sufficient gap separating two stages of curing and enabling versatile mechanical alignment techniques for manufacturing monodomain LCE in both liquid and gel states. Importantly, the mechanically robust network, helping processability at a partial&#8208;crosslinking stage, is facilitated by the chemically generated hydrogen bonding all through the process, as a by&#8208;product of hydrogen addition. Such a facile two&#8208;component kit&#8208;like fabrication should aid researchers from various fields in the search for a practical and reliable process of making soft actuators.

         <title>Design and Mechanism of a Self&#8208;Powered and Disintegration&#8211;Reorganization&#8211;Regeneration Power Supply with Cold Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imitating the regeneration of the planarian, a self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration power supply with relatively stable discharge for 8.3 h is realized. Additionally, the mechanism is investigated systematically by molecular dynamics simulation, and this power supply with a variety of self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration units can discharge continuously at freezing temperature and variable temperature (0&#8211;25 &#176;C).








Abstract
Up to now, power supplies designed based on the electrochemical reaction principle have had&#160;unavoidable defects, in that a complete redox reaction must be formed inside the power supply to operate normally, which makes it unable to be reconstructed and regenerated. Hence, the design and interpretation of this self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration power supply are generally considered to be almost insurmountable obstacles to haunt both experimenters and theorists. Herein, a self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration power supply with relatively stable discharge for 8.3 h is realized by the principle of ion&#8208;selective diffusion, which regenerates by radical polymerization. Additionally, the mechanism is investigated systematically by molecular dynamics simulation, and this power supply with a variety of self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration units can discharge continuously at freezing temperatures and variable temperature (0&#8211;25 &#176;C). As a hypothetical model, a self&#8208;powered and deformable arch bridge with disintegration and reorganization is fabricated. In the future, this power supply is expected to be applied in prosthetic limbs, bionic skins, implantable power supplies, mobile phones, portable computers, wearable devices, etc. Moreover, with the improvement of the stability and discharge life, it could promote major revolutionary breakthroughs in the fields of intelligent industrial automation, smart buildings, intelligent transportation systems, intelligent power systems, etc.

         <title>A Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanocomposite for Hydrogen Sulfide Gas and Trimodal&#8208;Enhanced Enzyme Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designed nanocomposite based on tetra&#8208;sulfide&#8208;bond&#8208;incorporated dendritic mesoporous organosilica as an effective cornerstone to load with chloroperoxidase (CPO) and sodium hyaluronate modified calcium peroxide nanoparticles (CaO2&#8208;HA NPs) can release Ca2+, hydrogen peroxide, and CPO rapidly in the tumor microenvironment and generate hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Therefore, H2S gas, tri&#8208;enhanced enzyme dynamic therapy, and Ca2+&#8208;interference combined tumor therapy strategy is established.








Abstract
Recently, enzyme dynamic therapy (EDT) has drawn much attention as a new type of dynamic therapy. However, the selection of suitable nanocarriers to deliver chloroperoxidase (CPO) and enhancement of the level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are critical factors for improving the efficiency of EDT. In this study, a rapidly decomposing nanocomposite is designed using tetra&#8208;sulfide&#8208;bond&#8208;incorporating dendritic mesoporous organosilica (DMOS) as a nanocarrier, followed by loading CPO and sodium&#8208;hyaluronate&#8208;modified calcium peroxide nanoparticles (CaO2&#8208;HA NPs). The nanocomposite can effectively generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for tumor therapy without any exogenous stimulus via trimodal&#8208;enhanced EDT, including DMOS&#8208;induced depletion of glutathione (GSH), H2O2 compensation from CaO2&#8208;HA NPs in mildly acidic TME, and oxidative stress caused by overloading of Ca2+. As tetra&#8208;sulfide bonds are sensitive to GSH, DMOS can generate hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas as a new kind of H2S gas nanoreactor. Additionally, the overloading of Ca2+ can cause tumor calcification to accelerate in vivo tumor necrosis and promote computed tomography imaging efficacy. Therefore, a novel H2S gas, EDT, and Ca2+&#8208;interference combined therapy strategy is developed.

         <title>Curvature Induced by Deflection in Thick Meta&#8208;Plates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of advanced functional devices often requires intrinsically curved geometries that belong to the realm of non&#8208;Euclidean geometry. Thick meta&#8208;plates based on hexagonal cellular mesostructures are used to achieve a wide range of intrinsic (i.e., Gaussian) curvatures. A scaling relationship is presented to predict the deformation&#8208;induced curvature of thick plates and their micro&#8208;architectural design variables.

The design of advanced functional devices often requires the use of intrinsically curved geometries that belong to the realm of non&#8208;Euclidean geometry and remain a challenge for traditional engineering approaches. Here, it is shown how the simple deflection of thick meta&#8208;plates based on hexagonal cellular mesostructures can be used to achieve a wide range of intrinsic (i.e., Gaussian) curvatures, including dome&#8208;like and saddle&#8208;like shapes. Depending on the unit cell structure, non&#8208;auxetic (i.e., positive Poisson ratio) or auxetic (i.e., negative Poisson ratio) plates can be obtained, leading to a negative or positive value of the Gaussian curvature upon bending, respectively. It is found that bending such meta&#8208;plates along their longitudinal direction induces a curvature along their transverse direction. Experimentally and numerically, it is shown how the amplitude of this induced curvature is related to the longitudinal bending and the geometry of the meta&#8208;plate. The approach proposed here constitutes a general route for the rational design of advanced functional devices with intrinsically curved geometries. To demonstrate the merits of this approach, a scaling relationship is presented, and its validity is demonstrated by applying it to 3D&#8208;printed microscale meta&#8208;plates. Several applications for adaptive optical devices with adjustable focal length and soft wearable robotics are presented.

         <title>Magnetic Dynamic Polymers for Modular Assembling and Reconfigurable Morphing Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic dynamic polymer composites composed of hard&#8208;magnetic microparticles in thermally reversible dynamic polymer networks for multifunctional assemblies and reconfigurable architectures are reported. These composites integrate the functionalities of targeted welding of modular assembling with complex actuation, magnetization reprogramming with altered shape&#8208;morphing mode, and remote&#8208;controlled permanent structural reconfiguration, opening a new avenue for manufacturing multifunctional and reconfigurable morphing architectures and devices.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;morphing magnetic soft materials, composed of magnetic particles in a soft polymer matrix, can transform shape reversibly, remotely, and rapidly, finding diverse applications in actuators, soft robotics, and biomedical devices. To achieve on&#8208;demand and sophisticated shape morphing, the manufacture of structures with complex geometry and magnetization distribution is highly desired. Here, a magnetic dynamic polymer (MDP) composite composed of hard&#8208;magnetic microparticles in a dynamic polymer network with thermally responsive reversible linkages, which permits functionalities including targeted welding for magnetic&#8208;assisted assembly, magnetization reprogramming, and permanent structural reconfiguration, is reported. These functions not only provide highly desirable structural and material programmability and reprogrammability but also enable the manufacturing of functional soft architected materials such as 3D kirigami with complex magnetization distribution. The welding of magnetic&#8208;assisted modular assembly can be further combined with magnetization reprogramming and permanent reshaping capabilities for programmable and reconfigurable architectures and morphing structures. The reported MDP are anticipated to provide a new paradigm for the design and manufacture of future multifunctional assemblies and reconfigurable morphing architectures and devices.

         <title>Infrared&#8208;Emitting Multimodal Nanostructures for Controlled In Vivo Magnetic Hyperthermia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron oxide and silver sulfide nanoparticles are combined in optomagnetic nanocapsules, which can act as multimodal contrast agents for several imaging modalities (fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, optical tomography, and photoacoustic imaging). More importantly, these nanocapsules enable real&#8208;time subcutaneous thermal monitoring of magnetic hyperthermia processes, paving the way to fully controlled magnetic therapies.








Abstract
Deliberate and local increase of the temperature within solid tumors represents an effective therapeutic approach. Thermal therapies embrace this concept leveraging the capability of some species to convert the absorbed energy into heat. To that end, magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) uses magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) that can effectively dissipate the energy absorbed under alternating magnetic fields. However, MNPs fail to provide real&#8208;time thermal feedback with the risk of unwanted overheating and impeding on&#8208;the&#8208;fly adjustment of the therapeutic parameters. Localization of MNPs within a tissue in an accurate, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective way represents another challenge for increasing the efficacy of MHT. In this work, MNPs are combined with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art infrared luminescent nanothermometers (LNTh; Ag2S nanoparticles) in a nanocapsule that simultaneously overcomes these limitations. The novel optomagnetic nanocapsule acts as multimodal contrast agents for different imaging techniques (magnetic resonance, photoacoustic and near&#8208;infrared fluorescence imaging, optical and X&#8208;ray computed tomography). Most crucially, these nanocapsules provide accurate (0.2&#160;&#176;C resolution) and real&#8208;time subcutaneous thermal feedback during in vivo MHT, also enabling the attainment of thermal maps of the area of interest. These findings are a milestone on the road toward controlled magnetothermal therapies with minimal side effects.

         <title>Anisotropically Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatigue&#8208;resistant hydrogels are fabricated through synergistically engineering the preferentially aligned microstructures and nanocrystalline domains, enabling application as load&#8208;bearing components in underwater robots.








Abstract
Nature builds biological materials from limited ingredients, however, with unparalleled mechanical performances compared to artificial materials, by harnessing inherent structures across multi&#8208;length&#8208;scales. In contrast, synthetic material design overwhelmingly focuses on developing new compounds, and fails to reproduce the mechanical properties of natural counterparts, such as fatigue resistance. Here, a simple yet general strategy to engineer conventional hydrogels with a more than 100&#8208;fold increase in fatigue thresholds is reported. This strategy is proven to be universally applicable to various species of hydrogel materials, including polysaccharides (i.e., alginate, cellulose), proteins (i.e., gelatin), synthetic polymers (i.e., poly(vinyl alcohol)s), as well as corresponding polymer composites. These fatigue&#8208;resistant hydrogels exhibit a record&#8208;high fatigue threshold over most synthetic soft materials, making them low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and durable alternatives to soft materials used in those circumstances including robotics, artificial muscles,&#160;etc.

         <title>Extreme Biomimetics: Designing of the First Nanostructured 3D Spongin&#8211;Atacamite Composite and its Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extreme biomimetics key way for designing of multifunctional macroporous 3D atacamite&#8208;based composites using the renewable biopolymer spongin is proposed. Neutron diffraction, X&#8208;ray diffraction, selected&#8208;area electron diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy provide insights, which help to understand a mechanism for its formation from a model solution that simulates the highly toxic copper&#8208;containing waste generated in the production of printed circuit boards worldwide.








Abstract
The design of new composite materials using extreme biomimetics is of crucial importance for bioinspired materials science. Further progress in research and application of these new materials is impossible without understanding the mechanisms of formation, as well as structural features at the molecular and nano&#8208;level. It presents a challenge to obtain a holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying the interaction of organic and inorganic phases under conditions of harsh chemical reactions for biopolymers. Yet, an understanding of these mechanisms can lead to the development of unusual&#8212;but functional&#8212;hybrid materials. In this work, a key way of designing centimeter&#8208;scale macroporous 3D composites, using renewable marine biopolymer spongin and a model industrial solution that simulates the highly toxic copper&#8208;containing waste generated in the production of printed circuit boards worldwide, is proposed. A new spongin&#8211;atacamite composite material is developed and its structure is confirmed using neutron diffraction, X&#8208;ray diffraction, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy/selected&#8208;area electron diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The formation mechanism for this material is also proposed. This study provides experimental evidence suggesting multifunctional applicability of the designed composite in the development of 3D constructed sensors, catalysts, and antibacterial filter systems.

         <title>Engineering Fe&#8211;N Coordination Structures for Fast Redox Conversion in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated catalyst comprising single&#8208;atom Fe and Fe2N composite sites, with dual&#8208;tailed Fe&#8211;N coordination structures, co&#8208;decorated on N&#8208;doped graphene is successfully constructed and demonstrated. The catalyst optimizes the polysulfide absorption&#8211;catalysis behavior, thereby facilitating fast redox conversion and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, the Li&#8211;S batteries exhibit high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycling stability.








Abstract
Critical drawbacks, including sluggish redox kinetics and undesirable shuttling of polysulfides (Li2Sn, n&#160;= 4&#8211;8), seriously deteriorate the electrochemical performance of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, these challenges are addressed by constructing an integrated catalyst with dual active sites, where single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;Fe and polar Fe2N are co&#8208;embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG). The SA&#8208;Fe, with plane&#8208;symmetric Fe&#8208;4N coordination, and Fe2N, with triangular pyramidal Fe&#8208;3N coordination, in this well&#8208;designed configuration exhibit synergistic adsorption of polysulfides and catalytic selectivity for Li2Sn lithiation and Li2S delithiation, respectively. These characteristics endow the SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG&#8208;modified separator with an optimal polysulfides confinement&#8211;catalysis ability, thus accelerating the bidirectional liquid&#8211;solid conversion (Li2Sn&#8596;Li2S) and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, a Li&#8211;S battery based on the SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG separator achieves a high capacity retention of 84.1% over 500 cycles at 1 C (pure S cathode, S content: 70&#160;wt%) and a high areal capacity of 5.02 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C (SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG&#8208;supported S cathode, S loading = 5 mg&#160;cm&#8722;2). It is expected that the outcomes of the present study will facilitate the design of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts for long&#8208;lasting Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>All&#8208;In&#8208;One Dendrimer&#8208;Based Lipid Nanoparticles Enable Precise HDR&#8208;Mediated Gene Editing In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;viral, lipid nanoparticle (dLNP) delivery platform capable of co&#8208;encapsulating and delivering Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, and an ssDNA template is developed for homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR)&#8208;mediated gene correction of DNA mutations in vivo. The relative ratios of lipids and nucleic acids are systematically optimized to induce high HDR efficiency, thereby guiding potential treatment opportunities for correction of mutations that cause disease.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR&#8208;associated (Cas) protein gene editing is poised to transform the treatment of genetic diseases. However, limited progress has been made toward precise editing of DNA via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR) that requires careful orchestration of complex steps. Herein, dendrimer&#8208;based lipid nanoparticles (dLNPs) are engineered to co&#8208;encapsulate and deliver multiple components for in vivo HDR correction. BFP/GFP switchable HEK293 cells with a single Y66H amino acid mutation are employed to assess HDR&#8208;mediated gene editing following simultaneous, one&#8208;pot delivery of Cas9 mRNA, single&#8208;guide RNA, and donor DNA. Molar ratios of individual LNP components and weight ratios of the three nucleic acids are systematically optimized to increase HDR efficiency. Using flow cytometry, fluorescence imaging, and DNA sequencing to quantify editing, optimized 4A3&#8208;SC8 dLNPs edit &gt;91%&#160;of all cells with 56% HDR efficiency in vitro and &gt;20%&#160;HDR efficiency in xenograft tumors in vivo. Due to the all&#8208;in&#8208;one simplicity and high efficacy, the developed dLNPs offer a promising route toward the gene correction of disease&#8208;causing mutations.

         <title>Direct Integration of Strained&#8208;Pt Catalysts into Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells with Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designer electrocatalysts can be deposited via atomic layer deposition onto support structures for performance evaluation under various platforms. In this example, strained platinum catalysts are formed by dissolving cobalt oxide from the Pt/CoOx core&#8211;shell structure. Performance enhancement seen on the rotating disk electrode is validated in the membrane electrode assembly.








Abstract
The design and fabrication of lattice&#8208;strained platinum catalysts achieved by removing a soluble core from a platinum shell synthesized via atomic layer deposition, is reported. The remarkable catalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), measured in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell configurations, is attributed to the observed lattice strain. By further optimizing the nanoparticle geometry and ionomer/carbon interactions, mass activity close to 0.8&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 @0.9&#160;V iR&#8208;free is achievable in the membrane electrode assembly. Nevertheless, active catalysts with high ORR activity do not necessarily lead to high performance in the high&#8208;current&#8208;density (HCD) region. More attention shall be directed toward HCD performance for enabling high&#8208;power&#8208;density hydrogen fuel cells.

         <title>Customized Photothermal Therapy of Subcutaneous Orthotopic Cancer by Multichannel Luminescent Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to establish customized therapeutic prescriptions for photothermal ablation to orthotopic breast tumors. By utilizing a multichannel lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoprobe, the parameters indicating individual intratumoral differences are analyzed through fluorescence imaging for constructing a 2D diagram of model prescriptions as the reference of actual treatments.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a potentially advanced strategy for highly precise cancer treatment. Tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;activatable agents provide useful tools for PTT, but their photothermal conversion capacities vary and cannot be evaluated in vivo; thus, a general PTT prescription does not work with individual activatable agents. Here, glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable nanocomposites, silicomolybdate&#8208;functionalized NaLuF4:Yb,Er@NaLuF4@NaLuF4:Nd are prepared, for customized PTT of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer. By simultaneously determining intratumoral GSH concentration and the amount of accumulated agent using multiple orthogonal luminescent emissions of nanocomposites, near&#8208;infrared absorbance of photothermal conversion agents is evaluated in vivo, based on the optimized irradiating prescriptions (irradiating power density and time) established. This allows customized PTT of each individual case with high efficacy and viability. This work also includes a method for investigating individual intratumoral variation, and the development of the next generation of customized nanomedicine for efficacious PTT of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer.

         <title>Multimodal Digital X&#8208;ray Scanners with Synchronous Mapping of Tactile Pressure Distributions using Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the multimodal integration of perovskite&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors and pressure&#8208;sensitive air&#8208;dielectric transistors, synchronous mapping of internal structures and morphologies of the object is realized. This work provides the simultaneous imaging of anatomical structures and the pressure distribution using the multiplexed platform, thereby indicating the substantial potential of the system for next&#8208;generation, non&#8208;destructive inspection and medical diagnosis.








Abstract
Visual and tactile information are the key intuitive perceptions in sensory systems, and the synchronized detection of these two sensory modalities can enhance accuracy of object recognition by providing complementary information between them. Herein, multimodal integration of flexible, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray detectors with a synchronous mapping of tactile pressure distributions for visualizing internal structures and morphologies of an object simultaneously is reported. As a visual&#8208;inspection method, perovskite materials that convert X&#8208;rays into charge carriers directly are synthesized. By incorporating pressure&#8208;sensitive air&#8208;dielectric transistors in the perovskite components, X&#8208;ray detectors with dual modalities (i.e., vision and touch) are attained as an active&#8208;matrix platform for digital visuotactile examinations. Also, in vivo X&#8208;ray imaging and pressure sensing are demonstrated using a live rat. This multiplexed platform has high spatial resolution and good flexibility, thereby providing highly accurate inspection and diagnoses even for the distorted images of nonplanar objects.

         <title>3D Anisotropic Au@Pt&#8211;Pd Hemispherical Nanostructures as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Methanol, Ethanol, and Formic Acid Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic 3D nanocatalyst with both morphological and elemental anisotropy shows excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability due to its special uneven distribution and asymmetric nanostructure characteristics. The 3D anisotropic hemispherical nanostructures prepared in this work exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability, which provides an inspiration for the creative synthesis of highly efficient electrocatalysts with 3D anisotropic nanostructures.








Abstract
Anisotropic 3D nanostructures exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability due to their heterogeneous elemental distribution and unsymmetrical configuration. However, it is still a huge challenge to combine anisotropically distributed elements and anisotropic morphologies within one 3D nanostructure. Herein, 3D Au@Pt&#8211;Pd hemispherical nanostructures (Au@Pt&#8211;Pd H&#8208;Ss) are fabricated as highly efficient electrocatalysts for oxidation reaction, which present heterogenous element distribution and anisotropic morphology. It is demonstrated that the non&#8208;uniform adsorption of BO2&#8722; on Au&#8208;CTA+ surface, as well as the simulated lower formation energy of Pt&#8211;Pd atoms for Au&#8208;CTA+&#8208;BO2&#8208;, basically contribute to the eventual formation of Au@Pt&#8211;Pd H&#8208;Ss. Impressively, the unique anisotropic Au@Pt&#8211;Pd H&#8208;Ss exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity and durability for methanol, ethanol, and formic acid oxidation reaction compared with commercial Pt/C and previously reported noble&#8208;metal based electrocatalysts. Especially, the mass activity of Au@Pt&#8211;Pd H&#8208;Ss for MOR is 4.38 A mgPt+Pd&#8208;1, which is about 2.0 and 4.7 times that of Au@Pt&#8211;Pd spherical nanostructures (Au@Pt&#8211;Pd Ss) and commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. This work provides an important reference for the design and preparation of 3D anisotropic and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts.

         <title>Wirelessly Actuated Thermo&#8208; and Magneto&#8208;Responsive Soft Bimorph Materials with Programmable Shape&#8208;Morphing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimorph material with uncoupled integration of a magnetic&#8208;responsive elastomer with a liquid crystal elastomer is reported. This material can be actuated by both magnetic and heat stimuli. It enables heterogenous material properties and local addressability for independent control of separate parts within a single device. It introduces a new dimension in the design and control of wireless soft machines.








Abstract
Soft materials that respond to wireless external stimuli are referred to as &#8220;smart&#8221; materials due to their promising potential in real&#8208;world actuation and sensing applications in robotics, microfluidics, and bioengineering. Recent years have witnessed a burst of these stimuli&#8208;responsive materials and their preliminary applications. However, their further advancement demands more versatility, configurability, and adaptability to deliver their promised benefits. Here, a dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive soft bimorph material with three configurations that enable complex programmable 3D shape&#8208;morphing is presented. The material consists of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) and magnetic&#8208;responsive elastomers (MREs) via facile fabrication that orthogonally integrates their respective stimuli&#8208;responsiveness without detrimentally altering their properties. The material offers an unprecedented wide design space and abundant degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedoms (DoFs) due to the LCE's programmable director field, the MRE's programmable magnetization profile, and diverse geometric configurations. It responds to wireless stimuli of the controlled magnetic field and environmental temperature. Its dual&#8208;responsiveness allows the independent control of different DoFs for complex shape&#8208;morphing behaviors with anisotropic material properties. A diverse set of in situ reconfigurable shape&#8208;morphing and an environment&#8208;aware untethered miniature 12&#8208;legged robot capable of locomotion and self&#8208;gripping are demonstrated. Such material can provide solutions for the development of future soft robotic and other functional devices.

         <title>Sphingosine 1&#8208;Phosphate Liposomes for Targeted Nitric Oxide Delivery to Mediate Anticancer Effects against Brain Glioma Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phospholipid&#8208;signaling sphingolipid hybrid and glutathione S&#8208;transferase (GST)&#8208;responsive liposome is successfully developed, which is able to specifically and safely deliver the therapeutic prodrug JS&#8208;K into glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors. Nitric oxide (NO) production in the tumor microenvironment is quantified by ultrasound imaging visualization. This study validates S1P liposomes as an effective drug delivery system for carcinomas.








Abstract
Specifically targeting glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) blood vessels and actively enhancing the permeability of the brain&#8211;blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BBTB) are two extremely difficult challenges currently hindering the development of effective therapies against GBM. Herein, a liposome drug delivery system (S1P/JS&#8208;K/Lipo) is described, which delivers the nitric oxide (NO) prodrug JS&#8208;K, O2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dinitrophenyl) 1&#8208;[(4&#8208;ethoxycarbonyl) piperazin&#8208;1&#8208;yl] diazen&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1,2&#8208;diolate, to GBM tumors using sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (S1P)&#8208;signaling molecules as active targeting lipid ligands. It is revealed that S1P/JS&#8208;K/Lipo actively penetrates the BBTB, aided by caveolin&#8208;1&#8208;mediated transcytosis, and it is demonstrated that the system specifically interacts with S1P receptors (S1PRs), which are highly expressed on GBM cells. Nondestructive ultrasound imaging in GBM mouse models is also utilized to observe microsized NO bubble production from JS&#8208;K, as catalyzed by the glutathione S&#8208;transferases (GSTs) resident in GBM cells. Given that these NO bubbles strongly promote GBM cell death in vivo, the S1PR&#8208;targeted liposome delivery system&#8212;which successfully achieves BBTB penetration and tumor targeted delivery of a complex multicomponent drug regimen&#8212;represents a promising approach for targeted therapies against GBM and other carcinomas characterized by elevated S1PR expression.

Crosslinked cationic dextran nanogels are identified as unique polycationic nanomaterials capable of mediating direct cytosolic delivery of membrane&#8208;impermeable cargo. The efficient delivery of various macromolecules in HeLa cells and primary cells is demonstrated. Moreover, this approach outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electroporation for the delivery of neutral macromolecules and the MRI contrast agent gadobutrol in primary human T cells.








Abstract
Intracellular delivery of membrane&#8208;impermeable cargo offers unique opportunities for biological research and the development of cell&#8208;based therapies. Despite the breadth of available intracellular delivery tools, existing protocols are often suboptimal and alternative approaches that merge delivery efficiency with both biocompatibility, as well as applicability, remain highly sought after. Here, a comprehensive platform is presented that exploits the unique property of cationic hydrogel nanoparticles to transiently disrupt the plasma membrane of cells, allowing direct cytosolic delivery of uncomplexed membrane&#8208;impermeable cargo. Using this platform, which is termed Hydrogel&#8208;enabled nanoPoration or HyPore, the delivery of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)&#8211;dextran macromolecules in various cancer cell lines and primary bovine corneal epithelial cells is convincingly demonstrated. Of note, HyPore demonstrates efficient FITC&#8208;dextran delivery in primary human T cells, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electroporation&#8208;mediated delivery. Moreover, the HyPore platform enables cytosolic delivery of functional proteins, including a histone&#8208;binding nanobody as well as the enzymes granzyme A and Cre&#8208;recombinase. Finally, HyPore&#8208;mediated delivery of the MRI contrast agent gadobutrol in primary human T cells significantly improves their T1&#8208;weighted MRI signal intensities compared to electroporation. Taken together, HyPore is proposed as a straightforward, highly versatile, and cost&#8208;effective technique for high&#8208;throughput, ex vivo manipulation of primary cells and cell lines.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Quantum Memories Based on Molecular Electron Spin Ensembles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ensembles of weakly exchange coupled organic radicals form strongly coupled systems with 3D microwave resonators. Time&#8208;domain pulsed microwave investigations reveal long, largely temperature&#8208;independent quantum coherence times. The room&#8208;temperature storage and retrieval of microwave pulses is demonstrated.








Abstract
Whilst quantum computing has recently taken great leaps ahead, the development of quantum memories has decidedly lagged behind. Quantum memories are essential devices in the quantum technology palette and are needed for intermediate storage of quantum bit states and as quantum repeaters in long&#8208;distance quantum communication. Current quantum memories operate at cryogenic, mostly sub&#8208;Kelvin temperatures and require extensive and costly peripheral hardware. It is demonstrated that ensembles of weakly coupled molecular spins show long coherence times and can be used to store microwave pulses of arbitrary phase. These studies exploit strong coupling of the spin ensemble to special 3D microwave resonators. Most importantly, these systems operate at room temperature.

         <title>Nanographene&#8211;Osmapentalyne Complexes as a Cathode Interlayer in Organic Solar Cells Enhance Efficiency over 18%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Newly synthesized hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8211;osmapentalyne complexes that combine fragments of graphene and metalla&#8208;aromatics are emerging as cathode interlayer materials. Further extending the d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugated systems of osmapentalynes, the most successful complex, in this work, HBC&#8208;S is found to boost the efficiency of non&#8208;fullerene solar cells to over 18%.








Abstract
Interface engineering is a critical method by which to efficiently enhance the photovoltaic performance of nonfullerene solar cells (NFSC). Herein, a series of metal&#8211;nanographene&#8208;containing large transition metal involving d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugated systems by way of the addition reactions of osmapentalynes and p&#8208;diethynyl&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes is reported. Conjugated extensions are engineered to optimize the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of these metal&#8211;nanographene molecules, which serve as alcohol&#8208;soluble cathode interlayer (CIL) materials. Upon extension of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based NFSCs increases from 16% to over 18%, giving the highest recorded PCE. It is deduced by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, interfacial contact methods, morphology characterization, and carrier dynamics that modification of hexabenzocoronenes&#8208;styryl can effectively improve the short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor of organic solar cells (OSCs), mainly due to the strong and ordered charge transfer, more matching energy level alignments, better interfacial contacts between the active layer and the electrodes, and regulated morphology. Consequently, the carrier transport is largely facilitated, and the carrier recombination is simultaneously impeded. These new CIL materials are broadly able to enhance the photovoltaic properties of OSCs in other systems, which provides a promising potential to serve as CILs for higher&#8208;quality OSCs.

         <title>3D Heterogeneous Device Arrays for Multiplexed Sensing Platforms Using Transfer of Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a removable polymer film, transfer of perovskite arrays to planar or nonplanar surfaces is realized. The total thickness of the fabricated perovskite device is thin enough to form conformal contact on various surfaces with 3D geometries. This work provides the integration of perovskites on contact lenses and pressure sensors, achieving multiplexed sensing platforms for future electronics.








Abstract
Despite recent substantial advances in perovskite materials, their 3D integration capability for next&#8208;generation electronic devices is limited owing to their inherent vulnerability to heat and moisture with degradation of their remarkable optoelectronic properties during fabrication processing. Herein, a facile method to transfer the patterns of perovskites to planar or nonplanar surfaces using a removable polymer is reported. After fabricating perovskite devices on this removable polymer film, the conformal attachment of this film on target surfaces can place the entire devices on various substrates by removing this sacrificial film. This transfer method enables the formation of a perovskite image sensor array on a soft contact lens, and in vivo tests using rabbits demonstrate its wearability. Furthermore, 3D heterogeneous integration of a perovskite photodetector array with an active&#8208;matrix array of pressure&#8208;sensitive silicon transistors using this transfer method demonstrates the formation of a multiplexed sensing platform detecting distributions of light and tactile pressure simultaneously.

         <title>Band Engineering of Dirac Semimetals Using Charge Density Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge density wave (CDW) is proposed as a tool to engineer an idealized Dirac semimetal. The CDW gaps all bands at the Fermi level except the Dirac cone, which is protected by non&#8208;symmorphic symmetry. Antiferromagnetic compounds of GdSbxTe2&#8722;x&#8722;&#948; are designed and synthesized to test this proposed mechanism. Unusual transport behavior is discovered and points to a new regime.








Abstract
New developments in the field of topological matter are often driven by materials discovery, including novel topological insulators, Dirac semimetals, and Weyl semimetals. In the last few years, large efforts have been made to classify all known inorganic materials with respect to their topology. Unfortunately, a large number of topological materials suffer from non&#8208;ideal band structures. For example, topological bands are frequently convoluted with trivial ones, and band structure features of interest can appear far below the Fermi level. This leaves just a handful of materials that are intensively studied. Finding strategies to design new topological materials is a solution. Here, a new mechanism is introduced, which is based on charge density waves and non&#8208;symmorphic symmetry, to design an idealized Dirac semimetal. It is&#160;then shown experimentally that the antiferromagnetic compound GdSb0.46Te1.48 is a nearly ideal Dirac semimetal based on the proposed mechanism, meaning that most interfering bands at the Fermi level are suppressed. Its highly unusual transport behavior points to a thus far unknown regime, in which Dirac carriers with Fermi energy very close to the node seem to gradually localize in the presence of lattice and magnetic&#160;disorder.

         <title>Facile Transformation of Murine and Human Primary Dendritic Cells into Robust and Modular Artificial Antigen&#8208;Presenting Systems by Intracellular Hydrogelation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial antigen cell is prepared by directly transforming live dendritic cells into a cell&#8211;gel hybrid construct by photoactivated intracellular radical polymerization, enabling the preparation of a highly robust and modular cell&#8208;mimicking biomaterial for immunoengineering. The gelated dendritic cells can be stored by lyophilization and effectively expand antigen&#8208;specific T cells for anticancer adoptive cell therapy.








Abstract
The growing enthusiasm for cancer immunotherapies and adoptive cell therapies has prompted increasing interest in biomaterials development mimicking natural antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) for T&#8208;cell expansion. In contrast to conventional bottom&#8208;up approaches aimed at layering synthetic substrates with T&#8208;cell activation cues, transformation of live dendritic cells (DCs) into artificial APCs (aAPCs) is demonstrated herein using a facile and minimally disruptive hydrogelation technique. Through direct intracellular permeation of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG&#8208;DA) hydrogel monomer and UV&#8208;activated radical polymerization, intracellular hydrogelation is rapidly accomplished on DCs with minimal influence on cellular morphology and surface antigen display, yielding highly robust and modular cell&#8211;gel hybrid constructs amenable to peptide antigen exchange, storable by freezing and lyophilization, and functionalizable with cytokine&#8208;releasing carriers for T&#8208;cell modulation. The DC&#8208;derived aAPCs are shown to induce prolonged T&#8208;cell expansion and improve anticancer efficacy of adoptive T&#8208;cell therapy in mice compared to nonexpanded control T cells, and the gelation technique is further demonstrated to stabilize primary DCs derived from human donors. The work presents a versatile approach for generating a new class of cell&#8208;mimicking biomaterials and opens new venues for immunological interrogation and immunoengineering.

         <title>Recent Progress on Perovskite Surfaces and Interfaces in Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress on perovskite surface and interface science of perovskite optoelectronic devices is summarized. The impact of various surface and interface defects on heterojunction energy barriers and carrier dynamics in devices is reviewed and discussed. Practical engineering methods to mitigate these defects at various interfaces in devices are also considered.








Abstract
Surfaces and heterojunction interfaces, where defects and energy levels dictate charge&#8208;carrier dynamics in optoelectronic devices, are critical for unlocking the full potential of perovskite semiconductors. In this progress report, chemical structures of perovskite surfaces are discussed and basic physical rules for the band alignment are summarized at various perovskite interfaces. Common perovskite surfaces are typically decorated by various compositional and structural defects such as residual surface reactants, discrete nanoclusters, reactions by products, vacancies, interstitials, antisites, etc. Some of these surface species induce deep&#8208;level defect states in the forbidden band forming very harmful charge&#8208;carrier traps and affect negatively the interface band alignments for achieving optimal device performance. Herein, an overview of research progresses on surface and interface engineering is provided to minimize deep&#8208;level defect states. The reviewed subjects include selection of interface and substrate buffer layers for growing better crystals, materials and processing methods for surface passivation, the surface catalyst for microstructure transformations, organic semiconductors for charge extraction or injection, heterojunctions with wide bandgap perovskites or nanocrystals for mitigating defects, and electrode interlayer for preventing interdiffusion and reactions. These surface and interface engineering strategies are shown to be critical in boosting device performance for both solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Functional Micro&#8208;/Nanomaterials for Multiplexed Biodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexed detection has gradually occupied the main development trend in the field of biodetection due to its rich information, accurate results, and high efficiency. The challenges of multiplexed detection in three aspects of coding library, detection performance, and workflow are analyzed, and the strategies are provided from the perspective of functional micro&#8208;/nanomaterials.








Abstract
When analyzing biological phenomena and processes, multiplexed biodetection has many advantages over single&#8208;factor biodetection and is highly relevant to both human health issues and advancements in the life sciences. However, many key problems with current multiplexed biodetection strategies remain unresolved. Herein, the main issues are analyzed and summarized: 1)&#160;generating sufficient signal to label targets, 2) improving the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio to ensure total detection sensitivity, and 3) simplifying the detection process to reduce the time and labor costs of multiple target detection. Then, available solutions made possible by designing and controlling the properties of micro&#8208; and nanomaterials are introduced. The aim is to emphasize the role that micro&#8208;/nanomaterials can play in the improvement of multiplexed biodetection strategies. Through analyzing existing problems, introducing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments regarding relevant materials, and discussing future directions of the field, it is hopeful to help promote necessary developments in multiplexed biodetection and associated scientific research.

         <title>Molecular Imprinting: Green Perspectives and Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to increasing concerns about the detrimental impacts of unsustainable molecular imprinting technology (MIT), MIT has veered toward greener pathways. Fourteen green principles specifically for MIT are codified using a nomenclature of &#8220;GREENIFICATION.&#8221; All aspects of greenificated MITs, including fundamentals, strategies, and future perspectives, are comprehensively reviewed. Moreover, a roadmap of greenificated MIT from 2012 to 2030 is proposed.








Abstract
Advances in revolutionary technologies pose new challenges for human life; in response to them, global responsibility is pushing modern technologies toward greener pathways. Molecular imprinting technology (MIT) is a multidisciplinary mimic technology simulating the specific binding principle of enzymes to substrates or antigens to antibodies; along with its rapid progress and wide applications, MIT faces the challenge of complying with green sustainable development requirements. With the identification of environmental risks associated with unsustainable MIT, a new aspect of MIT, termed green MIT, has emerged and developed. However, so far, no clear definition has been provided to appraise green MIT. Herein, the implementation process of green chemistry in MIT is demonstrated and a mnemonic device in the form of an acronym, GREENIFICATION, is proposed to present the green MIT principles. The entire greenificated imprinting process is surveyed, including element choice, polymerization implementation, energy input, imprinting strategies, waste treatment, and recovery, as well as the impacts of these processes on operator health and the environment. Moreover, assistance of upgraded instrumentation in deploying greener goals is considered. Finally, future perspectives are presented to provide a more complete picture of the greenificated MIT road map and to pave the way for further development.

         <title>From Design to Clinic: Engineered Nanobiomaterials for Immune Normalization Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 30, July 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer immunotherapy is a rapidly emerging clinical reality. Various strategies, however, often fail to unleash the antitumor immune response because of the paucity of appropriate therapeutic targets in the complex tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). The effective nanobiomaterial&#8208;based delivery and TIME normalization approaches that promote T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immune responses are discussed.








Abstract
The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is comprised of a complex milieu that contributes to stunting antitumor immune responses by restricting T cells to accumulate in the vicinity of the tumor. Nanomedicine&#8208;based strategies are being proposed as a salvage effort to reinvigorate antitumor immunity. Various strategies, however, often fail to unleash the antitumor immune response because of the paucity of appropriate therapeutic targets in the complex TIME, invigorating a fervor of investigation into mechanisms underlying the TIME to resist nanomedicines. In this review article, effective nano/biomaterial&#8208;based delivery and TIME normalization approaches that promote T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immune response will be discussed, with a focus on emerging preclinical and clinical strategies for immune normalization. Based on currently available evidence, it seems as if the ultimate success of cancer immunotherapy and nanomedicine hinges on the capacity to normalize the TIME. Here, how nanomedicines target immunosuppressive cells and signaling pathways to broaden the impact of cancer immunotherapy are explored. Acquisition of the urgently needed knowledge of nanomedicine&#8208;mediated immune normalization will guide researchers and scientists towards clinical applications of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>17.6%&#8208;Efficient Quasiplanar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells from a Chlorinated 3D Network Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasiplanar heterojunction (Q&#8208;PHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) based on D18 and BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl with a 3D network are reported, yielding a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.60%. The results show that the Q&#8208;PHJ architecture can replace the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture to realize excellent OSCs for certain unique donors and acceptors, giving an alternative approach for photovoltaic material design and device fabrication.








Abstract
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved great success because they overcome the shortcomings of short exciton diffusion distances. With the progress in material innovation and device technology, the efficiency of BHJ devices is continually being improved. For some special photovoltaic material systems, it is difficult to manipulate the miscibility and morphology of blend films, and this results in moderate, even poor device performance. Quasiplanar heterojunction (Q&#8208;PHJ) OSCs have been proposed to exploit the excellent photovoltaic properties of these materials. An OSC with BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl has a 3D interpenetrating network structure with multiple channels that can facilitate the exciton diffusion and charge transport, and BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl is therefore a good candidate for Q&#8208;PHJ OSCs. In this work, a D18:BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based Q&#8208;PHJ device is fabricated. The exciton diffusion lengths of D18 and BTIC&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl&#160;are in accord with&#160;the requirements of the Q&#8208;PHJ device and the efficiency of Q&#8208;PHJ device is as high as 17.60%. This study indicates that the Q&#8208;PHJ architecture can replace the BHJ architecture to produce excellent OSCs for certain unique donors and acceptors, providing an alternative approach to photovoltaic material design and device fabrication.

         <title>Photoresponsive and Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Structural Colors from Cellulose/Liquid Crystal Nanophotonic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarization&#8208;sensitive and photoresponsive nanophotonic system based on structural colors that are generated by cellulose nanocrystal films and modulated by a birefringent liquid crystal coating is presented. Intense structural colors are appealingly varied by altering the handedness of the illuminating circularly polarized light. The system is further made photoresponsive using a UV&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive liquid crystal mixture.








Abstract
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) possess the ability to form helical periodic structures that generate structural colors. Due to the helicity, such self&#8208;assembled cellulose structures preferentially reflect left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light of certain colors, while they remain transparent to right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light. This study shows that combination with a liquid crystal enables modulation of the optical response to obtain light reflection of both handedness but with reversed spectral profiles. As a result, the nanophotonic systems provide vibrant structural colors that are tunable via the incident light polarization. The results are attributed to the liquid crystal aligning on the CNC/glucose film, to form a birefringent layer that twists the incident light polarization before interaction with the chiral cellulose nanocomposite. Using a photoresponsive liquid crystal, this effect can further be turned off by exposure to UV light, which switches the nematic liquid crystal into a nonbirefringent isotropic phase. The study highlights the potential of hybrid cellulose systems to create self&#8208;assembled yet advanced photoresponsive and polarization&#8208;tunable nanophotonics.

         <title>The Wet&#8208;Oxidation of a Cu(111) Foil Coated by Single Crystal Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As&#8208;grown graphene by chemical vapor deposition cannot protect the Cu surface from wet&#8208;oxidation because there is a diffusion pathway enabling water to diffuse from the graphene edges to the graphene/Cu interface: A &#8220;gap&#8221; between graphene and each of the bunched Cu step corners. This interfacial diffusion of water is eliminated if an ultraflat graphene is coating an ultrasmooth Cu(111) surface.








Abstract
The wet&#8208;oxidation of a single crystal Cu(111) foil is studied by growing single crystal graphene islands on it followed by soaking it in water. 18O&#8208;labeled water is also used; the oxygen atoms in the formed copper oxides in both the bare and graphene&#8208;coated Cu regions come from water. The oxidation of the graphene&#8208;coated Cu regions is enabled by water diffusing from the edges of graphene along the bunched Cu steps, and along some graphene ripples where such are present. This interfacial diffusion of water can occur because of the separation between the graphene and the &#8220;step corner&#8221; of bunched Cu steps. Density functional theory simulations suggest that adsorption of water in this gap is thermodynamically stable; the &#8220;step&#8208;induced&#8208;diffusion model&#8221; also applies to graphene&#8208;coated Cu surfaces of various other crystal orientations. Since bunched Cu steps and graphene ripples are diffusion pathways for water, ripple&#8208;free graphene is prepared on ultrasmooth Cu(111) surfaces and it is found that the graphene completely shields the underlying Cu from wet&#8208;oxidation. This study greatly deepens the understanding of how a graphene&#8208;coated copper surface is oxidized, and shows that graphene completely prevents the oxidation when that surface is ultrasmooth and when the graphene has no ripples or wrinkles.

         <title>Arsenene Nanodots with Selective Killing Effects and their Low&#8208;Dose Combination with &#223;&#8208;Elemene for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEGylated arsenene nanodots (AsNDs@PEG) with high monoelemental arsenic purity and negligible systemic toxicity are identified as a new&#8208;concept arsenical drug for selectively treating solid tumors through the valence&#8208;change of arsenic to generate toxic oxidation states and on&#8208;demand photothermal therapy. This work can encourage a fast&#8208;paced clinical translation of arsenene for tumor treatments with potentially low attrition rates.








Abstract
Arsenical drugs have achieved hallmark success in treating patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, but expanding their clinical utility to solid tumors has proven difficult with the contradiction between the therapeutic efficacy and the systemic toxicity. Here, leveraging efforts from materials science, biocompatible PEGylated arsenene nanodots (AsNDs@PEG) with high monoelemental arsenic purity that can selectively and effectively treat solid tumors are synthesized. The intrinsic selective killing effect of AsNDs@PEG is closely related to high oxidative stress in tumor cells, which leads to an activated valence&#8208;change of arsenic (from less toxic As0 to severely toxic oxidation states), followed by decreased superoxide dismutase activity and massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These effects occur selectively within cancer cells, causing mitochondrial damage, cell&#8208;cycle arrest, and DNA damage. Moreover, AsNDs@PEG when applied in a multi&#8208;drug combination strategy with &#946;&#8208;elemene, a plant&#8208;derived anticancer drug, achieves synergistic antitumor outcomes, and its newly discovered on&#8208;demand photothermal properties facilitate the elimination of the tumors without recurrence, potentially further expanding its clinical utility. In line of the practicability for a large&#8208;scale fabrication and negligible systemic toxicity of AsNDs@PEG (even at high doses and with repetitive administration), a new&#8208;concept arsenical drug with high therapeutic efficacy for selective solid tumor therapy is provided.

These effects occur selectively within cancer cells, causing mitochondrial damage, cell-cycle arrest, and DNA damage. Moreover, AsNDs@PEG when applied in a multi-drug combination strategy with &#946;-elemene, a plant-derived anticancer drug, achieves synergistic antitumor outcomes, and its newly discovered on-demand photothermal properties facilitate the elimination of the tumors without recurrence, potentially further expanding its clinical utility. In line of the practicability for a large-scale fabrication and negligible systemic toxicity of AsNDs@PEG (even at high doses and with repetitive administration), a new-concept arsenical drug with high therapeutic efficacy for selective solid tumor therapy is provided.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chiral Plasmonic Triangular Nanorings with SERS Activity for Ultrasensitive Detection of Amyloid Proteins in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Pt@Au triangular nanorings with intense optical activity are fabricated to detect amyloid proteins in Alzheimer's disease. This text opens up an avenue to use chiral plasmonic nanomaterials as ultrasensitive surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates to early diagnosis of protein&#8208;misfolding diseases.








Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have attracted unprecedented attention due to their broad applications in biomedicine, negative refractive index, and chiral sensing. Here, using a wet&#8208;chemistry process, chiral triangular Au nanorings are fabricated with a platinum (Pt) framework (l/d&#8208;Pt@Au triangular nanorings, named l/d&#8208;Pt@Au TNRs). The l/d&#8208;Pt@Au TNRs exhibit strong optical activity with a g&#8208;factor of 0.023 and can be used effectively for the discrimination of enantiomers due to selective resonance coupling between the induced electric and magnetic dipoles associated with enantiomers and the chiral plasmonic TNRs, also known as the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering&#8208;chiral anisotropy (SERS&#8208;ChA) effect. The chiral d&#8208;Pt@Au TNRs represent a label&#8208;free SERS platform that can be applied to detect A&#946; monomers and fibrils, the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), achieving a limit of detection (LOD) down to 0.045 &#215; 10&#8722;12 m and 4 &#215; 10&#8722;15 m for 42&#8208;residue&#8208;long amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;42) monomer and fibrils, respectively. Furthermore, chiral d&#8208;Pt@Au TNRs can also be successfully carried out to detect A&#946;42 proteins in AD patients with ultrahigh levels of sensitivity, thus allowing picogram quantities of A&#946;42 proteins to be identified. This research opens up an avenue for the use of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials as ultrasensitive SERS substrates to early diagnosis of protein&#8208;misfolding diseases.

         <title>New Structure Mass Tag based on Zr&#8208;NMOF for Multiparameter and Sensitive Single&#8208;Cell Interrogating in Mass Cytometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high specificity and sensitivity of a Zr mass tag in concert with the exploitation of four additional detection channels compatible with MCP_Abs indicates a great promise for developing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based mass tags as next generation molecular probes in CyTOF for multiparameter and sensitive single&#8208;cell biomarker interrogating.








Abstract
Mass cytometry, also called cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF), is an emerging powerful proteomic analysis technique that utilizes metal chelated polymer (MCP) as mass tags for interrogating high&#8208;dimensional biomarkers simultaneously on millions of individual cells. However, under the typical polymer&#8208;based mass tag system, the sensitivity and multiplexing detection ability has been highly restricted. Herein, a new structure mass tag based on a nanometal organic framework (NMOF) is reported for multiparameter and sensitive single&#8208;cell biomarker interrogating in CyTOF. A uniform&#8208;sized Zr&#8208;NMOF (33 nm)&#160;carrying 105 metal ions is synthesized under modulator/reaction time coregulation, which is monodispersed and colloidally stable in water for over one&#8208;year storage. On functionalization with an antibody, the Zr mass tag exhibits specific molecular recognition properties and minimal cross&#8208;reaction toward nontargeted cells. In addition, the Zr&#8208;mass tag is compatible with MCP mass tags in a multiparameter assay for mouse spleen cells staining, which exploits four additional channels, m/z&#160;= 90, 91, 92, 94, for single&#8208;cell immunoassays in CyTOF. Compared to the MCP mass tag, the Zr&#8208;mass tag provides an additional fivefold signal amplification. This work provides the fundamental technical capability for exploiting NMOF&#8208;based mass tags for CyTOF application, which opens up possibility of high&#8208;dimensional single&#8208;cell immune profiling, low abundant antigen detection, and development of new barcoding systems.

         <title>Highly Luminescent Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal for Biocompatible X&#8208;Ray Detector to Attain Highest Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large metal&#8208;free perovskite MDABCO&#8208;NH4I3 single crystal is grown. The crystal exhibits triplet self&#8208;trapping excitons recombination, a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 53%, and structure&#8208;modulated band nature and luminescence under high pressure. Finally, high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray response and imaging were&#160;demonstrated with sensitivity up to 1997 &#177; 80 &#956;C Gy cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal&#8208;based halide perovskites have taken a dominant position for perovskite optoelectronics including light emission and X&#8208;ray detection; however, the toxicity of the included heavy metals severely restricts their applications for wearable, lightweight, and transient optoelectronic devices. Here, the authors describe investigations of large (4 &#215; 6 &#215; 2 mm3) 3D metal&#8208;free perovskite MDABCO&#8208;NH4I3 (MDBACO = methyl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) single crystal and its charge recombination and extraction behavior for light emission and X&#8208;ray detection. Unlike conventional 3D metal&#8208;based perovskites, this lightweight and biocompatible perovskite large crystal is processed from aqueous solution at room temperature, and can achieve both an extremely long carrier lifetime up to &#8776;1.03 &#181;s and the formation of self&#8208;trapped excited states for luminescence. These features contribute to a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as &#8776;53% at room temperature and an X&#8208;ray sensitivity up to 1997 &#177; 80 &#956;C Gy&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 50&#160;V bias (highest among all metal&#8208;free detectors). The ability to tune the perovskite band gap by modulating the structure under high pressure is also demonstrated, which opens up applications for the crystal as colored emitters. These attributes make it a molecular alternative to metal&#8208;based perovskites for biocompatible and transient optoelectronics.

         <title>Rapid Capture of Cancer Extracellular Vesicles by Lipid Patch Microarrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicles have great prospects as diagnostic and therapeutic tool. However, their isolation poses still challenges. Here, a novel supported lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;based platform is introduced for rapid capture, with high specificity and sensitivity, only a small need in analyte volume and without additional purification steps. The platform is flexible and can be applied to many targets by corresponding antibodies.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain various bioactive molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, and play a key role in the regulation of cancer progression. Furthermore, cancer&#8208;associated EVs carry specific biomarkers and can be used in liquid biopsy for cancer detection. However, it is still technically challenging and time consuming to detect or isolate cancer&#8208;associated EVs from complex biofluids (e.g., blood). Here, a novel EV&#8208;capture strategy based on dip&#8208;pen nanolithography generated microarrays of supported lipid membranes is presented. These arrays carry specific antibodies recognizing EV&#8208; and cancer&#8208;specific surface biomarkers, enabling highly selective and efficient capture. Importantly, it is shown that the nucleic acid cargo of captured EVs is retained on the lipid array, providing the potential for downstream analysis. Finally, the feasibility of EV capture from patient sera is demonstrated. The demonstrated platform offers rapid capture, high specificity, and sensitivity, with only a small need in analyte volume and without additional purification steps. The platform is applied in context of cancer&#8208;associated EVs, but it can easily be adapted to other diagnostic EV targets by use of corresponding antibodies.

The platform is applied in context of cancer-associated EVs, but it can easily be adapted to other diagnostic EV targets by use of corresponding antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Accelerating Ion Dynamics Under Cryogenic Conditions by the Amorphization of Crystalline Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphization is an effective strategy to promote low&#8208;temperature dynamics of cathodes by promoting fast charge transfer at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface and relieving the blocking effect of dense lattice structure on ion transport under cryogenic conditions. The synthesized amorphous organic electrode exhibits an unprecedented specific capacity of 141 mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultralow temperature of &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The normal operation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) at ultralow temperature (&lt;&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) is significant for cold&#8208;climate applications; however, their operation is plagued by the low capacity of the conventional intercalation cathodes due to their sluggish kinetics and the slow solid diffusion of Li+ in their frameworks. Here, it is demonstrated that amorphization is an effective strategy to promote the low&#8208;temperature dynamics of cathodes by relieving the blocking effect of a dense lattice structure on ion transport under cryogenic conditions. As a result, due to the decreased charge transport impedance and enhanced Li+ diffusion rate, the obtained covalent amorphous polymer (CAP) with an abundance of pyrazine and carbonyl active sites displays a remarkably outstanding specific capacity of 141 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C, which is superior to its structural analog, a covalent crystalline polymer (43.8 mAh g&#8722;1). Furthermore, 84.7% of the initial capacity of the CAP can be retained after 500 cycles of charge and discharge at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. Molecular dynamic simulations show that the channel&#8208;rich amorphous structure is highly conducive for lithium ions to diffuse quickly in the interstitial space of organic solids. This work provides an effective strategy regarding the amorphization of crystalline cathodes to develop low&#8208;temperature (Low&#8208;T) batteries.

         <title>Controlling Surface Wettability for Automated In Situ Array Synthesis and Direct Bioscreening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an amphiphilic coating of glass surface, on which small droplets of polar aprotic organic solvents can be deposited with enhanced contact angle (small feature size) and inhibited motion (strong binding), permitting fully automated multiple rounds of combinatorial synthesis of small molecule compounds and peptides. The amphiphilic coating can be switched to hydrophilic network for protein&#8208; and cell&#8208;based screening.








Abstract
The in situ synthesis of biomolecules on glass surfaces for direct bioscreening can be a powerful tool in the fields of pharmaceutical sciences, biomaterials, and chemical biology. However, it is still challenging to 1) achieve this conventional multistep combinatorial synthesis on glass surfaces with small feature sizes and high yields and 2) develop a surface which is compatible with solid&#8208;phase syntheses, as well as the subsequent bioscreening. This work reports an amphiphilic coating of a glass surface on which small droplets of polar aprotic organic solvents can be deposited with an enhanced contact angle and inhibited motion to permit fully automated multiple rounds of the combinatorial synthesis of small&#8208;molecule compounds and peptides. This amphiphilic coating can be switched into a hydrophilic network for protein&#8208; and cell&#8208;based screening. Employing this in situ synthesis method, chemical space can be probed via array technology with unprecedented speed for various applications, such as lead discovery/optimization in medicinal chemistry and biomaterial development.

         <title>Directional Magnetization Reversal Enables Ultrahigh Energy Density in Gradient Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A directional magnetization reversal is discovered by engineering Nd2Fe14B/&#945;&#8208;Fe gradient nanostructures, in contrast to the conventional random and nonuniform magnetization reversal in ferromagnetics. This directional magnetization reversal enables a rare combination of high saturation magnetization and high coercivity, thus leading to a record&#8208;high energy product of 26 MG Oe for isotropic permanent magnetic materials.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance ferromagnetic materials are essential for energy conversion and electronic devices. However, the random and nonuniform magnetization reversal in ferromagnetics limits their performance that can be achieved. Here, through both micromagnetism simulations and experiments, a directional magnetization reversal that initiates first from large grains toward smaller ones is discovered by engineering Nd2Fe14B/&#945;&#8208;Fe gradient nanostructures. Such directional magnetization reversal enables a rare combination of high magnetization and large coercivity, thus leading to a record&#8208;high energy density (26 MG Oe) for isotropic permanent magnetic materials, which is &#8776;50% higher than that of its gradient&#8208;free counterpart. The unusual magnetization reversal originates from an ordered arrangement of grain sizes in the gradient material, where the large grains have a lower reversal field than that of the smaller ones. These findings open up new opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance magnetic materials.

         <title>Precise Layer Control and Electronic State Modulation of a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide via Phase&#8208;Transition&#8208;Induced Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced growth is effective for synthesizing layer&#8208;controlled and electronic&#8208;state&#8208;modulated MoS2 films. The energetically unstable amorphous MoSxOy is efficiently converted to a thermodynamically stable crystalline MoS2 film on a wafer scale with excellent uniformity. The number of layers is precisely controlled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer from one to eleven layers, which is applicable in the growth of both intrinsic and heteroatom&#8208;inserted MoS2.








Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of transition metal dichalcogenides with precise control over the number of layers, and hence the electronic state is an essential technology for expanding the practical application of 2D materials. Herein, a new growth method, phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced growth (PTG), is proposed for the precisely controlled growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) films consisting of one to eleven layers with spatial uniformity on a 2 in. wafer. In this method, an energetically unstable amorphous MoSxOy (a&#8208;MoSxOy) phase is effectively converted to a thermodynamically stable crystalline MoS2 film. The number of MoS2 layers is readily controlled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer by controlling the amount of Mo atoms in a&#8208;MoSxOy, which is also applicable for the growth of heteroatom&#8208;inserted MoS2. The electronic states of intrinsic and Nb&#8208;inserted MoS2 with one and four layers grown by PTGare are analyzed based on their work functions. The work function of monolayer MoS2 effectively increases with the substitution of Nb for Mo. As the number of layers increases to four, charge screening becomes weaker, dopant ionization becomes easier, and ultimately the work function increases further. Thus, better electronic state modulation is achieved in a thicker layer, and in this respect, PTG has the advantage of enabling precise control over the film thickness.

         <title>Programmable Mechanically Active Hydrogel&#8208;Based Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel&#8208;based mechanically active materials (MAMs) are a diverse class of materials that are able to sense and respond to external stimuli by producing a physical deformation. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art programming of MAMs in recent studies is highlighted. Materials, fabrication methods, responsive mechanisms, and novel applications of hydrogel MAMs are systematically discussed.








Abstract
Programmable mechanically active materials (MAMs) are defined as materials that can sense and transduce external stimuli into mechanical outputs or conversely that can detect mechanical stimuli and respond through an optical change or other change in the appearance of the material. Programmable MAMs are a subset of responsive materials and offer potential in next generation robotics and smart systems. This review specifically focuses on hydrogel&#8208;based MAMs because of their mechanical compliance, programmability, biocompatibility, and cost&#8208;efficiency. First, the composition of hydrogel MAMs along with the top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches used for programming these materials are discussed. Next, the fundamental principles for engineering responsivity in MAMS, which includes optical, thermal, magnetic, electrical, chemical, and mechanical stimuli, are considered. Some advantages and disadvantages of different responsivities are compared. Then, to conclude, the emerging applications of hydrogel&#8208;based MAMs from recently published literature, as well as the future outlook of MAM studies, are summarized.

     alt="Programmable Mechanically Active Hydrogel-Based Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogel-based mechanically active materials (MAMs) are a diverse class of materials that are able to sense and respond to external stimuli by producing a physical deformation. The state-of-the-art programming of MAMs in recent studies is highlighted. Materials, fabrication methods, responsive mechanisms, and novel applications of hydrogel MAMs are systematically discussed.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmable mechanically active materials (MAMs) are defined as materials that can sense and transduce external stimuli into mechanical outputs or conversely that can detect mechanical stimuli and respond through an optical change or other change in the appearance of the material. Programmable MAMs are a subset of responsive materials and offer potential in next generation robotics and smart systems. This review specifically focuses on hydrogel-based MAMs because of their mechanical compliance, programmability, biocompatibility, and cost-efficiency. First, the composition of hydrogel MAMs along with the top-down and bottom-up approaches used for programming these materials are discussed. Next, the fundamental principles for engineering responsivity in MAMS, which includes optical, thermal, magnetic, electrical, chemical, and mechanical stimuli, are considered. Some advantages and disadvantages of different responsivities are compared. Then, to conclude, the emerging applications of hydrogel-based MAMs from recently published literature, as well as the future outlook of MAM studies, are summarized.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Side Area&#8208;Assisted 3D Evaporator with Antibiofouling Function for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Solar Steam Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar&#8208;driven interfacial steam generation (SISG) system involving an all&#8208;fiber porous cylinder&#8208;like foam 3D evaporator, side area&#8208;assisted evaporation protocol, and aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active solar absorber is explored. The SISG system exhibits a high solar evaporation rate of 3.6&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, and shows photodynamic killing of bacteria to prevent biofouling.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial steam generation (SISG) has been recognized as a promising strategy to solve water shortages in an eco&#8208;friendly and low&#8208;cost way. However, the practical application of SISG is vitally restricted by some inherent limits, especially for finite evaporation rate and insufficient working life of evaporator. Herein, a novel SISG system involving an all&#8208;fiber porous cylinder&#8208;like foam 3D evaporator, side area&#8208;assisted evaporation protocol, and aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active solar absorber with &#8220;one stone two birds&#8221; function is explored. The solar absorber exhibits efficient photothermal conversion, endowing the side area&#8208;assisted evaporator with as high as 3.6&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 of solar evaporation rate, which is highly desirable for SISG under 1 sun of irradiation. Moreover, the solar absorber is capable of powerfully producing reactive oxygen species upon sunlight irradiation, which results in extraordinary photodynamic killing of bacteria nearby the fiber to prevent biofouling, consequently improving the working life of evaporator.

         <title>Dynamic Bifunctional Metasurfaces for Holography and Color Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic bifunctional metasurface for color nanoprinting and metahologram is numerically and experimentally realized. Metaholograms are multiplexed with structural colors by controlling the spectral and phase response of metasurface. The light diffraction can be switched between &#8220;ON&#8221; and &#8220;OFF&#8221; states, or remain unchanged for different wavelength with the infiltration of the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution, making the colorful holographic images dynamically switchable.








Abstract
Metasurfaces have shown their unprecedented ability in wavefront shaping and triggered various applications with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances, e.g., color nanoprinting and metaholograms. Recently, these two functions have been combined into a single metasurface to further expand its capabilities. Despite the progress, the current dual&#8208;mode metasurfaces are mostly static and strongly hinder their practical applications. Herein, the realization of dynamic bifunctional metasurfaces is reported. Five metaholograms at two different wavelengths are multiplexed with structural colors by controlling the spectral and phase response of metasurface. Owing to the destructive interference and the resonance on external environment, the light diffraction at particular wavelengths can be switched between &#8220;ON&#8221; and &#8220;OFF&#8221; states, or remain unchanged with the change of surrounding refractive index. Consequently, the encoded metaholograms are selectively turned on and off, making the overall holographic image dynamically switchable. This concept paves a solid step toward practical applications of all&#8208;dielectric metasurfaces.

         <title>Au&#8208;Doped Ag2Te Quantum Dots with Bright NIR&#8208;IIb Fluorescence for In Situ Monitoring of Angiogenesis and Arteriogenesis in a Hindlimb Ischemic Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel near&#8208;infrared IIb fluorescent probe of Au&#8208;doped Ag2Te (Au:Ag2Te) quantum dots (QDs) is developed through a facile cation exchange method. The Au:Ag2Te QDs exhibit photoluminescence (PL) emission at 1600&#160;nm and a much&#8208;enhanced PL intensity of &#8776;12 fold compared to Ag2Te QDs at a doping amount of 4% (Au/Ag).








Abstract
Fluorescence located in 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm (denoted as the near&#8208;infrared IIb window, NIR&#8208;IIb) has drawn great interest for bioimaging, owing to its ultrahigh tissue penetration depth and spatiotemporal resolution. Therefore, NIR&#8208;IIb fluorescent probes with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and stability along with high biocompatibility are urgently pursued. Herein, a novel NIR&#8208;IIb fluorescent probe of Au&#8208;doped Ag2Te (Au:Ag2Te) quantum dots (QDs) is developed via a facile cation exchange method. The Au dopant concentration in the Ag2Te QDs is tunable from 0% to 10% by controlling the ratio of supplied Au precursor to Ag2Te QDs, resulting in a wide range of PL emission in the NIR&#8208;IIb window and a much&#8208;enhanced PL intensity. After surface modification, the Au:Ag2Te QDs possess bright NIR&#8208;IIb emission, high colloidal stability and photostability, and decent biocompatibility. Further, in vivo monitoring of the process of angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in an ischemic hindlimb is successfully performed.

         <title>Response to Comment on &#8220;Eppur si Muove: Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals&#8221;: Measure What is Measurable, and Make Measurable What is Not So: Discrepancies between Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals and Thin Films</title>

What can explain the 105 times difference higher value of the proton diffusion coefficient in iodide perovskite single crystals relative to other reported values in thin films? Instead of migration through imperfections, which is shown to be highly improbable, experimentally testable alternatives are proposed.








Abstract
Buffeteau et&#160;al. note that the proton diffusion coefficient in MAPbI3 that is deduced (by the authors) from results, obtained by a suite of complementary techniques, on a large number of single crystals (Adv. Mater. 2020, 32, 2002467) is 5 orders of magnitude higher than what is estimated (by them) in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 10431, from infrared spectroscopy on ultrathin MAPbI3 films; use of (deuterium/hydrogen) D/H isotope substitution is common to both studies. Buffeteau et&#160;al. speculated that proton diffusion in halide perovskite single crystals is dominated by 1D defects, which will somehow not be present in thin films, as those are made up of small&#8208;sized crystallites. It is shown here that the idea of a 1D defect is not supported by the body of experimental data gathered on these crystals, that the statistical analysis employed in to Buffeteau et&#160;al. to support the criticism is problematic, and it is concluded that the source of the difference must lie elsewhere. Constructive suggestions for this difference are provided and experiments to discern between possible reasons for it are proposed.

         <dc:description>
The &gt;105 discrepancy between recent reports of proton diffusion constants in halide perovskites is analyzed and it is found that the lower value is likely correct. The higher diffusion rate determined from single crystals may be the result of high&#8208;diffusivity pathways.

A recent report by Cahen and co&#8208;workers is examined that finds the diffusion constant for proton migration in methylammonium lead triiodide single crystals to be 2 &#215; 105&#8208;fold greater than that previously reported by Sadhu et&#160;al. By comparing the conversion of single crystals versus microcrystalline samples, it is concluded that proton diffusion in macroscopic single crystals is accelerated by the presence of defects acting as high&#8208;diffusivity paths.

         <title>Interfacial Embedding of Laser&#8208;Manufactured Fluorinated Gold Clusters Enabling Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophobic p&#8208;type semiconducting additive, fluorinated&#8208;gold&#8208;cluster, has been used as a bi&#8208;functional interfacial mediator to efficiently modulate the carrier dynamics of perovskite and restrain the perovskite from degradation by external environmental stimuli, which results in an n&#8722;i&#8722;p perovskite solar cell with a champion efficiency up to 24.02% and moisture stability over 10&#8239;000 h in relative humidity of 75%.








Abstract
Tackling the interfacial loss in emerged perovskite&#8208;based solar cells (PSCs) to address synchronously the carrier dynamics and the environmental stability, has been of fundamental and viable importance, while technological hurdles remain in not only creating such interfacial mediator, but the subsequent interfacial embedding in the active layer. This article reports a strategy of interfacial embedding of hydrophobic fluorinated&#8208;gold&#8208;clusters (FGCs) for highly efficient and stable PSCs. The p&#8208;type semiconducting feature enables the FGC efficient interfacial mediator to improve the carrier dynamics by reducing the interfacial carrier transfer barrier and boosting the charge extraction at grain boundaries. The hydrophobic tails of the gold clusters and the hydrogen bonding between fluorine groups and perovskite favor the enhancement of environmental stability. Benefiting from these merits, highly efficient formamidinium lead iodide PSCs (champion efficiency up to 24.02%) with enhanced phase stability under varied relative humidity (RH) from 40% to 95%, as well as highly efficient mixed&#8208;cation PSCs with moisture stability (RH of 75%) over 10 000 h are achieved. It is thus inspiring to advance the development of highly efficient and stable PSCs via interfacial embedding laser&#8208;generated additives for improved charge transfer/extraction and environmental stability.

         <title>Hydrogel Ionic Diodes toward Harvesting Ultralow&#8208;Frequency Mechanical Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel ionic diode for ultralow&#8208;frequency mechanical&#8208;energy harvesting is designed based on a sandwiched structures of anion and cation ionomers in hydrogels embedded with carbon nanotubes and silver nanowire electrodes. The ionic diode exhibits power density, charge density, and harvested energy that outperform the current energy&#8208;harvesting devices by several orders of magnitude at 0.01&#160;Hz.








Abstract
Energy harvesting from human motion is regarded as a promising protocol for powering portable electronics, biomedical devices, and smart objects of the Internet of things. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mechanical&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting devices generally operate at frequencies (&gt;10&#160;Hz) well beyond human activity frequencies. Here, a hydrogel ionic diode formed by the layered structures of anionic and cationic ionomers in hydrogels is presented. As confirmed by finite element analysis, the underlying mechanism of the hydrogel ionic diode involves the formation of the depletion region by mobile cations and anions and the subsequent increase of the built&#8208;in potential across the depletion region in response to mechanical pressure. Owing to the enhanced ionic rectification ratio by the embedded carbon nanotube and silver nanowire electrodes, the hydrogel ionic diode exhibits a power density of &#8776;5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a charge density of &#8776;4&#160;mC&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.01&#160;Hz, outperforming the current energy&#8208;harvesting devices by several orders of magnitude. The applications of the self&#8208;powered hydrogel ionic diode to tactile sensing, pressure imaging, and touchpads are demonstrated, with sensing limitation is as low as 0.01&#160;kPa. This work is expected to open up new opportunities for ionic&#8208;current&#8208;based ionotronics in electronics and energy devices.

         <title>Precipitation Hardening in Ferroelectric Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ferroelectric hardening method is proposed by precipitating a secondary phase inside of ferroelectric grains. Akin to hindered dislocation motion in metals, domain wall motion in ferroelectrics is impeded and loss is reduced. The mechanical quality factor in the model system BaTiO3&#8208;CaTiO3 is enhanced by 1.5 times, while the piezoelectric coefficient and planar electromechanical coupling factor remain nearly unchanged.








Abstract
Domain wall motion in ferroics, similar to dislocation motion in metals, can be tuned by well&#8208;concepted microstructural elements. In demanding high&#8208;power applications of piezoelectric materials, the domain wall motion is considered as a lossy hysteretic mechanism that should be restricted. Current applications for so&#8208;called hard piezoelectrics are abundant and hinge on the use of an acceptor&#8208;doping scheme. However, this mechanism features severe limitations due to enhanced mobility of oxygen vacancies at moderate temperatures. By analogy with metal technology, the authors present here a new solution for electroceramics, where precipitates are utilized to pin domain walls and improve piezoelectric properties. Through a sequence of sintering, nucleation, and precipitate growth, intragranular precipitates leading to a fine domain structure are developed as shown by transmission electron microscopy, piezoresponse force microscopy, and phase&#8208;field simulation. This structure impedes the domain wall motion as elucidated by electromechanical characterization. As a result, the mechanical quality factor is increased by &#8776;50% and the hysteresis in electrostrain is suppressed considerably. This is even achieved with slightly increased piezoelectric coefficient and electromechanical coupling factor. This novel process can be smoothly implemented in industrial production processes and is accessible to simple laboratory experimentation for microstructure optimization and implementation in various ferroelectric systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Human Viruses in Liquid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first high&#8208;resolution view of biological assemblies contained in a liquid environment is presented. The foundation for analyzing structure and dynamics of soft materials in real&#8208;time and in 3D is established.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;phase electron microscopy (LP&#8208;EM) is an exciting new area in the materials imaging field, providing unprecedented views of molecular processes. Time&#8208;resolved insights from LP&#8208;EM studies are a strong complement to the remarkable results achievable with other high&#8208;resolution techniques. Here, the opportunities to expand LP&#8208;EM technology beyond 2D temporal assessments and into the 3D regime are described. The results show new structures and dynamic insights of human viruses contained in minute volumes of liquid while acquired in a rapid timeframe. To develop this strategy, adeno&#8208;associated virus (AAV) is used as a model system. AAV is a well&#8208;known gene therapy vehicle with current applications involving drug delivery and vaccine development for COVID&#8208;19. Improving the understanding of the physical properties of biological entities in a liquid state, as maintained in the human body, has broad societal implications for human health and disease.

         <title>Chiral Phonons and Giant Magneto&#8208;Optical Effect in CrBr3 2D Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phonon chirality and magneto&#8208;optical phenomena in CrBr3 2D magnet are reviewed in this article. The superposition of doubly degenerate Eg modes results in chiral phonons with PAM of l&#160;=&#160;&#177;1, exhibiting isotropic linearly polarized Raman scattering. The non&#8208;degenerate Ag modes display a giant magneto&#8208;optical effect under an external out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field, rotating the plane of polarization of the scattered linearly polarized light.








Abstract
Phonons with chirality determine the optical helicity of inelastic light scattering processes due to their nonzero angular momentum. Here it is shown that 2D magnetic CrBr3 hosts chiral phonons at the Brillouin&#8208;zone center. These chiral phonons are linear combinations of the doubly&#8208;degenerate Eg phonons, and the phonon eigenmodes exhibit clockwise and counterclockwise rotational vibrations corresponding to angular momenta of l = &#177; 1.&#160;Such Eg chiral phonons completely switch the polarization of incident circularly polarized light. On the other hand, the non&#8208;degenerate non&#8208;chiral Ag phonons display a giant magneto&#8208;optical effect under an external out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field, rotating the plane of polarization of the scattered linearly polarized light. The corresponding degree of polarization of the scattered light changes from 91% to &#8722;68% as the magnetic field strength increases from 0 to 5 T.

     alt="Chiral Phonons and Giant Magneto-Optical Effect in CrBr3 2D Magnet"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phonon chirality and magneto-optical phenomena in CrBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 2D magnet are reviewed in this article. The superposition of doubly degenerate E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; modes results in chiral phonons with PAM of &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;&#177;1, exhibiting isotropic linearly polarized Raman scattering. The non-degenerate A&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; modes display a giant magneto-optical effect under an external out-of-plane magnetic field, rotating the plane of polarization of the scattered linearly polarized light.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phonons with chirality determine the optical helicity of inelastic light scattering processes due to their nonzero angular momentum. Here it is shown that 2D magnetic CrBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; hosts chiral phonons at the Brillouin-zone center. These chiral phonons are linear combinations of the doubly-degenerate E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; phonons, and the phonon eigenmodes exhibit clockwise and counterclockwise rotational vibrations corresponding to angular momenta of &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt; = &#177; 1.&#160;Such E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; chiral phonons completely switch the polarization of incident circularly polarized light. On the other hand, the non-degenerate non-chiral A&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; phonons display a giant magneto-optical effect under an external out-of-plane magnetic field, rotating the plane of polarization of the scattered linearly polarized light. The corresponding degree of polarization of the scattered light changes from 91% to &#8722;68% as the magnetic field strength increases from 0 to 5 T. In contrast, the chiral E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; modes display no field dependence. The results lay a foundation for the study of phonon chirality and magneto-optical phenomena in 2D magnetic materials, as well as their related applications, such as the phonon Hall effect, topological photonics, and Raman lasing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Molecular Alignment of Homoleptic Iridium Phosphors in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Dopant alignment in doped, vacuum deposited films can be promoted by molecular asymmetry and/or asymmetry in the dopant's electrostatic surface potential.








Abstract
The orientation of facial (fac) tris&#8208;cyclometalated iridium complexes in doped films prepared by vacuum deposition is investigated by altering the physical shape and electronic asymmetry in the molecular structure. Angle&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy and Fourier&#8208;plane imaging microscopy show that the orientation of roughly spherical fac&#8208;tris(2&#8208;phenylpyridyl)iridium (Ir(ppy)3) is isotropic, whereas complexes that are oblate spheroids, fac&#8208;tris(mesityl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole)iridium (Ir(mi)3) and fac&#8208;tris((3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole)iridium (Ir(mip)3), have a net horizontal alignment of their transition dipole moments. Optical anisotropy factors of 0.26 and 0.15, respectively, are obtained from the latter complexes when doped into tris(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)amine host thin films. The horizontal alignment is attributed to the favorable van der Waals interaction between the oblate Ir complexes and host material. Trifluoromethyl groups substituted on one polar face of the Ir(ppy)3 and Ir(mi)3 complexes introduce chemical asymmetries in the molecules at the expense of their oblate shapes. The anisotropy factors of films doped with these substituted derivatives are lower relative to the parent complexes, indicating that the fluorinated patches reinforce horizontal alignment during deposition. High efficiencies obtained from organic light emitting diodes prepared using the Ir dopants is attributed, in part, to improved outcoupling of electroluminescence brought about by molecular alignment.

         <title>Significant Improvements in Dielectric Constant and Energy Density of Ferroelectric Polymer Nanocomposites Enabled by Ultralow Contents of Nanofillers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric polymer nanocomposites with ultralow filler loadings exhibit considerably improved dielectric constant and breakdown strength, giving rise to remarkable discharged energy densities. A mathematical model is established to predict the dielectric constant of composites with low filler contents, revealing the significant contribution of the interphase to the polarization.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics with excellent processability and high breakdown strength (Eb) enable the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density capacitors. Although the improvement of dielectric constant (K) of polymer dielectric has been realized by adding high&#8208;K inorganic fillers with high contents (&gt;10 vol%), this approach faces significant challenges in scalable film processing. Here, the incorporation of ultralow ratios (&lt;1 vol%) of low&#8208;K Cd1&#8722;xZnxSe1&#8722;ySy nanodots into a ferroelectric polymer is reported. The polymer composites exhibit substantial and concurrent increase in both K and Eb, yielding a discharged energy density of 26.0 J cm&#8722;3, outperforming the current dielectric polymers and nanocomposites measured at &#8804;600 MV m&#8722;1. The observed unconventional dielectric enhancement is attributed to the structural changes induced by the nanodot fillers, including transformation of polymer chain conformation and induced interfacial dipoles, which have been confirmed by density function theory calculations. The dielectric model established in this work addresses the limitations of the current volume&#8208;average models on the polymer composites with low filler contents and gives excellent agreement to the experimental results. This work provides a new experimental route to scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer dielectrics and also advances the fundamental understanding of the dielectric behavior of polymer nanocomposites at atomistic scales.

         <title>A Universal Compensation Strategy to Anchor Polar Organic Molecules in Bilayered Hydrated Vanadates for Promoting Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal compensation strategy is reported to introduce polar organic molecules into the interlayer of AlxV2O5&#183;nH2O by replacing partial crystal water. Owing to the high&#8208;polar carbonyl/sulfenyl and low&#8208;polar alkyl, the organic molecules display a strong interaction with pre&#8208;intercalated Al3+ and a weak interaction with Zn2+. Consequently, the cathode displays superior structural stability and ion transfer kinetics, leading to excellent performance.








Abstract
The electrochemical performance of layered vanadium oxides is often improved by introducing guest species into their interlayer. Guest species with high stability in the interlayer and weak interaction with Zn2+ during charge/discharge process are desired to promoting reversible Zn2+ transfer. Herein, a universal compensation strategy was&#160;developed to introduce various polar organic molecules into the interlayer of AlxV2O5&#183;nH2O by replacing partial crystal water. The high&#8208;polar groups in the organic molecules have a strong electrostatic attraction with pre&#8208;intercalated Al3+, which ensures that organic molecules can be anchored in the interlayer of hydrated vanadates. Simultaneously, the low&#8208;polar groups endow organic molecules with a weak interaction with Zn2+ during cycling, thus liberalizing reversible Zn2+ transfer. As a result, AlxV2O5 with polar organic molecules displays enhanced electrochemical performance. Furthermore, based on above cathode material, a pouch cell was&#160;assembled by further integrating a dendrite&#8208;free N&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber@Zn anode, displaying an energy density of 50&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1. This work provides a path for designing stable guest species with a weak interaction with Zn2+ in the interlayer of layered vanadium oxide towards high&#8208;performance cathode materials of aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Vertically Aligned Bismuthene Nanosheet Arrays from Galvanic Replacement Reaction for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area vertically aligned bismuthene nanosheet arrays are demonstrated to grow on various Cu substrates via the galvanic replacement reaction. They feature small nanosheet thickness, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between nanosheets, and can enable efficient and robust CO2 reduction to formate in aqueous solution.








Abstract
There is a lack of straightforward methods to prepare high&#8208;quality bismuthene nanosheets, or, even more challengingly, to grow their arrays due to the low melting point and high oxophilicity of bismuth. This synthetic obstacle has hindered their potential applications. In this work, it is demonstrated that the galvanic replacement reaction can do the trick. Under well&#8208;controlled conditions, large&#8208;area vertically aligned bismuthene nanosheet arrays are grown on Cu substrates of various shapes and sizes. The product features small nanosheet thickness of two to three atomic layers, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between nanosheets. Most remarkably, bismuthene nanosheet arrays grown on Cu foam can enable efficient CO2 reduction to formate with high Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90%, large current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and great stability.

They feature small nanosheet thickness, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between nanosheets, and can enable efficient and robust CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to formate in aqueous solution.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lack of straightforward methods to prepare high-quality bismuthene nanosheets, or, even more challengingly, to grow their arrays due to the low melting point and high oxophilicity of bismuth. This synthetic obstacle has hindered their potential applications. In this work, it is demonstrated that the galvanic replacement reaction can do the trick. Under well-controlled conditions, large-area vertically aligned bismuthene nanosheet arrays are grown on Cu substrates of various shapes and sizes. The product features small nanosheet thickness of two to three atomic layers, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between nanosheets. Most remarkably, bismuthene nanosheet arrays grown on Cu foam can enable efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to formate with high Faradaic efficiency of &amp;gt;90%, large current density of 50&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and great stability.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite with Ordered Phase Distribution for High&#8208;Performance Self&#8208;Powered Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered photodetector based on a 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite with an ordered phase distribution is presented. The increased built&#8208;in potential due to the gradient phase distribution, oriented crystals, and improved crystal quality jointly contribute to the high photoresponse of the device in the entire response spectrum range.








Abstract
2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites exhibit great potential in optoelectronic devices for superior stability compared with their 3D counterparts. However, to achieve a high level of device performance, it is crucial but challenging to regulate the phase distribution of 2D perovskites to facilitate charge carrier transfer. Herein, using a solvent additive method (adding a small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)) combined with a hot&#8208;casting process, the phase distribution of (PEA)2MA3Pb4I13 (PEA+&#160;= C6H5CH2CH2NH3+, MA+&#160;= CH3NH3+) perovskite can be well controlled and the Fermi level of perovskites along the film thickness direction can achieve gradient distribution. The increased built&#8208;in potential, oriented crystal, and improved crystal quality jointly contribute to the high photoresponse of devices in the entire response spectrum range. The optimum device exhibits a characteristic detection peak at 570&#160;nm with large responsivity/detectivity (0.44 A W&#8722;1/3.38 &#215; 1012 Jones), ultrafast response speed with a rise/fall time of 20.8/20.6 &#181;s, and improved stability. This work suggests the possibility of manipulating the ordered phase distribution of 2D perovskites toward high&#8208;performance and stable optoelectronic conversion devices.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Elastomer with Excellent Mechanical Performance and Solvent Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of perfluoropolyether (PFPE)&#8208;based elastomers crosslinked by dynamic urethane are reported, which exhibit excellent elasticity at temperature down to &#8722;110 &#176;C&#160;and outstanding ductility within the cryogenic temperature range. Moreover, the high proportion of fluorocarbon segment also provides wonderful compatibility to most organic solvents, accounting for the low&#8208;swelling characteristics of the elastomer in low&#8208;temperature sealing applications.








Abstract
Elastomers presenting good elasticity, ductility, and chemical resistance at low temperatures can serve as superior performers for explorations in extremely cold environments. However, no commercially available elastomer to date can comprehensively fulfill those demands. Here, a perfluoropolyether (PFPE)&#8208;based network crosslinked by dynamic urethane chemistry is demonstrated, which may satisfy the demands of application in ultracold environments. As the crucial constitute in such a crosslinked network, PFPE provides the elastomer with excellent elasticity at a temperature down to &#8722;110 &#176;C&#160;and outstanding ductility within the cryogenic temperature range. Importantly, the high proportion of fluorocarbon segment also provides wonderful compatibility to most organic solvents, accounting for the low&#8208;swelling characteristics of the elastomer in sealing applications. Furthermore, the dynamic crosslinking feature allows the cured elastomer to be reprocessed like thermoplastic polymers, which affords great promise to recycle and reuse the elastomer after its disposal. Inherently, this elastomer would inspire a worldwide interest in the design of elastic devices that are adaptable to extremely low temperature.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Independent Photocleavage of Radical Nanogenerator for Near&#8208;IR&#8208;Gated and H2O&#8208;Mediated Free&#8208;Radical Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

This work provides an interesting paradigm of oxygen&#8208;irrelevant photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) via near&#8208;IR&#8208;gated and H2O&#8208;mediated photocleavage based on engineered yolk&#8208;shell upconversion of mesoporous silica nanoparticles nanomedicines to augment the therapeutic efficacy of PACT nanoagents for cancer treatment.








Abstract
The oxygen&#8208;dependent nature and limited penetration capacity of visible light render the low efficiency of photodynamic therapy in hypoxic and deep&#8208;seated tumors. Therefore, the development of oxygen&#8208;free photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species by near&#8208;IR (NIR) light&#8208;cleavable photocages is in high demand. Here, an oxygen&#8208;irrelevant PACT strategy based on NIR light&#8208;triggered hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) generation is developed for free&#8208;radical nanotherapy. Blebbistatin&#8208;loaded upconversion of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (UCSNs&#8208;B) is established to facilitate the high loading efficiency of blebbistatin and implement the efficient transformation of NIR light into blue light for unprecedented direct photorelease of oxygen&#8208;independent &#8226;OH. Under NIR laser irradiation, UCSNs&#8208;B converted NIR light into blue light, thus enabling the photocleavage of blebbistatin to induce the burst of &#8226;OH. The &#8226;OH burst under NIR laser irradiation further induces cancer cell apoptosis and significant suppression of hypoxic tumors. In addition, the gadolinium ion (Gd3+)&#8208;doped UCSNs&#8208;B are used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging to facilitate real&#8208;time monitoring of the therapeutic processes. This study effectively demonstrates that the UCSNs&#8208;B act as NIR light&#8208;triggered photocages to facilitate oxygen&#8208;irrelevant &#8226;OH bursts, thus providing insights into the development of efficient PACT nanoagents for cancer treatment.

         <title>Ordered Macroporous Carbonous Frameworks Implanted with CdS Quantum Dots for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped carbon supported CdS quantum dots are fabricated via an in situ transformation strategy. The as&#8208;prepared materials exhibit superior activity and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with amines oxidation, affording a CO production rate as high as 5210 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under the irradiation of visible light in the absence of any sacrificial agents and alkaline additives.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction is regarded as a promising way to simultaneously mitigate the energy crisis and CO2 pollution. However, achieving high efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, especially without the assistance of sacrifice reagents or extra alkaline additives, remains a critical issue. Herein, a photocatalyst of 3D ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) supported CdS quantum dots (3DOM CdSQD/NC) is successfully fabricated toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction via an in situ transformation strategy. Additionally, an amines oxidation reaction is introduced to replace the H2O oxidation process to further boost the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency. Impressively, 3DOM CdSQD/NC exhibits superior activity and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with amines oxidation, affording a CO production rate as high as 5210 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the absence of any sacrificial agents and alkaline additives. Moreover, 3DOM CdSQD/NC achieves an apparent quantum efficiency of 2.9% at 450 nm. Mechanism studies indicate that the 3D ordered macropores in the NC matrix are beneficial to the transfer of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, the highly dispersed CdS QDs on the NC skeleton are able to significantly promote the adsorption of both CO2 and amine molecules and depress the CO2 activation energy barriers by stabilizing the *COOH intermediate, directly contributing to the high activity.

         <title>Electric Field Control of the Magnetic Weyl Fermion in an Epitaxial SrRuO3 (111) Thin Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion is achieved in an epitaxial SrRuO3 (111) film, the topological property of which is identified with the help of magnetotransport measurements, angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
The magnetic Weyl fermion originates from the time reversal symmetry (TRS)&#8208;breaking in magnetic crystalline structures, where the topology and magnetism entangle with each other. Therefore, the magnetic Weyl fermion is expected to be effectively tuned by the magnetic field and electrical field, which holds promise for future topologically protected electronics. However, the electrical field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion has rarely been reported, which is prevented by the limited number of identified magnetic Weyl solids. Here, the electric field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion is demonstrated in an epitaxial SrRuO3 (111) thin film. The magnetic Weyl fermion in the SrRuO3 films is indicated by the chiral anomaly induced magnetotransport, and is verified by the observed Weyl nodes in the electronic structures characterized by the angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first&#8208;principles calculations. Through the ionic&#8208;liquid gating experiment, the effective manipulation of the Weyl fermion by electric field is demonstrated, in terms of the sign&#8208;change of the ordinary Hall effect, the nonmonotonic tuning of the anomalous Hall effect, and the observation of the linear magnetoresistance under proper gating voltages. The work may stimulate the searching and tuning of Weyl fermions in other magnetic materials, which are promising in energy&#8208;efficient electronics.

         <title>Penta&#8208;PdPSe: A New 2D Pentagonal Material with Highly In&#8208;Plane Optical, Electronic, and Optoelectronic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 2D pentagonal material, penta&#8208;PdPSe, with low&#8208;symmetry lattice characteristics, is introduced to the 2D family. Such a low&#8208;symmetry structure endows this material with strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy, in which high conductance and photoresponsivity anisotropic ratios of 4.74 and 6.17 are achieved, respectively. These results make 2D penta&#8208;PdPSe an ideal material for the design of next&#8208;generation anisotropic devices.








Abstract
Due to their low&#8208;symmetry lattice characteristics and intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy, 2D pentagonal materials, a new class of 2D materials composed entirely of pentagonal atomic rings, are attracting increasing research attention. However, the existence of these 2D materials has not been proven experimentally until the recent discovery of PdSe2. Herein, penta&#8208;PdPSe, a new 2D pentagonal material with a novel low&#8208;symmetry puckered pentagonal structure, is introduced to the 2D family. Interestingly, a peculiar polyanion of [Se&#63743;P&#63743;P&#63743;Se]4&#8722; is discovered in this material, which is the biggest polyanion in 2D materials yet discovered. Strong intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropic behavior endows penta&#8208;PdPSe with highly anisotropic optical, electronic, and optoelectronic properties. Impressively, few&#8208;layer penta&#8208;PdPSe&#8208;based phototransistor not only achieves excellent electronic performances, a moderate electron mobility of 21.37 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a high on/off ratio of up to 108, but it also has a high photoresponsivity of &#8776;5.07&#160;&#215; 103 A W&#8722;1 at 635&#160;nm, which is ascribed to the photogating effect. More importantly, penta&#8208;PdPSe also exhibits a large anisotropic conductance (&#963;max/&#963;max&#160;= 3.85) and responsivity (Rmax/Rmin&#160;= 6.17 at 808&#160;nm), superior to most 2D anisotropic materials. These findings make penta&#8208;PdPSe an ideal material for the design of next&#8208;generation anisotropic devices.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Chiral Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Based on Strained Monolayer Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature electrically tunable chiral light&#8208;emitting diode is realized using strained monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. The strain effects break the threefold rotational symmetry, which results in different amounts of spin recombination at the K/K&#8217; valleys to generate chiral light emission driven by electric fields. The results provide a new pathway for practical chiral light sources based on monolayer semiconductors.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature chiral light sources whose optical helicity can be electrically switched are one of the most important devices for future optical quantum information processing. The emerging valley degree of freedom in monolayer semiconductors allows generation of chiral luminescence via valley polarization. However, relevant valley&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) have only been achieved at low temperatures (typically below 80 K). Here, a room&#8208;temperature chiral LED with strained transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers is realized. Spatially resolved polarization spectroscopy reveals that strain effects are crucial to yielding robust valley&#8208;polarized electroluminescence. The broken threefold rotational symmetry of strained monolayers induce inequivalent valley drifts at the K/K&#8217; valleys, resulting in different amounts of spin recombination driven by electric fields. Based on this scenario, ideally strained conditions are designed for LEDs on flexible substrates, in which the helicity of room&#8208;temperature valley&#8208;polarized electroluminescence is electrically tuned. The results provide a new pathway for practical chiral light sources based on monolayer semiconductors.

         <title>A Soft and Absorbable Temporary Epicardial Pacing Wire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft and absorbable temporary epicardial pacing wire (TPW), made of U.S. FDA&#8208;approved materials [poly(l&#8208;lactide&#8208;co&#8208;&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)] and liquid metal (EGaIn), can pace heart to recover from abnormal heartbeats after surgery and reduce the severe complications from the rigid and nonabsorbable TPWs.








Abstract
Existing temporary epicardial pacing wires (TPWs) are rigid and non&#8208;absorbable, such that they can cause severe complications after cardiac surgery. Here, a soft and absorbable temporary epicardial pacing wire (saTPW) for effectively correcting abnormal heart rates in a rabbit model, such as bradycardia and ventricular premature beat, is developed. The saTPW exhibits excellent conductivity, flexibility, cycling stability (&gt;100&#160;000 cycles), and less inflammatory response during two&#8208;month subcutaneous implantation in a rat model. The saTPW which consists of poly(l&#8208;lactide&#8208;co&#8208;&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) and liquid metal, can degrade about 13% (mass loss) in the rats over a two&#8208;month subcutaneous implantation. It can be absorbed over time in the body. The cytocompatibility and absorbability avoid secondary injuries caused by remaining wires which are permanently left in the body. The saTPW will provide a great platform for diagnosis and treatments in cardiovascular diseases by delivering the physiological signal and applying electrical stimulation for therapy.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque&#8208;Induced Domain Nucleation for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dominant mode of field&#8208;free magnetization switching in L11&#8208;CuPt/CoPt bilayer is demonstrated to be domain nucleation. The stable intermediate states from domain nucleation grant excellent memristive plasticity, which allows the spintronic device to be used as an artificial sigmoidal neuron. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept live training is performed to recognize written digits, with a high recognition rate comparable to simulation.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing has become an increasingly popular approach for artificial intelligence because it can perform cognitive tasks more efficiently than conventional computers. However, it remains challenging to develop dedicated hardware for artificial neural networks. Here, a simple bilayer spintronic device for hardware implementation of neuromorphic computing is demonstrated. In L11&#8208;CuPt/CoPt bilayer, current&#8208;inducted field&#8208;free magnetization switching by symmetry&#8208;dependent spin&#8211;orbit torques shows a unique domain nucleation&#8208;dominated magnetization reversal, which is not accessible in conventional bilayers. Gradual domain nucleation creates multiple intermediate magnetization states which form the basis of a sigmoidal neuron. Using the L11&#8208;CuPt/CoPt bilayer as a sigmoidal neuron, the training of a deep learning network to recognize written digits, with a high recognition rate (87.5%) comparable to simulation (87.8%) is further demonstrated. This work offers a new scheme of implementing artificial neural networks by magnetic domain nucleation.

&lt;p&gt;The dominant mode of field-free magnetization switching in L1&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CuPt/CoPt bilayer is demonstrated to be domain nucleation. The stable intermediate states from domain nucleation grant excellent memristive plasticity, which allows the spintronic device to be used as an artificial sigmoidal neuron. A proof-of-concept live training is performed to recognize written digits, with a high recognition rate comparable to simulation.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic computing has become an increasingly popular approach for artificial intelligence because it can perform cognitive tasks more efficiently than conventional computers. However, it remains challenging to develop dedicated hardware for artificial neural networks. Here, a simple bilayer spintronic device for hardware implementation of neuromorphic computing is demonstrated. In L1&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CuPt/CoPt bilayer, current-inducted field-free magnetization switching by symmetry-dependent spin&#8211;orbit torques shows a unique domain nucleation-dominated magnetization reversal, which is not accessible in conventional bilayers. Gradual domain nucleation creates multiple intermediate magnetization states which form the basis of a sigmoidal neuron. Using the L1&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CuPt/CoPt bilayer as a sigmoidal neuron, the training of a deep learning network to recognize written digits, with a high recognition rate (87.5%) comparable to simulation (87.8%) is further demonstrated. This work offers a new scheme of implementing artificial neural networks by magnetic domain nucleation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chiral Helimagnetism and One&#8208;Dimensional Magnetic Solitons in a Cr&#8208;Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral helimagnetism and 1D magnetic solitons are discovered in Cr&#8208;intercalated 2H&#8208;TaS2. The chiral helimagnetic structure has an initial period of &#8776;25&#160;nm, and it transforms into a chiral soliton lattice in the external magnetic field. The spatial period evolution of this topological spin texture obeys the chiral sine&#8208;Gordon theory, revealing great potentials for fast&#8208;speed racetrack memories.








Abstract
Chiral magnets endowed with topological spin textures are expected to have promising applications in next&#8208;generation magnetic memories. In contrast to the well&#8208;studied 2D or 3D magnetic skyrmions, the authors report the discovery of 1D nontrivial magnetic solitons in a transition metal dichalcogenide 2H&#8208;TaS2 via precise intercalation of Cr elements. In the synthetic Cr1/3TaS2 (CTS) single crystal, the coupling of the strong spin&#8211;orbit interaction from TaS2 and the chiral arrangement of the magnetic Cr ions evoke a robust Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. A magnetic helix having a short spatial period of &#8776;25&#160;nm is observed in CTS via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. In a magnetic field perpendicular to the helical axis, the helical spin structure transforms into a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) with the spin structure evolution being consistent with the chiral sine&#8208;Gordon theory, which opens promising perspectives for the application of CSL to fast&#8208;speed nonvolatile magnetic memories. This work introduces a new paradigm to soliton physics and provides an effective strategy for seeking novel 2D magnets.

         <title>Titania&#8208;Supported Ni2P/Ni Catalysts for Selective Solar&#8208;Driven CO Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titania&#8208;supported Ni2P/Ni nanoparticle catalysts, obtained through a facile gas&#8211;solid reaction strategy, show a remarkable C2+ selectivity of 70% for solar&#8208;driven CO hydrogenation. Conversely, CO methanation is the dominant process for metallic Ni nanoparticles in the absence of Ni2P. Results reveal a simple phosphidation strategy for tuning the selectivity of Ni&#8208;based catalysts for selective CO hydrogenation to value&#8208;added hydrocarbons.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis (FTS) holds great potential for the sustainable production of fuels from syngas and solar energy. However, the selectivity toward multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) is often hampered by the difficulty in the regulation of transition metals acting as both light absorption units and active sites. Herein, a partial phosphidation strategy to prepare titania supported Ni2P/Ni catalysts for photothermal FTS is demonstrated. Under Xenon lamp or concentrated sunlight irradiation, the optimized catalyst shows a C2+ selectivity of 70% at a CO conversion of &gt;20%.&#160;Conversely, nickel metal in the absence of Ni2P delivers negligible C2+ products (&#8776;1%) with methane being the major product (&gt;90%). Structural characterization and density functional theory calculation reveal that the partial phosphidation allows exposed metallic Ni to be active for CO adsorption and activation, while the existence of Ni2P/Ni interface is responsible to inhibit CO methanation and promote C&#8211;C coupling of adsorbed *CH intermediates. This work introduces a novel phosphidation strategy for nickel&#8208;based photothermal catalysts in efficiently harnessing solar energy, and regulating the reaction pathways for CO hydrogenation to deliver high value products.

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Multicolor Image Sensor Based on Electrochromic Color&#8208;Radix Demultiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of broadband color&#8208;tunable photodetector and its high accuracy digital color&#8208;discrimination scheme is presented. A vertically stacked p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type graphene barristors demonstrates a superior capability of regulating charge transport under any desired illumination wavelengths, yielding voltage&#8208;controlled photoconductive gain spectra. An array of optoelectronic logic sensors that can demultiplex color coordinates with high color accuracy is demonstrated.








Abstract
Optical data acquisition has been set as one of the milestones to testify the developments aimed at harnessing the full potential of the spatial and temporal data processing capabilities of the advanced semiconductor technology. A highly promising approach to drive the level of acquisition beyond the current technological node is the vertical integration of multiple photodetectors. However, vertical integration so far requires the same level of circuit complexity as lateral integration from the incapability of monolithic integration. Here, an electrochromic device architecture is introduced that enables realization of a monolithic tandem multicolor photodetector. The device, composed of vertically stacked p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type graphene barristors, is demonstrated to be capable of regulating the balanced charge transport under any desired illumination wavelengths. It exhibits variable anti&#8208;ambipolar charge transport behavior, which yields sensitive voltage&#8208;controlled photoconductive gain spectra. These electrical behaviors are utilized to fabricate an optoelectronic logic sensor that can demultiplex the desired color coordinate or wavelength in the constituent array with high color accuracy.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Flexibility and Stretchability of Solar Cells: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible and stretchable solar cells are important for a range of emerging applications such as electronic skin, e&#8208;textile, wearable displays and health sensors, among others. This review provides an overview of stretchable opto&#8208;electronics, addresses the benefits of stretchable solar cells, and underlines the progress made in this field in terms of efficiency and strategies to achieve mechanical stretchability.








Abstract
Emerging forms of soft, flexible, and stretchable electronics promise to revolutionize the electronics industries of the future offering radically new products that combine multiple functionalities, including power generation, with arbitrary form factor. For example, skin&#8208;like electronics promise to transform the human&#8208;machine&#8208;interface, but the softness of the skin is incompatible with traditional electronic components. To address this issue, new strategies toward soft and wearable electronic systems are currently being pursued, which also include stretchable photovoltaics as self&#8208;powering systems for use in autonomous and stretchable electronics of the future. Here recent developments in the field of stretchable photovoltaics are reviewed and their potential for various emerging applications are examined. Emphasis is placed on the different strategies to induce stretchability including extrinsic and intrinsic approaches. In the former case, engineering and patterning of the materials and devices are key elements while intrinsically stretchable systems rely on mechanically compliant materials such as elastomers and organic conjugated polymers. The result is a review article that provides a comprehensive summary of the progress to date in the field of stretchable solar cells from the nanoscale to macroscopic functional devices. The article is concluded by discussing the emerging trends and future developments.

         <title>Triarylamine&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Carbonitriles for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices with EQE Nearly 40%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three 2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarbonitrile&#8208;based compounds with excellent photoluminescent quantum yields (79&#8211;100%) and high horizontal dipole ratios (86&#8722;88%) in the thin films are demonstrated. With two methyl groups on the triarylamines, the spin&#8722;orbit coupling is enhanced due to the elevated locally excited triplet states(3LE), leading to a fast reverse intersystem crossing. Green thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on them exhibit a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 39.8% without any optical extraction technique.








Abstract
Highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules are in urgent demand for solid&#8208;state lighting and full&#8208;color displays. Here, the design and synthesis of three triarylamine&#8208;pyridine&#8208;carbonitrile&#8208;based TADF compounds, TPAPPC, TPAmPPC, and tTPAmPPC, are shown. They exhibit excellent photoluminescence quantum yields of 79&#8722;100% with small &#916;EST values, fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), and high horizontal dipole ratios (&#920;//&#160;= 86&#8722;88%) in the thin films leading to the enhancement of device light outcoupling. Consequently, a green organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on TPAmPPC shows a high average external quantum efficiency of 38.8&#160;&#177; 0.6%, a current efficiency of 130.1&#160;&#177; 2.1&#160;cd A&#8211;1, and a power efficiency of 136.3&#160;&#177; 2.2&#160;lm W&#8211;1. The highest device efficiency of 39.8% appears to be record&#8208;breaking among TADF&#8208;based OLEDs to date. In addition, the TPAmPPC&#8208;based device shows superior operation lifetime and high&#8208;temperature resistance. It is worth noting that the TPA&#8208;PPC&#8208;based materials have excellent optical properties and the potential for making them strong candidates for TADF practical application.

&lt;p&gt;Three 2,6-diphenylpyridine-3,5-dicarbonitrile-based compounds with excellent photoluminescent quantum yields (79&#8211;100%) and high horizontal dipole ratios (86&#8722;88%) in the thin films are demonstrated. With two methyl groups on the triarylamines, the spin&#8722;orbit coupling is enhanced due to the elevated locally excited triplet states(&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LE), leading to a fast reverse intersystem crossing. Green thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic light-emitting diodes based on them exhibit a record-high external quantum efficiency of 39.8% without any optical extraction technique.

         <title>A Magneto&#8208;Heated Ferrimagnetic Sponge for Continuous Recovery of Viscous Crude Oil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferrimagnetic sponge with the skeletons coated with poly(dimethylsiloxane) and iron oxide nanoparticles is developed to achieve continuous recovery of viscous crude oil. Under the exposure of alternating magnetic field, the viscosity of the viscous oil around the sponge decreases sharply, thus accelerating its absorption.








Abstract
The high viscosity and low fluidity of heavy crude oil hinder its sorption by conventional porous sorbents, so the efficient clean&#8208;up of such heavy crude oil spills is challenging. Recently, Joule heating has been emerging as a new tool to reduce the viscosity of heavy crude oil dramatically. However, this direct&#8208;contact heating approach presents a potential risk due to the high voltage applied. To develop a non&#8208;contact recovery of viscous crude oil, here, a new approach for the fabrication of a series of ferrimagnetic sponges (FMSs) with hydrophobic porous channels is reported, whose surface can be remotely heated to 120 &#176;C within 10 s under an alternating magnetic field (f&#160;= 274&#160;kHz, H&#160;= 30 kA m&#8722;1). Compared with the solar&#8208;driven superficial heating, the integral magnetic heating in FMSs can result in a higher internal temperature of the sponges because of the confinement of thermal transport in the porous channels, which contributes to a dramatic decrease in oil viscosity and a significant increase in oil flow into the pores of FMSs. Furthermore, FMSs assembled with a self&#8208;priming pump can achieve continuous recovery of viscous crude oil (33.05&#160;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) via remotely magnetic heating.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Inspired Design of a Self&#8208;Adhesive Agent for Durable Moisture Management and Bacterial Inhibition on PET Fabric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mussel&#8208;inspired hydrophilic agent based on cation&#8211;&#960; interaction is developed with strong self&#8208;adhesion on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric to form a durable superhydrophilic and antibacterial coating. It shows great potential in designing a Janus PET fabric for efficient sweat/heat management and bacterial inhibition without interfering the balance of the skin microflora, which is highly valued in physiological health and long&#8208;term wearing.








Abstract
Functional textiles with advanced moisture management can enhance human comfort and physiological health. However, conventional wet finishing processes used for textiles are usually highly polluting and exhibit poor fastness. Inspired by the strong underwater adhesion properties of mussels based on cation&#8211;&#960; interaction, a novel superhydrophilic polymeric molecule with strong cohesion and adhesion property is designed on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric. The cation&#8211;&#960; hydrophilic agent (CPHA) can efficiently transform the hydrophobic PET fabric to a superhydrophilic one, and its superhydrophilicity can withstand 150 home laundry cycles. In addition, the cationic moieties in the CPHA self&#8208;adhere to the PET fabric without any finishing auxiliary that would cause pollution. Due to its strong adhesion, CPHA can be applied to one side of the PET fabric via spray coating and curing to form a Janus hydrophobic/superhydrophilic fabric capable of diode&#8208;like one&#8208;way sweat transportation (with forward transportation capability of 1115% and backward transportation capability of &#8722;1509%). Moreover, the Janus fabric inhibits bacterial growth and invasion, while simultaneously preserving the inner ecological healthy balance of the skin's microflora. This work opens up a pathway to develop adhesives in textile wet processing for more diverse, smarter applications, e.g., quick&#8208;dry sportswear, protective suits, or air&#8208;conditioning fabrics.

         <title>First&#8208;Principles Multiscale Modeling of Mechanical Properties in Graphene/Borophene Heterostructures Empowered by Machine&#8208;Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors propose the robust concept of first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling of mechanical properties based on machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials conveniently trainable over short ab initio datasets. It is shown that mechanical/failure responses of complex nanostructures at continuum scale and high temperatures can be explored with the precision of sophisticated first&#8208;principles calculations, affordable computational cost, and without the need for empirical data.








Abstract
Density functional theory calculations are robust tools to explore the mechanical properties of pristine structures at their ground state but become exceedingly expensive for large systems at finite temperatures. Classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations offer the possibility to study larger systems at elevated temperatures, but they require accurate interatomic potentials. Herein the authors propose the concept of first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling of mechanical properties, where ab initio level of accuracy is hierarchically bridged to explore the mechanical/failure response of macroscopic systems. It is demonstrated that machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) fitted to ab initio datasets play a pivotal role in achieving this goal. To practically illustrate this novel possibility, the mechanical/failure response of graphene/borophene coplanar heterostructures is examined. It is shown that MLIPs conveniently outperform popular CMD models for graphene and borophene and they can evaluate the mechanical properties of pristine and heterostructure phases at room temperature. Based on the information provided by the MLIP&#8208;based CMD, continuum models of heterostructures using the finite element method can be constructed. The study highlights that MLIPs were&#160;the missing block for conducting first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling, and their employment empowers a straightforward route to bridge ab initio level accuracy and flexibility to explore the mechanical/failure response of nanostructures at continuum scale.

         <title>Emerging Dual&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Efficient Energy Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an extension of single&#8208;atom catalysts, dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) with high metal loading, sophisticated and flexible active sites have aroused great interest. This review summarizes the recent development of DASCs in characterization, synthetic methods, and catalytic applications.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts with well&#8208;defined structures have been the research hotspot in heterogeneous catalysis because of their high atomic utilization efficiency, outstanding activity, and selectivity. Dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs), as an extension of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), have recently drawn surging attention. The DASCs possess higher metal loading, more sophisticated and flexible active sites, offering more chance for achieving better catalytic performance, compared with SACs. In this review, recent advances on how to design new DASCs for enhancing energy catalysis will be highlighted. It will start with the classification of marriage of two kinds of single&#8208;atom active sites, homonuclear DASCs and heteronuclear DASCs according to the configuration of active sites. Then, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques for DASCs will be discussed. Different synthetic methods and catalytic applications of the DASCs in various reactions, including oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, carbon monoxide oxidation reaction, and others will be followed. Finally, the major challenges and perspectives of DASCs will be provided.

         <title>Multifunctional Crosslinking&#8208;Enabled Strain&#8208;Regulating Crystallization for Stable, Efficient &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A universality strain&#8208;regulation approach&#8212;crosslinking&#8208;enabled strain&#8208;regulating crystallization (CSRC)&#8212;is introduced to eliminate intrinsic tensile strain in perovskite film, which significantly boosts the perovskite solar cells&#8217; (PSCs) stability and performance. The CSRC approach precisely modulates the perovskite film strain through synchronous cooperation of perovskite crystallization manipulation and in situ chemical crosslinking process, as showcased with several types of crosslinking agents.

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) but experiences intrinsic thermally induced tensile strain due to a higher phase&#8208;converting temperature, which is a critical instability factor. An in situ crosslinking&#8208;enabled strain&#8208;regulating crystallization (CSRC) method with trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMTA) is introduced to precisely regulate the top section of perovskite film where the largest lattice distortion occurs. In CSRC, crosslinking provides in situ perovskite thermal&#8208;expansion confinement and strain regulation during the annealing crystallization process, which is proven to be much more effective than the conventional strain&#8208;compensation (post&#8208;treatment) method. Moreover, CSRC with TMTA successfully achieves multifunctionality simultaneously: the regulation of tensile strain, perovskite defects passivation with an enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC&#160;= 50&#160;mV), and enlarged perovskite grain size. The CSRC approach gives significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.39% in &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;based PSC versus 20.29% in the control case. More importantly, the control PSCs&#8217; instability factor&#8212;residual tensile strain&#8212;is regulated into compression strain in the CSRC perovskite film through TMTA crosslinking, resulting in not only the best PCE but also outstanding device stability in both long&#8208;term storage (over 4000 h with 95% of initial PCE) and light soaking (1248 h with 80% of initial PCE) conditions.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Gain Organic Electrochemical Transistor Chemosensors Based on Self&#8208;Curled Nanomembranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have attracted growing interest due to their physical, chemical, and mechanical versatility. Simultaneously, strain&#8208;engineered nanomembranes are well recognized to allow integration and property tailorability to numerous electronic and electrochemical miniaturized systems. By employing self&#8208;curled nanomembranes to advance the current liquid&#8208;gated transistor technology, unique characteristics arise in a pioneering ultrahigh&#8208;gain OECT platform.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are technologically relevant devices presenting high susceptibility to physical stimulus, chemical functionalization, and shape changes&#8212;jointly to versatility and low production costs. The OECT capability of liquid&#8208;gating addresses both electrochemical sensing and signal amplification within a single integrated device unit. However, given the organic semiconductor time&#8208;consuming doping process and their usual low field&#8208;effect mobility, OECTs are frequently considered low&#8208;end category devices. Toward high&#8208;performance OECTs, microtubular electrochemical devices based on strain&#8208;engineering are presented here by taking advantage of the exclusive shape features of self&#8208;curled nanomembranes. Such novel OECTs outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic liquid&#8208;gated transistors, reaching lower operating voltage, improved ion doping, and a signal amplification with a &gt;104&#160;intrinsic gain. The multipurpose OECT concept is validated with different electrolytes and distinct nanometer&#8208;thick molecular films, namely, phthalocyanine and thiophene derivatives. The OECTs are also applied as transducers to detect a biomarker related to neurological diseases, the neurotransmitter dopamine. The self&#8208;curled OECTs update the premises of electrochemical energy conversion in liquid&#8208;gated transistors, yielding a substantial performance improvement and new chemical sensing capabilities within picoliter sampling volumes.

         <title>Gallium Plasmonic Nanoantennas Unveiling Multiple Kinetics of Hydrogen Sensing, Storage, and Spillover</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium nanoparticles represent a novel interesting plasmon photocatalysis system for hydrogen dissociation, sensing, and storage applications. Ga NPs have never been considered previously for photocatalysis. With respect to this, a novel vision is offered, which can represent breakthroughs in the plasmon&#8208;activated photocatalysis as well as in hydrogen science and technology.








Abstract
Hydrogen is the key element to accomplish a carbon&#8208;free based economy. Here, the first evidence of plasmonic gallium (Ga) nanoantennas is provided as nanoreactors supported on sapphire (&#945;&#8208;Al2O3) acting as direct plasmon&#8208;enhanced photocatalyst for hydrogen sensing, storage, and spillover. The role of plasmon&#8208;catalyzed electron transfer between hydrogen and plasmonic Ga nanoparticle in the activation of those processes is highlighted, as opposed to conventional refractive index&#8208;change&#8208;based sensing. This study reveals that, while temperature selectively operates those various processes, longitudinal (LO&#8208;LSPR) and transverse (TO&#8208;LSPR) localized surface plasmon resonances of supported Ga nanoparticles open selectivity of localized reaction pathways at specific sites corresponding to the electromagnetic hot&#8208;spots. Specifically, the TO&#8208;LSPR couples light into the surface dissociative adsorption of hydrogen and formation of hydrides, whereas the LO&#8208;LSPR activates heterogeneous reactions at the interface with the support, that is, hydrogen spillover into &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and reverse&#8208;oxygen spillover from &#945;&#8208;Al2O3. This Ga&#8208;based plasmon&#8208;catalytic platform expands the application of supported plasmon&#8208;catalysis to hydrogen technologies, including reversible fast hydrogen sensing in a timescale of a few seconds with a limit of detection as low as 5 ppm&#160;and in a broad temperature range from room&#8208;temperature up to 600 &#176;C while remaining stable and reusable over an extended period of time.

         <title>In Situ TEM Imaging of Solution&#8208;Phase Chemical Reactions Using 2D&#8208;Heterostructure Mixing Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D&#8208;heterostructure mixing cell allows sub&#8208;nanometer resolution characterization of calcium carbonate precipitation via nonclassical nucleation using scanning transmission electron microscopy. A trigger&#8208;based mixing mechanism using controlled damage to the MoS2 membrane enables visualization of the entire reaction timeline with high spatial resolution, including liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation, formation of amorphous calcium carbonate, and crystallization.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy is used to study a wide range of chemical processes, where its unique combination of spatial and temporal resolution provides countless insights into nanoscale reaction dynamics. However, achieving sub&#8208;nanometer resolution has proved difficult due to limitations in the current liquid cell designs. Here, a novel experimental platform for in situ mixing using a specially developed 2D heterostructure&#8208;based liquid cell is presented. The technique facilitates in situ atomic resolution imaging and elemental analysis, with mixing achieved within the immediate viewing area via controllable nanofracture of an atomically thin separation membrane. This novel technique is used to investigate the time evolution of calcium carbonate synthesis, from the earliest stages of nanodroplet precursors to crystalline calcite in a single experiment. The observations provide the first direct visual confirmation of the recently developed liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation theory, while the technological advancements open an avenue for many other studies of early stage solution&#8208;phase reactions of great interest for both the exploration of fundamental science and developing applications.

         <title>Ultrathin Yet Robust Single Lithium&#8208;Ion Conducting Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Polymer&#8208;Brush Electrolytes Enable Ultralong&#8208;Life and Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

Ultrathin, robust, and porous quasisolid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (QSPEs) are developed to achieve ultralong&#8208;life and dendrite&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries. The key to the QSPEs lies in utilization of superstructured polymer brushes, which have rigid bacterial cellulose nanofibril cores and soft single lithium&#8208;ion conducting polymer shells to well balance the mechanical strength and ion conductivity of the electrolytes in the presence of plasticizers.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes are one of the most promising candidates for long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries. However, introduction of plasticizers for high ion conductivity at room temperature inevitably gives rise to poor mechanical strength and requires a very thick electrolyte membrane, which is detrimental to safety and energy density of the batteries. Herein, inspired by tube brushes coupling hardness with softness, a novel superstructured polymer bottlebrush BC&#8208;g&#8208;PLiSTFSI&#8208;b&#8208;PEGM (BC = bacterial cellulose; PLiSTFSI = poly(lithium 4&#8208;styrenesulfonyl&#8208;(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide); PEGM = poly(diethylene glycol monomethyl ether methacrylate)) with a hard nanofibril backbone and soft functional polymer side&#8208;chains is reported as an effective strategy to well balance the mechanical strength and ion conductivity of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes. The resulting single lithium&#8208;ion conducting quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer&#8208;brush electrolytes (SLIC&#8208;QSPBEs) integrate the features of the ultrathin membrane thickness (10&#160;&#181;m), the nanofibril backbone&#8208;strengthened porous nanonetwork (Young's modulus = 1.9&#160;GPa), and the high&#8208;rate single lithium&#8208;ion conducting diblock copolymer brushes. As a result, the ultrathin yet robust SLIC&#8208;QSPBEs enable ultralong&#8208;term (over 3300 h) reversible and stable lithium plating/stripping in Li/Li symmetrical cell at a current density of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for lithium anode. This work affords a promising strategy to develop advanced electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Memory Seeds Enable High Structural Phase Purity in 2D Perovskite Films for High&#8208;Efficiency Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabrication of phase&#8208;pure films of 2D perovskites using a novel, simple, and scalable method, referred to as the phase&#8208;selective method, is demonstrated. Phase&#8208;purity is enabled by the presence of sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized seeds in the precursor&#8208;solution that preserves the memory of the dissolved single&#8208;crystals. A photovoltaic efficiency of 17.1% with a VOC of 1.20 V and stability T97.5 = 800 h at MPP is reported.








Abstract
2D perovskites are a class of halide perovskites offering a pathway for realizing efficient and durable optoelectronic devices. However, the broad chemical phase space and lack of understanding of film formation have led to quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films with polydispersity in perovskite layer thicknesses, which have hindered device performance and stability. Here, a simple and scalable approach is reported, termed as the &#8220;phase&#8208;selective method&#8221;, to fabricate 2D perovskite thin films with homogenous layer thickness (phase purity). The phase&#8208;selective method involves the dissolution of single&#8208;crystalline powders with a homogeneous perovskite layer thickness in desired solvents to fabricate thin films. In situ characterizations reveal the presence of sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized seeds in solution that preserve the memory of the dissolved single crystals and dictate the nucleation and growth of grains with an identical thickness of the perovskite layers in thin films. Photovoltaic devices with a p&#8211;i&#8211;n architecture are fabricated with such films, which yield an efficiency of 17.1% enabled by an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.20 V,&#160;while preserving 97.5% of their peak performance after 800 h under illumination without any external thermal management.

         <title>Multiterminal Quantized Conductance in InSb Nanocrosses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for growth of high&#8208;quality InSb nanocrosses by molecular beam epitaxy are developed, and electrical measurements at low temperature demonstrate ballistic transport in the individual nanowire terminals and through the junction.








Abstract
By studying the time&#8208;dependent axial and radial growth of InSb nanowires (NWs), the conditions for the synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline InSb nanocrosses (NCs) by molecular beam epitaxy are mapped. Low&#8208;temperature electrical measurements of InSb NC devices with local gate control on individual terminals exhibit quantized conductance and are used to probe the spatial distribution of the conducting channels. Tuning to a situation where the NC junction is connected by few&#8208;channel quantum point contacts in the connecting NW terminals, it is shown that transport through the junction is ballistic except close to pinch&#8208;off. Combined with a new concept for shadow&#8208;epitaxy of patterned superconductors on NCs, the structures reported here show promise for the realization of non&#8208;trivial topological states in multi&#8208;terminal Josephson junctions.

         <title>Cells in Slow Motion: Apparent Undercooling Increases Glassy Behavior at Physiological Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy water (D2O) reversibly slows down cells, retards cell invasion, and drastically impacts cell mechanics possibly prolonging storage times for biological materials. Cellular dynamics transform into slow motion, which can be captured via the time&#8211;temperature superposition principle, where temperature is replaced by D2O. Induced changes are fully reversible and effects are independent of signaling/expression.








Abstract
Solvent conditions are unexpectedly sufficient to drastically and reversibly slow down cells. In vitro on the molecular level, protein&#8211;solvent interactions drastically change in the presence of heavy water (D2O) and its stronger hydrogen bonds. Adding D2O to the cell medium of living cells increases the molecular intracellular viscosity. While cell morphology and phenotype remain unchanged, cellular dynamics transform into slow motion in a changeable manner. This is exemplified in the slowdown of cell proliferation and migration, which is caused by a reversible gelation of the cytoplasm. In analogy to the time&#8211;temperature superposition principle, where temperature is replaced by D2O, an increase in viscosity slows down the effective time. Actin networks, crucial structures in the cytoplasm, switch from a power&#8208;law&#8208;like viscoelastic to a more rubber&#8208;like elastic behavior. The resulting intracellular resistance and dissipation impair cell movement. Since cells are highly adaptive non&#8208;equilibrium systems, they usually respond irreversibly from a thermodynamic perspective. D2O induced changes, however, are fully reversible and their effects are independent of signaling as well as expression. The stronger hydrogen bonds lead to glass&#8208;like, drawn&#8208;out intramolecular dynamics, which may facilitate longer storage times of biological matter, for instance, during transport of organ transplants.

         <title>Multi&#8208;State Heterojunction Transistors Based on Field&#8208;Effect Tunneling&#8211;Transport Transitions</title>

A new design for the monolithic ternary logic transistor is presented to boost the breakthrough of the semiconductor technology beyond Moore's law. A vertically stacked double n&#8208;type semiconductor heterostructure enables an equiprobable and distinctive manifestation of multiple logic states in the conventional MOSFET architecture, through the chemical&#8208;turning of electrical transitions between onsets of field&#8208;effect charge transport and tunneling behaviors.








Abstract
A monolithic ternary logic transistor based on a vertically stacked double n&#8208;type semiconductor heterostructure is presented.

&lt;p&gt;A new design for the monolithic ternary logic transistor is presented to boost the breakthrough of the semiconductor technology beyond Moore's law. A vertically stacked double n-type semiconductor heterostructure enables an equiprobable and distinctive manifestation of multiple logic states in the conventional MOSFET architecture, through the chemical-turning of electrical transitions between onsets of field-effect charge transport and tunneling behaviors.

         <title>Pattern&#8208;Potential&#8208;Guided Growth of Textured Macromolecular Films on Graphene/High&#8208;Index Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A patterned potential is constructed on graphene/Cu(122) and employed to guide the highly ordered growth of ferroelectric polymer films over a large area (&#8776;5 cm &#215; 5 cm), resulting in an enhancement of ferroelectric and mechanical property. In situ SEM and MD simulations reveal that an electrostatic interaction is crucial for the formation of oriented film. Such a strategy is also demonstrated to be applicable to other polar macromolecules.








Abstract
Macromolecular films are crucial functional materials widely used in the fields of mechanics, electronics, optoelectronics, and biology, due to their superior properties of chemical stability, small density, high flexibility, and solution&#8208;processing ability. Their electronic and mechanical properties, however, are typically much lower than those of crystalline materials, as the macromolecular films have no long&#8208;range structural ordering. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for producing highly ordered macromolecular films is still facing a great challenge due to the complex interactions between adjacent macromolecules. Here, the growth of textured macromolecular films on a designed graphene/high&#8208;index copper (Cu) surface is demonstrated. This successful growth is driven by a patterned potential that originates from the different amounts of charge transfer between the graphene and Cu surfaces with, alternately, terraces and step edges. The textured films exhibit a remarkable improvement in remnant ferroelectric polarization and fracture strength. It is also demonstrated that this growth mechanism is universal for different macromolecules. As meter&#8208;scale graphene/high&#8208;index Cu substrates have recently become available, the results open a new regime for the production and applications of highly ordered macromolecular films with obvious merits of high production and low cost.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Molecular Detection by Imaging of Centimeter&#8208;Scale Metasurfaces with a Deterministic Gradient Geometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive sensor that can detect an angstrom&#8208;thick layer of adsorbed molecules by imaging of centimeter&#8208;scale plasmonic metasurface is demonstrated. This novel sensing scheme is expected to be a promising platform for point&#8208;of&#8208;care and lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip applications, which can be realized using off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf monochromatic light sources and commercial image sensors.








Abstract
Highly sensitive detection of trace amounts of substances is crucial for broad applications in healthcare, environmental monitoring, antiterrorism, etc., where cost effectiveness and portability are often demanded. Here, an ultrasensitive sensor is reported that can detect an angstrom&#8208;thick layer of adsorbed molecules through image acquisition and processing. The sensor features a centimeter&#8208;scale plasmonic metasurface with spatially varying geometry, where the light scattering is dependent on both the adsorbed substances and spatial locations. When illuminated with narrowband light (such as from a light emitting diode), the intensity pattern recorded on the metasurface changes with the surface&#8208;adsorbed molecules, enabling label&#8208;free, sensitive, and spectrometer&#8208;free molecular detection. The centimeter&#8208;scale size of the sensing area interfaces well with consumer&#8208;level imaging sensors on mobile devices without the need for microscopic optics and offers a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by leveraging the multimillion pixels for noise reduction. It is experimentally demonstrated that a single layer of Al2O3 molecules deposited on the sensor, with a thickness of approximately one angstrom, can be detected by analyzing the images taken of the sensing chip. Furthermore, by integrating the sensor into a microfluidic setup, quantitative detection of BSA/anti&#8208;BSA immune complex formation events is demonstrated, which agrees well with the Langmuir isotherm model.

         <title>Design and Use of a Thermogelling Methylcellulose Nanoemulsion to Formulate Nanocrystalline Oral Dosage Forms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new thermogelling nanoemulsion is developed to formulate composite drug products with well&#8208;controlled active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) nanocrystals embedded in a methylcellulose matrix. The thermally gelled nanoemulsion is directly dried with the precise formation of stable API nanocrystals templated by the nanodroplets in situ. The thermogelling nanoemulsion is formulated into various dosage forms (particle, nanoparticle suspension, drug tablet, and oral thin film).








Abstract
Oral drug products have become indispensable in modern medicine because of their exceptional patient compliance. However, poor bioavailability of ubiquitous low&#8208;water&#8208;soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and lack of efficient oral drug formulations remain as significant challenges. Nanocrystalline formulations are an attractive route to increase API solubility, but typically require abrasive mechanical milling and several processing steps to create an oral dosage form. Using the dual amphiphilic and thermoresponsive properties of methylcellulose (MC), a new thermogelling nanoemulsion and a facile thermal dripping method are developed for efficient formulation of composite particles with the MC matrix embedded with precisely controlled API nanocrystals. Moreover, a fast and tunable release performance is achieved with the combination of a fast&#8208;eroding MC matrix and fast&#8208;dissolving API nanocrystals. Using the versatile thermal processing approach, the thermogelling nanoemulsion is easily formulated into a wide variety of dosage forms (nanoparticle suspension, drug tablet, and oral thin film) in a manner that avoids nanomilling. Overall, the proposed thermogelling nanoemulsion platform not only broadens the applications of thermoresponsive nanoemulsions but also shows great promise for more efficient formulation of oral drug products with high quality and tunable fast release.

         <title>Convergence of Machine Vision and Melt Electrowriting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Taylor cone volume is discovered to be a readily measurable and important signature process for melt electrowriting. Machine vision of the Taylor cone during processing gives essential information on process stability, including fiber pulsing, and correlates to the fiber diameter. When adopted to tubular melt electrowriting, exceptionally large volume prints can be manufactured that demonstrate elastic snap&#8208;through behavior.








Abstract
Melt electrowriting (MEW) is a high&#8208;resolution additive manufacturing technology that balances multiple parametric variables to arrive at a stable fabrication process. The better understanding of this balance is underscored here using high&#8208;resolution camera vision of jet stability profiles in different electrical fields. Complementing this visual information are fiber&#8208;diameter measurements obtained at precise points, allowing the correlation to electrified jet properties. Two process signatures&#8212;the jet angle and for the first time, the Taylor cone area&#8212;are monitored and analyzed with a machine vision system, while SEM imaging for diameter measurement correlates real&#8208;time information. This information, in turn, allows the detection and correction of fiber pulsing for accurate jet placement on the collector, and the in&#8208;process assessment of the fiber diameter. Improved process control is used to successfully fabricate collapsible MEW tubes; structures that require exceptional accuracy and printing stability. Using a precise winding angle of 60&#176; and 300 layers, the resulting 12 mm&#8208;thick tubular structures have elastic snap&#8208;through instabilities associated with mechanical metamaterials. This study provides a detailed analysis of the fiber pulsing occurrence in MEW and highlights the importance of real&#8208;time monitoring of the Taylor cone volume to better understand, control, and predict printing instabilities.

         <title>DNA Origami Penetration in Cell Spheroid Tissue Models is Enhanced by Wireframe Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To probe the potential for DNA&#8208;origami&#8208;based delivery devices, the effect of the folding arrangement of the DNA, on passive uptake and penetration, is studied. Despite almost identical composition and shape of the structures, wireframe&#8208;style origami penetrates deeper in tumor models than classical origami and this is likely an effect due to differences in scavenger receptor mediated uptake.








Abstract
As DNA origami applications in biomedicine are expanding, more knowledge is needed to assess these structures&#8217; interaction with biological systems. Here, uptake and penetration in cell and cell spheroid tissue models (CSTMs) are studied to elucidate whether differences in internal structure can be a factor in the efficacy of DNA&#8208;origami&#8208;based delivery. Two structures bearing largely similar features in terms of both geometry and molecular weight, but with different internal designs&#8212;being either compact, lattice&#8208;based origami or following an open, wireframe design&#8212;are designed. In CSTMs, wireframe rods are able to penetrate deeper than close&#8208;packed rods. Moreover, doxorubicin&#8208;loaded wireframe rods show a higher cytotoxicity in CSTMs. These results can be explained by differences in structural mechanics, local deformability, local material density, and accessibility to cell receptors between these two DNA origami design paradigms. In particular, it is suggested that the main reason for the difference in penetration dynamic arises from differences in interaction with scavenger receptors where lattice&#8208;based structures appear to be internalized to a higher degree than polygonal structures of the same size and shape. It is thus argued that the choice of structural design method constitutes a crucial parameter for the application of DNA origami in drug delivery.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Electronic Ground&#8208;State Charge Transfer in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amount of charge transfer between components of a van der Waals heterostructure to reach the electronic ground state can exhibit a strong temperature dependence. For a donor&#8211;bridge&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type heterostructure, the intra component electron&#8211;phonon coupling and the intercomponent electronic coupling result in a temperature&#8208;dependent density of states available for charge transfer.








Abstract
Electronic charge rearrangement between components of a heterostructure is the fundamental principle to reach the electronic ground state. It is acknowledged that the density of state distribution of the components governs the amount of charge transfer, but a notable dependence on temperature is not yet considered, particularly for weakly interacting systems. Here, it is experimentally observed that the amount of ground&#8208;state charge transfer in a van der Waals heterostructure formed by monolayer MoS2 sandwiched between graphite and a molecular electron acceptor layer increases by a factor of 3 when going from 7 K to room temperature. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic structure calculations of the full heterostructure that accounts for nuclear thermal fluctuations reveal intracomponent electron&#8211;phonon coupling and intercomponent electronic coupling as the key factors determining the amount of charge transfer. This conclusion is rationalized by a model applicable to multicomponent van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>2D NbOI2: A Chiral Semiconductor with Highly In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Electrical and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
NbOI2 has a strong in&#8208;plane structural anisotropy, where the [NbO2I4] octahedra are connected through I&#8211;I edges along the c&#8208;axis and cornered O atoms along the b&#8208;axis. The I anions with weaker electronegativity contribute to the electrons near the Fermi surface, leading to the highly anisotropic dispersion of band structures along the c&#8208;axis. Hence, NbOI2 exhibits large anisotropic factor of 1.75 and 1.7 for optical absorbance and photoresponsivity, which makes it a promising platform for novel polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection applications.








Abstract
Exploring in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D materials is of great significance to the fundamental studies and further development of polarizationsensitive optoelectronics. Herein, chiral niobium oxide diiodide (NbOI2) is introduced into the intriguing anisotropic 2D family with the experimental demonstration of anisotropic optical and electrical properties. 2D NbOI2 crystals exhibit highly anisotropic dispersed band structures around the Fermi surface and strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy of phonon vibrations owing to the different bonding modes of Nb atoms along the b&#8208; and c&#8208;axes. Consequently, the anisotropic factors of optical absorbance and photoresponsivity in 2D NbOI2 crystals reach up to 1.75 and 1.7, respectively. These anisotropic properties make 2D NbOI2 an interesting platform for novel polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Tailoring of White Luminescence in a NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ Phosphor Containing Broad&#8208;Band Defect&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transfer Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;component white emitter is developed by introducing defect&#8208;associated charge&#8208;transfer emission in a NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor via a facile composition modification strategy. An extra broadband yellow peak (585&#160;nm) appears in addition to the narrow&#8208;band blue emission (472&#160;nm). A single&#8208;component white light&#8208;emitting diode with color&#8208;rendering index of 82.9 is fabricated using the white phosphor.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component materials with white&#8208;light emission are ideal for lighting applications. However, it is very challenging to achieve white luminescence in single&#8208;dopant activated solid phosphors. Herein, white NaLi3Si1&#8722;xO4:Eu2+ materials are designed via defect engineering and synthesized by reducing the Si content (0.15 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 0.25). Stochiometric NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ exhibits a narrow&#8208;band blue emission at 469&#160;nm, ascribed to the 5d &#8594; 4f transition of Eu2+ at highly symmetric cuboid Na sites, while samples with Si content reduced by 15&#8211;25% display white emission with two peaks at 472&#160;nm and 585&#160;nm. The newly appeared broadband yellow peak arises from charge&#8208;transfer transitions involving Eu2+ and nearby defects, as verified by an unusual bandwidth, a large Stokes shift, and a long decay time. A single&#8208;component white light&#8208;emitting diode device is fabricated by employing a white phosphor to demonstrate a color&#8208;rendering index of 82.9. This result provides a new design strategy for single&#8208;component white&#8208;light materials with broad&#8208;band defect&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer emission.

         <title>Visco&#8208;Poroelastic Electrochemiluminescence Skin with Piezo&#8208;Ionic Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material platform capable of transducing mechanical stimuli into visual readout is presented. The material platform contains liquid state electrochemiluminescence (ECL) active materials within rubbery polymer matrix, which undergoes visco&#8208;poroelastic response to mechanical stress. Incorporating this visco&#8208;poroelastic material into a simple electronic device, which is termed &#8220;ECL skin&#8221;, locally applied stress is spatially resolved and visualized.








Abstract
Following early research efforts devoted to achieving excellent sensitivity of electronic skins, recent design schemes for these devices have focused on strategies for transduction of spatially resolved sensing data into straightforward user&#8208;adaptive visual signals.

Emission from the ECL skin is examined, which increases with the applied normal/tensile stress. Additionally, locally applied stress to the ECL skin is spatially resolved and visualized without the use of spatially distributed arrays of pressure sensors. The simple fabrication and unique operation of the demonstrated ECL skin are expected to provide new insights into the design of materials for human&#8211;machine interactive electronic skins.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets with Variable Functionalities</title>

         <dc:description>
Direct, scalable, and surfactant&#8208;free synthesis of metal&#8211;organic framework suspensions encompassing exceptionally large NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with variable functionalities and excellent solution processability is presented. Relevant monoliths, aero&#8208; and xerogels, and large&#8208;area textured films with a great homogeneity, controllable thickness, and appreciable mechanical properties can be facilely fabricated. The sensors coated with NUS&#8208;8 possessing variable functionalities exhibit distinguishable sensing behaviors toward acetone.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) intrinsically lack fluidity and thus solution processability. Direct synthesis of MOFs exhibiting solution processability like polymers remains challenging but highly sought&#8208;after for multitudinous applications. Herein, a one&#8208;pot, surfactant&#8208;free, and scalable synthesis of highly stable MOF suspensions composed of exceptionally large (average area &gt;&#160;15&#160;000 &#181;m2) NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with variable functionalities and excellent solution processability is presented. This is achieved by adding capping molecules during the synthesis, and by judicious controls of precursor concentration and MOF nanosheet&#8211;solvent interactions. The resulting 2D NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with variable functionalities exhibit excellent solution processability. As such, relevant monoliths, aero&#8208; and xerogels, and large&#8208;area textured films with a great homogeneity, controllable thickness, and appreciable mechanical properties can be facilely fabricated. Additionally, from both the molecular&#8208; and chip&#8208;level it is demonstrated that capacitive sensors integrated with NUS&#8208;8 films functionalized with different terminal groups exhibit distinguishable sensing behaviors toward acetone due to their disparate host&#8211;guest interactions. It is envisioned that this simple approach will greatly facilitate the integration of MOFs in miniaturized electronic devices and benefit their mass production.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Encryption in a Shape&#8208;Memory Hydrogel with Tunable Fluorescence and Reconfigurable Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reprogrammable dual&#8208;encryption of information storage is realized in a tough hydrogel with good shape&#8208;memory ability and phototunable fluorescence, enabling reconfigured 3D architectures and rewritable 2D fluorescent patterns, respectively. The encrypted information in the architectured hydrogel becomes readable only after sequential shape recovery and UV light irradiation, affording improved security and reuse of information materials in aqueous environments.








Abstract
Materials capable of shape&#8208;morphing and/or fluorescence imaging have practical significances in the fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information display, and information protection. However, it's challenging to realize these functions in hydrogels due to the poor mechanical properties and lack of tunable fluorescence. A tough hydrogel with good shape&#8208;memory ability and phototunable fluorescence is reported here, which affords reprogrammable shape designing and information encoding for dual&#8208;encryption. This hydrogel is prepared by incorporating donor&#8211;acceptor chromophore units into a poly(1&#8208;vinylimidazole&#8208;co&#8208;methacrylic acid) network, in which the dense intra&#8208; and interchain hydrogen bonds lead to desirable features including high stiffness, high toughness, and temperature&#8208;mediated shape&#8208;memory property. Additionally, the hydrogel shows photomediated tunable fluorescence through a unimer&#8208;to&#8208;dimer transformation of the chromophores. By combining photolithography and origami/kirigami designs, hydrogel sheets encoded with fluorescent patterns can deform into specific 3D configurations. The geometrically encrypted fluorescent information in the architected hydrogels is readable only after sequential shape recovery and UV light irradiation. As demonstrated by proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments, both the fluorescent pattern and the 3D configuration are reprogrammable, facilitating repeated information protection and display. The design of tough hydrogels with rewritable fluorescent patterns and reconfigurable shapes should guide the future development of smart materials with improved security and wider applications in aqueous environments.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Monolayer LED with Hybrid Continuous&#8208;Pulsed Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer WS2 light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) operate in a hybrid mode of continuous&#8208;pulsed injection, which has a high emission efficiency and tunable emission wavelength. The negatively charged defect electroluminescence emission has a large quantum efficiency and can be visualized and distinguished in real space. This work is aimed at inspiring further high&#8208;performance and wavelength&#8208;tunable LED devices for future advanced optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency and wavelength&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) devices will play an important role in future advanced optoelectronic systems. Traditional semiconductor LED devices typically have a fixed emission wavelength that is determined by the energy of the emission states. Here, a novel high&#8208;efficiency and wavelength&#8208;tunable monolayer WS2 LED device, which operates in the hybrid mode of continuous&#8208;pulsed injection, is developed. This hybrid injection enables highly enhanced emission efficiency (&gt;20 times) and effective size of emission area (&gt;5 times) at room temperature. The emission wavelength of the WS2 monolayer LED device can be tuned over more than 40&#160;nm by driving AC voltages, from exciton emission to trion emission, and further to defect emission. The quantum efficiency of defect electroluminescence (EL) emission is measured to be more than 24.5 times larger than that from free exciton and trion EL emission. The separate carrier injection in the LED also demonstrates advantages in allowing defect species to be visualized and distinguished in real space. Those defects are assigned to be negatively charged defects. The results open a new route to develop high&#8208;performance and wavelength&#8208;tunable LED devices for future advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Complex Metal Nanostructures with Programmable Shapes from Simple DNA Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile construction kit for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of complex metal nanostructures with programmable shapes is presented. It uses different DNA elements that can be docked together to produce hollow mold superstructures for metal filling. Electrical and optical characterizations of the obtained metallic nanostructures explore their potential for the self&#8208;assembly of nanoelectronic and nanooptic devices.








Abstract
Advances in DNA nanotechnology allow the design and fabrication of highly complex DNA structures, uisng specific programmable interactions between smaller nucleic acid building blocks. To convey this concept to the fabrication of metallic nanoparticles, an assembly platform is developed based on a few basic DNA structures that can serve as molds. Programming specific interactions between these elements allows the assembly of mold superstructures with a range of different geometries. Subsequent seeded growth of gold within the mold cavities enables the synthesis of complex metal structures including tightly DNA&#8208;caged particles, rolling&#8208;pin&#8208; and dumbbell&#8208;shaped particles, as well as T&#8208;shaped and loop particles with high continuity. The method further supports the formation of higher&#8208;order assemblies of the obtained metal geometries. Based on electrical and optical characterizations, it is expected that the developed platform is a valuable tool for a self&#8208;assembly&#8208;based fabrication of nanoelectronic and nanooptic devices.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Coordinated Biocatalysts for Chem&#8208;/Sono&#8208;/Photo&#8208;Trimodal Tumor Therapies</title>

         <dc:description>
A precisely designed Pd single&#8208;atom coordinated biocatalyst (Pd&#8208;Pta/Por) is synthesized for achieving chem&#8208;/sono&#8208;/photo&#8208;trimodal dynamic tumor therapies. Experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Pd&#8208;Pta/Por biocatalyst consists of atomic Pd&#8208;N coordination active sites and has efficient catalytic yield of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for highly synergistic antitumor therapies, which takes an essential step toward developing ROS&#8208;related therapeutic and biological applications.








Abstract
The diversity, complexity, and heterogeneity of malignant tumor seriously undermine the efficiency of mono&#8208;modal treatment. Recently, multi&#8208;modal therapeutics with enhanced antitumor efficiencies have attracted increasing attention. However, designing a nanotherapeutic platform with uniform morphology in nanoscale that integrates with efficient chem&#8208;/sono&#8208;/photo&#8208;trimodal tumor therapies is still a great challenge. Here, new and facile Pd&#8208;single&#8208;atom coordinated porphyrin&#8208;based polymeric networks as biocatalysts, namely, Pd&#8208;Pta/Por, for chem&#8208;/sono&#8208;/photo&#8208;trimodal tumor therapies are designed. The atomic morphology and chemical structure analysis prove that the biocatalyst consists of atomic Pd&#8208;N coordination networks with a Pd&#8208;N2&#8208;Cl2 catalytic center. The characterization of peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activities displays that the Pd&#8208;Pta/Por can generate abundant &#8226;OH radicals for chemodynamic therapies. The ultrasound irradiation or laser excitation can significantly boost the catalytic production of 1O2 by the porphyrin&#8208;based sono&#8208;/photosensitizers to achieve combined sono&#8208;/photodynamic therapies. The superior catalytic production of &#8226;OH is further verified by density functional theory calculation. Finally, the corresponding in vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated their synergistic chem&#8208;/sono&#8208;/photo&#8208;trimodal antitumor efficacies. It is believed that this study provides new promising single&#8208;atom&#8208;coordinated polymeric networks with highly efficient biocatalytic sites and synergistic trimodal therapeutic effects, which may inspire many new findings in reactive oxygen species&#8208;related biological applications across broad therapeutics and biomedical fields.

&lt;p&gt;A precisely designed Pd single-atom coordinated biocatalyst (Pd-Pta/Por) is synthesized for achieving chem-/sono-/photo-trimodal dynamic tumor therapies. Experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Pd-Pta/Por biocatalyst consists of atomic Pd-N coordination active sites and has efficient catalytic yield of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for highly synergistic antitumor therapies, which takes an essential step toward developing ROS-related therapeutic and biological applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diversity, complexity, and heterogeneity of malignant tumor seriously undermine the efficiency of mono-modal treatment. Recently, multi-modal therapeutics with enhanced antitumor efficiencies have attracted increasing attention. However, designing a nanotherapeutic platform with uniform morphology in nanoscale that integrates with efficient chem-/sono-/photo-trimodal tumor therapies is still a great challenge. Here, new and facile Pd-single-atom coordinated porphyrin-based polymeric networks as biocatalysts, namely, Pd-Pta/Por, for chem-/sono-/photo-trimodal tumor therapies are designed. The atomic morphology and chemical structure analysis prove that the biocatalyst consists of atomic Pd-N coordination networks with a Pd-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalytic center. The characterization of peroxidase-like catalytic activities displays that the Pd-Pta/Por can generate abundant &#8226;OH radicals for chemodynamic therapies. The ultrasound irradiation or laser excitation can significantly boost the catalytic production of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the porphyrin-based sono-/photosensitizers to achieve combined sono-/photodynamic therapies. The superior catalytic production of &#8226;OH is further verified by density functional theory calculation. Finally, the corresponding in vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated their synergistic chem-/sono-/photo-trimodal antitumor efficacies. It is believed that this study provides new promising single-atom-coordinated polymeric networks with highly efficient biocatalytic sites and synergistic trimodal therapeutic effects, which may inspire many new findings in reactive oxygen species-related biological applications across broad therapeutics and biomedical fields.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cells in Slow Motion: Cells in Slow Motion: Apparent Undercooling Increases Glassy Behavior at Physiological Temperatures (Adv. Mater. 29/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
In article number 2101840, J&#246;rg Schnau&#223; and co&#8208;workers show that heavy water (D2O) reversibly slows down cells, retards cell invasion, and drastically impacts cell mechanics, possibly prolonging storage times for biological materials. The cellular dynamics, which transform into slow motion, can be captured via the time&#8208;temperature superposition principle, where temperature is replaced by D2O. Induced changes are fully reversible and effects are independent of signaling/expression.

         <dc:description>
In article number 2100321, a material platform capable of transducing mechanical stimuli into visual readout is presented by Do Hwan Kim, Moon Sung Kang, and co&#8208;workers. The electrochemiluminescent ionic materials embedded into a rubbery polymer matrix undergo visco&#8208;poroelastic response to mechanical stress, resulting in the piezoionic effect. Locally applied stress can be spatially resolved and visualized via change in the luminescence.

         <dc:description>
Achieving synergy between electrochemistry and microelectronics is a hard&#8208;hitting task. In article number 2101518, Carlos C. Bof Bufon and co&#8208;workers employ rolling&#8208;origami nanotechnology to build up novel organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) featuring outstanding performance. The findings also anticipate that rolling&#8208;origami OECTs are enormously appealing candidates to future applications in chemical and biological sensors (viz., for neurotransmitter detection).

Liquid metals with superior mechanical properties and low reduction potentials are a class of promising metal anodes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, that are intrinsically dendrite&#8208;free and conformal at various interfaces. Designs based on liquid metals promise intermittent renewable energy resources as power sources for flexible electronics, electric automobiles, and even grid&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems, as discussed by Guihua Yu and co&#8208;workers in article number 2100052.

The amount of charge transfer between components of a van der Waals heterostructure to reach the electronic ground state can exhibit a strong temperature dependence. In article number 2008677, Mariana Rossi, Norbert Koch, and co&#8208;workers experimentally observe that the amount of ground&#8208;state charge transfer in a van der Waals heterostructure formed by monolayer MoS2 sandwiched between graphite and a molecular electron&#8208;acceptor layer increases by a factor of 3 when going from 7 K to room temperature.

         <title>Nanoarchitectured Porous Conducting Polymers: From Controlled Synthesis to Advanced Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
Conductive polymers (CPs) exhibit the characteristics of conventional polymers and the electrical properties of metals. The recent advances in the development and utilization of CPs for energy, sensing, and bioapplications are reviewed. Particular emphasis is given on the tuning of their structural parameters to optimize their performance. Finally, the current challenges and future outlook in this field are summarized.








Abstract
Conductive polymers (CPs) integrate the inherent characteristics of conventional polymers and the unique electrical properties of metals. They have aroused tremendous interest over the last decade owing to their high conductivity, robust and flexible properties, facile fabrication, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Compared to bulk CPs, porous CPs with well&#8208;defined nano&#8208; or microstructures possess open porous architectures, high specific surface areas, more exposed reactive sites, and remarkably enhanced activities. These attractive features have led to their applications in sensors, energy storage and conversion devices, biomedical devices, and so on. In this review article, the different strategies for synthesizing porous CPs, including template&#8208;free and template&#8208;based methods, are summarized, and the importance of tuning the morphology and pore structure of porous CPs to optimize their functional performance is highlighted. Moreover, their representative applications (energy storage devices, sensors, biomedical devices, etc.) are also discussed. The review is concluded by discussing the current challenges and future development&#160;trend&#160;in&#160;this&#160;field.

         <title>Design Principles and Applications of Next&#8208;Generation High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries Based on Liquid Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of applications on low&#8208;melting&#8208;temperature liquid metals in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries is presented. Starting from the theoretical basis of materials properties and electrochemical features with liquid metals and alloys, reported applications are summarized by working mechanisms, critically evaluated with strengths and issues, and proposed with future development directions in the field.








Abstract
Increasing need for the renewable energy supply accelerated the thriving studies of Li&#8208;ion batteries, whereas if the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li as well as alkali metals should be adopted as battery electrodes is still under fierce debate for safety concerns. Recently, a group of low&#8208;melting temperature metals and alloys that are in liquid phase at or near room&#8208;temperature are being reported for battery applications, by which the battery energy could be improved without significant dendrite issue. Besides the dendrite&#8208;free feature, liquid metals can also promise various high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery designs on the basis of unique materials properties. In this review, the design principles for liquid metals&#8208;based batteries from mechanical, electrochemical, and thermodynamical aspects are provided. With the understanding of the theoretical basis, currently reported relevant designs are summarized and analyzed focusing on the working mechanism, effectiveness evaluation, and novel application. An overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art liquid metal battery developments and future prospects is also provided in the end as a reference for further research explorations.

         <title>Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss in Lead Chalcogenide Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current high&#8208;efficiency lead chalcogenide colloidal quantum dot solar cells still have high Voc loss, which places great restrictions on the performance enhancement. The origin of Voc loss from solar absorber and interface is discussed in detail and various strategies for reducing the loss are summarized. Moreover, promising research directions are provided to further improve the solar cell performance.








Abstract
Lead chalcogenide colloidal quantum dot solar cells (CQDSCs) have received considerable attention due to their broad and tunable absorption and high stability. Presently, lead chalcogenide CQDSC has achieved a power conversion efficiency of &#8776;14%. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lead chalcogenide CQDSC still has an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss of &#8776;0.45&#160;V, which is significantly higher than those of c&#8208;Si and perovskite solar cells. Such high Voc loss severely limits the performance improvement and commercialization of lead chalcogenide CQDSCs. In this review, the Voc loss is first analyzed via detailed balance theory and the origin of Voc loss from both solar absorber and interface is summarized. Subsequently, various strategies for improving the Voc from the solar absorber, including the passivation strategies during the synthesis and ligand exchange are overviewed. The great impact of the ligand exchange process on CQD passivation is highlighted and the corresponding strategies to further reduce the Voc loss are summarized. Finally, various strategies are discussed to reduce interface Voc loss from charge transport layers. More importantly, the great potential of achieving performance breakthroughs via various organic hole transport layers is highlighted and the existing challenges toward commercialization are discussed.

         <title>Advances in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: From Academic Research to Commercial Viability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major developments and advancements of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries over the past 60 years are presented. The prospects and an outlook on the future development of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries for large&#8208;scale practical applications are also discussed and presented.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which have revolutionized portable electronics over the past three decades, were eventually recognized with the 2019 Nobel Prize in chemistry. As the energy density of current lithium&#8208;ion batteries is approaching its limit, developing new battery technologies beyond lithium&#8208;ion chemistry is significant for next&#8208;generation high energy storage. Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, which rely on the reversible redox reactions between lithium and sulfur, appears to be a promising energy storage system to take over from the conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries for next&#8208;generation energy storage owing to their overwhelming energy density compared to the existing lithium&#8208;ion batteries today. Over the past 60 years, especially the past decade, significant academic and commercial progress has been made on Li&#8211;S batteries. From the concept of the sulfur cathode first proposed in the 1960s to the current commercial Li&#8211;S batteries used in unmanned aircraft, the story of Li&#8211;S batteries is full of breakthroughs and back tracing steps. Herein, the development and advancement of Li&#8211;S batteries in terms of sulfur&#8208;based composite cathode design, separator modification, binder improvement, electrolyte optimization, and lithium metal protection is summarized. An outlook on the future directions and prospects for Li&#8211;S batteries is also offered.

         <title>Nanostructure Engineering and Modulation of (Oxy)Nitrides for Application in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of bulk structure, size, morphology, and surface/interface properties on the basic processes, particularly for the charge separation of (oxy)nitride&#8208;based nanophotocatalysts, are systematically described, with the aim of understanding the development of methodologies and strategies for modulating the bulk and composite nanostructures to improve the solar energy conversion efficiencies of the (oxy)nitrides.








Abstract
(Oxy)nitride&#8208;based nanophotocatalysts have been extensively investigated for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, and not only allow wide spectral utilization to achieve high theoretical energy conversion efficiency but also exhibit suitable conduction and valence band positions for robust reduction and oxidation of water. During the past decades, a few reviews on the research progress in designing and synthesizing new visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive semiconductors for various applications in solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion have been published. However, those on the effects of their bulk and composite (surface/interface) nanostructures on basic processes as well as solar water splitting performances to produce hydrogen are still limited. In this review, a brief introduction on the relationship between the nanostructure photocatalytic properties is included. Three main processes of solar water splitting are involved, allowing the elucidation of the correlation with the nanostructural properties of the photocatalyst such as surface/interface, size, morphology, and bulk structure. Subsequently, the development of methodologies and strategies for modulating the bulk and composite structures to improve the efficiencies of the basic processes, particularly charge separation, is summarized in detail. Finally, the prospects of (oxy)nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts such as controlled synthesis, modulation of 1D/2D morphology, exposed facet regulation, heterostructure formation, theoretical simulation, and time&#8208; and space&#8208;resolved spectroscopy are discussed.

         <title>Emerging 2D Memory Devices for In&#8208;Memory Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 29, July 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;memory computing that performs computations in situ within a nonvolatile memory unit is considered as one of the mainstream hardware implementations for future data&#8208;intensive computing applications. The recent progress from 2D memory devices to their applications for in&#8208;memory computing is summarized, and the current challenges and potential strategies in this exciting field are proposed.








Abstract
It is predicted that the conventional von Neumann computing architecture cannot meet the demands of future data&#8208;intensive computing applications due to the bottleneck between the processing and memory units. To try to solve this problem, in&#8208;memory computing technology, where calculations are carried out in situ within each nonvolatile memory unit, has been intensively studied. Among various candidate materials, 2D layered materials have recently demonstrated many new features that have been uniquely exploited to build next&#8208;generation electronics. Here, the recent progress of 2D memory devices is reviewed for in&#8208;memory computing. For each memory configuration, their operation mechanisms and memory characteristics are described, and their pros and cons are weighed. Subsequently, their versatile applications for in&#8208;memory computing technology, including logic operations, electronic synapses, and random number generation are presented. Finally, the current challenges and potential strategies for future 2D in&#8208;memory computing systems are also discussed at the material, device, circuit, and architecture levels.

     alt="Emerging 2D Memory Devices for In-Memory Computing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-memory computing that performs computations in situ within a nonvolatile memory unit is considered as one of the mainstream hardware implementations for future data-intensive computing applications. The recent progress from 2D memory devices to their applications for in-memory computing is summarized, and the current challenges and potential strategies in this exciting field are proposed.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is predicted that the conventional von Neumann computing architecture cannot meet the demands of future data-intensive computing applications due to the bottleneck between the processing and memory units. To try to solve this problem, in-memory computing technology, where calculations are carried out in situ within each nonvolatile memory unit, has been intensively studied. Among various candidate materials, 2D layered materials have recently demonstrated many new features that have been uniquely exploited to build next-generation electronics. Here, the recent progress of 2D memory devices is reviewed for in-memory computing. For each memory configuration, their operation mechanisms and memory characteristics are described, and their pros and cons are weighed. Subsequently, their versatile applications for in-memory computing technology, including logic operations, electronic synapses, and random number generation are presented. Finally, the current challenges and potential strategies for future 2D in-memory computing systems are also discussed at the material, device, circuit, and architecture levels. It is hoped that this manuscript could give a comprehensive review of 2D memory devices and their applications in in-memory computing, and be helpful for this exciting research area.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
Wood&#8208;derived cellulose materials by structure&#8208;retaining delignification show excellent mechanical properties and facilitate the embedding of advanced functionality. To pave the way for a multitude of applications and substitute less ecofriendly materials, future research needs to focus on a deeper understanding of the impact of the various processing steps and the resulting structure&#8211;property relationships.








Abstract
Wood&#8208;derived cellulose materials obtained by structure&#8208;retaining delignification are attracting increasing attention due to their excellent mechanical properties and great potential to serve as renewable and CO2 storing cellulose scaffolds for advanced hybrid materials with embedded functionality. Various delignification protocols and a multitude of further processing steps including polymer impregnation and densification are applied resulting in a large range of properties. However, treatment optimization requires a more comprehensive characterization of the developed materials in terms of structure, chemical composition, and mechanical properties for faster progress in the field. Herein, the current protocols for structure&#8208;retaining delignification are reviewed and the emphasis is placed on the mechanical characterization at different hierarchical levels of the cellulose scaffolds by experiments and modeling to reveal the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships.

Top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up wood&#8208;based structures provide a hierarchically porous, fibrous material platform for ion transport and regulation through multiscale channels. Through structural and compositional engineering, the ion transport behavior in wood&#8208;based structures can be regulated toward various emerging device applications.








Abstract
Ion transport and regulation are fundamental processes for various devices and applications related to energy storage and conversion, environmental remediation, sensing, ionotronics, and biotechnology. Wood&#8208;based materials, fabricated by top&#8208;down or bottom&#8208;up approaches, possess a unique hierarchically porous fibrous structure that offers an appealing material platform for multiscale ion regulation. The ion transport behavior in these materials can be regulated through structural and compositional engineering from the macroscale down to the nanoscale, imparting wood&#8208;based materials with multiple functions for a range of emerging applications. A fundamental understanding of ion transport behavior in wood&#8208;based structures enhances the capability to design high&#8208;performance ion&#8208;regulating devices and promotes the utilization of sustainable wood materials. Combining this unique ion regulation capability with the renewable and cost&#8208;effective raw materials available, wood and its derivatives are the natural choice of materials toward sustainability.

         <title>Beyond What Meets the Eye: Imaging and Imagining Wood Mechanical&#8211;Structural Properties</title>

A review of the imaging of wood at various length scales is presented, showing how hierarchical properties are achieved and demonstrating unique levels of physical and mechanical performance.








Abstract
Wood presents a hierarchical structure, containing features at all length scales: from the tracheids or vessels that make up its cellular structure, through to the microfibrils within the cell walls, down to the molecular architecture of the cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses that comprise its chemical makeup. This structure renders it with high mechanical (e.g., modulus and strength) and interesting physical (e.g., optical) properties. A better understanding of this structure, and how it plays a role in governing mechanical and other physical parameters, will help to better exploit this sustainable resource. Here, recent developments on the use of advanced imaging techniques for studying the structural properties of wood in relation to its mechanical properties are explored. The focus is on synchrotron nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray tomographical imaging, Raman and infrared spectroscopies, confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Critical discussion on the role of imaging techniques and how fields are developing rapidly to incorporate both spatial and temporal ranges of analysis is presented.

         <title>Nanocellulose in Emulsions and Heterogeneous Water&#8208;Based Polymer Systems: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses have unique properties and have been shown to assemble at oil&#8211;water interfaces and impart new functionality to emulsions and latexes. The use of nanocellulose in both emulsions and heterogeneous water&#8208;based polymer systems is reported. Comprehensive tables with past work employing nanocellulose as stabilizers or additives are presented, and properties that can be tailored through the use of nanocellulose are highlighted.








Abstract
Nanocelluloses (i.e., bacterial nanocellulose, cellulose nanocrystals, and cellulose nanofibrils) are cellulose&#8208;based materials with at least one dimension in the nanoscale. These materials have unique and useful properties and have been shown to assemble at oil&#8211;water interfaces and impart new functionality to emulsion and latex systems. Herein, the use of nanocellulose in both emulsions and heterogeneous water&#8208;based polymers is reviewed, including dispersion, suspension, and emulsion polymerization. Comprehensive tables describe past work employing nanocellulose as stabilizers or additives and the properties that can be tailored through the use of nanocellulose are highlighted. Even at low loadings, nanocellulose offers an unprecedented level of control as a property modifier for a range of emulsion and polymer applications, influencing, for example, emulsion type, stability, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. Nanocellulose can tune polymer particle properties such as size, surface charge, and morphology, or be used to produce capsules and polymer nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical, thermal, and adhesive properties. The role of nanocellulose is discussed, and a perspective for future direction is presented.

         <title>Surface and Interface Engineering for Nanocellulosic Advanced Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses, the natural reinforcement for plants, are incredibly strong and stiff, and are therefore under great scrutiny for incorporation in sustainable, ecofriendly, and strong man&#8208;made materials. Nanocelluloses enable dramatic tailoring of surface chemistry, interface interactions, and functionalities via chemical and/or physical surface and interface engineering that permit assembly of diverse nanocellulosic materials. Some of the promising progress in this area is reviewed.








Abstract
How do trees support their upright massive bodies? The support comes from the incredibly strong and stiff, and highly crystalline nanoscale fibrils of extended cellulose chains, called cellulose nanofibers. Cellulose nanofibers and their crystalline parts&#8212;cellulose nanocrystals, collectively nanocelluloses, are therefore the recent hot materials to incorporate in man&#8208;made sustainable, environmentally sound, and mechanically strong materials. Nanocelluloses are generally obtained through a top&#8208;down process, during or after which the original surface chemistry and interface interactions can be dramatically changed. Therefore, surface and interface engineering are extremely important when nanocellulosic materials with a bottom&#8208;up process are fabricated. Herein, the main focus is on promising chemical modification and nonmodification approaches, aiming to prospect this hot topic from novel aspects, including nanocellulose&#8208;, chemistry&#8208;, and process&#8208;oriented surface and interface engineering for advanced nanocellulosic materials. The reinforcement of nanocelluloses in some functional materials, such as structural materials, films, filaments, aerogels, and foams, is discussed, relating to tailored surface and/or interface engineering. Although some of the nanocellulosic products have already reached the industrial arena, it is hoped that more and more nanocellulose&#8208;based products will become available in everyday life in the next few years.

         <title>Recent Progress in High&#8208;Strength and Robust Regenerated Cellulose Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rengenerated cellulose materials with the forms of films/membranes, fibers, hydrogels, aerogels, beads/microspheres can be designed via chemical crosslinking, chemically dual&#8208;crosslinking, physical crosslinking, and chemically and physically double crosslinking for achieving the high strength and bidegradability. These cellulose&#8208;based materials are a promising substitute for nonbiodegradable petroleum&#8208;derived synthetic polymers, contribut ing to a sustainable development in the world.








Abstract
High&#8208;strength petroleum&#8208;based materials like plastics have been widely used in various fields, but their nonbiodegradability has caused serious pollution problems. Cellulose, as the most abundant sustainable polymer, has a great chance to act as the ideal substitute for plastics due to its low cost, wide availability, biodegradability, etc. Herein, the recent achievements for developing cellulose &#8220;green&#8221; solvents and regenerated cellulose materials with high strength via the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; route are presented. Cellulose can be regenerated to produce films/membranes, hydrogels/aerogels, filaments/fibers, microspheres/beads, bioplastics, etc., which show potential applications in textiles, biomedicine, energy storage, packaging, etc. Importantly, these cellulose&#8208;based materials can be biodegraded in soil and oceans, reducing environmental pollution. The cellulose solvents, dissolving mechanism, and strategies for constructing the regenerated cellulose functional materials with high strength and performances, together with the current achievements and urgent challenges are summarized, and some perspectives are also proposed. The near future will be an exciting era for high&#8208;strength biodegradable and renewable materials. The hope is that many environmentally friendly materials with good properties and low cost will be produced for commercial use, which will be beneficial for sustainable development in the world.

         <title>The Use of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Self&#8208;Assembly and Nanocellulose to Prepare Advanced Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current literature on the use of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembled structures of nanocelluloses and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes for the preparation of strong, adhesive, electrically interactive, and biologically interactive thin films is summarized. By using this renewable and biodegradable nanomaterial, it is shown possible to prepare high&#8208;performance materials in a noncomplicated way.








Abstract
The current knowledge about the formation of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assemblies using combinations of nanocelluloses (NCs) and polyelectrolytes is reviewed. Herein, the fundamentals behind the LbL formation, with a major focus on NCs, are considered. Following this, a special description of the limiting factors for the formation of LbLs of only NCs, both anionic and cationic, and the combination&#160;of NCs and polyelectrolytes/nanoparticles is provided. The ability of the NCs and polyelectrolytes to form dense films with excellent mechanical properties and with tailored optical properties is then reviewed. How low&#8208;density, wet stable&#160;networks of cellulose nanofibrils can be used as substrates for the preparation of antibacterial, electrically interactive, and fire&#8208;retardant materials by forming well&#8208;defined LbLs inside these networks is then considered. A short outlook of the possible uses of LbLs containing NCs is given to conclude.

         <dc:description>
Wood components are considered as important feedstocks to fabricate functional materials. An insightful summary of recent wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials is provided from the perspective of macromolecular engineering, including the structural characteristics of cellulose and lignin, molecular modification, and subsequent assembly behavior to generate distinctive functional materials.








Abstract
In recent years, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to developing wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials due to their distinctive properties, including environmental friendliness, renewability, and biodegradability. Thus, the uniqueness of the main components in wood (cellulose and lignin) has attracted enormous interest for both fundamental research and practical applications. Herein, the emerging field of wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by means of macromolecular engineering is reviewed, covering the basic structures and properties of the main components, the design principle to utilize these main components, and the resulting wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials in terms of elastomers, hydrogels, aerogels, and nanoparticles. In detail, the natural features of wood components and their significant roles in the fabrication of materials are emphasized. Furthermore, the utilization of controlled/living polymerization, click chemistry, dynamic bonds chemistry, etc., for the modification is specifically discussed from the perspective of molecular design, together with their sequential assembly into different morphologies. The functionalities of wood&#8208;derived polymeric materials are mainly focused on self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;memory abilities, adsorption, conduction, etc. Finally, the main challenges of wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by macromolecular engineering are presented, as well as the potential solutions or directions to develop green and scalable wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials.

         <title>Recent Progress on Cellulose&#8208;Based Ionic Compounds for Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic cellulose&#8208;based compounds as either polymeric cellulose derivatives or ionic nanocellulose have gained tremendous attention within the last years due to their remarkable properties, especially their biological properties. Recent advances about various ionic cellulose&#8208;based compounds with diverse functional moieties either along the cellulose chains or on the surface of nanocellulose for biomedical applications are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Glycans play important roles in all major kingdoms of organisms, such as archea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Cellulose, the most abundant polysaccharide on the Earth, plays a predominant role for mechanical stability in plants, and finds a plethora of applications by humans. Beyond traditional use, biomedical application of cellulose becomes feasible with advances of soluble cellulose derivatives with diverse functional moieties along the backbone and modified nanocellulose with versatile functional groups on the surface due to the native features of cellulose as both cellulose chains and supramolecular ordered domains as extractable nanocellulose. With the focus on ionic cellulose&#8208;based compounds involving both these groups primarily for biomedical applications, a brief introduction about glycoscience and especially native biologically active glycosaminoglycans with specific biomedical application areas on humans is given, which inspires further development of bioactive compounds from glycans. Then, both polymeric cellulose derivatives and nanocellulose&#8208;based compounds synthesized as versatile biomaterials for a large variety of biomedical applications, such as for wound dressings, controlled release, encapsulation of cells and enzymes, and tissue engineering, are separately described, regarding the diverse routes of synthesis and the established and suggested applications for these highly interesting materials.

         <title>Cellulose&#8208;Based Flexible Functional Materials for Emerging Intelligent Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent research in the field of cellulose&#8208;based materials for flexible electronic applications is reviewed, including flexible sensors, biomimetic electronic skin, portable electrochemical energy storage devices, flexible nanogenerators, flexible organic thin&#8208;film transistors, printed radio&#8208;frequency identification devices, thin&#8208;film photovoltaic devices, and miniaturized bioelectronic devices. An outlook of future perspectives for this field is also presented.








Abstract
There is currently enormous and growing demand for flexible electronics for personalized mobile equipment, human&#8211;machine interface units, wearable medical&#8208;healthcare systems, and bionic intelligent robots. Cellulose is a well&#8208;known natural biopolymer that has multiple advantages including low cost, renewability, easy processability, and biodegradability, as well as appealing mechanical performance, dielectricity, piezoelectricity, and convertibility. Because of its multiple merits, cellulose is frequently used as a substrate, binder, dielectric layer, gel electrolyte, and derived carbon material for flexible electronic devices. Leveraging the advantages of cellulose to design advanced functional materials will have a significant impact on portable intelligent electronics. Herein, the unique molecular structure and nanostructures (nanocrystals, nanofibers, nanosheets, etc.) of cellulose are briefly introduced, the structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships of cellulosic materials summarized, and the processing technologies for fabricating cellulose&#8208;based flexible electronics considered. The focus then turns to the recent advances of cellulose&#8208;based functional materials toward emerging intelligent electronic devices including flexible sensors, optoelectronic devices, field&#8208;effect transistors, nanogenerators, electrochemical energy storage devices, biomimetic electronic skins, and biological detection devices. Finally, an outlook of the potential challenges and future prospects for developing cellulose&#8208;based wearable devices and bioelectronic systems is presented.

         <title>Recent Developments in Cellulose Nanomaterial Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanomaterial (CNM) composites are sustainable and can compete on strength and stiffness with traditional materials. Unfortunately, research has tended to be more basic&#8208;science oriented rather than commercially applicable, so there are few CNM&#8208;enabled products on the market today. Efforts are presented for preparing and forming cellulose nanomaterial nanocomposites in manners practical to commercialization.








Abstract
Cellulose nanomaterials (CNMs) are a class of materials that have recently garnered attention in fields as varied as structural materials, biomaterials, rheology modifiers, construction, paper enhancement, and others. As the principal structural reinforcement of biomass giving wood its mechanical properties, CNM is strong and stiff, but also nontoxic, biodegradable, and sustainable with a very large (Gton yr&#8722;1) source. Unfortunately, due to the relatively young nature of the field and inherent incompatibility of CNM with most man&#8208;made materials in use today, research has tended to be more basic&#8208;science oriented rather than commercially applicable, so there are few CNM&#8208;enabled products on the market today. Herein, efforts are presented for preparing and forming cellulose nanomaterial nanocomposites. The focus is on recent efforts attempting to mitigate common impediments to practical commercialization but is also placed in context with traditional efforts. The work is presented in terms of the progress made, and still to be made, on solving the most pressing challenges&#8212;getting properties that are competitive with currently used materials, removing organic solvent, solving the inherent incompatibility between CNM and polymers of interest, and incorporation into commonly used industrial processing techniques.

         <title>Understanding Plant Biomass via Computational Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical structures and properties of plant biomass (especially wood) and relevant computational modeling are reviewed, which may inspire the bottom&#8208;up design of new bio&#8208;based materials and the manufacturing of nanomaterials from plant biomass. Both modeling and relevant experimental studies of wood cell wall, cellulose, lignin, and their molecular units are summarized. Common hierarchical structures in nature are also compared with wood.








Abstract
Plant biomass, especially wood, has been used for structural materials since ancient times. It is also showing great potential for new structural materials and it is the major feedstock for the emerging biorefineries for building a sustainable society. The plant cell wall is a hierarchical matrix of mainly cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Herein, the structure, properties, and reactions of cellulose, lignin, and wood cell walls, studied using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD), which are the widely used computational modeling approaches, are reviewed. Computational modeling, which has played a crucial role in understanding the structure and properties of plant biomass and its nanomaterials, may serve a leading role on developing new hierarchical materials from biomass in the future.

         <title>Thermal Management by Engineering the Alignment of Nanocellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A summary of how nanocellulose can be used to fabricate bioinspired building materials, including thermally super&#8208;insulating transparent and translucent aerogels and designable photonic reflectors, like the ones found in cuticles of beetles, is presented. These materials promise a boost of the energy efficiency of building envelopes, especially windows, so that no or very little supplemental energy would be needed to provide year&#8208;round occupant comfort.








Abstract
One of the grand current research challenges is to improve the energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings, which cumulatively consume more than 40% of the energy generated globally. In addition to improving the comfort of the inhabitants and mitigating the growing energy consumption problem, new building materials and technologies could provide a safe strategy for geoengineering to mitigate global climate change. Herein, recent progress in developing such advanced materials from nanocellulose, which is often derived from wood or even dirty feedstocks like waste, is reviewed. By using chemical and bacteria&#8208;enabled processing, nanocellulose can be used to fabricate broadband photonic reflectors, thermally super&#8208;insulating aerogels, solar gain regulators, and low&#8208;emissivity coatings, with potential applications in windows, roofs, walls, and other components of buildings envelopes. These material developments draw inspiration from advanced energy management found in nature, such as the nanoporous photonic structures that evolved in cuticles of beetles. Fabrication of such materials takes advantage of mesoscale liquid crystalline self&#8208;assembly, which allows for pre&#8208;designed control of cellulose nanoparticle orientations at the mesoscale. With the potential fully realized, such materials could one day transform the current energy&#8208;lossy buildings into energy plants on Earth and possibly even enable extraterrestrial habitats.

         <title>Functional Materials from Nanocellulose: Utilizing Structure&#8211;Property Relationships in Bottom&#8208;Up Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a natural and renewable building block for bottom&#8208;up fabrication, nanocellulose has gained considerable interest for the assembly of sophisticated materials with advanced functionality. The organization of nanocellulose into aligned, porous, and fibrous materials is highlighted, focusing on the inherent material properties enabling the formation of such structures, along with discussing key advancements and critical challenges within the field.








Abstract
It is inherently challenging to recapitulate the precise hierarchical architectures found throughout nature (such as in wood, antler, bone, and silk) using synthetic bottom&#8208;up fabrication strategies. However, as a renewable and naturally sourced nanoscale building block, nanocellulose&#8212;both cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibrils&#8212;has gained significant research interest within this area. Altogether, the intrinsic shape anisotropy, surface charge/chemistry, and mechanical/rheological properties are some of the critical material properties leading to advanced structure&#8208;based functionality within nanocellulose&#8208;based bottom&#8208;up fabricated materials. Herein, the organization of nanocellulose into biomimetic&#8208;aligned, porous, and fibrous materials through a variety of fabrication techniques is presented. Moreover, sophisticated material structuring arising from both the alignment of nanocellulose and via specific process&#8208;induced methods is covered. In particular, design rules based on the underlying fundamental properties of nanocellulose are established and discussed as related to their influence on material assembly and resulting structure/function. Finally, key advancements and critical challenges within the field are highlighted, paving the way for the fabrication of truly advanced materials from nanocellulose.

         <title>Plant Nanomaterials and Inspiration from Nature: Water Interactions and Hierarchically Structured Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired from nature, wood&#8208;based and man&#8208;made hydrogels are produced taking advantage of the properties and structure of elements present in the cell walls of plants, including (nano)celluloses. They endow new materials with features that include directionality, hierarchy, responsiveness, and function, all of which are associated to the composition and morphology of the building blocks.








Abstract
Recent developments in the area of plant&#8208;based hydrogels are introduced, especially those derived from wood as a widely available, multiscale, and hierarchical source of nanomaterials, as well as other cell wall elements. With water being fundamental in a hydrogel, water interactions, hydration, and swelling, all critically important in designing, processing, and achieving the desired properties of sustainable and functional hydrogels, are highlighted. A plant, by itself, is a form of a hydrogel, at least at given states of development, and for this reason phenomena such as fluid transport, diffusion, capillarity, and ionic effects are examined. These aspects are highly relevant not only to plants, especially lignified tissues, but also to the porous structures produced after removal of water (foams, sponges, cryogels, xerogels, and aerogels). Thus, a useful source of critical and comprehensive information is provided regarding the synthesis of hydrogels from plant materials (and especially wood nanostructures), and about the role of water, not only for processing but for developing hydrogel properties and uses.

         <title>Emerging Bioinspired Artificial Woods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial woods have emerged as a novel kind of wood&#8208;inspired engineering material with almost exactly the same channel microstructures and similar wall components. The performances of artificial woods depend on both the oriented channel and wall designs. The rational combination of other engineering polymers and channel&#8208;making techniques hold promise to develop more useful artificial woods.








Abstract
As an abundant natural resource, wood has gained great attention for thousands of years, spanning from the primitive construction materials to the modern high&#8208;added&#8208;value engineering materials. The unique delicate microstructures and the wonderful properties (e.g., low&#8208;density, high strength and stiffness, good toughness, and environmental sustainability) have made wood a natural source of inspiration that guides researchers to invent various wood&#8208;inspired materials. Herein, as an emerging material system, bioinspired artificial wood, with similar cellular structures and comparable mechanical properties, is discussed in the view of the design concept, fabrication strategy, properties, and possible applications. The present challenges and further research opportunities are also presented for artificial woods to thrive. To achieve the final eco&#8208;friendly artificial wood, more endeavors should be made in biomaterials and biodegradable or recyclable engineering of polymers to gain high mechanical properties and environmental sustainability simultaneously.

         <title>Advanced Nanowood Materials for the Water&#8211;Energy Nexus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review on novel nanowood materials and applications related to the water&#8211;energy nexus is presented. The unique structures and properties are highlighted, and how such features are harnessed by nanomanufacturing to enable sustainable water filtration, adsorption, catalysis, energy and resource recovery, as well as desalination and environmental cleanup, is discussed. Insights are offered on future development to enable a circular water economy.








Abstract
Wood materials are being reinvented to carry superior properties for a variety of new applications. Cutting&#8208;edge nanomanufacturing transforms traditional bulky and low&#8208;value woods into advanced materials that have desired structures, durability, and functions to replace nonrenewable plastics, polymers, and metals. Here, a first prospect report on how novel nanowood materials have been developed and applied in water and associated industries is provided, wherein their unique features and promises are discussed. First, the unique hierarchical structure and associated properties of the material are introduced, and then how such features can be harnessed and modified by either bottom&#8208;up or top&#8208;down manufacturing to enable different functions for water filtration, chemical adsorption and catalysis, energy and resource recovery, as well as energy&#8208;efficient desalination and environmental cleanup are discussed. The study recognizes that this is a nascent but very promising field; therefore, insights are offered to encourage more research and development. Trees harness solar energy and CO2 and provide abundant carbon&#8208;negative materials. Once harvested and utilized, it is believed that advanced wood materials will play a vital role in enabling a circular water economy.

         <title>Why Cellulose&#8208;Based Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress of cellulose, as an appealing natural material that can outperform traditional synthetic materials, for use in energy&#8208;storage devices is described. Cellulose can bring benefits in the fabrication and properties of energy&#8208;storage materials and devices, eventually enabling significant improvements in electrochemical performance, mechanical flexibility, cost competitiveness, and form factors, which are difficult to achieve with conventional power source technologies.








Abstract
Recent findings demonstrate that cellulose, a highly abundant, versatile, sustainable, and inexpensive material, can be used in the preparation of very stable and flexible electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy and power densities by using electrodes with high mass loadings, composed of conducting composites with high surface areas and thin layers of electroactive material, as well as cellulose&#8208;based current collectors and functional separators. Close attention should, however, be paid to the properties of the cellulose (e.g., porosity, pore distribution, pore&#8208;size distribution, and crystallinity). The manufacturing of cellulose&#8208;based electrodes and all&#8208;cellulose devices is also well&#8208;suited for large&#8208;scale production since it can be made using straightforward filtration&#8208;based techniques or paper&#8208;making approaches, as well as utilizing various printing techniques. Herein, the recent development and possibilities associated with the use of cellulose are discussed, regarding the manufacturing of electrochemical energy storage devices comprising electrodes with high energy and power densities and lightweight current collectors and functional separators.

         <dc:description>
The unique physical and chemical properties of wood and its derivatives endow them with great potential to fabricate advanced materials for use in bioengineering, flexible electronics, and clean energy. The unique characteristics of wood&#8208;derived carbon and light&#8208;emitting materials are reviewed, with the aim of deepening understanding and inspiring new ideas in the area of advanced wood&#8208;based materials.








Abstract
Wood is a sustainable and renewable material that naturally has a hierarchical structure. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the three main components of wood. The unique physical and chemical properties of wood and its derivatives endow them with great potential as resources to fabricate advanced materials for use in bioengineering, flexible electronics, and clean energy. Nevertheless, comprehensive information on wood&#8208;derived carbon and light&#8208;emitting materials is scarce, although much excellent progress has been made in this area. Here, the unique characteristics of wood&#8208;derived carbon and light&#8208;emitting materials are summarized, with regard to the fabrication principles, properties, applications, challenges, and future prospects of wood&#8208;derived carbon and light&#8208;emitting materials, with the aim of deepening the understanding and inspiring new ideas in the area of advanced wood&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Emerging Nanocellulose Technologies: Recent Developments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses have unique morphologies, characteristics, and surface nanostructures, and are prepared from abundant and renewable plant biomass resources. Nanocelluloses can be categorized into cellulose nanonetworks, cellulose nanofibrils, and cellulose nanocrystals, depending on their morphologies. Cellulose nanofibrils have significant amounts of charged groups on their surfaces. These surface&#8208;charged groups can be stoichiometrically counterion&#8208;exchanged to diverse metal and alkylammonium ions.








Abstract
Nanocelluloses have unique morphologies, characteristics, and surface nanostructures, and are prepared from abundant and renewable plant biomass resources. Therefore, expansion of the use of CO2&#8208;accumulating nanocelluloses is expected to partly contribute to the establishment of a sustainable society and help overcome current global environmental issues. Nanocelluloses can be categorized into cellulose nanonetworks, cellulose nanofibrils, and cellulose nanocrystals, depending on their morphologies. All of these materials are first obtained as aqueous dispersions. In particular, cellulose nanofibrils have homogeneous &#8776;3 nm widths and average lengths of &gt;500&#160;nm, and significant amounts of charged groups are present on their surfaces. Such charged groups are formed by carboxymethylation, C6&#8208;carboxylation, phosphorylation, phosphite esterification, xanthation, sulfate esterification, and C2/C3 dicarboxylation during the pretreatment of plant cellulose fibers before their conversion into cellulose nanofibrils via mechanical disintegration in water. These surface&#8208;charged groups in nanocelluloses can be stoichiometrically counterion&#8208;exchanged into diverse metal and alkylammonium ions, resulting in surface&#8208;modified nanocelluloses with various new functions including hydrophobic, water&#8208;resistant, catalytic, superdeodorant, and gas&#8208;separation properties. However, many fundamental and application&#8208;related issues facing nanocelluloses must first be overcome to enable their further expansion.

         <title>Thermally Insulating Nanocellulose&#8208;Based Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recently discovered potential of cellulose nanomaterials (CNMs) as raw materials to produce foams and aerogels for thermal insulation applications is described. The fundamental heat transfer contributions in such porous materials are summarized and put into context, through a selection of works highlighting highly efficient CNM&#8208;based isotropic and anisotropic insulation materials.








Abstract
Thermally insulating materials based on renewable nanomaterials such as nanocellulose could reduce the energy consumption and the environmental impact of the building sector. Recent reports of superinsulating cellulose nanomaterial (CNM)&#8208;based aerogels and foams with significantly better heat transport properties than the commercially dominating materials, such as expanded polystyrene, polyurethane foams, and glass wool, have resulted in a rapidly increasing research activity. Herein, the fundamental basis of thermal conductivity of porous materials is described, and the anisotropic heat transfer properties of CNMs and films with aligned CNMs and the processing and structure of novel CNM&#8208;based aerogels and foams with low thermal conductivities are presented and discussed. The extraordinarily low thermal conductivity of anisotropic porous architectures and multicomponent approaches are highlighted and related to the contributions of the Knudsen effect and phonon scattering.

         <title>Wood and the Activity of Dead Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wood is a prototypical biological material, which adapts to mechanical requirements by the structural organization of cellulose fibrils. The cellulose fiber orientation determines the response of wood to environmental changes as an active material, thereby processing information and converting energy. Some examples for the harvesting of wood activity as well as bioinspiration are discussed.








Abstract
Wood is a prototypical biological material, which adapts to mechanical requirements. The microarchitecture of cellulose fibrils determines the mechanical properties of woody materials, as well as their actuation properties, based on absorption and desorption of water. Herein it is argued that cellulose fiber orientation corresponds to an analog code that determines the response of wood to humidity as an active material. Examples for the harvesting of wood activity, as well as bioinspiration, are given.

         <title>Biopolymers Derived from Trees as Sustainable Multifunctional Materials: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A timely overview of the recent development of materials and structures derived from different parts of trees for sustainability is provided. The relationships between the structure, properties, performance, and applications of components from trees are comprehensively reviewed. A concise introduction of the corresponding chemistry and preparation methods of functional elements from the trees is given.








Abstract
The world is currently transitioning from a fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven energy economy to one that is supplied by more renewable and sustainable materials. Trees as the most abundant renewable bioresource have attracted significant attention for advanced materials and manufacturing in this epochal transition. Trees are composed with complex structures and components such as trunk (stem and bark), leaf, flower, seed, and root. Although many excellent reviews have been published regarding advanced applications of wood and wood&#8208;derived biopolymers in different fields, such as energy, electronics, biomedical, and water treatment, no reviews have revisited and systematically discussed functional materials and even devices derived from trees in a full scope yet. Therefore, a timely summary of the recent development of materials and structures derived from different parts of trees for sustainability is prsented here. A concise introduction to the different parts of the trees is given first, which is followed by the corresponding chemistry and preparation of functional materials using various biopolymers from trees. The most promising applications of biopolymer&#8208;based materials are discussed subsequently.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is currently transitioning from a fossil-fuel-driven energy economy to one that is supplied by more renewable and sustainable materials. Trees as the most abundant renewable bioresource have attracted significant attention for advanced materials and manufacturing in this epochal transition. Trees are composed with complex structures and components such as trunk (stem and bark), leaf, flower, seed, and root. Although many excellent reviews have been published regarding advanced applications of wood and wood-derived biopolymers in different fields, such as energy, electronics, biomedical, and water treatment, no reviews have revisited and systematically discussed functional materials and even devices derived from trees in a full scope yet. Therefore, a timely summary of the recent development of materials and structures derived from different parts of trees for sustainability is prsented here. A concise introduction to the different parts of the trees is given first, which is followed by the corresponding chemistry and preparation of functional materials using various biopolymers from trees. The most promising applications of biopolymer-based materials are discussed subsequently. A comprehensive review of the different parts of trees as sustainable functional materials and devices for critical applications is thus provided.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Light Management with Natural Materials: From Whiteness to Transparency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of strategies is used to manage light propagation in plants and animals to produce transparent and white appearances. Inspired by nature, various transparent (low&#8208;scattering) and opaque (high&#8208;scattering) cellulose&#8208;based materials have been developed. The possibility to structure materials at the nanoscale is essential to control light&#8211;matter interaction and enables the fabrication of next&#8208;generation optical materials made of renewable biopolymers.








Abstract
The possibility of structuring material at the nanoscale is essential to control light&#8211;matter interactions and therefore fabricate next&#8208;generation paints and coatings. In this context, nature can serve not only as a source of inspiration for the design of such novel optical structures, but also as a primary source of materials. Here, some of the strategies used in nature to optimize light&#8211;matter interaction are reviewed and some of the recent progress in the production of optical materials made solely of plant&#8208;derived building blocks is highlighted. In nature, nano&#8208; to micrometer&#8208;sized structured materials made from biopolymers are at the origin of most of the light&#8208;transport effects. How natural photonic systems manage light scattering and what can be learned from plants and animals to produce photonic materials from biopolymers are discussed. Tuning the light&#8208;scattering properties via structural variations allows a wide range of appearances to be obtained, from whiteness to transparency, using the same renewable and biodegradable building blocks. Here, various transparent and white cellulose&#8208;based materials produced so far are highlighted.

         <title>Mechanics Design in Cellulose&#8208;Enabled High&#8208;Performance Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;mechanics relationships of cellulose molecular chains give rise to unconventional cellulose&#8208;based functional materials that possess multiple beneficial mechanical properties such as high strength and toughness, in addition to other fundamentally attractive properties such as low&#8208;cost, lightweight, and sustainability.








Abstract
The abundance of cellulose found in natural resources such as wood, and the wide spectrum of structural diversity of cellulose nanomaterials in the form of micro&#8208;nano&#8208;sized particles and fibers, have sparked a tremendous interest to utilize cellulose's intriguing mechanical properties in designing high&#8208;performance functional materials, where cellulose's structure&#8211;mechanics relationships are pivotal. In this progress report, multiscale mechanics understanding of cellulose, including the key role of hydrogen bonding, the dependence of structural interfaces on the spatial hydrogen bond density, the effect of nanofiber size and orientation on the fracture toughness, are discussed along with recent development on enabling experimental design techniques such as structural alteration, manipulation of anisotropy, interface and topology engineering. Progress in these fronts renders cellulose a prospect of being effectuated in an array of emerging sustainable applications and being fabricated into high&#8208;performance structural materials that are both strong and tough.

         <title>Cellulose Nanomaterials in Interfacial Evaporators for Desalination: A &#8220;Natural&#8221; Choice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to their biocompatibility, renewability, and sustainability, cellulose nanomaterials are highly attractive supporting substrate materials in solar evaporators for sustainable desalination. The physiochemical properties of extracted cellulose nanoparticles and natural cellulose are discussed, and recent progress in utilizing cellulose&#8208;based materials such as wood, bacterial nanocellulose, cellulose nanofibrils, air&#8208;laid paper, cellulose paper, and cotton fabric in solar desalination is summarized.








Abstract
Herein, the recent advances in realizing highly efficient cellulose&#8208;based solar evaporators for alleviating the global water crisis are summarized. Fresh water scarcity is one of the most threatening issues for sustainable development. Solar steam generation, which harnesses the abundant sunlight, has been recognized as a sustainable approach to harvest fresh water. In contrast to synthetic polymeric materials that can pose serious negative environmental impacts, cellulose&#8208;based materials, owing to their biocompatibility, renewability, and sustainability, are highly attractive for realizing solar steam generators. The molecular and macromolecular features of cellulose and the physicochemical properties of extracted cellulose nanoparticles (cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF)) and natural cellulose materials (wood and bacterial nanocellulose (BNC)) that make them attractive as supporting substrate materials in solar steam generators are briefly discussed. Recent progress in designing highly efficient cellulose&#8208;based solar evaporators, including utilizing extracted cellulose nanoparticles via bottom&#8208;up assembly CNF, natural cellulose materials with intrinsic hierarchical structure (wood and BNC), and commercial planar cellulose substrates (air&#8208;laid paper, cellulose paper, and cotton fabric) is reviewed. The outstanding challenges that need to be addressed for these materials and devices to be utilized in the real&#8208;world and in overcoming global water crisis are also briefly highlighted.

         <title>Elucidating the Opportunities and Challenges for Nanocellulose Spinning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocellulose presents an opportunity for the development of a new class of man&#8208;made biobased fibers that can replace high&#8208;performance fossil&#8208;based fibers, as well as provide fibers with new advanced functionalities. Promising material concepts are available, but successful scale&#8208;up will need more profound insights into the mechanisms that control nanoscale assembly during processing.








Abstract
Man&#8208;made continuous fibers play an essential role in society today. With the increase in global sustainability challenges, there is a broad spectrum of societal needs where the development of advanced biobased fibers could provide means to address the challenges. Biobased regenerated fibers, produced from dissolved cellulose are widely used today for clothes, upholstery, and linens. With new developments in the area of advanced biobased fibers, it would be possible to compete with high&#8208;performance synthetic fibers such as glass fibers and carbon fibers as well as to provide unique functionalities. One possible development is to fabricate fibers by spinning filaments from nanocellulose, Nature's nanoscale high&#8208;performance building block, which will require detailed insights into nanoscale assembly mechanisms during spinning, as well as knowledge regarding possible functionalization. If successful, this could result in a new class of man&#8208;made biobased fibers.

     alt="Elucidating the Opportunities and Challenges for Nanocellulose Spinning"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocellulose presents an opportunity for the development of a new class of man-made biobased fibers that can replace high-performance fossil-based fibers, as well as provide fibers with new advanced functionalities. Promising material concepts are available, but successful scale-up will need more profound insights into the mechanisms that control nanoscale assembly during processing.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man-made continuous fibers play an essential role in society today. With the increase in global sustainability challenges, there is a broad spectrum of societal needs where the development of advanced biobased fibers could provide means to address the challenges. Biobased regenerated fibers, produced from dissolved cellulose are widely used today for clothes, upholstery, and linens. With new developments in the area of advanced biobased fibers, it would be possible to compete with high-performance synthetic fibers such as glass fibers and carbon fibers as well as to provide unique functionalities. One possible development is to fabricate fibers by spinning filaments from nanocellulose, Nature's nanoscale high-performance building block, which will require detailed insights into nanoscale assembly mechanisms during spinning, as well as knowledge regarding possible functionalization. If successful, this could result in a new class of man-made biobased fibers. This work aims to identify the progress made in the field of spinning of nanocellulose filaments, as well as outline necessary steps for efficient fabrication of such nanocellulose-based filaments with controlled and predictable properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Evolving Highly Active Oxidic Iron(III) Phase from Corrosion of Intermetallic Iron Silicide to Master Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation and Selective Oxygenation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of iron for oxidizing electrocatalytic reactions is limited due to the low conductivity of FeIIIOxHy phases. Using the second most abundant element of the Earth's crust, silicon, intermetallic FeSi is formed, which is demonstrated to drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at high efficiency under ambient and industrially relevant conditions (500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.50&#160;&#177;&#160;0.025&#160;VRHE&#160;and 65&#160;&#176;C), as well as selectively oxygenate 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).








Abstract
In a green energy economy, electrocatalysis is essential for chemical energy conversion and to produce value added chemicals from regenerative resources. To be widely applicable, an electrocatalyst should comprise the Earth's crust's most abundant elements. The most abundant 3d metal, iron, with its multiple accessible redox states has been manifold applied in chemocatalytic processes. However, due to the low conductivity of FeIIIOxHy phases, its applicability for targeted electrocatalytic oxidation reactions such as water oxidation is still limited. Herein, it is shown that iron incorporated in conductive intermetallic iron silicide (FeSi) can be employed to meet this challenge. In contrast to silicon&#8208;poor iron&#8211;silicon alloys, intermetallic FeSi possesses an ordered structure with a peculiar bonding situation including covalent and ionic contributions together with conducting electrons. Using in situ X&#8208;ray absorption and Raman spectroscopy, it could be demonstrated that, under the applied corrosive alkaline conditions, the FeSi partly forms a unique, oxidic iron(III) phase consisting of edge and corner sharing [FeO6] octahedra together with oxidized silicon species. This phase is capable of driving the oxyge evolution reaction (OER) at high efficiency under ambient and industrially relevant conditions (500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.50&#160;&#177;&#160;0.025&#160;VRHE and 65&#160;&#176;C) and to selectively oxygenate 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).

         <title>Engineering of Microcage Carbon Nanotube Architectures with Decoupled Multimodal Porosity and Amplified Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft&#8208;templating of 1D carbon nanostructures provides next&#8208;generation nanocarbon aerogels with unique microcage internal architectures and independently tuneable micro&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and macroporosities. The intricate aerogel microstructures are chemically modified with metal nanoparticles (Cu, Pd, Ru) through a structure&#8208;preserving sublimation and shock&#8208;decomposition functionalization approach. The subsequent nanoparticle&#8208;decorated aerogels exhibit amplified catalytic performance, as well as solvent&#8208;induced shape&#8208;recovery behavior.








Abstract
New approaches for the engineering of the 3D microstructure, pore modality, and chemical functionality of hierarchically porous nanocarbon assemblies are key to develop the next generation of functional aerogel and membrane materials. Here, interfacially driven assembly of carbon nanotubes (CNT) is exploited to fabricate structurally directed aerogels with highly controlled internal architectures, composed of pseudo&#8208;monolayer, CNT microcages. CNT Pickering emulsions enable engineering at fundamentally different length scales, whereby the microporosity, mesoporosity, and macroporosity are decoupled and individually controlled through CNT type, CNT number density, and process energy, respectively. In addition, metal nanocatalysts (Cu, Pd, and Ru) are embedded within the architectures through an elegant sublimation and shock&#8208;decomposition approach; introducing the first approach that enables through&#8208;volume functionalization of intricate, pre&#8208;designed aerogels without microstructural degradation. Catalytic structure&#8211;function relationships are explored in a pharma&#8208;important amidation reaction; providing insights on how the engineered frameworks enhance catalyst activity. A sophisticated array of advanced tomographic, spectroscopic, and microscopic techniques reveal an intricate 3D assembly of CNT building&#8208;blocks and their influence on the functional properties of the enhanced nanocatalysts. These advances set a basis to modulate structure and chemistry of functional aerogel materials independently in a controlled fashion for a variety of applications, including energy conversion and storage, smart electronics, and (electro)catalysis.

         <title>Innervated, Self&#8208;Sensing Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators with Closed Loop Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sensing, innervated liquid crystal elastomers in both fiber and square spiral motifs (shown) are produced by core&#8211;shell 3D printing. The printed core&#8211;shell filaments consist of a liquid metal core surrounded by a liquid crystal elastomer shell. When Joule heated above their nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperature, these self&#8208;sensing architectures exhibit actuation and large work output, which can be regulated via closed loop control.

Abstract
The programmable assembly of innervated LCE actuators (iLCEs) with prescribed contractile actuation, self&#8208;sensing, and closed loop control via core&#8211;shell 3D printing is reported. This extrusion&#8208;based direct ink writing method enables coaxial filamentary features composed of pure LM core surrounded by an LCE shell, whose director is aligned along the print path. Specifically, the thermal response of the iLCE fiber&#8208;type actuators is programmed, measured, and modeled during Joule heating, including quantifying the concomitant changes in fiber length and resistance that arise during simultaneous heating and self&#8208;sensing. Due to their reversible, high&#8208;energy actuation and their resistive feedback, it is also demonstrated that iLCEs can be regulated with closed loop control even when perturbed with large bias loads. Finally, iLCE architectures capable of programmed, self&#8208;sensing 3D shape change with closed loop control are fabricated.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Control of Propagating Spin Waves by Ferroelectric Domain&#8208;Wall Motion in a Multiferroic Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric&#8208;field control of propagating spin waves in an Fe/BaTiO3 multiferroic heterostructure is demonstrated experimentally. The underlying mechanism involves the concurrent motion of strain&#8208;coupled ferroelectric domain walls and magnetic anisotropy boundaries and allows reversible tuning of the spin&#8208;wave amplitude and phase. The results provide a new route toward energy&#8208;efficient reconfigurable magnonics.








Abstract
Magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic heterostructures offers a promising platform for electric&#8208;field control of magnonic devices based on low&#8208;power spin&#8208;wave transport. Here, electric&#8208;field manipulation of the amplitude and phase of propagating spin waves in a ferromagnetic Fe film on top of a ferroelectric BaTiO3 substrate is demonstrated experimentally. Electric&#8208;field effects in this composite material system are mediated by strain coupling between alternating ferroelectric stripe domains with in&#8208;plane and perpendicular polarization and fully correlated magnetic anisotropy domains with differing spin&#8208;wave transport properties. The propagation of spin waves across the strain&#8208;induced magnetic anisotropy domains of the Fe film is directly imaged and it is shown how reversible electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven motion of ferroelectric domain walls and pinned anisotropy boundaries turns the spin&#8208;wave signal on and off. Furthermore, linear electric&#8208;field tuning of the spin&#8208;wave phase by altering the width of strain&#8208;coupled stripe domains is demonstrated. The results provide a new route toward energy&#8208;efficient reconfigurable&#160;magnonics.

         <title>A Harmless&#8211;Harmful Switchable and Uninterrupted Laccase&#8208;Instructed Killer for Activatable Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A harmless&#8211;harmful switchable and uninterrupted laccase (LAC)&#8208;instructed killer (HULK) is designed as a chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent, which is the first CDT agent accelerated by LAC&#8208;instructed superoxide radical (O2&#8722;&#8226;) generation and possesses harmless&#8211;harmful switchable effect because of the photodegradation of O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger Fe&#8208;chlorin e6, showing great potential as a safe and effective CDT agent.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) employs Fenton catalysts to kill cancer cells by converting intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into hydroxyl radicals (OH&#8226;). Although many studies on H2O2 supplementation have been conducted to improve the therapeutic effect of CDT, few studies have focused on the application of superoxide radical (O2&#8722;&#8226;) in CDT, which may result in better efficacy. A major concern about O2&#8722;&#8226;&#8208;mediated CDT is its tendency to induce serious oxidative damage to normal tissues, which may be addressed by using a degradable O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger. Here, a harmless&#8208;harmful switchable and uninterrupted laccase (LAC)&#8208;instructed killer (HULK) is constructed, which is the first CDT agent accelerated by LAC&#8208;instructed O2&#8722;&#8226; generation and possesses a harmless&#8208;harmful switchable effect because of the photodegradation of the O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger iron&#8208;chlorin e6 (FeCe6). LAC&#8208;instructed substrate oxidation effectively catalyzes O2&#8722;&#8226; production with the help of intracellular reduction, thereby promoting the conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+, accelerating the generation of OH&#8226;, and inducing tumor cell apoptosis and necrosis. The introduced O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger FeCe6 is quickly photodegraded during irradiation, while LAC&#8208;instructed O2&#8722;&#8226; generation proceeds as before, resulting in activatable CDT. This work not only provides the first strategy for LAC&#8208;instructed O2&#8722;&#8226; generation but also presents new insight into activatable CDT.

         <title>40.1% Record Low&#8208;Light Solar&#8208;Cell Efficiency by Holistic Trap&#8208;Passivation using Micrometer&#8208;Thick Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The involvement of guanidinium in perovskite bulk film and CH3O&#8208;PEABr passivation on the perovskite surface synergistically suppresses the trap states. The charge carrier lifetimes of perovskite films increase by tenfold and fivefold to 981 ns and 8.02 &#181;s at the crystal surface and in its bulk, respectively. The decreased nonradiative recombination loss translates to a record efficiency of 40.1%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells exhibit not only high efficiency under full AM1.5 sunlight, but also have great potential for applications in low&#8208;light environments, such as indoors, cloudy conditions, early morning, late evening, etc. Unfortunately, their performance still suffers from severe trap&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination, particularly under low&#8208;light conditions. Here, a holistic passivation strategy is developed to reduce traps both on the surface and in the bulk of micrometer&#8208;thick perovskite film, leading to a record efficiency of 40.1% under 301.6 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 warm light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) light for low&#8208;light solar&#8208;cell applications. The involvement of guanidinium into the perovskite bulk film and 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)ethylamine hydrobromide (CH3O&#8208;PEABr) passivation on the perovskite surface synergistically suppresses the trap states. The charge carrier lifetimes of the perovskite film increase by tenfold and fivefold to 981&#160;ns and 8.02 &#181;s at the crystal surface and in its bulk, respectively. The decreased nonradiative recombination loss translates to a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.00&#160;V, a high short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) of 152.10 &#181;A cm&#8722;2, and a fill factor (FF) of 79.52%. Note that this performance also stands as the highest among all photovoltaics measured under indoor light illumination. This work of trap passivation for micrometer&#8208;thick perovskite film paves a way for high&#8208;performance, self&#8208;powered IoT devices.

         <title>Bubble Forming Films for Spatial Selective Cell Killing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric films embedding iron oxide nanoparticles as photosensitizers are designed. Irradiation of the films with pulsed&#8208;laser light generates water vapor bubbles at their surface. Cells located close to the films can be killed due to mechanical forces which arise when the bubbles collapse. Local irradiation of bubble&#8208;films allows for spatial and selective single cell killing at the surface of the eye.








Abstract
Photodynamic and photothermal cell killing at the surface of tissues finds applications in medicine. However, a lack of control over heat dissipation following a treatment with light might damage surrounding tissues. A new strategy to kill cells at the surface of tissues is reported. Polymeric films are designed in which iron oxide nanoparticles are embedded as photosensitizers. Irradiation of the films with pulsed laser light generates water vapor bubbles at the surface of the films. It is found that &#8220;bubble&#8208;films&#8221; can kill cells in close proximity to the films due to mechanical forces which arise when the bubbles collapse. Local irradiation of bubble&#8208;films allows for spatial selective single cell killing. As nanosurgery becomes attractive in ophthalmology to remove superficial tumors, bubble&#8208;films are applied on the cornea and it is found that irradiation of the bubble&#8208;films allows spatial and selective killing of corneal cells. As i) the photosensitizer is embedded in the films, which reduces its uptake by cells and spreading into tissues and ii) the bubble&#8208;films can be removed from the tissue after laser treatment, while iii) a low laser fluence is sufficient to generate vapor bubbles, it is foreseen that bubble&#8208;films might become promising for safe resection of superficial tumors.

         <title>Repurposing Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) as a Conductivity&#8208;Reducing Additive for Polyethylene&#8208;Based High&#8208;Voltage Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugated polymer poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is used as a conductivity&#8208;reducing additive for low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE). An ultralow amount of only 0.0005 wt% of P3HT decreases the electrical conductivity of LDPE threefold, which may facilitate the design of better insulation materials for high&#8208;voltage direct&#8208;current power cables.








Abstract
Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is found to be a highly effective conductivity&#8208;reducing additive for low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE), which introduces a new application area to the field of conjugated polymers. Additives that reduce the direct&#8208;current (DC) electrical conductivity of an insulation material at high electric fields have gained a lot of research interest because they may facilitate the design of more efficient high&#8208;voltage direct&#8208;current power cables. An ultralow concentration of regio&#8208;regular P3HT of 0.0005 wt% is found to reduce the DC conductivity of LDPE threefold, which translates into the highest efficiency reported for any conductivity&#8208;reducing additive to date. The here&#8208;established approach, i.e., the use of a conjugated polymer as a mere additive, may boost demand in absolute terms beyond the quantities needed for thin&#8208;film electronics, which would turn organic semiconductors from a niche product into commodity chemicals.

The here-established approach, i.e., the use of a conjugated polymer as a mere additive, may boost demand in absolute terms beyond the quantities needed for thin-film electronics, which would turn organic semiconductors from a niche product into commodity chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Hybrid Dielectric for Capacitive and Triboelectric Tactile Sensors with High Sensitivity and Ultrawide Linearity Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;inspired hybrid dielectric with gradient compressibility and dielectric property is presented based on a combined low&#8208;permittivity (low&#8208;k) micro&#8208;cilia array and high&#8208;permittivity (high&#8208;k) rough surface and micro&#8208;dome array. The derived linear elastic modulus and effective dielectric constant enable an ultrawide linear sensing range (0&#8211;1000&#160;kPa) and enhanced sensitivity for capacitive/triboelectric tactile sensors.








Abstract
The trade&#8208;off between sensitivity and linearity is critical for preserving the high pressure&#8208;resolution over a broad range and simplifying the signal processing/conversion of flexible tactile sensors. Conventional dielectrics suffer from the difficulty of quantitatively controlling the interacted mechanical and dielectric properties, thus causing the restricted sensitivity and linearity of capacitive sensors. Herein, inspired by human skin, a novel hybrid dielectric composed of a low&#8208;permittivity (low&#8208;k) micro&#8208;cilia array, a high&#8208;permittivity (high&#8208;k) rough surface, and micro&#8208;dome array is developed. The pressure&#8208;induced series&#8208;parallel conversion between the low&#8208;k and high&#8208;k components of the hybrid dielectric enables the linear effective dielectric constant and controllable initial/resultant capacitance. The gradient compressibility of the hybrid dielectric enables the linear behavior of elastic modulus with pressures, which derives the capacitance variation determined by the effective dielectric constant. Therefore, an ultrawide linearity range up to 1000&#160;kPa and a high sensitivity of 0.314 kPa&#8211;1 are simultaneously achieved by the optimized hybrid dielectric. The design is also applicable for triboelectric tactile sensors, which realizes the similar linear behavior of output voltage and enhanced sensitivity. With the high pressure&#8208;resolution across a broad range, potential applications such as healthcare monitoring in diverse scenarios and control command conversion via a single sensor are demonstrated.

         <title>Active Control of Nanodielectric&#8208;Induced THz Quasi&#8208;BIC in Flexible Metasurfaces: A Platform for Modulation and Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy for introducing and engineering narrow and active resonances in metamaterials is demonstrated. A nanoscale&#8208;thick semiconducting strip breaks the structure's symmetry, providing access to a quasi&#8208;bound state in the continuum (quasi&#8208;BIC) that can be modulated with light. Inverse design of such resonances and their potential for ultrafast terahertz switchable filters and sensors are demonstrated.








Abstract
A bound state in the continuum (BIC) is a nonradiating state of light embedded in the continuum of propagating modes providing drastic enhancement of the electromagnetic field and its localization at micro&#8211;nanoscale. However, access to such modes in the far&#8208;field requires symmetry breaking. Here, it is demonstrated that a nanometric dielectric or semiconductor layer, 1000&#160;times thinner than the resonant wavelength (&#955;/1000), induces a dynamically controllable quasi&#8208;bound state in the continuum (QBIC) with ultrahigh quality factor in a symmetric metallic metasurface at terahertz frequencies. Photoexcitation of nanostrips of germanium activates ultrafast switching of a QBIC resonance with 200% transmission intensity modulation and complete recovery within 7 ps on a low&#8208;loss flexible substrate. The nanostrips also form microchannels that provide an opportunity for BIC&#8208;based refractive index sensing. An optimization model is presented for (switchable) QBIC resonances of metamaterial arrays of planar symmetric resonators modified with any (active) dielectric for inverse metamaterial design that can serve as an enabling platform for active micro&#8211;nanophotonic devices.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electroreduction via the Synergistic Effect of Tuning Cationic Clusters and Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy is developed to improve the CO2RR intrinsic activity and selectivity via introducing Ti into the cluster and an external light field. The initial electron transfer to form *COO&#8722; can be facilitated thanks to the more exposed active sites and adjusted electron transfer pathway. This strategy provides a guidance to fabricate highly active and stable catalysts for CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Introducing an external light field can increase the intrinsic activity and energy efficiency for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Herein, a synergistic strategy that introduces photosensitive components and visible light into a stable system is reported to improve the performance for CO2 reduction. The catalytic kinetics studies indicate that the synergistic effect of implantation of cationic Ti and additional light driving is the primary responsibility for accelerating the first electron transfer to form a *COO&#8722; intermediate. This leads to a satisfactory CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion for Zr/Ti&#8208;NB&#8208;Co in terms of high selectivity (Faradaic efficiency of 93.6% at &#8722;0.7&#160;V), remarkable catalytic activity (production rate up to 546&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V), excellent long&#8208;term stability (without performance decay over 11 h), and large turnover frequency of 1028 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V under visible light. These results imply that the photodriven Ti&#8208;based porphyrin catalyst not only can deliver more electrons, but also can act as a photoswitch to adjust the electron transfer pathway.

         <title>Organic Solar Cells with 18% Efficiency Enabled by an Alloy Acceptor: A Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; strategy is applied to form an acceptor alloy for fine&#8208;tuning the donor/acceptor energy alignment and blend morphology. Enhanced hole transfer and suppressed charge recombination in the alloy acceptor consisting of AQx&#8208;3 and Y6 enable a power conversion efficiency of over 18%, which is the highest documented for ternary organic solar cells utilizing two nonfullerene acceptors.








Abstract
The trade&#8208;off between the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) has become the core of current organic photovoltaic research, and realizing the minimum energy offsets that can guarantee effective charge generation is strongly desired for high&#8208;performance systems. Herein, a high&#8208;performance ternary solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of over 18% using a large&#8208;bandgap polymer donor, PM6, and a small&#8208;bandgap alloy acceptor containing two structurally similar nonfullerene acceptors (Y6 and AQx&#8208;3) is reported. This system can take full advantage of solar irradiation and forms a favorable morphology. By varying the ratio of the two acceptors, delicate regulation of the energy levels of the alloy acceptor is achieved, thereby affecting the charge dynamics in the devices. The optimal ternary device exhibits more efficient hole transfer and exciton separation than the PM6:AQx&#8208;3&#8208;based system and reduced energy loss compared with the PM6:Y6&#8208;based system, contributing to better performance. Such a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; alloy strategy, which synergizes two highly compatible acceptors, provides a promising path for boosting the photovoltaic performance of devices.

         <title>Assembly of Close&#8208;Packed Ferroelectric Polymer Nanowires via Interface&#8208;Epitaxy with ReS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable approach is developed to achieve ferroelectric polymer P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) thin films composed of close&#8208;packed crystalline nanowires with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar axis via interface&#8208;epitaxy with 1T&#8242;&#8208;ReS2, which leads to over six orders of magnitude higher ferroelectric field&#8208;effect modulation in ReS2 transistors and coercive voltages as low as 0.1&#160;V, making them viable for large&#8208;scale, low&#8208;power, high&#8208;performance device applications.








Abstract
The flexible, transparent, and low&#8208;weight nature of ferroelectric polymers makes them promising for wearable electronic and optical applications. To reach the full potential of the polarization&#8208;enabled device functionalities, large&#8208;scale fabrication of polymer thin films with well&#8208;controlled polar directions is called for, which remains a central challenge. The widely exploited Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett, spin&#8208;coating, and electrospinning methods only yield polymorphous or polycrystalline films, where the net polarization is compromised. Here, an easily scalable approach is reported to achieve poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) thin films composed of close&#8208;packed crystalline nanowires via interface&#8208;epitaxy with 1T&#8242;&#8208;ReS2. Upon controlled thermal treatment, uniform P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) films restructure into about 10 and 35 nm&#8208;wide (010)&#8208;oriented nanowires that are crystallographically aligned with the underlying ReS2, as revealed by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. Piezoresponse force microscopy studies confirm the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar axis of the nanowire films and reveal coercive voltages as low as 0.1 V. Reversing the polarization can induce a conductance switching ratio of &gt;108 in bilayer ReS2, over six orders of magnitude higher than that achieved by an untreated polymer gate. This study points to a cost&#8208;effective route to large&#8208;scale processing of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric polymer thin films for flexible energy&#8208;efficient nanoelectronics.

         <title>Interfacial Trap&#8208;Assisted Triplet Generation in Lead Halide Perovskite Sensitized Solid&#8208;State Upconversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of interfacial properties on charge&#8208;initiated triplet sensitization in perovskite&#8208;sensitized solid&#8208;state upconversion devices is investigated. Trap&#8208;assisted triplet sensitization is demonstrated via modification of interfacial trap densities of the devices through surface treatment while monitoring the upconversion performance. Devices with more interfacial traps show brighter upconversion, highlighting the importance of interfacial control in perovskite&#8208;sensitized upconversion devices.








Abstract
Photon upconversion via triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) has promise for overcoming the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit for single&#8208;junction solar cells by allowing the utilization of sub&#8208;bandgap photons. Recently, bulk perovskites have been employed as sensitizers in solid&#8208;state upconversion devices to circumvent poor exciton diffusion in previous nanocrystal (NC)&#8208;sensitized devices. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the underlying photophysics of perovskite&#8208;sensitized triplet generation is still lacking due to the difficulty of precisely controlling interfacial properties of fully solution&#8208;processed devices. In this study, interfacial properties of upconversion devices are adjusted by a mild surface solvent treatment, specifically altering perovskite surface properties without perturbing the bulk perovskite. Thermal evaporation of the annihilator precludes further solvent contamination. Counterintuitively, devices with more interfacial traps show brighter upconversion. Approximately an order of magnitude difference in upconversion brightness is observed across different interfacial solvent treatments. Sequential charge transfer and interfacial trap&#8208;assisted triplet sensitization are demonstrated by comparing upconversion performance, transient photoluminescence dynamics, and magnetic field dependence of the devices. Incomplete triplet conversion from transferred charges and consequent triplet&#8208;charge annihilation (TCA) are also observed. The observations highlight the importance of interfacial control and provide guidance for further design and optimization of upconversion devices using perovskites or other semiconductors as sensitizers.

         <title>Traceable Nano&#8208;Biohybrid Complexes by One&#8208;Step Synthesis as CRISPR&#8208;Chem Vectors for Neurodegenerative Diseases Synergistic Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traceable nano&#8208;biohybrid complexes are established by one&#8208;step synthesis to serve as CRISPR&#8208;chem drug vectors (CF&#8208;TBIO). The CRISPR/Cas9 tool and the chemical drug are employed to inhibit and eliminate abnormal protein aggregations related to neurodegenerative diseases. CF&#8208;TBIO facilitates accumulation of gene&#8208;chem drugs in brain lesions, reduces the burden of protein aggregations, and provides accurate imaging signals, having great potential for synergistic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.








Abstract
Abnormal protein aggregations are essential pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. Eliminating while inhibiting the regeneration of these protein aggregates is considered an effective treatment strategy. Herein, the CRISPR/Cas9 gene&#8208;editing tool is employed to inhibit the regeneration of disease&#8208;related proteins, while chemical drugs are applied to eliminate the proteins that are produced. To efficiently deliver CRISPR&#8208;chem drugs into brain lesions, traceable nano&#8208;biohybrid complexes (F&#8208;TBIO) are constructed by one&#8208;step synthesis and CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids (CF&#8208;TBIO) are loaded in a controllable manner. CF&#8208;TBIO can knock out the BACE1 gene and reduce the burden of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, and thereby significantly improve the cognitive abilities of 2xTg&#8208;AD mice. In particular, by prolonging the dosing interval, the pathological damage and behavioral abilities of 2xTg&#8208;AD mice are still significantly improved. During the therapeutic process, CF&#8208;TBIO with a high relaxation rate provides accurate imaging signals in the complex brain physiological environment. The finding shows that CF&#8208;TBIO has great potential to serve as a CRISPR&#8208;chem drug&#8208;delivery platform for neurodegenerative diseases therapy.

         <title>Double&#8208;Gate MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors with Full&#8208;Range Tunable Threshold Voltage for Multifunctional Logic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;gate MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistor is designed for potential applications in multifunctional reconfigurable logic circuits. Featuring the feasible tuning of threshold voltage and optimizing of subthreshold swing of the transistors, the system can both function well as full logic swing binary logic with high noise margin and be dynamically reconfigured between binary and ternary logic.








Abstract
Multifunctional reconfigurable devices, with higher information capacity, smaller size, and more functions, are urgently needed and draw most attention in frontiers in information technology. 2D semiconductors, ascribing to ultrathin body and easy electrostatic control, show great potential in developing reconfigurable functional units. This work proposes a novel double&#8208;gate field&#8208;effect transistor architecture with equal top and bottom gate (TG and BG) and realizes flexible optimization of the subthreshold swing (SS) and threshold voltage (VTH). While the TG and BG are used simultaneously, as a single gate to drive the transistor, ultralow average SS value of 65.5 mV dec&#8722;1 can be obtained in a large current range over 104, enabling the application in high gain inverter. While one gate is used to initialize the channel doping, full logic swing inverter circuit with high noise margin (over 90%) is demonstrated. Such device prototype is further extended for designing reconfigurable logic applications and can be dynamically switched and well maintained between binary and ternary logics. This study provides important concept and device prototype for future multifunctional logic applications.

The elastomer has unprecedented crack tolerance with fracture energy of 215.2&#160;kJ m&#8722;2 that even exceeds that of metals and alloys. The elastomer exhibits superhigh elastic restorability allowing dimensional recovery from elongation over 12 times.








Abstract
Spider silk is one of the most robust natural materials, which has extremely high strength in combination with great toughness and good elasticity. Inspired by spider silk but beyond it, a healable and recyclable supramolecular elastomer, possessing superhigh true stress at break (1.21&#160;GPa) and ultrahigh toughness (390.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), which are, respectively, comparable to and &#8776;2.4 times higher than those of typical spider silk, is developed. The elastomer has the highest tensile strength (ultimate engineering stress, 75.6&#160;MPa) ever recorded for polymeric elastomers, rendering it the strongest and toughest healable elastomer thus far. The hyper&#8208;robust elastomer exhibits superb crack tolerance with unprecedentedly high fracture energy (215.2&#160;kJ m&#8722;2) that even exceeds that of metals and alloys, and superhigh elastic restorability allowing dimensional recovery from elongation over 12 times. These extraordinary mechanical performances mainly originate from the meticulously engineered hydrogen&#8208;bonding segments, consisting of multiple acylsemicarbazide and urethane moieties linked with flexible alicyclic hexatomic spacers. Such hydrogen&#8208;bonding segments, incorporated between extensible polymer chains, aggregate to form geometrically confined hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays resembling those in spider silk. The hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays act as firm but reversible crosslinks and sacrificial bonds for enormous energy dissipation, conferring exceptional mechanical robustness, healability, and recyclability on the elastomer.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered MXene/GaN van der Waals Heterojunction Ultraviolet Photodiodes with Superhigh Efficiency and Stable Current Outputs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MXene/GaN self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodiode with superhigh peak external quantum efficiency (over 99%) is reported. It is found that two synergistic effects, the robust Schottky&#8208;junction&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field and the photoexcited hot carriers, contribute to the high&#8208;performance photodiode. The MXene/GaN van der Waals heterojunction can be easily fabricated into ultraviolet photodiode arrays with uniform and stable photocurrent outputs.








Abstract
A self&#8208;powered, high&#8208;performance Ti3C2Tx MXene/GaN van der Waals heterojunction (vdWH)&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) photodiode is reported. Such integration creates a Schottky junction depth that is larger than the UV absorption depth to sufficiently separate the photoinduced electron/hole pairs, boosting the peak internal quantum efficiency over the unity and the external quantum efficiency over 99% under weak UV light without bias. The proposed Ti3C2Tx/GaN vdWH UV photodiode demonstrates pronounced photoelectric performances working in self&#8208;powered mode, including a large responsivity (284 mA W&#8722;1), a high specific detectivity (7.06 &#215; 1013 Jones), and fast response speed (rise/decay time of 7.55 &#181;s/1.67 ms). Furthermore, the remarkable photovoltaic behavior leads to an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.33% under 355 nm UV light illumination. Additionally, this work presents an easy&#8208;processing spray&#8208;deposition route for the fabrication of large&#8208;area UV photodiode arrays that exhibit highly uniform cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell performance. The MXene/GaN photodiode arrays with high&#8208;efficiency and self&#8208;powered ability show high potential for many applications, such as energy&#8208;saving communication, imaging, and sensing networks.

         <title>HCl&#8208;Based Hydrothermal Etching Strategy toward Fluoride&#8208;Free MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of etching various MAX materials in HCl solution influenced by temperature and pressure is simulated. Fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx MXenes are obtained with high quality and efficiency via a controllable HCl&#8208;hydrothermal etching method. Mo2CTx exhibits an excellent rate performance in supercapacitors owing to the unique surface terminations that significantly change the energy&#8208;storage mechanism compared with F&#8208;terminated MXenes.








Abstract
Due to their ultrathin layered structure and rich elemental variety, MXenes are emerging as a promising electrode candidate in energy generation and storage. MXenes are generally synthesized via hazardous fluoride&#8208;containing reagents from robust MAX materials, unfortunately resulting in plenty of inert fluoride functional groups on the surface that noticeably decline their performance. Density functional theory calculations are used to show the etching feasibility of hydrochloric acid (HCl) on various MAX phases. Based on this theoretical guidance, fluoride&#8208;free Mo2C MXenes with high efficiency about 98% are experimentally demonstrated. The Mo2C electrodes produced by this process exhibit high electrochemical performance in supercapacitors and sodium&#8208;ion batteries owing to the chosen surface functional groups created via the HCl etch process. This strategy enables the development of fluoride&#8208;free MXenes and opens a new window to explore their potential in energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Mechanically Robust and UV&#8208;Curable Shape&#8208;Memory Polymers for Digital Light Processing Based 4D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically robust and UV&#8208;curable shape&#8208;memory polymer (SMP) system can be stretched by up to 1240% of its original length and is compatible with Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based high&#8208;resolution 3D printing technology (up to 2&#160;&#181;m). The high deformability and fatigue resistance (more than 10&#160;000 cycles loading&#8211;unloading) make the SMP an ideal 4D printing material for engineering applications.








Abstract
4D printing is an emerging fabrication technology that enables 3D printed structures to change configuration over &#8220;time&#8221; in response to an environmental stimulus. Compared with other soft active materials used for 4D printing, shape&#8208;memory polymers (SMPs) have higher stiffness, and are compatible with various 3D printing technologies. Among them, ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;curable SMPs are compatible with Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based 3D printing to fabricate SMP&#8208;based structures with complex geometry and high&#8208;resolution. However, UV&#8208;curable SMPs have limitations in terms of mechanical performance, which significantly constrains their application ranges. Here, a mechanically robust and UV&#8208;curable SMP system is reported, which is highly deformable, fatigue resistant, and compatible with DLP&#8208;based 3D printing, to fabricate high&#8208;resolution (up to 2&#160;&#181;m), highly complex 3D structures that exhibit large shape change (up to 1240%) upon heating. More importantly, the developed SMP system exhibits excellent fatigue resistance and can be repeatedly loaded more than 10&#160;000 times. The development of the mechanically robust and UV&#8208;curable SMPs significantly improves the mechanical performance of the SMP&#8208;based 4D printing structures, which allows them to be applied to engineering applications such as aerospace, smart furniture, and soft robots.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Integration of&#160;Highly Conductive PdTe2&#160;with Low&#8208;Dimensional Semiconductors for p&#8208;Type Transistors with Low Contact Barriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The patterned synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D PdTe2 is demonstrated. The as&#8208;grown PdTe2 exhibits high electrical and thermal conductivities, showing potential as an ideal contact material in nanoelectronics. Based on the nondestructive synthesis of PdTe2 patterns directly on various low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors, high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with reduced contact barriers are chemically constructed.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors provide promising ultrathin channels for constructing more&#8208;than&#8208;Moore devices. However, the prominent contact barriers at the semiconductor&#8211;metal electrodes interfaces greatly limit the performance of the obtained devices. Here, a chemical approach is developed for the construction of p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with low contact barriers by achieving the simultaneous synthesis and integration of 2D PdTe2 with various low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors. The 2D PdTe2 synthesized through a quasi&#8208;liquid process exhibits high electrical conductivity (&#8776;4.3 &#215; 106 S m&#8722;1) and thermal conductivity (&#8776;130 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), superior to other transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and even higher than some metals. In addition, PdTe2 electrodes with desired geometry can be synthesized directly on 2D MoTe2 and other semiconductors to form high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type FETs without any further treatment. The chemically derived atomically ordered PdTe2&#8211;MoTe2 interface results in significantly reduced contact barrier (65 vs 240 meV) and thus increases the performance of the obtained devices. This work demonstrates the great potential of 2D PdTe2 as contact materials and also opens up a new avenue for the future device fabrication through the chemical construction and integration of 2D components.

&lt;p&gt;The patterned synthesis of high-quality 2D PdTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is demonstrated. The as-grown PdTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits high electrical and thermal conductivities, showing potential as an ideal contact material in nanoelectronics. Based on the nondestructive synthesis of PdTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; patterns directly on various low-dimensional semiconductors, high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) with reduced contact barriers are chemically constructed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-dimensional semiconductors provide promising ultrathin channels for constructing more-than-Moore devices. However, the prominent contact barriers at the semiconductor&#8211;metal electrodes interfaces greatly limit the performance of the obtained devices. Here, a chemical approach is developed for the construction of p-type field-effect transistors (FETs) with low contact barriers by achieving the simultaneous synthesis and integration of 2D PdTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with various low-dimensional semiconductors.

The few&#8208;atoms&#8208;wide and amorphous native defects in multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) synthesized by chemical vapor deposition can drive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane random telegraph noise current signals that are more stable than those traditionally observed in transition metal oxides. The reason is that these defects are confined and completely surrounded by 2D layered and crystalline h&#8208;BN. This allows fabrication of high&#8208;performance true random number generators for advanced data encryption.








Abstract
Advanced data encryption requires the use of true random number generators (TRNGs) to produce unpredictable sequences of bits. TRNG circuits with high degree of randomness and low power consumption may be fabricated by using the random telegraph noise (RTN) current signals produced by polarized metal/insulator/metal (MIM) devices as entropy source. However, the RTN signals produced by MIM devices made of traditional insulators, i.e., transition metal oxides like HfO2 and Al2O3, are not stable enough due to the formation and lateral expansion of defect clusters, resulting in undesired current fluctuations and the disappearance of the RTN effect. Here, the fabrication of highly stable TRNG circuits with low power consumption, high degree of randomness (even for a long string of 224&#160;&#8722; 1 bits), and high throughput of 1 Mbit s&#8722;1 by using MIM devices made of multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is shown. Their application is also demonstrated to produce one&#8208;time passwords, which is ideal for the internet&#8208;of&#8208;everything. The superior stability of the h&#8208;BN&#8208;based TRNG is related to the presence of few&#8208;atoms&#8208;wide defects embedded within the layered and crystalline structure of the h&#8208;BN stack, which produces a confinement effect that avoids their lateral expansion and results in stable operation.

In article number 2008379, Ranhua Xiong, Chaobo Huang, Stefaan C. De Smedt, F&#233;lix Sauvage, and co&#8208;workers introduce a laser&#8208;responsive polymeric film for spatial and selective cell killing. Iron oxide clusters embedded in the polymeric film can absorb laser energy and generate vapor bubbles. Single&#8208;cell killing can be achieved at the surface of the eye by the mechanical forces that arise upon the collapse of the bubbles. These bubble forming films have applications as adjuvants after cancer surgery and are promising for safe resection of superficial tumors.

In article 2100185, Mario Lanza and co&#8208;workers use 2D multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) to fabricate devices that exhibit stable random telegraph noise current signals, and employ them in true random number generator circuits for advanced data encryption. The currents are very stable because they are confined across the few&#8208;atoms&#8208;wide defects embedded within the crystalline and highly stable h&#8208;BN structure, which avoids their lateral propagation.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New synthesis strategies of fluoride&#8208;free MXenes beyond Ti3C2Tx are imperative to extend 2D MXenes. In article number 2101015, Pulickel M. Ajayan, Li Song, and co&#8208;workers simulate the feasibility of etching various MAX materials in HCl solution influenced by temperature and pressure. Fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx MXene is then obtained with high quality and efficiency via a controllable HCl hydrothermal etching method, which exhibits a modulated energy&#8208;storage mechanism.

         <title>Harnessing Innate Immunity Using Biomaterials for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterial&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy has recently drawn significant attention due to the enhanced therapeutic efficacy without adverse effects. A comprehensive overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomaterials reinforcing innate immunity in diverse manners is provided. The future perspective of harnessing biomaterials for enhanced cancer immunotherapy is also discussed.








Abstract
The discovery of immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the field of immuno&#8208;oncology and established the foundation for developing various new therapies that can surpass conventional cancer treatments. Most recent immunotherapeutic strategies have focused on adaptive immune responses by targeting T cell&#8208;activating pathways, genetic engineering of T cells with chimeric antigen receptors, or bispecific antibodies. Despite the unprecedented clinical success, these T cell&#8208;based treatments have only benefited a small proportion of patients. Thus, the need for the next generation of cancer immunotherapy is driven by identifying novel therapeutic molecules or new immunoengineered cells. To maximize the therapeutic potency via innate immunogenicity, the convergence of innate immunity&#8208;based therapy and biomaterials is required to yield an efficient index in clinical trials. This review highlights how biomaterials can efficiently reprogram and recruit innate immune cells in tumors and ultimately initiate activation of T cell immunity against advanced cancers. Moreover, the design and specific biomaterials that improve innate immune cells&#8217; targeting ability to selectively activate immunogenicity with minimal adverse effects are discussed.

         <title>2D III&#8208;Nitride Materials: Properties, Growth, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphene&#8208;like 2D III&#8208;nitride semiconductor materials have unique physical properties such as high stability, wide and tunable bandgap, and magnetism, etc. Those advantages prove them to be useful in optoelectronic, electronic, and spin&#8208;based devices and so on. The pro perties, growth methods, and applications of graphene&#8208;like 2D III&#8208;nitride materials are introduced and reviewed.








Abstract
2D III&#8208;nitride materials have been receiving considerable attention recently due to their excellent physicochemical properties, such as high stability, wide and tunable bandgap, and magnetism. Therefore, 2D III&#8208;nitride materials can be applied in various fields, such as electronic and photoelectric devices, spin&#8208;based devices, and gas detectors. Although the developments of 2D h&#8208;BN materials have been successful, the fabrication of other 2D III&#8208;nitride materials, such as 2D h&#8208;AlN, h&#8208;GaN, and h&#8208;InN, are still far from satisfactory, which limits the practical applications of these materials. In this review, recent advances in the properties, growth methods, and potential applications of 2D III&#8208;nitride materials are summarized. The properties of the 2D III&#8208;nitride materials are mainly obtained by first&#8208;principles calculations because of the difficulties in the growth and characterizations of these materials. The discussion on the growth of 2D III&#8208;nitride materials is focused on 2D h&#8208;BN and h&#8208;AlN, as the developments of 2D h&#8208;GaN and h&#8208;InN are yet to be realized. Therefore, applications have been realized mostly based on the 2D h&#8208;BN materials; however, many potential applications are cited for the entire range of 2D III&#8208;nitride materials. Finally, future research directions and prospects in this field are also discussed.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Derived Nanostructures as Multifaceted Electrodes in Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in designing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived nanostructures for multifaceted electrodes in metal&#8211;sulfur batteries (MSBs) are presented. Particularly, the inherent charge transfer, polysulfides immobilization and conversion, and morphology&#8211;property correlations for MSB applications are systematically discussed. The future tendencies regarding the construction of MOF&#8208;derived nanostructures are also summarized, which will provide experimental/theoretical guidance in developing fast&#8208;kinetic and robust MSBs.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;sulfur batteries (MSBs) are considered up&#8208;and&#8208;coming future&#8208;generation energy storage systems because of their prominent theoretical energy density. However, the practical applications of MSBs are still hampered by several critical challenges, i.e., the shuttle effects, sluggish redox kinetics, and low conductivity of sulfur species. Recently, benefiting from the high surface area, regulated networks, molecular/atomic&#8208;level reactive sites, the metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;derived nanostructures have emerged as efficient and durable multifaceted electrodes in MSBs. Herein, a timely review is presented on recent advancements in designing MOF&#8208;derived electrodes, including fabricating strategies, composition management, topography control, and electrochemical performance assessment. Particularly, the inherent charge transfer, intrinsic polysulfide immobilization, and catalytic conversion on designing and engineering of MOF nanostructures for efficient MSBs are systematically discussed. In the end, the essence of how MOFs&#8217; nanostructures influence their electrochemical properties in MSBs and conclude the future tendencies regarding the construction of MOF&#8208;derived electrodes in MSBs is exposed.

&lt;p&gt;Recent advancements in designing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)-derived nanostructures for multifaceted electrodes in metal&#8211;sulfur batteries (MSBs) are presented. Particularly, the inherent charge transfer, polysulfides immobilization and conversion, and morphology&#8211;property correlations for MSB applications are systematically discussed. The future tendencies regarding the construction of MOF-derived nanostructures are also summarized, which will provide experimental/theoretical guidance in developing fast-kinetic and robust MSBs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-sulfur batteries (MSBs) are considered up-and-coming future-generation energy storage systems because of their prominent theoretical energy density. However, the practical applications of MSBs are still hampered by several critical challenges, i.e., the shuttle effects, sluggish redox kinetics, and low conductivity of sulfur species. Recently, benefiting from the high surface area, regulated networks, molecular/atomic-level reactive sites, the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived nanostructures have emerged as efficient and durable multifaceted electrodes in MSBs. Herein, a timely review is presented on recent advancements in designing MOF-derived electrodes, including fabricating strategies, composition management, topography control, and electrochemical performance assessment. Particularly, the inherent charge transfer, intrinsic polysulfide immobilization, and catalytic conversion on designing and engineering of MOF nanostructures for efficient MSBs are systematically discussed. In the end, the essence of how MOFs&#8217; nanostructures influence their electrochemical properties in MSBs and conclude the future tendencies regarding the construction of MOF-derived electrodes in MSBs is exposed. It is believed that this progress review will provide significant experimental/theoretical guidance in designing and understanding the MOF-derived nanostructures as multifaceted electrodes, thus offering promising orientations for the future development of fast-kinetic and robust MSBs in broad energy fields.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Roadmap to Cardiac Tissue&#8208;Engineered Construct Preservation: Insights from Cells, Tissues, and Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successful preservation methods for cardiac&#8208;tissue&#8208;engineered constructs will allow transportation and storage for off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf availability, both critical for translating this technology to clinical use, opening new avenues for the treatment/prevention of heart failure. A theoretical foundation for cardiac&#8208;tissue&#8208;engineered construct preservation is presented, with the aim to provide a roadmap to design safe and robust storage protocols.








Abstract
Worldwide, over 26 million patients suffer from heart failure (HF). One strategy aspiring to prevent or even to reverse HF is based on the transplantation of cardiac tissue&#8208;engineered (cTE) constructs. These patient&#8208;specific constructs aim to closely resemble the native myocardium and, upon implantation on the diseased tissue, support and restore cardiac function, thereby preventing the development of HF. However, cTE constructs off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf availability in the clinical arena critically depends on the development of efficient preservation methodologies. Short&#8208; and long&#8208;term preservation of cTE constructs would enable transportation and direct availability. Herein, currently available methods, from normothermic&#8208; to hypothermic&#8208; to cryopreservation, for the preservation of cardiomyocytes, whole&#8208;heart, and regenerative materials are reviewed. A theoretical foundation and recommendations for future research on developing cTE construct specific preservation methods are provided. Current research suggests that vitrification can be a promising procedure to ensure long&#8208;term cryopreservation of cTE constructs, despite the need of high doses of cytotoxic cryoprotective agents. Instead, short&#8208;term cTE construct preservation can be achieved at normothermic or hypothermic temperatures by administration of protective additives. With further tuning of these promising methods, it is anticipated that cTE construct therapy can be brought one step closer to the patient.

Abstract
Piezoelectric materials, with their unique ability for mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion, have been widely applied in important fields such as sensing, energy harvesting, wastewater treatment, and catalysis. In recent years, advances in material synthesis and engineering have provided new opportunities for the development of bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials with excellent biocompatibility and piezoelectric performance. Bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials have attracted interdisciplinary research interest due to recent insights on the impact of piezoelectricity on biological systems and their versatile biomedical applications. This review therefore introduces the development of bio&#8208;piezoelectric platforms from a broad perspective and highlights their design and engineering strategies. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomedical applications in both biosensing and disease treatment will be systematically outlined. The relationships between the properties, structure, and biomedical performance of the bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials are examined to provide a deep understanding of the working mechanisms in a physiological environment. Finally, the development trends and challenges are discussed, with the aim to provide new insights for the design and construction of future bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials.

         <title>Emerging of Heterostructure Materials in Energy Storage: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing heterostructures is an effective way to enhance the electrochemical performance of active materials due to the unique heterointerface structure and some unrevealed synergistic effects. An overview of the recent advancements in heterostructured materials in terms of enhanced mechanism, synthesis techniques, and electrochemical performance is provided. Future development trends for design of heterostructured electrodes are analyzed.








Abstract
With the ever&#8208;increasing adaption of large&#8208;scale energy storage systems and electric devices, the energy storage capability of batteries and supercapacitors has faced increased demand and challenges. The electrodes of these devices have experienced radical change with the introduction of nano&#8208;scale materials. As new generation materials, heterostructure materials have attracted increasing attention due to their unique interfaces, robust architectures, and synergistic effects, and thus, the ability to enhance the energy/power outputs as well as the lifespan of batteries. In this review, the recent progress in heterostructure from energy storage fields is summarized. Specifically, the fundamental natures of heterostructures, including charge redistribution, built&#8208;in electric field, and associated energy storage mechanisms, are summarized and discussed in detail. Furthermore, various synthesis routes for heterostructures in energy storage fields are roundly reviewed, and their advantages and drawbacks are analyzed. The superiorities and current achievements of heterostructure materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (Li&#8208;S batteries), supercapacitors, and other energy storage devices are discussed. Finally, the authors conclude with the current challenges and perspectives of the heterostructure materials for the fields of energy storage.

         <title>Formulation of a Composite Nasal Spray Enabling Enhanced Surface Coverage and Prophylaxis of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
There&#160;is a high risk of transmission of airborne pathogens through the nasal epithelium. This study reports a novel nasal spray, which is designed to maximize surface coverage and prevent infection through physical entrapment and inhibition of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2).








Abstract
Airborne pathogens pose high risks in terms of both contraction and transmission within the respiratory pathways, particularly the nasal region. However, there is little in the way of adequate intervention that can protect an individual or prevent further spread. This study reports on a nasal formulation with the capacity to combat such challenges, focusing on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). Formulation of a polysaccharide&#8208;based spray, known for its mucoadhesive properties, is undertaken and it is characterized for its mechanical, spray distribution, and antiviral properties. The ability to engineer key mechanical characteristics such as dynamic yield stresses and high coverage is shown, through systematic understanding of the composite mixture containing both gellan and &#955;&#8208;carrageenan. Furthermore, the spray systems demonstrate highly potent capacities to prevent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection in Vero cells, resulting in complete inhibition when either treating, the cells, or the virus, prior to challenging for infection. From this data, a mechanism for both prophylaxis and prevention is proposed; where entrapment within a polymeric coating sterically blocks virus uptake into the cells, inactivating the virus, and allowing clearance within the viscous medium. As such, a fully preventative spray is formulated, targeted at protecting the lining of the upper respiratory pathways against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Strain Effects on Rashba Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling of 2D Hole Gases in GeSn/Ge Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first 2D hole gas (2DHG) in GeSn/Ge heterostructures and the strongest Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) among group&#8208;IV materials are demonstrated. The SOC strength is controlled by modulating the 2DHG density via top gating, which enables effective spin manipulation for a spin logic device and fast quantum computing for spin qubits via SOC effects.








Abstract
A demonstration of 2D hole gases in GeSn/Ge heterostructures with a mobility as high as 20 000&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is given. Both the Shubnikov&#8211;de Haas oscillations and integer quantum Hall effect are observed, indicating high sample quality. The Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) is investigated via magneto&#8208;transport. Further, a transition from weak localization to weak anti&#8208;localization is observed, which shows the tunability of the SOC strength by gating. The magneto&#8208;transport data are fitted to the Hikami&#8211;Larkin&#8211;Nagaoka formula. The phase&#8208;coherence and spin&#8208;relaxation times, as well as spin&#8208;splitting energy and Rashba coefficient of the k&#8208;cubic term, are extracted. The analysis reveals that the effects of strain and confinement potential at a high fraction of Sn suppress the Rashba SOC caused by the GeSn/Ge&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>Dense All&#8208;Electrochem&#8208;Active Electrodes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of cathodes with superior ionic/electronic conductivities is demonstrated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. No carbon and electrolyte additives are needed in such an &#8220;all&#8208;electrochem&#8208;active&#8221; (AEA) cathode so the space and mass of the electrode are fully utilized and high mass/volume energy density are obtained.








Abstract
The energy density presents the core competitiveness of lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries. In conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries, the utilization of the gravimetric/volumetric energy density at the electrode level is unsatisfactory (&lt;84 wt% and &lt;62 vol%,&#160;respectively)&#160;due to the existence of non&#8208;electrochemical active parts among the 3D porous electrodes, including electrolytes, binders, and carbon additives. These are regarded as indispensable and irreducible components of the electronic and ionic transport network. Here, a dense &#8220;all&#8208;electrochem&#8208;active&#8221; (AEA) electrode for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries is proposed, which is entirely constructed from a family of superior mixed electronic&#8211;ionic&#8208;conducting cathodes, to minimize the energy density gap between the accessible and theoretical energy density at the electrode level. Furthermore, with the ionic&#8211;electronic&#8208;conductive network self&#8208;supported from the AEA cathode, the dense hybrid sulfur (S)&#8208;based AEA electrode exhibits a high compacted filling rate of 91.8%, which indicates a high energy density of 777 W h kg&#8722;1 and 1945 W h L&#8722;1 at the electrode level based on the total cathodes and anodes when at 70 &#176;C.

         <title>Adipocyte&#8208;Derived Anticancer Lipid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipid droplet, an organelle in adipocytes, is engineered to be a controllable, effective, and biocompatible drug delivery system for cancer therapy. It is demonstrated that the lipid droplet can augment the therapeutic performance of an encapsulated drug via several pathways, including generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, providing a promising material with clinical translation potential.








Abstract
Engineering of efficient and safe materials remains a challenge for cancer therapy. Here, the lipid droplet, an organelle in adipocytes, is demonstrated to be a controllable and biocompatible vehicle to deliver anticancer drugs. It is validated that isolated lipid droplets maintain their key physiological functions to interact with other organelles and augment the therapeutic effect of cancer photodynamic therapy by encapsulation with a lipid&#8208;conjugated photosensitizer (Pyrolipid) through a variety of pathways, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); lipid peroxidation; and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. As such, the IC50 value of Pyrolipid is reduced by 6.0&#8208;fold when loaded into the lipid droplet. Of note, in vivo results demonstrate that engineered lipid droplets induce significant inhibition of tumor growth with minimal side effects.

         <title>Biomimetic Dendrimer&#8211;Peptide Conjugates for Early Multi&#8208;Target Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease by Inflammatory Microenvironment Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;target nanoconjugate is developed to target the Alzheimer's disease microenvironment in the early stage. Synergistic therapeutic effects are achieved by scavenging reactive oxygen species, restoring cellular antioxidant capacity, polarizing microglia phenotype, inhibiting formation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid plaques, and recovering immunologic function based on the functional polymers and nuclear factor (erythroid&#8208;derived 2)&#8208;like 2 activating peptide. Cognitive functions are enhanced in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 model transgenic mice after treatment.








Abstract
Current therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments mainly focus on &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) targeting. However, such therapeutic strategies have limited clinical outcomes due to the chronic and irreversible impairment of the nervous system in the late stage of AD. Recently, inflammatory responses, manifested in oxidative stress and glial cell activation, have been reported as hallmarks in the early stages of AD. Based on the crosstalk between inflammatory response and brain cells, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive dendrimer&#8211;peptide conjugate (APBP) is devised to target the AD microenvironment and inhibit inflammatory responses at an early stage. With the modification of the targeting peptide, this nanoconjugate can efficiently deliver peptides to the infected regions and restore the antioxidant ability of neurons by activating the nuclear factor (erythroid&#8208;derived 2)&#8208;like 2 signaling pathway. Moreover, this multi&#8208;target strategy exhibits a synergistic function of ROS scavenging, promoting A&#946; phagocytosis, and normalizing the glial cell phenotype. As a result, the nanoconjugate can reduce ROS level, decrease A&#946; burden, alleviate glial cell activation, and eventually enhance cognitive functions in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 model mice. These results indicate that APBP can be a promising candidate for the multi&#8208;target treatment of AD.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Deformable and Tissue&#8208;Adhesive Liquid Metal Antennas with High Wireless Powering Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabrication of unprecedentedly deformable liquid metal antennas by direct ink writing of silicone microchannels on a 7 &#181;m&#8208;thick elastomeric substrate is demonstrated. Suture&#8208;free conformal adhesion of the polydopamine&#8208;coated thin&#8208;film antenna to ex vivo animal tissues and reliable wireless operations under mechanical deformations are also demonstrated.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable antennas are important for wireless communication using wearable and implantable devices to address mechanical mismatch at the tissue&#8211;device interface. Emerging technologies of liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based stretchable electronics are promising approaches to improve the flexibility and stretchability of conventional metal&#8208;based antennas. However, existing methods to encapsulate liquid metals require monolithically thick (at least 100&#160;&#181;m) substrates, and the resulting devices are limited in deformability and tissue&#8208;adhesiveness. To overcome this limitation, fabrication of microchannels by direct ink writing on a 7 &#181;m&#8208;thick elastomeric substrate is demonstrated, to obtain liquid metal microfluidic antennas with unprecedented deformability. The fabricated wireless light&#8208;emitting device is powered by a standard near&#8208;field&#8208;communication system (13.56&#160;MHz, 1 W) and retained a consistent operation under deformations including stretching (&gt;200% uniaxial strain), twisting (180&#176; twist), and bending (3.0 mm radius of curvature) while maintaining a high quality factor (q&#160;&gt; 20). Suture&#8208;free conformal adhesion of the polydopamine&#8208;coated device to ex vivo animal tissues under mechanical deformations is also demonstrated. This technology offers a new capability for the design and fabrication of wireless biomedical devices requiring conformable tissue&#8208;device integration toward minimally invasive, imperceptible medical treatments.

&lt;p&gt;Fabrication of unprecedentedly deformable liquid metal antennas by direct ink writing of silicone microchannels on a 7 &#181;m-thick elastomeric substrate is demonstrated. Suture-free conformal adhesion of the polydopamine-coated thin-film antenna to ex vivo animal tissues and reliable wireless operations under mechanical deformations are also demonstrated.


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible and stretchable antennas are important for wireless communication using wearable and implantable devices to address mechanical mismatch at the tissue&#8211;device interface. Emerging technologies of liquid-metal-based stretchable electronics are promising approaches to improve the flexibility and stretchability of conventional metal-based antennas. However, existing methods to encapsulate liquid metals require monolithically thick (at least 100&#160;&#181;m) substrates, and the resulting devices are limited in deformability and tissue-adhesiveness. To overcome this limitation, fabrication of microchannels by direct ink writing on a 7 &#181;m-thick elastomeric substrate is demonstrated, to obtain liquid metal microfluidic antennas with unprecedented deformability. The fabricated wireless light-emitting device is powered by a standard near-field-communication system (13.56&#160;MHz, 1 W) and retained a consistent operation under deformations including stretching (&amp;gt;200% uniaxial strain), twisting (180&#176; twist), and bending (3.0 mm radius of curvature) while maintaining a high quality factor (&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&amp;gt; 20). Suture-free conformal adhesion of the polydopamine-coated device to ex vivo animal tissues under mechanical deformations is also demonstrated. This technology offers a new capability for the design and fabrication of wireless biomedical devices requiring conformable tissue-device integration toward minimally invasive, imperceptible medical treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineering the Deformability of Albumin&#8208;Stabilized Emulsions for Lymph&#8208;Node Vaccine Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deformable albumin&#8208;stabilized emulsion with self&#8208;adaptive deformability, which can squeeze through the cellular gaps of lymphatic vessels for lymph node (LN) delivery (intercellular pathway), is engineered. Concurrently, they tend to also be internalized and drained to the LNs by the immunocytes (intracellular pathway). Through the dual LN&#8208;transfer, exploiting the deformability may offer an alternative way for efficient LN delivery and vaccinations.








Abstract
A major challenge in vaccine delivery is to achieve robust lymph&#8208;node (LN) accumulation, which can capitalize on concentrated immunocytes and cytokines in LNs to stimulate the onset and persistence of adaptive immune responses. Previous attempts at developing vaccine delivery systems have focused on the sizes, charges, or surface ligands but not on their deformability. In fact, the LN homing of antigen&#8208;presenting cells depends on deformability to pass through the cellular gaps. Herein, the deformability of albumin&#8208;stabilized emulsions is engineered. Owing to self&#8208;adaptive deformability, the droplets (&#8776;330 nm) can attach to and deform between cells and adjust their sizes to pass through the endothelial gaps (20&#8211;100 nm), favoring direct LN transfer (intercellular pathway). Additionally, owing to relatively large sizes, some emulsions can be retained at the administration sites for potent antigen uptake and activation of APCs as well as LN&#8208;targeted delivery of vaccines (intracellular pathway). Compared with solid particles, the dual LN transfer strategy evidently enhances antigen accumulation and activation of LN drainage, potently stimulates cellular immune responses, and increases the survival rate of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Thus, the deformability of albumin&#8208;stabilized droplets may offer an efficient strategy for potent LN targeting and enhanced vaccinations.

         <title>Dendritic Network Implementable Organic Neurofiber Transistors with Enhanced Memory Cyclic Endurance for Spatiotemporal Iterative Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are proposed. The architecture of the fibrous organic electrochemical transistors consisting of a double&#8208;stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enables multiple implementation of synaptic junctions via simple physical contact of gate&#8208;electrode microfibers, as the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber.








Abstract
Dendritic network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are proposed. The architecture of the fibrous organic electrochemical transistors consisting of a double&#8208;stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enables the highly sensitive multiple implementation of synaptic junctions via simple physical contact of gate&#8208;electrode microfibers, similar to the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber. In particular, carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;functionalized polythiophene as a semiconductor channel material provides stable gate&#8208;field&#8208;dependent multilevel memory characteristics with long&#8208;term stability and cyclic endurance, unlike the conventional poly(alkylthiophene)&#8208;based neuromorphic electrochemical transistors, which exhibit short retention and unstable endurance. The dissociation of the carboxylic acid of the polythiophene enables reversible doping and dedoping of the polythiophene channel by effectively stabilizing the ions that penetrate the channel during potentiation and depression cycles, leading to the reliable cyclic endurance of the device. The synaptic weight of the neurofiber transistors with a dendritic network maintains the state levels stably and is independently updated with each synapse connected with the presynaptic neuron to a specific state level. Finally, the neurofiber transistor demonstrates successful speech recognition based on iterative spiking neural network learning in the time domain, showing a substantial recognition accuracy of 88.9%.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Binary Polarization in a Ferroelectric Nanowire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternary switching hysteresis in a graphene nanoribbon (GNR) is demonstrated by imposing an anisotropic bias field to a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) ferroelectric nanowire (FNW) gate with a diameter of &#8776;250&#160;nm. As switching characteristics of the associated GNR field&#8208;effect transistor, the FNW hosts four polar states: vertical&#8208;up, vertical&#8208;down, radial&#8208;in, and radial&#8208;out, which are complemented by Landau&#8211;Ginzburg theory modeling.








Abstract
The prediction and observation of supra&#8208;binary polarization in a ferroelectric nanowire (FNW) covered with a semicylindrical gate that provides an anisotropic electric field in the FNW are reported. There are gate&#8208;voltage&#8208;driven transitions between four polarization states in the FNW's cross&#8208;section, dubbed vertical&#8208;up, vertical&#8208;down, radial&#8208;in, and radial&#8208;out. They are determined by the interplay between the spatial depolarization energy and the free energy induced by an anisotropic external electric field, in clear distinction from the conventional film&#8208;based binary ferroelectricity. When the FNW is mounted on a biased graphene nanoribbon (GNR), these transitions induce exotic current&#8211;voltage hysteresis in the FNW&#8211;GNR transistor. This discovery suggests new operating mechanisms of ferroelectric devices. In particular, it enables intrinsic quaternary&#8208;digit information manipulation in parallel to the bit manipulation employed in conventional data storage.

         <title>Nanoengineered Peptide&#8208;Based Antimicrobial Conductive Supramolecular Biomaterial for Cardiac Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo RGD&#8208;containing peptide is shown to form self&#8208;healing and biocompatible hydrogels. Nanoengineering the network of the peptide hydrogel by polyaniline integration results in a semiconducting composite hydrogel showing excellent antibacterial properties and DNA binding ability. The composite hydrogel further supports the growth of cardiac cells into functional synchronized monolayers, thus highlighting its potential as an excellent supramolecular biomaterial.








Abstract
Owing to their dynamic nature and ordered architecture, supramolecular materials strikingly resemble organic components of living systems. Although short&#8208;peptide self&#8208;assembled nanostructured hydrogels are regarded as intriguing supramolecular materials for biotechnology, their application is often limited due to their low stability and considerable challenge of combining other desirable properties. Herein, a di&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;based hydrogelator containing the cell&#8208;adhesive Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD) fragment that forms a mechanically stable, self&#8208;healing hydrogel is designed. Molecular dynamics simulation reveals the presence of RGD segments on the surface of the hydrogel fibers, highlighting their cell adherence capacity. Aiming to impart conductivity, the 3D network of the hydrogel is further nanoengineered by incorporating polyaniline (PAni). The composite hydrogels demonstrate semiconductivity, excellent antibacterial activity, and DNA binding capacity. Cardiac cells grown on the surface of the composite hydrogels form functional synchronized monolayers. Taken together, the combination of these attributes in a single hydrogel suggests it as an exceptional candidate for functional supramolecular biomaterial designed for electrogenic tissue engineering.

         <title>Superconducting Quantum Metamaterials from Convergence of Soft and Hard Condensed Matter Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting mesostructured niobium carbonitrides with different morphologies are prepared from a single block copolymer via self&#8208;assembly using a variety of new synthetic routes. Superconducting transition temperatures are comparable to bulk analogues but vary with mesostructure, a typical fingerprint of metamaterials, while some materials exhibit atypical flux avalanches. The results suggest a fruitful convergence of soft and hard condensed matter science.








Abstract
Superconducting quantum metamaterials are expected to exhibit a variety of novel properties, but have been a major challenge to prepare as a result of the lack of appropriate synthetic routes to high&#8208;quality materials. Here, the discovery of synthesis routes to block copolymer (BCP) self&#8208;assembly&#8208;directed niobium nitrides and carbonitrides is described. The resulting materials exhibit unusual structure retention even at temperatures as high as 1000 &#176;C and resulting critical temperature, Tc, values comparable to their bulk analogues. Applying the concepts of soft matter self&#8208;assembly, it is demonstrated that a series of four different BCP&#8208;directed mesostructured superconductors are accessible from a single triblock terpolymer. Resulting materials display a mesostructure&#8208;dependent Tc without substantial variation of the XRD&#8208;measured lattice parameters. Finally, field&#8208;dependent magnetization measurements of a sample with double&#8208;gyroid morphology show abrupt jumps comparable in overall behavior to flux avalanches. Results suggest a fruitful convergence of soft and hard condensed matter science.

         <title>Boosting the Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Activity for D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A Conjugated Microporous Polymers by Statistical Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic activity of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A copolymer photocatalysts can be boosted through statistical copolymerization by varying the ratio of electron donor to acceptor, and an attractive hydrogen evolution rate of 1.05&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 is obtained by a copolymer (10&#160;mg) with optimized polymer structure, which is also evidenced by a water&#8208;draining experiment.








Abstract
Recently, great progress has been achieved in the design and preparation of conjugated organic polymer photocatalysts for hydrogen generation. However, it is still challenging to develop an organic polymer photocatalyst with high photoconversion efficiency. Rational structure design of organic polymer photocatalysts holds the key point to realize high photocatalytic performance. Herein, a series of donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) conjugated organic copolymer photocatalysts is developed using statistical copolymerization by tuning the feed molar ratio of pyrene (donor) to dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide (acceptor) units. It reveals that the photocatalytic activity of the resulting copolymers is significantly dependent on the molar ratio of donor to acceptor, which efficiently changes the polymer structure and component. When the monomer feed ratio is 25:75, the random copolymer PyBS&#8208;3 of 10&#160;mg with Pt cocatalyst shows a high hydrogen evolution rate of 1.05&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 under UV/Vis light irradiation using ascorbic acid as the hole&#8208;scavenger, and an external quantum efficiency of 29.3% at 420&#160;nm, which represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of organic polymer photocatalysts. This work demonstrates that statistical copolymerization is an efficient strategy to optimize the polymer structure for improving the photocatalytic activity of conjugated organic polymer catalysts.

         <title>Fully 3D Printed and Disposable Paper Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully 3D printed and disposable paper supercapacitors are designed from the bottom up by a combination of nanocellulose, biopolymers, and carbon nanomaterials leading to monolithic integrated devices with excellent electrochemical properties. The results combining digital material assembly, high performance, and nontoxicity have the potential to move the field of sustainable electronics forward.








Abstract
With the development of the internet&#8208;of&#8208;things for applications such as wearables and packaging, a new class of electronics is emerging, characterized by the sheer number of forecast units and their short service&#8208;life. Projected to reach 27 billion units in 2021, connected devices are generating an exponentially increasing amount of electronic waste (e&#8208;waste). Fueled by the growing e&#8208;waste problem, the field of sustainable electronics is attracting significant interest. Today, standard energy&#8208;storage technologies such as lithium&#8208;ion or alkaline batteries still power most of smart devices. While they provide good performance, the nonrenewable and toxic materials require dedicated collection and recycling processes. Moreover, their standardized form factor and performance specifications limit the designs of smart devices. Here, exclusively disposable materials are used to fully print nontoxic supercapacitors maintaining a high capacitance of 25.6 F&#160;g&#8722;1 active material at an operating voltage up to 1.2 V. The presented combination of digital material assembly, stable high&#8208;performance operation, and nontoxicity has the potential to open new avenues within sustainable electronics and applications such as environmental sensing, e&#8208;textiles, and healthcare.

         <title>Quicker and More Zn2+ Storage Predominantly from the Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificially constructed VOx sub&#8208;nanometer clusters/rGO composite composed of heterogeneous V&#63743;O&#63743;C bonds is used as a zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode, in which Zn2+ storage predominantly originates from the interface, while electron conduction occurs on the rGO. Such interface&#8208;dominated storage enables an ultrahigh rate capability (174.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1) and a high capacity (443 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1).








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are highly desirable for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their low cost and high&#8208;level safety. However, achieving high energy and high power densities simultaneously is challenging. Herein, a VOx sub&#8208;nanometer cluster/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) cathode material composed of interfacial V&#63743;O&#63743;C bonds is artificially constructed. Therein, a new mechanism is revealed, where Zn2+ ions are predominantly stored at the interface between VOx and rGO, which causes anomalous valence changes compared to conventional mechanisms and exploits the storage ability of non&#8208;energy&#8208;storing active yet highly conductive rGO. Further, this interface&#8208;dominated storage triggers decoupled transport of electrons/Zn2+ ions, and the reversible destruction/reconstruction allows the interface to store more ions than the bulk. Finally, an ultrahigh rate capability (174.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1, i.e., capacity retention of 39.4% for a 1000&#8208;fold increase in current density) and a high capacity (443 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1, exceeding the theoretical capacities of each interfacial component) are achieved. Such interface&#8208;dominated storage is an exciting way to build high&#8208;energy&#8208; and high&#8208;power&#8208;density devices.

         <title>Efficient and Tunable Reflection of Phonon Polaritons at Built&#8208;In Intercalation Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedded intercalation nanostructures are constructed in polaritonic &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flakes, serving as efficient and tunable reflectors for phonon polaritons. Reflected phonon polaritons with low losses exhibit propagation&#8208;dependent reflection phase shifts and propagation&#8208;independent reflectance. Both experiment and simulation results confirm that this nontrivial reflection stems from the permittivity discontinuity at the built&#8208;in interfaces, offering potential electrical tunability.








Abstract
Phonon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to lattice vibrations&#8212;in polar van der Waals crystals offer unprecedented opportunities for controlling light at the nanoscale due to their anisotropic and ultralow&#8208;loss propagation. While their analog plasmon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to electron oscillations&#8212;have long been studied and exhibit interesting reflections at geometrical edges and electronic boundaries, whether phonon polaritons can be reflected by such barriers has been elusive. Here, the effective and tunable reflection of phonon polaritons at embedded interfaces formed in hydrogen&#8208;intercalated &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flakes is elaborated upon. Without breaking geometrical continuity, such intercalation interfaces can reflect phonon polaritons with low losses, yielding the distinct phase changes of &#8722;0.8&#960; and &#8722;0.3&#960; associated with polariton propagation, high efficiency of 50%, and potential electrical tunability. The results point to a new approach to construct on&#8208;demand polariton reflectors, phase modulators, and retarders, which may be transplanted into building future polaritonic circuits using van der Waals crystals.

&lt;p&gt;Embedded intercalation nanostructures are constructed in polaritonic &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; flakes, serving as efficient and tunable reflectors for phonon polaritons. Reflected phonon polaritons with low losses exhibit propagation-dependent reflection phase shifts and propagation-independent reflectance. Both experiment and simulation results confirm that this nontrivial reflection stems from the permittivity discontinuity at the built-in interfaces, offering potential electrical tunability.

         <title>Abrasion Resistant/Waterproof Stretchable Triboelectric Yarns Based on Fermat Spirals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous triboelectric yarn based on a Fermat&#8208;spiral structure has outstanding dynamic structure stability. The unique Fermat&#8208;spiral nanofibers endow this electronic yarn with excellent electrical output, abrasion resistance, and hydrophobicity, which then can collect water&#8208;droplet energy. Moreover, textiles knitted from the electronic yarn are of distinguished stretchability and breathability. This scalable yarn and textile is thus a feasible proposal for building future &#8220;energy garments&#8221;.








Abstract
Emerging energy harvesting yarns, via triboelectric effects, have wide application prospects in new&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, few studies have been carried out regarding simultaneously achieving high electrical performance, mechanical robustness, and comfortability in industrial&#8208;scalable yarn. Here, an electronic yarn twisted into Fermat spiral, which has outstanding dynamic structure stability, is reported. The Fermat&#8208;spiral&#8208;based energy yarns (FSBEY) can simultaneously realize ultrahigh abrasion resistance (over 5000 Martindale standard abrasion cycles), stable reversible strain (100%), and excellent electrical output. Considerably high output (105&#160;V, &#8776;1.2 &#181;A under 2&#160;Hz) can be attained upon contacting a single yarn (30&#160;cm) with latex material, which is superior to most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stretchable triboelectric yarns. The application of these FSBEY in wireless gesture recognition, smart screen information protection, and harvesting of energy from water dropletsis demonstrated. Moreover, textiles knitted from the FSBEY have distinguished waterproof nature and are breathable. This work shows a feasible proposal for building future &#8220;energy garments&#8221;.

         <title>Uniform Magnesium Electrodeposition via Synergistic Coupling of Current Homogenization, Geometric Confinement, and Chemisorption Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a synergistic coupling of homogenizing current distribution, geometric confinement, and chemisorptive interaction, a 3D vertically aligned nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber array structure on carbon cloth can regulate the uniform Mg electrodeposition and realize a reversible magnesium&#8208;metal anode with high areal capacity, much better kinetics, and improved cycle life.








Abstract
Unevenly distributed magnesium (Mg) electrodeposits have emerged as a major obstacle for Mg&#8208;metal batteries. A comprehensive design matrix is reported for 3D magnesiophilic hosts, which regulate the uniform Mg electrodeposition through a synergistic coupling of homogenizing current distribution, geometric confinement, and chemisorptive interaction. Vertically aligned nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber arrays on carbon cloth (denoted as &#8220;VNCA@C&#8221;) are developed as a proof of concept. The evenly arranged short nanoarray architecture helps to homogenize the surface current density and the microchannels built in this 3D host allow the preferential nucleation of Mg due to their geometrical confinement effect. Besides, the nitrogen&#8208;/oxygen&#8208;doped carbon species exhibit strong chemisorptive interaction toward Mg atoms, providing preferential nucleation sites as demonstrated by first&#8208;principle calculation results. Electrochemical analysis reveals a peculiar yet highly reversible microchannel&#8208;filling growth&#160;behavior of Mg metals, which empowers the delicately designed VNCA@C host with the ability to deliver a reduced nucleation overpotential of 429&#160;mV at 10.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an elongated Mg plating/stripping cycle life (110 cycles) under high current density of 10.0 mA cm&#8722;2. The proposed design matrix can be extended to other metal anodes (such as lithium and zinc) for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Tough&#8208;Hydrogel Reinforced Low&#8208;Tortuosity Conductive Networks for Stretchable and High&#8208;Performance Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultratough hydrogel reinforcement coating enables a tough and stretchable isotopically low tortuous conductive network. The micro&#8208;open&#8208;porous material demonstrates simultaneously high mechanical robustness, high capacitance, energy and power density when applied as capacitive electrodes. The presented strategy promotes the development of stretchable energy storage devices and opens up new possibilities for the application of tough hydrogels.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitors are seeing emerging applications in flexible and stretchable electronics. Supercapacitors with high capacitance, high power density, simple form factor, and good mechanical robustness are highly desired, which demands electrode materials with high surface area, high mass loading, good conductivity, larger thickness, low tortuosity, and high toughness. However, it has been challenging to simultaneously realize them in a single material. By compositing a superficial layer of tough hydrogel on conductive and low tortuous foams, a thick capacitor electrode with large capacitance (5.25 F cm&#8208;2), high power density (41.28&#160;mW cm&#8208;2), and good mechanical robustness (&#949;&#160;= 140%, &#915;&#160;= 1000 J m&#8208;2) is achieved. The tough hydrogel serves as both a load&#8208;bearing layer to maintain structural integrity during deformation and a permeable binder to allow interaction between the conductive electrode and electrolyte. It is shown that the tough hydrogel reinforcement is beneficial for both electrical and mechanical stability. With a simple design and facile fabrication, this strategy is generalizable for various conductive materials.

         <title>Co3Se4 Quantum Dots as an Ultrastable Host Material for Potassium&#8208;Ion Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co3Se4 quantum dots encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon (CSC) are reported as an anode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries, in which a morphology change process occurs. The unique core&#8211;shell&#8208;like&#8208;structure anode demonstrates greatly enhanced electrochemical performance, especially long&#8208;term cyclic performance at various current densities. Density functional theory calculations, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, and ex situ transmission electron microscopy further reveal the working mechanism of the CSC anode during potassiation/depotassiation.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) are receiving increased attention due to their cost&#8208;effective and similar energy&#8208;storage mechanism to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the lack of appropriate electrode materials is still hampered for their development, which is mainly caused by the large size of the potassium ions (1.38&#160;&#197;) including low structural stability and poor electrochemical redox reaction kinetics. Herein, Co3Se4 quantum dots (QD) encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon (CSC) are reported as an anode material for KIBs, in which a morphology change process occurs. Benefiting from the unique uniform nanostructure reducing the ion&#8208;diffusion length, the improved electronic conductivity, and the enhanced protective effect of N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) alleviating volume fluctuation, the CSC demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance. The core&#8211;shell&#8208;like CSC composite demonstrates remarkable discharge capacity (410&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 550 cycles, 360&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 3200 cycles) and excellent cyclic performance over 10&#160;000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Density functional theory calculations show a larger reaction energy of Co3Se4 QD than bulk Co3Se4, a lower barrier of K atom migration in Co3Se4 QD than bulk Co3Se4, and also favor the intercalation reaction rather than replacement reaction. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ transmission electron microscopy are further used to evaluate potassiation/depotassiation phenomena.

Herein, Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots (QD) encapsulated by N-doped carbon (CSC) are reported as an anode material for KIBs, in which a morphology change process occurs. Benefiting from the unique uniform nanostructure reducing the ion-diffusion length, the improved electronic conductivity, and the enhanced protective effect of N-doped carbon (NC) alleviating volume fluctuation, the CSC demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance. The core&#8211;shell-like CSC composite demonstrates remarkable discharge capacity (410&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 550 cycles, 360&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 3200 cycles) and excellent cyclic performance over 10&#160;000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Density functional theory calculations show a larger reaction energy of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; QD than bulk Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a lower barrier of K atom migration in Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; QD than bulk Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and also favor the intercalation reaction rather than replacement reaction. In situ X-ray diffraction and ex situ transmission electron microscopy are further used to evaluate potassiation/depotassiation phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>From Fundamental Understanding to Engineering Design of High&#8208;Performance Thick Electrodes for Scalable Energy&#8208;Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical assessment of the combined effect of electrode thickness with other key design parameters is provided and practical guidelines offered toward developing scalable high&#8208;energy/power energy&#8208;storage systems.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing needs for renewable energy demand the pursuit of batteries with higher energy/power output. A thick electrode design is considered as a promising solution for high&#8208;energy batteries due to the minimized inactive material ratio at the device level. Most of the current research focuses on pushing the electrode thickness to a maximum limit; however, very few of them thoroughly analyze the effect of electrode thickness on cell&#8208;level energy densities as well as the balance between energy and power density. Here, a realistic assessment of the combined effect of electrode thickness with other key design parameters is provided, such as active material fraction and electrode porosity, which affect the cell&#8208;level energy/power densities of lithium&#8211;LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (Li&#8211;NMC622) and lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) cells as two model battery systems, is provided. Based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium batteries, key research targets are quantified to achieve 500&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1/800&#160;Wh L&#8211;1 cell&#8208;level energy densities and strategies are elaborated to simultaneously enhance energy/power output. Furthermore, the remaining challenges are highlighted toward realizing scalable high&#8208;energy/power energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>An Efficient Narrowband Near&#8208;Infrared at 1040&#160;nm Organic Photodetector Realized by Intermolecular Charge Transfer Mediated Coupling Based on a Squaraine Dye</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband near&#8208;infrared organic photodiodes are reported based on a dipolar squaraine dye. J&#8208;type coupling in the solid state allows SQ&#8208;H thin films to combine favorable NIR absorption at 1040&#160;nm and charge carrier mobility. The bulk&#8208;heterojunction with PC61BM yields an organic photodiode with external quantum efficiency of 12.3% at 1050&#160;nm with a full&#8208;width half&#8208;maximum of 85&#160;nm under short&#8208;circuit condition.








Abstract
A highly sensitive short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, &#955;&#160;&gt; 1000 nm) organic photodiode (OPD) is described based on a well&#8208;organized nanocrystalline bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) active layer composed of a dicyanovinyl&#8208;functionalized squaraine dye (SQ&#8208;H) donor material in combination with PC61BM. Through thermal annealing, dipolar SQ&#8208;H chromophores self&#8208;assemble in a nanoscale structure with intermolecular charge transfer mediated coupling, resulting in a redshifted and narrow absorption band at 1040 nm as well as enhanced charge carrier mobility. The optimized OPD exhibits an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12.3% and a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of only 85 nm (815 cm&#8722;1) at 1050 nm under 0 V, which is the first efficient SWIR OPD based on J&#8208;type aggregates. Photoplethysmography application for heart&#8208;rate monitoring is successfully demonstrated on flexible substrates without applying reverse bias, indicating the potential of OPDs based on short&#8208;range coupled dye aggregates for low&#8208;power operating wearable applications.

         <title>Digital Electrochemistry for On&#8208;Chip Heterogeneous Material Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel digital electrochemistry approach is proposed, which site&#8208;selectively carries out electrochemical reactions to deposit electroactive materials. Multicolored electrochromic patterns and actuator arrays are fabricated. The approach can be extended to a broad range of materials and structures, opening up a new path for advanced heterogeneous microsystem integration.








Abstract
Many modern electronic applications rely on functional units arranged in an active&#8208;matrix integrated on a single chip. The active&#8208;matrix allows numerous identical device pixels to be addressed within a single system. However, next&#8208;generation electronics requires heterogeneous integration of dissimilar devices, where sensors, actuators, and display pixels sense and interact with the local environment. Heterogeneous material integration allows the reduction of size, increase of functionality, and enhancement of performance; however, it is challenging since front&#8208;end fabrication technologies in microelectronics put extremely high demands on materials, fabrication protocols, and processing environments. To overcome the obstacle in heterogeneous material integration, digital electrochemistry is explored here, which site&#8208;selectively carries out electrochemical processes to deposit and address electroactive materials within the pixel array. More specifically, an amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (a&#8208;IGZO) thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor (TFT) active&#8208;matrix is used to address pixels within the matrix and locally control electrochemical reactions for material growth and actuation. The digital electrochemistry procedure is studied in&#8208;depth by using polypyrrole (PPy) as a model material. Active&#8208;matrix&#8208;driven multicolored electrochromic patterns and actuator arrays are fabricated to demonstrate the capabilities of this approach for material integration. The approach can be extended to a broad range of materials and structures, opening up a new path for advanced heterogeneous microsystem integration.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triboelectric nanogenerators can efficiently convert biomechanical motion into a characteristically high voltage and low current whilst avoiding collateral heat production, which is known to lead to detrimental localized side effects. The use of triboelectric nanogenerators for electrical stimulation has been validated and demonstrated to be useful in enhancing numerous tissue regeneration processes within the human body to provide a novel paradigm in therapeutic solutions. Such systems are reviewed by Jun Chen and co&#8208;workers in article number 2007502.

         <title>Neurofiber Transistors: Dendritic Network Implementable Organic Neurofiber Transistors with Enhanced Memory Cyclic Endurance for Spatiotemporal Iterative Learning (Adv. Mater. 26/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic neural&#8208;network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are developed by Hyunsu Ju, Jung Ah Lim, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2100475. These neurofiber transistors consisting of a double&#8208;stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enable a multichannel synaptic junction of a neural network via simple physical contact of gate&#8208;electrode microfibers, as the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber. This work provides insight into the design of the materials and architecture of organic neuromorphic devices with reliable artificial synaptic functionality for artificial neural network learning.

         <title>Mesoporous Superconductors: Superconducting Quantum Metamaterials from Convergence of Soft and Hard Condensed Matter Science (Adv. Mater. 26/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2006975, mesoporous superconductors are prepared by Ulrich Wiesner and co&#8208;workers via solution&#8208;based block&#8208;copolymer self&#8208;assembly leading to high&#8208;quality quantum metamaterials. The full promise of this soft&#8208;materials approach is realized by producing superconductors with four different mesoscale morphologies. In these materials, the superconducting transition temperatures show variations with mesoscale structure despite nearly identical atomic crystal lattices. The materials exhibit atypical flux avalanches, characteristic of granular materials.

         <dc:description>
In article number 2101272, Bin Bao, Daniil Karnaushenko, Oliver G. Schmidt, and co&#8208;workers develop a digital electrochemistry approach for on&#8208;chip heterogeneous material integration. An amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor (a&#8208;IGZO TFT) active&#8208;matrix is used to address pixels within the matrix and locally control electrochemical reactions for material growth and actuation. Multicolored electrochromic patterns and actuator arrays can be fabricated. The approach can be extended to a broad range of materials and structures, opening up a new path for advanced heterogeneous microsystem integration.

Specifically, strategies for engineering the electronic structure of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, etc., are comprehensively summarized, along with a perspective for the future development of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The exploration of efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion is important for green energy development. Owing to their high surface areas and unusual electronic structure, 2D electrocatalysts have attracted increasing interest. Among them, non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D materials with numerous chemical bonds in all three dimensions and novel chemical and electronic properties beyond those of vdW 2D materials have been studied increasingly over the past decades. Herein, the progress of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts is critically reviewed, with a special emphasis on electronic structure modulation. Strategies for heteroatom doping, vacancy engineering, pore creation, alloying, and heterostructure engineering are analyzed for tuning electronic structures and achieving intrinsically enhanced electrocatalytic performances. Lastly, a roadmap for the future development of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts is provided from material, mechanism, and performance viewpoints.

         <title>Recent Progress of Chiral Perovskites: Materials, Synthesis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral perovskites are considered to be a promising class of materials for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic and spintronic devices, owing to their superiority in combining chirality and high dielectric constants, high optical&#8208;absorption coefficients, and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. The synthesis strategies, chirality generation mechanisms, physical properties, and applications of chiral perovskites are reviewed.








Abstract
Chiral materials with intrinsic inversion&#8208;symmetric structures possess many unique physicochemical features, including circular dichroism, circularly polarized photoluminescence, nonlinear optics, ferroelectricity, and spintronics. Halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent optical and electrical properties, which are particularly suitable for realizing high power&#8208;conversion efficiency in solar cells. Recent studies have shown that chirality can be transferred from chiral organic ligands into halide perovskites and the resultant chiral perovskites combine the advantages of both chiral materials and halide perovskites; this provides an ideal platform to design next&#8208;generation optoelectronic and spintronic devices. In this progress report, the most recent advances are summarized in various chemical structures of chiral perovskites, their synthesis strategies, chirality generation mechanisms, and physical properties. Furthermore, the potential chiral&#8208;halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based applications are presented and the challenges and prospects of chiral perovskites are discussed. This report outlines the diverse construction strategies of and proposes research directions for chiral halide perovskites; thus, it provides insights into the design of novel chiral perovskites and facilitates investigation of the optoelectronic applications that employ chirality.

         <title>Advances in Application of Azobenzene as a Trigger in Biomedicine: Molecular Design and Spontaneous Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene is a well&#8208;known derivative of stimulus&#8208;responsive molecular switches and has shown superior performance as a functional material in biomedical applications. The results of numerous studies have led to the development of light/hypoxia&#8208;responsive azobenzene for biomedical use.

Abstract
Azobenzene is a well&#8208;known derivative of stimulus&#8208;responsive molecular switches and has shown superior performance as a functional material in biomedical applications. The results of multiple studies have led to the development of light/hypoxia&#8208;responsive azobenzene for biomedical use. In recent years, long&#8208;wavelength&#8208;responsive azobenzene has been developed. Matching the longer wavelength absorption and hypoxia&#8208;response characteristics of the azobenzene switch unit to the bio&#8208;optical window results in a large and effective stimulus response. In addition, azobenzene has been used as a hypoxia&#8208;sensitive connector via biological cleavage under appropriate stimulus conditions. This has resulted in on/off state switching of properties such as pharmacology and fluorescence activity. Herein, recent advances in the design and fabrication of azobenzene as a trigger in biomedicine are summarized.

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Therapeutic Electrical Stimulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the key role of naturally induced electrical signals in many physiological functions, the recent invention of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) allows for self&#8208;powered electrical stimulation to provide a novel paradigm in therapeutic solutions. Research on in&#8208; and on&#8208;body TENGs applied for electrical stimulation therapeutics in the fields of regenerative medicine, neurology, rehabilitation, and pharmaceutical engineering is detailed.








Abstract
Current solutions developed for the purpose of in and on body (IOB) electrical stimulation (ES) lack autonomous qualities necessary for comfortable, practical, and self&#8208;dependent use. Consequently, recent focus has been placed on developing self&#8208;powered IOB therapeutic devices capable of generating therapeutic ES for human use. With the recent invention of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), harnessing passive human biomechanical energy to develop self&#8208;powered systems has allowed for the introduction of novel therapeutic ES solutions. TENGs are especially effective at providing ES for IOB therapeutic systems given their bioconformability, low cost, simple manufacturability, and self&#8208;powering capabilities. Due to the key role of naturally induced electrical signals in many physiological functions, TENG&#8208;induced ES holds promise to provide a novel paradigm in therapeutic interventions. The aim here is to detail research on IOB TENG devices applied for ES&#8208;based therapy in the fields of regenerative medicine, neurology, rehabilitation, and pharmaceutical engineering. Furthermore, considering TENG&#8208;produced ES can be measured for sensing applications, this technology is paving the way to provide a fully autonomous personalized healthcare system, capable of IOB energy generation, sensing, and therapeutic intervention. Considering these grounds, it seems highly relevant to review TENG&#8208;ES research and applications, as they could constitute the foundation and future of personalized healthcare.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Photodetectors: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design principle for lead&#8208;free perovskites and the progress of typical lead&#8208;free perovskite photodetectors are reviewed and discussed. The outlook for future research and applications is then explored.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photodetectors which apply hybrid perovskite materials have emerged as powerful candidates for next&#8208;generation light sensing. Among them, lead&#8208;based ones are the most popular beyond doubt on account of their unique and superior optoelectronic properties. Nevertheless, trade&#8208;off toward commercialization exists between nontoxicity and high performance, with the poor stability of lead&#8208;based perovskites, indicating that it is indispensable to substitute lead with nontoxic element meanwhile bringing about a comparable figure of merit of photodetectors and relatively long&#8208;term stability. Herein, recent advances in lead&#8208;free perovskite photodetectors are reviewed, analyzing the principle while designing new materials and highlighting some remarkable progress, which are comparable, even superior, to lead&#8208;based photodetectors. Furthermore, their potential strategy in optical communication, image sensing, narrowband photodetection, etc., is examined and a perspective on developing new materials and photodetectors with superior properties for more practical applications is provided.
