         <title>Extreme Water Uptake of Hygroscopic Hydrogels through Maximized Swelling&#8208;Induced Salt Loading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The swelling dynamics of hydrogels in aqueous lithium chloride solutions are studied and unprecedented salt loadings and water vapor uptakes reaching 1.79 and 3.86&#160;gg&#8722;1 are acheived at relative humidity of 30% and 70%, respectively. This exceeds previously reported uptakes of hydrogels by 15%, while also avoiding the leakage problems common with salts.








Abstract
Hygroscopic hydrogels are emerging as scalable and low&#8208;cost sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting, dehumidification, passive cooling, and thermal energy storage. However, devices using these materials still exhibit insufficient performance, partly due to the limited water vapor uptake of the hydrogels. Here, the swelling dynamics of hydrogels in aqueous lithiumchloride solutions, the implications on hydrogel salt loading, and the resulting vapor uptake of the synthesized hydrogel&#8211;salt composites are characterized. By tuning the salt concentration of the swelling solutions and the cross&#8208;linking properties of the gels, hygroscopic hydrogels with extremely high salt loadings are synthesized, which enable unprecedented water uptakes of 1.79 and 3.86&#160;gg&#8722;1 at relative humidity (RH) of 30% and 70%, respectively. At 30% RH, this exceeds previously reported water uptakes of metal&#8211;organic frameworks by over 100% and of hydrogels by 15%, bringing the uptake within 93% of the fundamental limit of hygroscopic salts while avoiding leakage problems common in salt solutions. By modeling the salt&#8208;vapor equilibria, the maximum leakage&#8208;free RH is elucidated as a function of hydrogel uptake and swelling ratio. These insights guide the design of hydrogels with exceptional hygroscopicity that enable sorption&#8208;based devices to tackle water scarcity and the global energy crisis.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Pumped Perovskite Lasers with Device Area Below 1&#160;&#181;m2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;wave optically pumped perovskite sub&#8208;micrometer lasers are demonstrated. Their thresholds are comparable to or even lower than those of several&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized counterparts owing to their enhanced exciton&#8211;photon coupling strength. The potential of exciton&#8211;polaritons in laser miniaturization is unveiled experimentally and theoretically to develop low&#8208;threshold semiconductor lasers with device sizes approaching the optical diffraction limit.








Abstract
Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) pumped lasers with device areas below 1&#160;&#181;m2 constitute a key step to meeting the energy efficiency requirement for on&#8208;chip optical communications. However, a debate about whether a sub&#8211;micrometer device size and low threshold can be simultaneously satisfied has persisted owing to insurmountable radiation losses when approaching the optical diffraction limit. Herein, a record&#8208;small CW optically pumped perovskite laser with a device area of 0.65&#160;&#181;m2 is demonstrated. The thresholds of sub&#8211;micrometer lasers can be found lower than those of several&#8208;micrometer counterparts, and are ascribed to the enlarged group refractive index and modal confinement resulting from the enhanced exciton&#8211;photon coupling. Moreover, the operation temperature is elevated to 150&#160;K through the reduction in heat generation. These findings unveil the potential of exciton&#8211;polaritons in laser miniaturization, providing an alternative for developing low&#8208;threshold semiconductor lasers without artificial optical cavities, to approach the optical diffraction limit.

         <title>Highly Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Dry Reforming of Methane on a Rh/LaNiO3 Catalyst through a Light&#8208;induced Metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal Charge Transfer Process</title>

Abstract
As an energy&#8208;saving and green method, solar&#8208;driven dry reforming of methane (DRM) is expected to introduce new activation processes and prevent sintering and coking of the catalysts. However, it still lacks an efficient way to the coordinate regulation of activation of reactants and lattice oxygen migration. In this work, Rh/LaNiO3 is designed as a highly efficient photothermal catalyst for solar&#8208;driven DRM, which performs production rates of 452.3&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gRh&#8722;1 for H2 and 527.6&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gRh&#8722;1 for CO2 under a light intensity of 1.5&#160;W cm&#8722;2, with an excellent stability. Moreover, a remarkable light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency (LTCEE) of 10.72% is achieved under a light intensity of 3.5&#160;W cm&#8722;2. The characterizations of surface electronic and chemical properties and theoretical analysis demonstrate that strong adsorption for CH4 and CO2, light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) process and high oxygen mobility together bring Rh/LaNiO3 excellent performance for solar&#8208;driven DRM.

         <title>Separating Crystal Growth from Nucleation Enables the in&#8208;situ&#8208;controllable Synthesis of Nanocrystals for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;emitting Diodes</title>

Abstract
Colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) display bright luminescence for light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) applications; however, they require post&#8208;synthesis ligand exchange that may cause surface degradation and defect formation. In&#8208;situ&#8208;formed PNCs achieve improved surface passivation using a straightforward synthetic approach, but their LED performance in the green wavelength is not yet comparable with that of colloidal PNC devices. Here we find that the limitations of in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed PNCs stem from uncontrolled formation kinetics: conventional surface ligands confine perovskite nuclei but fail to delay crystal growth. We introduce a bifunctional carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;containing ammonium hydrobromide ligand that separates crystal growth from nucleation, leading to the formation of quantum&#8208;confined PNC solids exhibiting a narrow size distribution. Controlled crystallization is further coupled with defect passivation using deprotonated phosphinates, enabling improvements in photoluminescence quantum yield to near unity. We fabricate green LEDs with a maximum current efficiency of 109&#160;cd A&#8722;1 and average external quantum efficiency of 22.5% across 25 devices &#8211; exceeding the performance of colloidal PNC&#8208;based counterparts; We further document a 45.6&#8208;hour operating half&#8208;time for an unencapsulated device in N2 with an initial brightness of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>PdNi biatomic clusters from metallene unlock record&#8208;low onset dehydrogenation temperature for bulk&#8208;MgH2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogen storage has long been a priority on the renewable energy research agenda. Due to its high volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen density, MgH2 is a desirable candidate for solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage. However, its practical use is constrained by high thermal stability and sluggish kinetics. Here, we report PdNi bilayer metallenes as catalysts for hydrogen storage of bulk&#8208;MgH2 near ambient temperature. Unprecedented 422 K beginning dehydrogenation temperature and up to 6.36&#160;wt.% reliable hydrogen storage capacity were achieved. Fast hydrogen desorption was also provided by the system (5.49&#160;wt.% in 1&#160;h, 523 K). The in&#8208;situ generated PdNi alloy clusters with suitable d&#8208;band centers were identified as the main active sites during the de/re&#8208;hydrogenation process by AC&#8208;TEM and theoretical simulations, while other active species including Pd/Ni pure phase clusters and Pd/Ni single atoms obtained via metallene ball milling, also enhance reaction. These findings present fundamental insights into active species identification and rational design of highly efficient hydrogen storage materials.

Unprecedented 422 K beginning dehydrogenation temperature and up to 6.36&#160;wt.% reliable hydrogen storage capacity were achieved. Fast hydrogen desorption was also provided by the system (5.49&#160;wt.% in 1&#160;h, 523 K). The &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; generated PdNi alloy clusters with suitable &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band centers were identified as the main active sites during the de/re-hydrogenation process by AC-TEM and theoretical simulations, while other active species including Pd/Ni pure phase clusters and Pd/Ni single atoms obtained via metallene ball milling, also enhance reaction. These findings present fundamental insights into active species identification and rational design of highly efficient hydrogen storage materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Direct Conversion of Phase&#8208;Transition Entropy into Electrochemical Thermopower and Peltier Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermocell generates thermopower from a temperature difference (&#916;T) between two electrodes. The converse process of thermocells is an electrochemical Peltier effect, which creates a &#916;T on the electrodes by applying an external current. The Seebeck coefficient (Se) of the electrochemical system is proportional to the entropy change of the redox reaction; therefore, a redox system having a significant entropy change is expected to increase the Se. In this study, a thermo&#8208;responsive polymer having a redox&#8208;active moiety, poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;acrylamide ethyl)&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;n&#8208;propylviologen) (PNV), is used as the redox species of a thermocell. PNV2+ dication undergoes the coil&#8211;globule phase transition upon the reduction to PNV+ cation radical, and a large entropy change is introduced because water molecules are freed from the polymer chains. The Se of PNV thermocell drastically increased to +2.1&#160;mV K&#8722;1 at the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNV. The entropy change calculated from the increment of Se agreed with the value evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, the electrochemical Peltier effect was observed when the device temperature was increased above the LCST. This study shows that the large entropy change associated with the coil&#8211;globule phase transition can be used in electrochemical thermal management and refrigeration technologies.

         <title>An Ultrastable Self&#8208;Assembled Antibacterial Nanospears Made of Protein</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent increasing reports of antibiotic resistance reveal an overwhelming threat to global public health, necessitating alternative approaches. By rational design and serendipity, a supramolecular nanostructure with a well&#8208;defined shape, geometry or architecture termed &#8220;nanospears&#8221; based on engineered proteins is spontaneously biofabricated via a bottom&#8208;up strategy with exceptional stability, broad&#8208;antibacterial activities and biocompatibility.








Abstract
Protein&#8208;based nanomaterials have broad applications in the biomedical and bionanotechnological sectors owing to their outstanding properties such as high biocompatibility and biodegradability, structural stability, sophisticated functional versatility, and being environmentally benign. They have gained considerable attention in drug delivery, cancer therapeutics, vaccines, immunotherapies, biosensing, and biocatalysis. However, so far, in the battle against the increasing reports of antibiotic resistance and emerging drug&#8208;resistant bacteria, unique nanostructures of this kind are lacking, hindering their potential next&#8208;generation antibacterial agents. Here, the discovery of a class of supramolecular nanostructures with well&#8208;defined shapes, geometries, or architectures (termed &#8220;protein nanospears&#8221;) based on engineered proteins, exhibiting exceptional broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activities, is reported. The protein nanospears are engineered via spontaneous cleavage&#8208;dependent or precisely tunable self&#8208;assembly routes using mild metal salt&#8208;ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+) as a molecular trigger. The nanospears&#8217; dimensions collectively range from entire nano&#8208; to micrometer scale. The protein nanospears display exceptional thermal and chemical stability yet rapidly disassemble upon exposure to high concentrations of chaotropes (&gt;1 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)). Using a combination of biological assays and electron microscopy imaging, it is revealed that the nanospears spontaneously induce rapid and irreparable damage to bacterial morphology via a unique action mechanism provided by their nanostructure and enzymatic action, a feat inaccessible to traditional antibiotics. These protein&#8208;based nanospears show promise as a potent tool to combat the growing threats of resistant bacteria, inspiring a new way to engineer other antibacterial protein nanomaterials with diverse structural and dimensional architectures and functional properties.

         <title>Engineering Amorphous&#8211;Crystallized Interface of ZrNx Barriers for Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of the amorphous&#8211;crystalline (a&#8211;c) interface on the blocking performance of ZrNx barrier films is investigated and the interface density is quantified for proving the interdiffusion channels by pattern recognition technology. The underlying mechanisms of a&#8211;c interfaces for blocking effects are further revealed&#160;in thermodynamic and kinetics properties, constructing stable inverted perovskite solar cells with amorphous ZrNx barriers.








Abstract
It is challenging to achieve long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells due to the corrosion and diffusion of metal electrodes. Integration of compact barriers into devices has been recognized as an effective strategy to protect the perovskite absorber and electrode. However, the difficulty is to construct a thin layer of a few nanometers that can delay ion migration and impede chemical reactions simultaneously, in which the delicate microstructure design of a stable material plays an important role. Herein, ZrNx barrier films with high amorphization are introduced in p&#8211;i&#8211;nperovskite solar cells. To quantify the amorphous&#8211;crystalline (a&#8211;c) density, pattern recognition techniques are employed. It is found the decreasing a&#8211;c interface in an amorphous film leads to dense atom arrangement and uniform distribution of chemical potential, which retards the interdiffusion at the interface between ions and metal atoms and protect the electrodes from corrosion. The resultant solar cells exhibit improved operational stability, which retains 88% of initial efficiency after continuous maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;Sun illumination at room temperature (25 &#176;C) for 1500 h.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry as a Universal Strategy for a Controlled Perovskite Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The most efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are made from complex mixture of precursors, which are practically always dissolved in combinations of the volatile (and toxic) N, N&#8208;Dimethylformamide (DMF), and the non&#8208;volatile (and green) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvents. Typically, to then form a thin film, an extreme oversaturation of the perovskite precursor is initiated to trigger nucleation sites, e.g. by vacuum, an airstream or a so&#8208;called antisolvent. Unfortunately, most such oversaturation triggers do not expel the lingering (and highly coordinating) DMSO, which is highly coordinating, from the thin films; this detrimentally affects long&#8208;term stability. Here, for the first time, we introduce (the green) dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as a novel nucleation trigger for perovskite films combining, uniquely, high coordination and high vapor pressure. More precisely, DMS coordinates more strongly than all currently used solvents, hence replacing them, including DMSO, effectively during film formation. Crucially, DMS also has among the highest vapor pressures reported in literature, thus effectively leaving the thin film shortly after formation. This gives DMS a universal scope: DMS replaces other solvents by coordinating more strongly and removes itself once the film formation is finished. To demonstrate this novel coordination chemistry approach, we process MAPbI3 PSCs, typically dissolved in hard&#8208;to&#8208;remove (and green) DMSO achieving 21.6% efficiency, among the highest reported efficiencies for this system. To confirm the universality of our strategy, we tested DMS for FAPbI3 as another composition, which showed higher efficiency of 23.5% compared to 20.9% for fabricated device with CB. This work provides a universal strategy to control perovskite crystallization using coordination chemistry heralding the revival of perovskite compositions with pure DMSO, such as MAPbI3.

         <title>Tailoring the Amphiphilic Structure of Zwitterionic AIE Photosensitizers to Boost Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) for thorough cancer treatment is hindered by the limited generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with short lifetime from photosensitizers, PDT&#8208;induced antitumor immune response remedies the defects.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) for thorough cancer treatment is hindered by the limited generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with short lifetime from photosensitizers, PDT-induced antitumor immune response remedies the defects. Previous studies showed that inducing immunogenic cell deaths is an attractive approach to activate antitumor immunity, which confers a robust adjuvanticity to dying cancer cells. In this work, amphiphilic luminogens with aggregation-induced emission characteristics (AIEgens) are rationally designed and synthesized. By modulating the hydrophobic &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-bridge and zwitterionic functional groups, these AIEgens exhibited tunable organelle specificity to lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane and enhanced ROS generation ability. Notably, the membrane-targeting AIEgen namely TPS-2 induced cell death and membrane rupture via PDT to facilitate the release of antigens and activation of immune cells. Furthermore, the size-controlled TPS-2 nanoaggregates were found to serve as an adjuvant, promoting antigen accumulation and delivery to sufficiently boost the in vivo antitumor immunity by only one dose injection in a prophylactic tumor vaccination model. This work thus provides new insights into optimizing AIE photosensitizers via a hydrophobicity-hydrophilicity balance strategy for evoking an antitumor immunity and directly suppressing the distanced tumor.

         <title>Precision covalent organic frameworks for surface nucleation control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Unwanted accumulation of ice and lime scale crystals on surfaces is a long&#8208;standing challenge with major economic and sustainability implications. Passive inhibition of icing and scaling by liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces are often inadequate, susceptible to surface failure under harsh conditions and unsuitable for long&#8208;term/real&#8208;life usages. Such surfaces often require a multiplicity of additional features such as optical transparency, robust impact resistance and ability to prevent contamination from low surface energy liquids. Unfortunately, most promising advances have relied on using perfluoro compounds (PFCs) which are bio&#8208;persistent and/or highly toxic. Here we&#160;show that organic, reticulated mesoporous frameworks, i.e., covalent organic frameworks (COFs), may offer a solution. By exploiting simple and scalable synthesis of defect&#8208;free COFs and rational post&#8208;synthetic functionalization, we&#160;prepared nanocoatings with precision nanoporosity (morphology) that can inhibit nucleation at molecular level without compromising the related contamination prevention and robustness. The results offer a simple strategy to exploit nanoconfinement effect, which remarkably delay nucleation of ice and scale formation on surfaces. Ice nucleation is suppressed down to &#8208;28&#160;&#176;C, scale formation is avoided for &gt;2 weeks in super saturated conditions and jets of organic solvents impacting at Weber numbers &gt;&#160;105 resisted with surfaces that also offers optical transparency (&gt;92%).

         <title>Enhanced Hot&#8208;Phonon Bottleneck Effect on Slowing Hot Carrier Cooling in Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots With Alloyed A&#8208;Site</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A deep understanding of the effect of the A&#8208;site cation cross&#8208;exchange on the hot&#8208;carrier relaxation dynamics in perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) has profound implications on the further development of disruptive photovoltaic technologies. In this study, we investigated the hot carrier cooling kinetics of pure FAPbI3, MAPbI3, CsPbI3 and alloyed FA0.5MA0.5PbI3, FA0.5Cs0.5PbI3, and MA0.5Cs0.5PbI3 QDs using ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The lifetimes of the initial fast cooling stage (&lt;1&#160;ps) of all the organic cation&#8208;containing PQDs were shorter than those of the CsPbI3 QDs, as verified by the electron&#8208;phonon coupling strength extracted from the temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra. The lifetimes of the slow cooling stage of the alloyed PQDs were longer under illumination greater than 1 sun, which was ascribed to the introduction of co&#8208;vibrational optical phonon modes in the alloyed PQDs. This facilitated efficient acoustic phonon upconversion and enhanced the hot&#8208;phonon bottleneck effect, as demonstrated by first&#8208;principles calculations.

         <title>Flagella of Tumor&#8208;targeting Bacteria Trigger Local Hemorrhage to Reprogram Tumor&#8208;associated Macrophages for Improved Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) exhibit an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype and lead to failure of antitumor therapy. Infiltrated erythrocytes during hemorrhage have been recognized as a promising strategy for polarizing TAMs. However, novel materials that precisely induce tumor hemorrhage without affecting normal coagulation still face challenges. Here, tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria (flhDC VNP) are genetically constructed to realize precise tumor hemorrhage. flhDC VNP colonize the tumor and overexpress flagella during proliferation. The flagella promote the expression of TNF&#945;, which induces local tumor hemorrhage. Infiltrated erythrocytes during the hemorrhage temporarily polarize macrophages to M1 subtype. In the presence of artesunate, this short&#8208;lived polarization is transformed into a sustained polarization because artesunate and heme form a complex which continuously produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, the flagella of active tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria may open up new strategies for reprogramming TAMs and improving antitumor therapy.

         <title>Microscale Imaging of Thermal Conductivity Suppression at Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Grain&#8208;boundary engineering is an effective strategy to tune the thermal conductivity of materials, leading to improved performance in thermoelectric, thermal&#8208;barrier coatings and thermal management applications. Despite the central importance to thermal transport, a clear understanding of how grain boundaries modulate the microscale heat flow is missing, owing to the scarcity of local investigations. Here, thermal imaging of individual grain boundaries is demonstrated in thermoelectric SnTe via spatially resolved frequency&#8208;domain thermoreflectance. Measurements with microscale resolution reveal local suppressions in thermal conductivity at grain boundaries. Also, the grain&#8208;boundary thermal resistance &#8211; extracted employing a Gibbs excess approach &#8211; is found correlating with the grain&#8208;boundary misorientation angle. Extracting thermal properties, including thermal boundary resistances, from microscale imaging can provide comprehensive understanding of how microstructure affects heat transport, crucially impacting the materials design of high&#8208;performance thermal&#8208;management and energy&#8208;conversion devices.

         <title>Homogeneous Phase Distribution in Q&#8208;2D Perovskites via Co&#8208;assembly of Spacer Cations for Efficient Light&#8208;emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q&#8208;2D) perovskites are promising candidates applied in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, delicate control on crystallization kinetics is needed to suppress severe phase segregation and wide phase distribution. Here, we investigate the crystallization kinetics of Q&#8208;2D perovskites via in&#8208;situ absorbance spectroscopy and for the first time find the multiphase distribution is governed by the arrangement, rather than diffusion, of spacer cations at nucleation stage, which associate with its assembling ability determined by molecular configuration. We conceive a &#8220;co&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy by combining co&#8208;cations with different configuration characteristics, where bulky cations disturb the assembling between slender cations and lead&#8208;bromide sheet, contributing to homogeneous emitting phase with effective passivation. Correspondingly, in the phenylethylammonium (PEA+)&#8208;based Q&#8208;2D perovskites (&lt;n&gt; = 3), homogeneous phase distribution is achieved by incorporating co&#8208;cation triphenylmethaneammonium (TPMA+), the branching terminals of which suppress cations assembling into low&#8208;n phases and afford adequate cations as passivating ligands. Therefore, the champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the LED device reach 23.9%, which is among the highest performance of green Q&#8208;2D perovskite LEDs. This work reveals that arrangement of spacer cations is key factor that determine the crystallization kinetics in Q&#8208;2D perovskites, providing further guidance on the molecular design and phase modulation of Q&#8208;2D perovskites.

         <title>Fibrous Zr&#8208;MOF Nanozyme Aerogels with Macro&#8208;Nanoporous Structure for Enhanced Catalytic Hydrolysis of Organophosphate Toxins</title>

Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with Lewis acid catalytic sites, such as zirconium&#8208;based MOFs (Zr&#8208;MOFs), comprise a growing class of phosphatase&#8208;like nanozymes that can degrade toxic organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents. Rationally engineering and shaping MOFs from as&#8208;synthesized powders into hierarchically porous monoliths is essential for their use in emerging applications, such as filters for air and water purification and personal protection gear. However, several challenges still limit the production of practical MOF composites, including the need for sophisticated reaction conditions, low MOF catalyst loadings in the resulting composites, and poor accessibility to MOF&#8208;based active sites. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a rapid synthesis method to introduce Zr&#8208;MOF nanozyme coating into cellulose nanofibers, resulting in the formation of processable monolithic aerogel composites with high MOF loadings. These composites contain Zr&#8208;MOF nanozymes embedded in the structure, and hierarchical macro&#8208;micro porosity enables excellent accessibility to catalytic active sites. This multi&#8208;faceted rational design strategy, including the selection of a MOF with many catalytic sites, fine&#8208;tuning the coating morphology, and the fabrication of a hierarchically structured monolithic aerogel, renders synergistic effects towards the efficient continuous hydrolytic detoxification of organophosphorus&#8208;based nerve agent simulants and pesticides from contaminated water.

         <title>Mechanoresponsive drug release from a flexible, tissue&#8208;adherent, hybrid hydrogel actuator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft robotic technologies for therapeutic biomedical applications require conformal and atraumatic tissue coupling that is amenable to dynamic loading for effective drug delivery or tissue stimulation. This intimate and sustained contact offers vast therapeutic opportunity for localized drug release. This paper introduces a new class of hybrid hydrogel actuator (HHA) that facilitates enhanced drug delivery. The multi&#8208;material soft actuator can elicit tunable mechanoresponsive release of charged drug from its alginate/acrylamide hydrogel layer with temporal control. Dosing control parameters include actuation magnitude, frequency, and duration. The actuator can safely adhere to tissue via a flexible, drug permeable adhesive bond that can withstand dynamic device actuation. Conformal adhesion of the hybrid hydrogel actuator to tissue leads to the improved mechanoresponsive spatial delivery of drug. Future integration of this hybrid hydrogel actuator with other soft robotic assistive technologies could enable a synergistic multi&#8208;pronged treatment approach for the treatment of disease.

         <title>Inhalable capsular polysaccharide&#8208;camouflaged gallium&#8208;polyphenol nanoparticles enhance lung cancer chemotherapy by depleting local lung microbiota</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Local lung microbiota is closely associated with lung tumorigenesis and therapeutic response. It is found that lung commensal microbes induce chemoresistance in lung cancer by directly inactivating therapeutic drugs via biotransformation. Accordingly, an inhalable microbial capsular polysaccharide (CP)&#8208;camouflaged gallium&#8208;polyphenol metal&#8208;organic network (MON) is designed to eliminate lung microbiota and thereby abrogate microbe&#8208;induced chemoresistance. As a substitute for iron uptake, Ga3+ released from MON acts as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; to disrupt bacterial iron respiration, effectively inactivating multiple microbes. Moreover, CP cloaks endow MON with reduced immune clearance by masquerading as normal host&#8208;tissue molecules, significantly increasing residence time in lung tissue for enhanced antimicrobial efficacy. In multiple lung cancer mice models, microbe&#8208;induced drug degradation is remarkably inhibited when drugs are delivered by antimicrobial MON. Tumor growth is sufficiently suppressed and mouse survival is prolonged. Our&#160;work develops a novel microbiota&#8208;depleted nano&#8208;strategy to overcome chemoresistance in lung cancer by inhibiting local microbial inactivation of therapeutic drugs.

         <title>Ultrafast Subpicosecond Magnetisation Of a Two&#8208;Dimensional Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Strong spin&#8208;charge interactions in several ferromagnets are expected to lead to subpicosecond (sub&#8208;ps) magnetisation of the magnetic materials through control of the carrier characteristics via electrical means, which is essential for ultrafast spin&#8208;based electronic devices. Thus far, ultrafast control of magnetisation has been realized by optically pumping a large number of carriers into the d or f orbitals of a ferromagnet; however, it is extremely challenging to be implemented by electrical gating. This work demonstrates a new method for sub&#8208;ps magnetisation manipulation, called wavefunction engineering, in which w&#160;e control only the spatial distribution (wavefunction) of s (or p) electrons and require no change in the total carrier density. Using a ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) (In,Fe)As quantum well (QW), w&#160;e observe instant enhancement, as fast as 600 fs, of the magnetisation upon irradiating a femtosecond (fs) laser pulse. O&#160;ur analysis shows that the instant enhancement of the magnetisation is induced when the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) electron wavefunctions (WFs) in the FMS QW are rapidly moved by a photo&#8208;Dember electric field formed by an asymmetric distribution of the photocarriers. Because this WF engineering method can be equivalently implemented by applying a gate electric field, o&#160;ur results open a new way to realise ultrafast magnetic storage and spin&#8208;based information processing in present electronic systems.

         <title>Top&#8208;down fabrication of atomic patterns in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale engineering typically involves bottom&#8208;up approaches, leveraging parameters such as temperature, partial pressures, and chemical affinity to promote spontaneous arrangement of atoms. These parameters are applied globally, resulting in atomic scale features scattered probabilistically throughout the material. In a top&#8208;down approach, different regions of the material are exposed to different parameters resulting in structural changes varying on the scale of the resolution. In this work, we combine the application of global and local parameters in an aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to demonstrate atomic scale precision patterning of atoms in twisted bilayer graphene. The focused electron beam is used to define attachment points for foreign atoms through the controlled ejection of carbon atoms from the graphene lattice. The sample environment is staged with nearby source materials, such that the sample temperature can induce migration of the source atoms across the sample surface. Under these conditions, the electron&#8208;beam (top&#8208;down) enables carbon atoms in the graphene to be replaced spontaneously by diffusing adatoms (bottom&#8208;up). Using image&#8208;based feedback&#8208;control, arbitrary patterns of atoms and atom clusters are attached to the twisted bilayer graphene with limited human interaction. The role of substrate temperature on adatom and vacancy diffusion is explored by first&#8208;principles simulations.

         <title>Folding Double&#8208;Stranded DNA into Designed Shapes with Triplex&#8208;Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The compaction and organization of genomic DNA is a central mechanism in eukaryotic cells, but engineered architectural control over double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) is notably challenging. Here, long dsDNA templates are folded into designed shapes via triplex&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly. Triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) bind purines in dsDNA via normal or reverse Hoogsteen interactions. In the triplex origami methodology, these non&#8208;canonical interactions are programmed to compact dsDNA (linear or plasmid) into well&#8208;defined objects, which demonstrate a variety of structural features: hollow and raster&#8208;filled, single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layered, with custom curvatures and geometries, and featuring lattice&#8208;free, square&#8208;, or honeycomb&#8208;pleated internal arrangements. Surprisingly, the length of integrated and free&#8208;standing dsDNA loops can be modulated with near&#8208;perfect efficiency; from hundreds down to only six bp (2&#160;nm). The inherent rigidity of dsDNA promotes structural robustness and non&#8208;periodic structures of almost 25.000&#160;nt are therefore formed with fewer unique starting materials, compared to other DNA&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly methods. Densely triplexed structures also resist degradation by DNase I. Triplex&#8208;mediated dsDNA folding is methodologically straightforward and orthogonal to Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;based methods. Moreover, it enables unprecedented spatial control over dsDNA templates.

         <title>Paper&#8208;Based Laser&#8208;Pyrolyzed Electrofluidics: An Electrochemical Platform for Capillary&#8208;Driven Diagnostic Bioassays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile electrochemical platform that integrates paper&#8208;based microfluidics and laser&#8208;pyrolyzed permeable electronics is introduced. This platform combines efficient electrochemical sensing with rapid capillary wicking, making it suitable for a wide range of capillary&#8208;driven biosensing assays. The devices are constructed using readily available digital fabrication tools, providing exceptional adaptability for widespread implementation.








Abstract
Microfluidic paper&#8208;based analytical devices (&#181;PADs) are indispensable tools for disease diagnostics. The integration of electronic components into &#181;PADs enables new device functionalities and facilitates the development of complex quantitative assays. Unfortunately, current electrode fabrication methods often hinder capillary flow, considerably restricting &#181;PAD design architectures. Here, laser&#8208;induced graphenization is presented as an approach to fabricate porous electrodes embedded into cellulose paper. The resulting electrodes not only have high conductivity and electrochemical activity, but also retain wetting properties for capillary transport. Paper&#8208;based electrofluidics, including a lateral flow device for injection analysis of alkaline phosphatase in serum and a vertical flow device for quantitative detection of HPV16 with a CRISPR&#8208;based assay are demonstrated. It is expected that this platform will streamline the development of diagnostic devices that combine the operational simplicity of colorimetric lateral flow tests with the added benefits and possibilities offered by electronic signaling.

Abstract
The explosive growth of the information era has put forward urgent requirements for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;speed and extremely efficient computations. In direct contrary to charge&#8208;based computations, spintronics aims to use spins as information carriers for data storage, transmission, and decoding, to help fully realize electronic device miniaturization and high integration for next&#8208;generation computing technologies. Currently, many novel spintronic materials have been developed with unique properties and multi&#8208;functionalities, including organic semiconductors (OSCs), organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs), and two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs). These materials are useful to fulfil the demand for developing diverse and advanced spintronic devices. Herein, we systematically reviewed these promising materials for advanced spintronic applications. Due to the distinct chemical and physical structures of OSCs, OIHPs, and 2DMs, their spintronic properties (spin transport and spin manipulation) were discussed separately. In addition, some multifunctionalities due to photoelectric and chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) were overviewed, including the spin&#8208;filter effect, spin&#8208;photovoltaics, spin&#8208;light emitting devices, and spin&#8208;transistor functions. Subsequently, we presented challenges and future perspectives of using these multifunctional materials for the development of advanced spintronics.

         <title>A Deformable Additive on Defects Passivation and Phase Segregation Inhibition Enables the Efficiency of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The defects and phase segregation in perovskite will significantly reduce the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a deformable coumarin was employed as a multifunctional additive for formamidinium&#8208;cesium (FA&#8208;Cs) perovskite. During the annealing process of perovskite, the partial decomposition of coumarin passivates the Pb2+, iodine, and organic cation defects. Additionally, coumarin can affect colloidal size distributions, resulting in relatively large grain size and good crystallinity of target perovskite film. Hence, the carrier extraction/transport can be promoted, trap&#8208;assisted recombination is reduced, and energy levels are optimized in target perovskite films. Furthermore, the coumarin treatment can significantly release the residual stress. As a result, the champion PCEs of 23.18% and 24.14% are obtained for Br&#8208;rich (FA0.88Cs0.12PbI2.64Br0.36) and Br&#8208;poor (FA0.96Cs0.04PbI2.8Br0.12) based devices, respectively. The flexible PSCs based on Br&#8208;poor perovskite exhibit an excellent PCE of 23.13%, one of the highest values for flexible PSCs reported to date. Due to the inhibition of phase segregation, the target devices exhibit excellent thermal and light stability. This work provides new insights into the additive engineering of passivating defects, stress relief, and inhibition of phase segregation of perovskite films, offering a reliable method to develop state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <title>An Exciplex&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emission Pathway for Solution&#8208;State Electrochemiluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) allows the design of unique light&#8208;emitting devices that use organic semiconductors in a liquid or gel state, which allows for simpler and more sustainable device fabrication and facilitates unconventional device form&#8208;factors. Compared to solid&#8208;state organic LEDs, ECL devices (ECLDs) have attracted less attention due to their currently much lower performance. ECLD operation is typically based on an annihilation pathway that involves electron transfer between reduced and oxidized luminophore species; the intermediate radical ions produced during annihilation dramatically reduce device stability. Here, we mitigate the effects of radical ions by using an exciplex formation pathway and demonstrate a remarkable improvement in luminance, luminous efficacy, and operational lifetime. Electron donor and acceptor molecules are dissolved at high concentrations and recombine as an exciplex upon their oxidization/reduction. The exciplex then transfers its energy to a nearby dye, allowing the dye to emit light without undergoing oxidation/reduction. Furthermore, by applying a mesoporous TiO2 electrode, we increase the contact area and hence the number of molecules participating in ECL, thereby obtaining devices with a very high luminance of 3,790&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a 30&#8208;fold improved operational lifetime. This study paves the way for the development of ECLDs into highly versatile light sources.

         <title>Large anomalous Nernst effects at room temperature in Fe3Pt thin films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Heat current in ferromagnets can generate a transverse electric voltage perpendicular to magnetization, which is known as anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). ANE originates intrinsically from the combination of large Berry curvature and density of states near the Fermi energy EF. It shows technical advantages over conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect in converting waste heat to electricity due to its unique transverse geometry. However, materials showing giant ANE especially at zero magnetic field, remain to be explored. Herein, we report the discovery of a large ANE thermopower of Syx &#8776; 2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in ferromagnetic Fe3Pt epitaxial films, which also shows a giant transverse thermoelectric conductivity of &#945;yx &#8776; 4 A K&#8722;1m&#8722;1 and a remarkable coercive field of about 1300&#160;Oe. Besides the consequent strong magnetic anisotropy, our theoretical analysis reveals that the strong spin&#8208;orbit interaction in addition to the hybridization between Pt 5d and Fe 3d electrons leads to a series of distinct energy gaps and large Berry curvature in the Brillouin zone, which is the key for the large ANE. These results highlight the important roles of both Berry curvature and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in achieving large ANE at zero magnetic field, providing pathways to explore materials with giant transverse thermoelectric effect without external magnetic field.

Surface acoustic wave (SAW) provides a promising platform to study spin&#8208;phonon coupling, which can be achieved by SAW&#8208;driven ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) for efficiently acoustic manipulation of spin. Although the magneto&#8208;elastic effective field model has achieved great success in describing SAW&#8208;driven FMR, the magnitude of the effective field acting on the magnetization induced by SAW still remain hard to access. Here, by integrating ferromagnetic stripes with SAW devices, we report direct&#8208;current detection for SAW&#8208;driven FMR based on electrical rectification. By analyzing FMR rectified voltage, we straightforwardly characterize and extract the effective fields, which exhibits advantages of better integration compatibility and lower cost than traditional methods such as vector network analyzer based techniques. Large nonreciprocal rectified voltage is obtained, which is attributed to the coexistence of in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane effective fields. The effective fields can be modulated by controlling the longitudinal and shear strains within the films to achieve almost 100% nonreciprocity ratio, demonstrating the potential for electrical switches. Besides the fundamental significance, our finding provides a unique opportunity for designable spin acousto&#8208;electronic device and its convenient signal readout.

         <title>On the mechanism of solvents catalyzed structural transformation in metal halide perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal halide perovskites show the capability of performing structural transformation, allowing the formation of functional heterostructures. Unfortunately, the elusive mechanism governing these transformations limits their technological application. Herein, we&#160;unravel the mechanism of 2D&#8208;3D structural transformation, and enlighten that is catalyzed by solvents. By combining a spatial&#8208;temporal cation interdiffusivity simulation with experimental findings, we&#160;validate that, protic solvents foster the dissociation degree of formadinium iodide (FAI) via dynamic hydrogen bond, then the stronger hydrogen bond of phenylethylamine (PEA) cation with selected solvents compared to dissociated FA cation facilitates 2D&#8208;3D transformation from (PEA)2PbI4 to FAPbI3. We&#160;discover that, the energy barrier of PEA out&#8208;diffusion and the lateral transition barrier of inorganic slab are diminished. Importantly, for 2D films, the protic solvents catalyze grain centers (GCs) and grain boundaries (GBs) transforming into 3D phases and quasi&#8208;2D phases, respectively. While in the solvent&#8208;free case, GCs transform into 3D&#8208;2D heterostructures along the direction perpendicular to the substrate, most GBs evolve into 3D phases. Finally, memristor devices fabricated using the transformed films with/without solvent&#8208;catalysis uncover that, GBs composed of 3D phases are more prone to the vertical ion migration. This work elucidates the fundamental mechanism of structural transformation, allowing their use to fabricate complex heterostructures.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Bridged Copper&#8208;Iron Atomic Pair as Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites for Boosting Electrocatalytic NO Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) is a promising approach to NH3 synthesis. However, due to the lack of efficient electrocatalysts, the performance of electrocatalytic NO reduction reaction (NORR) is far from satisfactory. Herein, we report that an atomic copper&#8208;iron dual&#8208;site electrocatalyst bridged by an axial oxygen atom (O&#8208;Fe&#8208;N6&#8208;Cu) is anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CuFe DS/NC) for NORR. The CuFe DS/NC can significantly enhance the electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis performance (Faraday efficiency, 90%; yield rate, 112.52&#160;&#956;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) at &#8208;0.6&#160;V versus RHE, which is dramatically higher than the corresponding Cu single&#8208;atom, Fe single&#8208;atom and all NORR single&#8208;atom catalysts in the literature so far. Moreover, an assembled proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Zn&#8208;NO battery using CuFe DS/NC as the cathode outputs a power density of 2.30&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and NH3 yield of 45.52&#160;&#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. The theoretical calculation result indicates that bimetallic sites can promote electrocatalytic NORR by changing the rate&#8208;determining step and accelerating the protonation process. This work provides a flexible strategy for the efficient sustainable NH3 synthesis.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Electropolymerized Three&#8208;Dimensional Microporous Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin Nanofilm for Highly Effective Molecular Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) based on molecular catalysts, e.g., cobalt porphyrin, is a promising approach to enhance carbon cycle and mitigate climate crisis. However, the electrocatalytic performance and accurate evaluations remains problems because of either the low loading amount or the low utilization rate of the electroactive CoN4 sites. W e herein synthesized a monomer, cobalt(II)&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(3,5&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)porphyrin (CoP), electropolymerized it onto the crosslinked carbon nanotubes (CNTs) networks, affording a molecular electrocatalyst of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microporous nanofilm (EP&#8208;CoP, 2&#8764;3&#160;nm thickness) with highly dispersed CoN4 sites. The new electrocatalyst shortens the electron transfer pathway, accelerates the redox kinetics of CoN4 sites and improves the durability in the electrocatalytic CO2RR. From the intrinsic redox behavior of CoN4 sites, the effective utilization rate is obtained as 13.1%, much higher than that of the monomer assembled electrode (5.8%), and the durability is also promoted dramatically (&gt; 40&#160;h) in a H&#8208;type cell. In a commercial flow cell, EP&#8208;CoP can achieve a faradic efficiency for CO (FECO) over 92% at an overpotential of 160&#160;mV. At a higher overpotential of 620&#160;mV, the working current density can reach 310&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a high FECO of 98.6%, representing the best performance for electrodeposited molecular porphyrin electrocatalysts.

         <title>Thermally Stable Red&#8208;Emitting Oxide Ceramics for Laser Lighting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu2+&#8208;activated oxide&#8208;based bulk ceramics with red emission are reported. Cation&#8208;ordering in the double perovskites Sr3TaO5.5 and Sr3NbO5.5 contributes to the high external quantum efficiency and excellent thermal stability. It is further demonstrated that red&#8208;emitting Sr3TaO5.5:Eu2+ ceramic is a highly promising candidate for future high&#8208;power white laser lighting with a high luminous flux of 1115&#160;lm and ideal CRI (&#8776;90).








Abstract
Laser&#8208;driven phosphor&#8208;converted white light sources are highly desirable for their unprecedented energy efficiency and lighting quality. However, important challenges remain due to a lack of efficient and stable red&#8208;emitting materials. Here Eu2+&#8208;activated oxide&#8208;based double perovskites are explored as red emitters with thermally stable photoluminescence. Sr3TaO5.5:Eu2+ ceramics exhibit a red emission band peaking at 620&#160;nm upon blue laser pumping owing to the Eu2+ occupation at highly ordered substitutional lattice sites. A constructed laser&#8208;driven white light wheel under an incident power density of 19.2&#160;W&#160;mm&#8722;2 presents a record luminous flux of 1115&#160;lm with an excellent color rendering index of 90. This study invigorates the development of Eu2+&#8208;activated oxide&#8208;based ceramics with thermally stable luminescence for laser&#8208;pumped lighting and display applications.

         <title>Metasurfaces&#8208;Driven Hyperspectral Imaging via Multiplexed Plasmonic Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexed metasurface&#8211;driven plasmonic resonance energy transfer (PRET) hyperspectral imaging is created to probe biological light&#8211;matter interactions. Pixelated metasurfaces with engineered scattering spectra over the entire visible range, by the precision nanoengineering of gap plasmon and optical effects of metasurface clusters, are designed, fabricated, characterized by their full dark&#8208;field coloration, and are demonstrated for multiplexed real&#8208;time molecular sensing and imaging methods.








Abstract
Obtaining single&#8211;molecular&#8211;level fingerprints of biomolecules and electron&#8211;transfer dynamic imaging in living cells are critically demanded in postgenomic life sciences and medicine. However, the possible solution called plasmonic resonance energy transfer (PRET) spectroscopy remains challenging due to the fixed scattering spectrum of a plasmonic nanoparticle and limited multiplexing. Here, multiplexed metasurfaces&#8208;driven PRET hyperspectral imaging, to probe biological light&#8211;matter interactions, is reported. Pixelated metasurfaces with engineered scattering spectra are first designed over the entire visible range by the precision nanoengineering of gap plasmon and grating effects of metasurface clusters. Pixelated metasurfaces are created and their full dark&#8208;field coloration is optically characterized with visible color palettes and high&#8208;resolution color printings of the art pieces. Furthermore, three different biomolecules (i.e., chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and cytochrome c) are applied on metasurfaces for color palettes to obtain selective molecular fingerprint imaging due to the unique biological light&#8211;matter interactions with application&#8208;specific biomedical metasurfaces. This metasurface&#8208;driven PRET hyperspectral imaging will open up a new path for multiplexed real&#8208;time molecular sensing and imaging methods.

         <title>Transport Layer Engineering Toward Lower Threshold for Perovskite Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of transport layers on perovskite lasing actions are investigated. It is find that a selected hole&#8208;transport layer (PTAA) can reduce the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold of perovskite by suppressing hot&#8208;hole&#8208;induced Auger loss. An independent excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;influenced ASE threshold experiment further verifies the discovery.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;transport layers are essential for achieving electrically pumped perovskite lasers. However, their role in perovskite lasing is not fully understood. Here, the role of charge&#8208;transport layers on the lasing actions of perovskite films is explored by investigating the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) thresholds. A largely reduced ASE threshold and enhanced ASE intensity is demonstrated by introducing an additional hole transport layer poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA). It is shown that the key role of the PTAA layer is to accelerate the hot&#8208;carrier cooling process by extracting holes in perovskites. With reduced hot holes, the Auger recombination loss is largely suppressed, resulting in decreased ASE threshold. This argument is further supported by the fact that the ASE threshold can be further reduced from 25.7 to 7.2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 upon switching the pumping wavelength from 400 to 500&#160;nm to directly avoid excess hot&#8208;hole generation. This work exemplifies how to further reduce the ASE threshold with transport layer engineering through hot&#8208;hole manipulation. This is critical to maintaining the excellent gain properties of perovskites when integrating them into electrical devices, paving the way for electrically pumped perovskite lasers.

         <title>Life&#8208;Cycle Assessment of Ti3C2Tx MXene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A life&#8208;cycle assessment (LCA) of Ti3C2Tx MXene as an EMI&#8208;shielding coating is presented. MXene synthesis, including laboratory&#8208;scale systems and precursor generation utilizing TiO2, is examined for energy demand and environmental impacts. Findings demonstrate that laboratory electricity usage has the greatest impact on MXene production. Sustainable MXene synthesis toward the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of this intriguing 2D material is discussed.








Abstract
MXenes, 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have been investigated for diverse applications since their discovery; however, their life&#8208;cycle assessment (LCA) has not been studied. Here, a &#8220;cradle to gate&#8221; LCA is performed to assess the cumulative energy demand (CED) and environmental impacts of lab&#8208;scale synthesis of Ti3C2Tx, the most researched MXene composition. Electromagnetic interface (EMI) shielding is selected as it is one of MXenes' most promising applications and LCA of Ti3C2Tx synthesis is compared to aluminum and copper foils, two typical EMI&#8208;shielding materials. Two laboratory&#8208;scale MXene synthesis systems&#8212;gram and kilogram batches&#8212;are examined. The CED and environmental implications of Ti3C2Tx synthesis are investigated based on its precursor production, selective etching, delamination processes, laboratory location, energy mix, and raw material type. These&#160;results show that laboratory electricity usage for the synthesis processes accounts for &gt;70% of the environmental impacts. Manufacturing 1.0&#160;kg of industrial&#8208;scale aluminum and copper foil releases 23.0&#160;kg and 8.75&#160;kg of CO2, respectively, while 1.0&#160;kg of lab&#8208;scale MXene synthesis releases 428.10&#160;kg. Chemical usage is less impactful than electricity, which suggests that&#160;recycled resources and renewable energy can make MXene synthesis more sustainable. Understanding MXene LCA helps the industrialization of this material.

         <title>Surface Ligand Engineering Ruthenium Nanozyme Superior to Horseradish Peroxidase for Enhanced Immunoassay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modification can engineer charge transfer between Ru and ligands and facilitate intermediate radicals to react with colorimetric substrate, which significantly improves the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Ru nanozymes superior to horseradish peroxidase. Following such a mechanism, polystyrene&#8208;sulfonate&#8208;modified Ru nanozymes can be used as an enzyme alternative in enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay to improve detection sensitivity up to 140&#8208;fold, validated with human alpha&#8208;fetoprotein.








Abstract
Nanozymes have great potential to be used as an alternative to natural enzymes in a variety of fields. However, low catalytic activity compared with natural enzymes limits their practical use. It is still challenging to design nanozymes comparable to their natural counterparts in terms of the specific activity. In this study, a surface engineering strategy is employed to improve the specific activity of Ru nanozymes using charge&#8208;transferrable ligands such as polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). PSS&#8208;modified Ru nanozyme exhibits a peroxidase&#8208;like specific activity of up to 2820&#160;U&#160;mg&#8722;1, which is twice that of horseradish peroxidase (1305&#160;U&#160;mg&#8722;1). Mechanism studies suggest that PSS readily accepts negative charge from Ru, thus reducing the affinity between Ru and &#183;OH. Importantly, the modified Ru&#8208;peroxidase&#160;nanozyme is successfully used to develop an immunoassay for human alpha&#8208;fetoprotein and achieves a 140&#8208;fold increase in detection sensitivity compared with traditional horseradish&#8208;peroxidase&#8208;based enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay. Therefore, this work provides a feasible route to design nanozymes with high specific activity that meets the practical use as an alternative to natural enzymes.

         <title>Gastrointestinal&#8208;Peristalsis&#8208;Inspired Hydrogel Actuators for NIR&#8208;Controlled Transport of Viscous Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the gastrointestinal peristalsis of mammals to propel viscous chyme (viscosity up to 2000 mPa s), a new type of double&#8208;layered tubular liquid actuators is designed and demonstrated. Under the control of applied NIR light, highly viscous liquids ranging from &#8776;1000 mPa s to &gt;80&#160;000 mPa s can be efficiently propelled to move directionally.








Abstract
Liquid transportation is fundamentally important in microfluidics, water collection, biosensing, and printing, and has attracted enormous research interest in the past decades. However, despite substantial progress, it remains a big challenge to achieve the controlled transport of viscous liquids (&gt;100 mPa s) commonly existing in daily life and the chemical industry. Inspired by the gastrointestinal peristalsis of mammalians that can efficiently transport viscous chyme (viscosity up to 2000 mPa s) by the synergistic combination of contraction driving force and lubrication, here, the design and construction of double&#8208;layered tubular hydrogel actuators for directional transport of highly viscous liquids ranging from &#8776;1000 mPa s to &gt;80&#160;000 mPa s under the control of an applied 808&#160;nm laser, which is attributed to the cooperation of outer layer contraction and water film lubrication of the inner layer, is reported. It is demonstrated that the actuators are capable of transporting polymerizing liquid whose viscosity significantly increases to &#8776;11&#160;182 mPa s in 2&#160;h. This work paves a new avenue toward directional transport of highly viscous liquids, which not only expands the research scope of liquid transportation, but will spur the design of new liquid actuators with potential applications in viscous&#8208;liquid&#8208;based microfluidics, artificial blood vessels, and soft robots.

Inspired by the gastrointestinal peristalsis of mammalians that can efficiently transport viscous chyme (viscosity up to 2000 mPa s) by the synergistic combination of contraction driving force and lubrication, here, the design and construction of double-layered tubular hydrogel actuators for directional transport of highly viscous liquids ranging from &#8776;1000 mPa s to &amp;gt;80&#160;000 mPa s under the control of an applied 808&#160;nm laser, which is attributed to the cooperation of outer layer contraction and water film lubrication of the inner layer, is reported. It is demonstrated that the actuators are capable of transporting polymerizing liquid whose viscosity significantly increases to &#8776;11&#160;182 mPa s in 2&#160;h. This work paves a new avenue toward directional transport of highly viscous liquids, which not only expands the research scope of liquid transportation, but will spur the design of new liquid actuators with potential applications in viscous-liquid-based microfluidics, artificial blood vessels, and soft robots.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gate&#8208;Controlled Magnetotransport and Electrostatic Modulation of Magnetism in 2D Magnetic Semiconductor CrPS4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to its large bandwidth, we&#160;identify layered semiconducting antiferromagnet CrPS4 as an ideal candidate to realize field&#8208;effect transistors based on 2D magnetic materials. Low&#8208;temperature measurements exhibit a gate&#8208;tunable magnetoconductance exceeding 5000%, as well as the ability to continuously tune electrostatically the boundaries between different states in the magnetic phase diagram of the material.








Abstract
Using field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) to explore atomically thin magnetic semiconductors with transport measurements is difficult, because the very narrow bands of most 2D&#160;magnetic semiconductors cause carrier localization, preventing transistor operation. Here, it is shown that exfoliated layers of CrPS4&#8212;a 2D layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor whose bandwidth approaches 1&#160;eV&#8212;allow the realization of FETs that operate properly down to cryogenic temperature. Using these devices, conductance measurements as a function of temperature and magnetic field are performed to determine the full magnetic phase diagram, which includes a spin&#8208;flop and a spin&#8208;flip phase. The magnetoconductance, which&#160;depends strongly on gate voltage, is determined. reaching values as high as 5000% near the threshold for electron conduction. The gate voltage also allows the magnetic states to be tuned, despite the relatively large thickness of the CrPS4 multilayers employed in the study. The results show the need to employ 2D magnetic semiconductors with sufficiently large bandwidth to realize properly functioning transistors, and identify a candidate material to realize a fully gate&#8208;tunable half&#8208;metallic&#160;conductor.

An integrated free&#8208;standing functional carbon positive electrode (named MSCG) with a &#8220;point&#8208;line&#8208;plane&#8221; hierarchical architecture at the practical level of ultrahigh mass&#8208;loading (&gt;50 mg cm&#8211;2) is developed for dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs). The DIBs with ultrahigh&#8208;mass&#8208;loading MSCG electrodes achieves a high energy density of 379 Wh kg&#8211;1 based on the mass of electrode materials, which offers a promising strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage devices.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) have been attracting great attention&#160;for the storage of stationary energy due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high working voltage. However, most reports on DIBs involve low&#8208;mass&#8208;loading electrodes (&lt;2.5&#160;mg), while the use of high mass&#8208;loading electrodes (&gt;10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), which are critical for practical application, is overlooked. Herein, an integrated free&#8208;standing functional carbon positive electrode (named MSCG) with a &#8220;point&#8208;line&#8208;plane&#8221; hierarchical architecture at the practical level of ultrahigh mass&#8208;loading (&gt;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) is developed for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density DIBs. The rationally designed microstructure and the advanced assembly method that is adopted produce a well&#8208;interconnected ion/electron transport channel in the MSCG electrode, which confers rapid ion/electron kinetic properties while maintaining good mechanical properties. Consequently, the DIBs with ultrahigh&#8208;mass&#8208;loading MSCG electrodes exhibits a high discharge capacity of 100.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C (loading mass of 50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and a long&#8208;term cycling performance with a capacity retention of 87.7% at 1 C after 500 cycles (loading mass of 23&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Moreover, the DIB with the ultrahigh&#8208;mass&#8208;loading positive electrode achieves a high energy density of 379&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the mass of electrode materials, the highest value recorded to date for any DIBs.

         <title>Pancreatic Tumor&#8208;Targeting Stemsome Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tumor&#8208;targeting strategy using stem cells without knowing the surface target receptors of the cancer cells is demonstrated for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, one of the intractable tumors that currently have no successful clinical strategy. The suggested promising strategy is especially effective for the treatment of other intractable tumors.








Abstract
Owing to the intrinsic ability of stem cells to target the tumor environment, stem&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;functionalized nanocarriers can target and load active anticancer drugs. In this work, a strategy that focuses on stem cells that self&#8208;target pancreatic cancer cells is developed. In particular, malignant deep tumors such as pancreatic cancer cells, one of the intractable tumors that currently have no successful clinical strategy, are available for targeting and destruction. By gaining the targeting ability of stem cells against pancreatic tumor cells, stem cell membranes can encapsulate nano&#8208;polylactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide loaded with doxorubicin to target and reduce deep pancreatic tumor tissues. Considering the lack of known target proteins on pancreatic tumor cells, the suggested platform technology can be utilized for targeting any malignant tumors in which surface target receptors are unavailable.

         <title>Post&#8208;Maturation Reinforcement of 3D&#8208;Printed Vascularized Cardiac Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for reinforcing fully cellularized tissue is shown. Vascularized cardiac tissues are printed. Following tissue maturation, a biocompatible, tissue&#8208;penetrating small&#8208;molecule is deployed to generate significant improvement in the tissue's mechanical properties.








Abstract
Despite advances in biomaterials engineering, a large gap remains between the weak mechanical properties that can be achieved with natural materials and the strength of synthetic materials. Here, a method is presented for reinforcing an engineered cardiac tissue fabricated from differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and an extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;based hydrogel in a manner that is fully biocompatible. The reinforcement occurs as a post&#8208;fabrication step, which allows for the use of 3D&#8208;printing technology to generate thick, fully cellularized, and vascularized cardiac tissues. After tissue assembly and during the maturation process in a soft hydrogel, a small, tissue&#8208;penetrating reinforcer is deployed, leading to a significant increase in the tissue's mechanical properties. The tissue's robustness is demonstrated by injecting the tissue in a simulated minimally invasive procedure and showing that the tissue is functional and undamaged at the nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and macroscales.

         <title>Coexistence of Both Localized Electronic States and Electron Gas at Rutile TiO2 Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;mobility electrons and localized electronic states can coexist at rutile TiO2 surfaces as induced through argon&#8208;ion irradiation. Specifically, the localized states form robust shallow in&#8208;gap states, leading to an exotic metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition when cooling below a critical temperature. Furthermore, the localized states can be reactivated into free electrons through thermal heating or with external electric fields.








Abstract
Localized electron polarons formed through the coupling of excess electrons and ionic vibrations play a key role in the functionalities of materials. However, the mechanism of the coexistence of delocalized electrons and localized polarons remains underexplored. Here, the discovery of high&#8208;mobility 2D electron gas at the rutile TiO2 surfaces through argon ion irradiation induced oxygen vacancies is reported. Strikingly, the electron gas forms localized electronic states at lower temperatures, resulting in an abrupt metal&#8211;insulator transition. Moreover, it is found that the low&#8208;temperature conductivity in the insulating state is dominated by excess free electrons with a high mobility of &#8776;103 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, whereas the carrier density is dramatically suppressed with decreasing temperature. Remarkably, it reveals that the application of an electric field can lead to a collapse of the localized states, resulting in a metallic state. These results reveal the strongly correlated/coupled nature between the localized electrons and high&#8208;mobility electrons and offer a new pathway to probe and harvest the exotic electron states at the complex oxide surfaces.

&lt;p&gt;High-mobility electrons and localized electronic states can coexist at rutile TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surfaces as induced through argon-ion irradiation. Specifically, the localized states form robust shallow in-gap states, leading to an exotic metal-to-insulator transition when cooling below a critical temperature. Furthermore, the localized states can be reactivated into free electrons through thermal heating or with external electric fields.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Localized electron polarons formed through the coupling of excess electrons and ionic vibrations play a key role in the functionalities of materials. However, the mechanism of the coexistence of delocalized electrons and localized polarons remains underexplored. Here, the discovery of high-mobility 2D electron gas at the rutile TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surfaces through argon ion irradiation induced oxygen vacancies is reported. Strikingly, the electron gas forms localized electronic states at lower temperatures, resulting in an abrupt metal&#8211;insulator transition. Moreover, it is found that the low-temperature conductivity in the insulating state is dominated by excess free electrons with a high mobility of &#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas the carrier density is dramatically suppressed with decreasing temperature. Remarkably, it reveals that the application of an electric field can lead to a collapse of the localized states, resulting in a metallic state. These results reveal the strongly correlated/coupled nature between the localized electrons and high-mobility electrons and offer a new pathway to probe and harvest the exotic electron states at the complex oxide surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Ionogels Tougher than Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastrong and superstretchable ionogels tougher than that of metals are produced through the synergy of force&#8208;induced crystallization and halometallate ionic liquid created supramolecular ionic networks. The prepared ionogels with environmental applicability and sustainability are expected to replace lightweight high&#8208;strength materials, such as plastics and rubbers in the applications of aerospace, robotics, and other fields.








Abstract
Common natural and synthetic high&#8208;strength materials (such as rubber, plastics, ceramics, and metals) undergo the occurrence of poor deformability. Achieving high strength and large deformation simultaneously is a huge challenge. Herein, high&#8208;strength ionogels are developed through the synergy of force&#8208;induced crystallization and halometallate ionic liquid created supramolecular ionic networks. The prepared poly(vinyl alcohol)/halometallate ionic liquid ionogels show excellent mechanical properties, including ultimate fracture stress (63.1&#160;&#177;&#160;2.1&#160;MPa), strain (5248&#160;&#177;&#160;113%), and unprecedented toughness (1947&#160;&#177;&#160;52&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), which is much higher than that of most metals and alloys. Furthermore, the ionogels can achieve reversibility by water to realize green recovery and restoration of damaged mechanical properties.

         <title>Quantum Size Effect to Induce Colossal High&#8208;Temperature Energy Storage Density and Efficiency in Polymer/Inorganic Cluster Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quantum size effect is utilized to modulate the band structure of aluminum oxide clusters. Based on the &#8220;site isolation&#8221; strategy, a polymer/aluminum oxide cluster composite with uniform dispersion of the inorganic phase is prepared with one&#8208;pot synthesis, which exhibits a colossal storage energy density of 6.8&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and ultrahigh efficiency over 95% at 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics need to operate at high temperatures to meet the demand of electrostatic energy storage in modern electronic and electrical systems. The polymer nanocomposite approach, an extensively proved strategy for performance improvement, encounters a bottleneck of reduced energy density and poor discharge efficiency beyond 150&#160;&#176;C. In this work, a polymer/metal oxide cluster composite prepared based on the &#8220;site isolation&#8221; strategy is reported. Capitalizing on the quantum size effect, the bandgap and surface defect states of the ultrasmall inorganic clusters (2.2&#160;nm diameter) are modulated to markedly differ from regular&#8208;sized nanoparticles. Experimental results in conjunction with computational simulation demonstrate that the presence of ultrasmall inorganic clusters can introduce more abundant, deeper traps in the composite dielectric with respect to conventional polymer/nanoparticle blends. Unprecedented high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, including colossal energy density (6.8&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3), ultrahigh discharge efficiency (95%) and superior stability at different electric field frequencies, are achieved in these polymer/cluster composites up to 200&#160;&#176;C. Along with the advantages in material preparation (inexpensive precursors and one&#8208;pot synthesis), such polymer/inorganic cluster composite approach is promising for high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage in practical power apparatus and electronic devices.

         <title>Probing the N&#233;el&#8208;Type Antiferromagnetic Order and Coherent Magnon&#8211;Exciton Coupling in Van Der Waals VPS3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#233;el&#8208;type AFM order of the VPS3 can break both spatial&#8208;inversion and time&#8208;reversal symmetries, which is verified by the magnetic&#8208;order&#8208;dependent second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). Accordingly, The SHG intensity shows a close correlation with the N&#233;el&#8208;type magnetic order under varying temperatures, and an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin orientation can be further determined based on the specific six&#8208;fold symmetry.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets have received intensive attention due to their terahertz resonance, multilevel magnetic&#8208;order states, and ultrafast spin dynamics. However, accurately identifying their magnetic configuration still remains a challenge owing to the lack of net magnetization and insensitivity to external fields. In this work, the N&#233;el&#8208;type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in 2D antiferromagnet VPS3 with the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy, which is demonstrated by the temperature&#8208;dependent spin&#8211;phonon coupling and second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), is experimentally probed. This long&#8208;range AFM order even persists at the ultrathin limit. Furthermore, strong interlayer exciton&#8211;magnon coupling (EMC) upon the N&#233;el&#8208;type AFM order is detected based on the monolayer WSe2/VPS3 heterostructure, which induces an enhanced excitonic state and further certifies the N&#233;el&#8208;type AFM order of VPS3. The discovery provides optical routes as the novel platform to study 2D antiferromagnets and promotes their potential applications in magneto&#8208;optics and opto&#8208;spintronic devices.

         <title>Hairy&#8208;Skin&#8208;Adaptive Viscoelastic Dry Electrodes for Long&#8208;Term Electrophysiological Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hairy&#8208;skin&#8208;adaptive viscoelastic dry electrode (VDE) with semiflowable, adhesive, moldable, stretchable, self&#8208;healing, and recyclable properties is prepared. The VDE fills skin wrinkles, bypasses hair, and shields against hair disturbance and strain&#8208;related motion artifacts, achieving stable electrocardiography monitoring with intense chest expansion, electromyography monitoring at large strain, and convenient electroencephalography monitoring.








Abstract
Long&#8208;term epidermal electrophysiological (EP) monitoring is crucial for disease diagnosis and human&#8211;machine synergy. The human skin is covered with hair that grows at an average rate of 0.3&#160;mm per day. This impedes a stable contact between the skin and dry epidermal electrodes, resulting in motion artifacts during ultralong&#8208;term EP monitoring. Therefore, accurate and high&#8208;quality EP signal detection remains challenging. To address this issue, a new solution&#8212;the hairy&#8208;skin&#8208;adaptive viscoelastic dry electrode (VDE) is reported. This innovative technology is capable of bypassing hair and filling into the skin wrinkles, leading to long&#8208;lasting and stable interface impedance. The VDE maintains a stable interface impedance for a remarkable period of 48 days and 100 cycles. The VDE is highly effective in shielding against hair disturbances in electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring, even during intense chest expansion, and in electromyography (EMG) monitoring during large strain. Furthermore, the VDE is easily attachable to the skull without requiring any electroencephalogram (EEG) cap or bandage, making it an ideal solution for EEG monitoring. This work represents a substantial breakthrough in the field of EP monitoring, providing a solution for the previously challenging issue of monitoring human EP signals on hairy skin.

         <dc:description>
A covalently functionalized leakage&#8208;free phase&#8208;change thermal interface material is synthesized. The hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;forming functional groups enable a nearly perfect healing efficiency and recyclability. Elaborately designed multiwalled carbon nanotubes decorated with silver nanoparticles bridge silver&#8208;flake islands, resulting in extraordinary high thermal conductivity (43.4&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1) and low total thermal resistance (30.5&#160;mm2&#160;K W&#8722;1) for phase&#8208;change thermal interface materials.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) have received considerable attention to take advantage of both pad&#8208;type and grease&#8208;type thermal interface materials (TIMs). However, the critical drawbacks of leaking, non&#8208;recyclability, and low thermal conductivity (&#954;) hinder industrial applications of PCM TIMs. Here, leakage&#8208;free healable PCM TIMs with extraordinarily high &#954; and low total thermal resistance (Rt) are reported. The matrix material (OP) is synthesized by covalently functionalizing octadecanol PCM with polyethylene&#8208;co&#8208;methyl acrylate&#8208;co&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate polymer through the nucleophilic epoxy ring opening reaction. The OP changes from semicrystalline to amorphous above the phase&#8208;transition temperature, preventing leaking. The hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;forming functional groups in OP enable nearly perfect healing efficiencies in tensile strength (99.7%), &#954; (97.0%), and Rt (97.4%). Elaborately designed thermally conductive fillers, silver&#160;flakes&#160;and multiwalled carbon nanotubes decorated with silver nanoparticles (nAgMWNTs), are additionally introduced in the OP matrix (OP&#8208;Ag&#8208;nAgMWNT). The nAgMWNTs bridge silver&#8208;flake islands, resulting in extraordinarily high &#954; (43.4&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1) and low Rt (30.5&#160;mm2&#160;K W&#8722;1) compared with PCM TIMs in the literature. Excellent heat dissipation and recycling demonstration of the OP&#8208;Ag&#8208;nAgMWNT is also carried out using a computer graphic processing unit. The OP&#8208;Ag&#8208;nAgMWNT is a promising future TIM for thermal management of mechanical and electrical devices.

         <title>Electrostatic Attractive Self&#8208;Delivery of siRNA and Light&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Escape for Synergistic Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrostatic&#8208;attraction&#8208;driven&#160;carrier&#8208;free siRNA delivery nanoparticle (siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs) is designed by grafting cationic sulfur&#8208;substituted Nile Blue photosensitizer onto deblock PLK1 siRNA strands. The siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs exhibit rapid cellular uptake, efficient lysosome escape, and outstanding tumor&#8208;targeting ability. Moreover, the siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs can effectively suppress the target PLK1 gene, achieving RNAi and PDT synergistic cancer treatment.








Abstract
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) holds immense promise for suppressing gene expression and treating various life&#8208;threatening diseases, including cancer. However, efficient delivery and lysosomal escape remain critical challenges that hinder the therapeutic effectiveness of siRNA. Herein, cationic photosensitizer (NB&#8208;Br) is grafted onto polo&#8208;like kinase 1 (PLK1) siRNA to form an amphiphilic siRNA&#8208;photosensitizer conjugate (siPLK1&#8208;NB), which can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs) via electrostatic attraction. Notably, siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs exhibit rapid and efficient cell endocytosis, as well as outstanding tumor&#8208;targeting property in multiple tumor&#8208;bearing mice models. When siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs are located inside tumor cell lysosomes, the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) after photoactivation can disrupt the lysosome membrane structure and facilitate siRNA escape from lysosomes. Under light irradiation, siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs can downregulate PLK1 expression and induce photodynamic killing, effectively inhibiting tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, this study provides a novel design strategy for carrier&#8208;free siRNA delivery systems. As far as it is known, this is the first report of a carrier&#8208;free siRNA delivery system based on electrostatic attraction.

         <title>Fabrication of Single&#8208;Crystalline CoCrFeNi Thin Films by DC Magnetron Sputtering: A Route to Surface Studies of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with their almost limitless number of possible compositions have raised widespread attention in material science. Next to wear and corrosion resistive coatings, their application as tunable electrocatalysts has recently moved into the focus. On the other hand, fundamental properties of HEA surfaces like atomic and electronic structure, surface segregation and diffusion as well as adsorption on HEA surfaces are barely explored. The lack of research is caused by the limited availability of single&#8208;crystalline samples. In the present work, the epitaxial growth of face centered cubic (fcc) CoCrFeNi films on MgO(100) is reported. Their characterisation by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrates that the layers with a homogeneous and close to equimolar elemental composition are oriented in [100] direction and aligned with the substrate to which they form an abrupt interface. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low&#8208;energy electron diffraction (LEED) and angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy are employed to study chemical composition and atomic and electronic structure of CoCrFeNi(100). It is demonstrated that epitaxially grown HEA films have the potential to fill the sample gap, allowing for fundamental studies of properties of and processes on well&#8208;defined HEA surfaces over the full compositional&#160;space.

         <title>Induction of Metabolic Reprogramming in Kidney by Singlet Diradical Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic compounds with an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical ground state, namely singlet diradicals, have recently gained attention in the fields of organic electronics, photovoltaics, and spintronics owing to their unique electronic structures and properties. Notably, singlet diradicals exhibit tunable redox amphoterism, which makes them excellent redox&#8208;active materials for biomedical applications. However, the safety and therapeutic efficacy of singlet diradicals in biological systems have not yet been explored. Herein, we present a newly designed singlet diradical nanomaterial, diphenyl&#8208;substituted biolympicenylidene (BO&#8208;Ph), exhibiting low cytotoxicity in vitro, non&#8208;significant acute nephrotoxicity in vivo, and the ability to induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids. Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal that the metabolism of BO&#8208;Ph stimulates glutathione synthesis and fatty acid degradation, increases the levels of intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid and carnitine cycles, and eventually boosts oxidative phosphorylation under redox homeostasis. Benefits of BO&#8208;Ph&#8208;induced metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids include enhanced cellular antioxidant capacity and promoted mitochondrial function. The results of this study can facilitate the application of singlet diradical materials in the treatment of clinical conditions induced by mitochondrial abnormalities in kidney.

         <title>Mn&#8208;Oxygen Compounds Coordinated Ruthenium Sites with Deprotonated and Low Oxophilic Microenvironments for Membrane Electrolyzer&#8208;based H2&#8208;Production</title>

Abstract
Among the platinum&#8208;group metals, ruthenium (Ru), with a low water dissociation energy, has been considered a promising alternative to substitute Pt for catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, optimizing the adsorption/desorption energies of H* and OH* intermediates on Ru catalytic sites is extremely desirable but remains challenging. Inspired by the natural catalytic characteristics of Mn&#8208;oxygen complex, we report to design Mn&#8208;oxygen compounds coordinated Ru sites (MOC&#8208;Ru) with deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments for modulating the adsorption/desorption of H* and OH* to promote HER kinetics. Benefiting from the unique advantages of MOC structures, including weakened H&#8208;OH bond at interface, electron donation ability, and deprotonation capability, the MOC&#8208;Ru exhibits extremely low overpotential and ultralong stability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations elucidate that the MOC can accelerate water dissociation kinetics and promote OH* desorption in alkaline conditions, and trigger the long&#8208;range H* spillover for H2&#8208;release in acid conditions. The outstanding activity and stability of membrane electrolyzer display that the MOC&#8208;Ru catalyst holds great potential as cathode for H2&#8208;production. This study provides essential insights into the crucial roles of deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments in HER catalysis and offers new pathway to create efficient water&#8208;splitting cathode.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Aerogel Ion Motor for Nanofluid Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Osmotic power, also known as &#8220;blue energy&#8221;, is a vast, sustainable and clean energy source that can be directly converted into electricity by nanofluidic membranes. However, the key technological bottleneck for large&#8208;scale osmotic electricity is that macroscopic&#8208;scale bulky membranes cannot synergistically satisfy the demands of high power density and low resistance without sacrificing scalability and mechanical robustness. Here, inspired by the anatomy and working principle of electric eels, which harness osmotic energy through embedded neuron&#8208;mediated fibril nanochannels with nanoconfined transport dynamics. We engineer fibrous nanofluidic meta&#8208;aerogel ion motors, 3D&#8208;assembled from nanofluidic cable fibers with actuatable stimulation/transport &#8220;ion highways&#8221;. The meta&#8208;aerogel exhibits the integrated coupling effect of boosted ion propulsion and surface&#8208;charge&#8208;dominated selective ion transport. Driven by osmosis, the meta&#8208;aerogel ion motor can produce an unprecedented output power density of up to 30.7&#160;W m&#8722;2 under a 50&#8208;fold salinity gradient. Advancing ultra&#8208;selective ion transport in nanofluidic meta&#8208;aerogels may provide a promising roadmap for blue energy harvesting.

         <title>Exchange&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Like Behavior in Ferroelectric Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Interlayer coupling in materials, such as exchange interactions at the interface between an antiferromagnet and a ferromagnet, can produce exotic phenomena not present in the parent materials. While such interfacial coupling in magnetic systems has been widely studied, there is considerably less work on analogous electric counterparts (i.e., akin to electric &#8220;exchange&#8208;bias&#8208;like&#8221; or &#8220;exchange&#8208;spring&#8208;like&#8221; interactions between two polar materials) despite the likelihood that such effects could also engender new features associated with anisotropic electric dipole alignment. Here, electric analogs of such exchange interactions are reported, and their physical origins are explained for bilayers of in&#8208;plane polarized Pb1&#8208;xSrxTiO3 ferroelectrics. Variation of the strontium content and thickness of the layers provides for deterministic control over the switching properties of the bilayer system resulting in phenomena analogous to an exchange&#8208;spring interaction and, leveraging added control of these interactions with an electric field, the ability to realize multistate&#8208;memory function. Such observations not only hold technological promise for ferroelectrics and multiferroics, but also extend the similarities between ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials to include the manifestation of exchange&#8208;interaction&#8208;like phenomena.

         <title>Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction: Ammonia Synthesis and the Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Natural nitrogen cycle has been severely disrupted by anthropogenic activities. The overuse of N&#8208;containing fertilizers induces the increase of nitrate level in surface and ground waters, and substantial emission of nitrogen oxides causes heavy air pollution. Nitrogen gas, as the main component of air, has been used for mass ammonia production for over a century, providing enough nutrition for agriculture to support world population increase. In the last decade, researchers have made great efforts to develop ammonia processes under ambient conditions to combat the intensive energy consumption and high carbon emission associated with the Haber&#8208;Bosch process. Among different techniques, electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) can achieve nitrate removal and ammonia generation simultaneously using renewable electricity as the power, and there is an exponential growth of studies in this research direction. Here we provide a timely and comprehensive review on the important progresses of electrochemical NO3RR, covering the rational design of electrocatalysts, emerging C&#8208;N coupling reactions, and advanced energy conversion and storage systems. Moreover, future perspectives are proposed to accelerate the industrialized NH3 production and green synthesis of chemicals, leading to a sustainable nitrogen cycle via prosperous N&#8208;based electrochemistry.

         <title>Templated 2D Polymer Heterojunctions for Improved Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D polymer heterojunctions are formed using a novel templating technique and are investigated as photocatalysts for proton reduction. Templated materials showed improved charge separation and reduced trapped charges at the donor&#8211;acceptor interface, which results in hydrogen evolution rates of 3&#8211;9 times that of either individual semiconductor and the ability to produce hydrogen in combination with the oxidation of reversible redox mediators, as well as sacrificial electron donors.








Abstract
2D polymers have emerged as one of the most promising classes of organic photocatalysts for solar fuel production due to their tunability, charge&#8208;transport properties, and robustness. They are&#160;however&#160;difficult to process and so there are limited studies into the formation of heterojunction materials incorporating these components. In this work, a novel templating approach is used to combine an imine&#8208;based donor polymer and an acceptor polymer formed through Knoevenagel condensation. Heterojunction formation is shown to be highly dependent on the topological match of the donor and acceptor polymers with the most active templated material found to be between three and nine times more active for photocatalysis than its constituent components. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that this improvement is due to faster charge separation and more efficient charge extraction in the templated heterojunction. The templated material shows a very high hydrogen evolution rate of &gt;20&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 with an ascorbic acid hole scavenger but also produces hydrogen in the presence of only water and a cobalt&#8208;based redox mediator. This suggests&#160;the improved charge&#8208;separation interface and reduced trapping accessed through this approach could be suitable for Z&#8208;scheme formation.

         <title>The Readiness of Water Molecules to Split into Hydrogen + Oxygen: A Proposed New Aspect of Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of dioxane to water leads to a significant blueshift in the frequency of the O&#63743;H stretch vibration derived from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) experiments, which is indicative of increased O&#63743;H bond strength (intramolecular bonding). This phenomenon is accompanied by a significant increase in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) onset potential. Structural&#8211;molecular realities of H2O are hereby linked to a key parameter of water electrolysis.








Abstract
The potential of the anode, at which the evolution of oxygen begins, is a key parameter that describes how well water is split in water electrolyzers. Research efforts related to electrocatalytically initiated water splitting that aim at reducing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential to date focus on the optimization of materials used to produce the electrodes. Descriptors for the readiness of the H2O molecule itself to break down into its components have not been considered in water electrolysis experiments so far. In a simple set of experiments, it is found that adding dioxane to aqueous solutions leads to a substantial blueshift of the frequency of the O&#63743;H stretch vibration which is a sign of an increased strength of the O&#63743;H bond (intramolecular bonding). This phenomenon coincides with a significant increase in the OER onset potential as derived from cyclic voltammetry experiments. Thus, the O&#63743;H stretch frequency can be an ideal indicator for the readiness of water molecules to be split in its cleavage products. This is thought to be first example of a study into the relationship between structural features of water as derived from Fourier transform infrared&#160;(FTIR) spectroscopic studies and key results derived from water electrolysis experiments.

         <title>Dry&#8208;Transferrable Photoresist Enabled Reliable Conformal Patterning for Ultrathin Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photolithographic techniques, which are widely used in the silicon&#8208;based semiconductor industry, enable the manufacture of high&#8208;yield and high&#8208;resolution features at the micrometer and nanometer scale. However, conventional photolithographic processes cannot accommodate the micro/nanofabrication of flexible and stretchable electronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photolithographic techniques, which are widely used in the silicon-based semiconductor industry, enable the manufacture of high-yield and high-resolution features at the micrometer and nanometer scale. However, conventional photolithographic processes cannot accommodate the micro/nanofabrication of flexible and stretchable electronics. In this study, a microfabrication approach that uses a synthesized environmentally friendly and dry-transferrable photoresist to enable the reliable conformal manufacturing of thin-film electronics is reported, which is also compatible with the existing cleanroom processes. Photoresists with high-resolution, high-density, and multiscale patterns can be transferred onto various substrates in a defect-free and conformal-contact manner, thus enabling multiple wafer reuses. Theoretical studies are conducted to investigate the damage-free peel-off mechanism of the proposed approach. The in situ fabrication of various electrical components, including ultralight and ultrathin biopotential electrodes, has been demonstrated, which offer lower interfacial impedance, durability, and stability, and the components are applied to collect electromyography signals with superior signal-to-noise ratio and quality.

         <title>Aerosol&#8208;Jet&#8208;Printable Covalent Organic Framework Colloidal Inks and Temperature&#8208;Sensitive Nanocomposite Films</title>

Abstract
With molecularly well&#8208;defined and tailorable two&#8208;dimensional structures, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as leading material candidates for diverse applications including chemical sensing, storage, separation, and catalysis. In many of these contexts, the ability to directly and deterministically print COFs into arbitrary geometries would enable rapid optimization and deployment. However, previous attempts to print COFs have been restricted by low spatial resolution and/or post&#8208;deposition polymerization that complicates processing or limits the range of compatible COFs. Here, we overcome these limitations with a pre&#8208;synthesized, solution&#8208;processable colloidal ink that enables aerosol jet printing of COFs with micron&#8208;scale resolution. A key component of the ink formulation is the low&#8208;volatility solvent benzonitrile, which is critical to obtaining homogeneous printed COF film morphologies. The ink formulation is also compatible with other colloidal nanomaterials, thus facilitating the integration of COFs into printable nanocomposite films. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, boronate&#8208;ester COFs are integrated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form printable COF&#8208;CNT nanocomposite films, in which the CNTs enhance charge transport and the temperature sensing performance of the COFs. In particular, the printed COF&#8208;CNT nanocomposite films show high in&#8208;plane COF crystallinity and exhibit tunable electrical conductivity as a function of CNT loading, COF pore size, and temperature, ultimately resulting in high&#8208;sensitivity temperature sensors that show electrical conductivity variation by 4 orders of magnitude between room temperature and 300&#176;C. Overall, this work establishes a flexible platform for COF additive manufacturing that can accelerate the incorporation of COFs into technologically significant applications.

         <title>Cancer Stem&#8208;like Cells&#8208;Oriented Surface Self&#8208;Assembly to Conquer Radioresistance</title>

Abstract
Cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs), capable of indefinite self&#8208;renewal and differentiation, are considered to be the root cause of tumor radiotherapy (RT) resistance. However, the CSCs&#8208;targeted therapy still remains to be a great challenge because they are commonly located in the deep tumor making drugs hard to approach, and their hypoxic and acidic niche can further aggravate radioresistance. Herein, based on our finding that hypoxic CSCs highly express carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) on the cell membrane, a CAIX&#8208;targeted induced in situ self&#8208;assembly system on the surface of CSC is reported to overcome hypoxic CSC&#8208;mediated radioresistance. Via the sequential processes of &#8220;monomer release&#8208;target accumulation&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly,&#8221; the constructed peptide&#8208;based drug delivery system (CA&#8208;Pt) exhibits the advantages of deep penetration, amplified CAIX inhibition, and enhanced cellular uptake, which greatly relieves the hypoxic and acidic microenvironment to promote the hypoxic CSC differentiation and combines with platinum to boost the RT&#8208;inducing DNA damage. In both lung cancer tumor mouse and zebrafish embryo models, CA&#8208;Pt treatment can effectively assist RT in suppressing tumor growth and preventing tumor invasion and metastasis. This study used a surface&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy to differentiate hypoxic CSCs, which may provide a universal treatment strategy for overcoming tumor radioresistance.

         <title>Localized Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Delivery of miR&#8208;29b Normalizes the Dysregulation of Bone Homeostasis Caused by Osteosarcoma whilst Simultaneously Inhibiting Tumor Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formulation of miR&#8208;29b:nanoparticles is developed that is delivered via a hyaluronic&#8208;based hydrogel to enable local and sustained release of the therapy and to study the potential of attenuating tumor growth whilst normalizing bone homeostasis. It is found that when miR&#8208;29b is delivered, compared to chemotherapy alone, the therapy provided a significant decrease in tumor burden, an increase in mouse survival, and a significant decrease in osteolysis caused by the tumor.








Abstract
Patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma undergo extensive surgical intervention and chemotherapy resulting in dismal prognosis and compromised quality of life owing to poor bone regeneration, which is further compromised with chemotherapy delivery. This study aims to investigate if localized delivery of miR&#8208;29b&#8212;which is shown to promote bone formation by inducing osteoblast differentiation and also to suppress prostate and cervical&#160;tumor growth&#8212;can suppress osteosarcoma tumors whilst simultaneously normalizing the dysregulation of bone homeostasis caused by osteosarcoma. Thus, the therapeutic potential of microRNA (miR)&#8208;29b is studied to promote bone remodeling in an orthotopic model of osteosarcoma (rather than in bone defect models using healthy mice), and in the context of chemotherapy, that is clinically relevant. A formulation of miR&#8208;29b:nanoparticles are developed that are delivered via a hyaluronic&#8208;based hydrogel to enable local and sustained release of the therapy and to study the potential of attenuating tumor growth whilst normalizing bone homeostasis. It is found that when miR&#8208;29b is delivered along with systemic chemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy alone, the therapy provided a significant decrease in tumor burden, an increase in mouse survival, and a significant decrease in osteolysis thereby normalizing the dysregulation of bone lysis activity caused by the tumor.

         <title>Emergent Ferroelectric Switching Behavior from Polar Vortex Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the polar vortex lattice, low&#8208;field metastable switching events are demonstrated in coexistence with classical ferroelectric bi&#8208;stability. By changing the poled state of the vortex lattice one can tune the anisotropy of these low&#8208;field hysteresis loops, allowing for a novel method of non&#8208;destructive readout of the poled state with a simple in&#8208;plane capacitor.








Abstract
Topologically protected polar textures have provided a rich playground for the exploration of novel, emergent phenomena. Recent discoveries indicate that ferroelectric vortices and skyrmions not only host properties markedly different from traditional ferroelectrics, but also that these properties can be harnessed for unique memory devices. Using a combination of capacitor&#8208;based capacitance measurements and computational models, it is demonstrated that polar vortices in dielectric&#8211;ferroelectric&#8211;dielectric trilayers exhibit classical ferroelectric bi&#8208;stability together with the existence of low&#8208;field metastable polarization states. This behavior is directly tied to the in&#8208;plane vortex ordering, and it is shown that it can be used as a new method of non&#8208;destructive readout&#8208;out of the poled state.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Scale Structure Engineering of ZnSnO3 for Ultra&#8208;Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept of multi&#8208;scale (electronic&#8208;crystal&#8208;geometric) structure design is proposed to develop the hollow amorphous ZnSnO3 cubes (HZTO) for optimizing Zn metal anodes. The as&#8208;prepared HZTO@Zn with high hydrogen evolution barrier, abundant zincophilic sites, and rapid Zn2+ migration can achieve dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition and ultra&#8208;long cycling over 6900 h.








Abstract
Suppressing the severe water&#8208;induced side reactions and uncontrolled dendrite growth of zinc (Zn) metal anodes is crucial for aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries to achieve ultra&#8208;long cyclic lifespans and promote their practical applications. Herein, a concept of multi&#8208;scale (electronic&#8208;crystal&#8208;geometric) structure design is proposed to precisely construct the hollow amorphous ZnSnO3 cubes (HZTO) for optimizing Zn metal anodes. In situ gas chromatography demonstrates that Zn anodes modified by HZTO (HZTO@Zn) can effectively inhibit the undesired hydrogen evolution. The pH stabilization and corrosion suppression mechanisms are revealed via operando pH detection and in situ Raman analysis. Moreover, comprehensive experimental and theoretical results prove that the amorphous structure and hollow architecture endow the protective HZTO layer with strong Zn affinity and rapid Zn2+ diffusion, which are beneficial for achieving the ideal dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. Accordingly, excellent electrochemical performances for the HZTO@Zn symmetric battery (6900&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 100&#160;times longer than that of bare Zn), HZTO@Zn||V2O5 full battery (99.3% capacity retention after 1100&#160;cycles), and HZTO@Zn||V2O5 pouch cell (120.6 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1) are achieved. This work with multi&#8208;scale structure design provides significant guidance to rationally develop advanced protective layers for other ultra&#8208;long&#8208;life metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A concept of multi-scale (electronic-crystal-geometric) structure design is proposed to develop the hollow amorphous ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cubes (HZTO) for optimizing Zn metal anodes. The as-prepared HZTO@Zn with high hydrogen evolution barrier, abundant zincophilic sites, and rapid Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; migration can achieve dendrite-free Zn deposition and ultra-long cycling over 6900 h.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppressing the severe water-induced side reactions and uncontrolled dendrite growth of zinc (Zn) metal anodes is crucial for aqueous Zn-metal batteries to achieve ultra-long cyclic lifespans and promote their practical applications. Herein, a concept of multi-scale (electronic-crystal-geometric) structure design is proposed to precisely construct the hollow amorphous ZnSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cubes (HZTO) for optimizing Zn metal anodes. In situ gas chromatography demonstrates that Zn anodes modified by HZTO (HZTO@Zn) can effectively inhibit the undesired hydrogen evolution. The pH stabilization and corrosion suppression mechanisms are revealed via operando pH detection and in situ Raman analysis. Moreover, comprehensive experimental and theoretical results prove that the amorphous structure and hollow architecture endow the protective HZTO layer with strong Zn affinity and rapid Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion, which are beneficial for achieving the ideal dendrite-free Zn anode. Accordingly, excellent electrochemical performances for the HZTO@Zn symmetric battery (6900&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 100&#160;times longer than that of bare Zn), HZTO@Zn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; full battery (99.3% capacity retention after 1100&#160;cycles), and HZTO@Zn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell (120.6 Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) are achieved.

         <title>Generation of 13.9&#8208;mJ Terahertz Radiation from Lithium Niobate Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of single&#8208;cycle 13.9&#8208;mJ extreme terahertz pulses from cryogenically cooled lithium niobate crystals and 1.2% energy conversion efficiency from 800&#160;nm to terahertz are demonstrated experimentally using the tilted pulse front technique driven by a home&#8208;built 30&#8208;fs, 1.2&#8208;Joule Ti:sapphire laser amplifier. The focused peak electric field strength&#160;was&#160;estimated to be 7.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Extremely strong&#8208;field terahertz (THz) radiation in free space has compelling applications in nonequilibrium condensed matter state regulation, all&#8208;optical THz electron acceleration and manipulation, THz biological effects, etc. However, these practical applications are constrained by the absence of high&#8208;intensity, high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;beam&#8208;quality, and stable solid&#8208;state THz light sources. Here, the generation of single&#8208;cycle 13.9&#8208;mJ extreme THz pulses from cryogenically cooled lithium niobate crystals and a 1.2% energy conversion efficiency from 800&#160;nm to THz are demonstrated experimentally using the tilted pulse&#8208;front technique driven by a home&#8208;built 30&#8208;fs, 1.2&#8208;Joule Ti:sapphire laser amplifier. The focused peak electric field strength is estimated to be 7.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&#8722;1. A record of 1.1&#8208;mJ THz single&#8208;pulse energy at a 450 mJ pump at room temperature is produced and observed that the self&#8208;phase modulation of the optical pump can induce THz saturation behavior from the crystals in the substantially nonlinear pump regime. This study lays the foundation for the generation of sub&#8208;Joule THz radiation from lithium niobate crystals and will inspire more innovations in extreme THz science and applications.

         <title>Monolithic Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Energy&#8208;Efficient Water Adsorption Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (UiO&#8208;66, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 and Zr&#8208;fumarate) with high density and exceptional water sorption capacity are developed to replace traditional refrigeration systems with energy&#8208;efficient alternatives. The adsorption characteristics of monolithic materials have been predicted using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and lattice&#8208;gas models. Unlike traditional MOFs, these monolithic MOFs have overcome processing issues, making them suitable for real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Space cooling and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) accounts for roughly 10% of global electricity use and are responsible for ca. 1.13 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions annually. Adsorbent&#8208;based HVAC technologies have long been touted as an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to traditional refrigeration systems. However, thus far, no suitable adsorbents have been developed which overcome the drawbacks associated with traditional sorbent materials such as silica gels and zeolites. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvements in water adsorption and regeneration energy requirements. However, the deployment of MOFs in HVAC applications has been hampered by issues related to MOF powder processing. Herein, three high&#8208;density, shaped, monolithic MOFs (UiO&#8208;66, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, and Zr&#8208;fumarate) with exceptional volumetric gas/vapor uptake are developed&#8212;solving previous issues in MOF&#8208;HVAC deployment. The monolithic structures across the mesoporous range are visualized using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and lattice&#8208;gas models, giving accurate predictions of adsorption characteristics of the monolithic materials. It is also demonstrated that a fragile MOF such as Zr&#8208;fumarate can be synthesized in monolithic form with a bulk density of 0.76 gcm&#8722;3 without losing any adsorption performance, having a coefficient of performance (COP) of 0.71 with a low regeneration temperature (&#8804; 100 &#176;C).

         <title>Bi&#8208;Deficiency Leading to High&#8208;Performance in Mg3(Sb,Bi)2&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation and tuning of complex defects can effectively enhance the thermoelectric performance of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2. This work proposes an approach to mitigate the negative scattering effect of Mg vacancies by Bi deficiency. The heterovalent vacancies provide a strong phonon scattering, leading to a significant reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity and a superior zT.








Abstract
Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 is a potential nearly&#8208;room temperature thermoelectric compound composed of earth&#8208;abundant elements. However, complex defect tuning and exceptional microstructural control are required. Prior studies have confirmed the detrimental effect of Mg vacancies (VMg) in Mg3(Sb,Bi)2. This study proposes an approach to mitigating the negative scattering effect of VMg by Bi deficiency, synergistically modulating the electrical and thermal transport properties to enhance the thermoelectric performance. Positron annihilation spectrometry and Cs&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy analyses indicated that the VMg tends to coalesce due to the introduced Bi vacancies (VBi). The defects created by Bi deficiency effectively weaken the scattering of electrons from the intrinsic VMg and enhance phonon scattering. A peak zT of 1.82 at 773 K and high conversion efficiency of 11.3% at &#8710;T = 473 K are achieved in the optimized composition of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 by tuning the defect combination. This work demonstrates a feasible and effective approach to improving the performance of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 as an emerging thermoelectric material.

         <title>Polymeric Memristor Based Artificial Synapses with Ultra&#8208;Wide Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic polymeric memristive device using MDMO&#8208;PPV is demonstrated. The unencapsulated devices maintain reliable memristive switching behavior under an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range (77&#8211;573 K). XPS and ToF&#8208;SIMS depth profiling techniques are utilized to visualize the kinetic process of ion migration in the device. This work may allow the use of organic memristors as robust artificial synapses in ultra&#8208;wide temperature range for future neuromorphic applications.








Abstract
Neuromorphic electronics, being inspired by how the brain works, hold great promise to the successful implementation of smart artificial systems. Among several neuromorphic hardware issues, a robust device functionality under extreme temperature is of particular importance for practical applications. Given that the organic memristors for artificial synapse applications are demonstrated under room temperature, achieving a robust device performance at extremely low or high temperature is still utterly challenging. In this work, the temperature issue is addressed by tuning the functionality of the solution&#8208;based organic polymeric memristor. The optimized memristor demonstrates a reliable performance under both the cryogenic and high&#8208;temperature environments. The unencapsulated organic polymeric memristor shows a robust memristive response under test temperature ranging from 77 to 573&#160;K. Utilizing X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) depth profiling, the device working mechanism is unveiled by comparing the compositional profiles of the fresh and written organic polymeric memristors. A reversible ion migration induced by an applied voltage contributes to the characteristic switching behavior of the memristor. Herein, both the robust memristive response achieved at extreme temperatures and the verified device working mechanism will remarkably accelerate the development of memristors in neuromorphic systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;architectured high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading proton pseudocapacitors with cross&#8208;scale, high energy density, and oriented toward harsh environments are rationally designed via 3D printing technology. The 3D&#8208;printed pseudocapacitors can deliver a high energy density of 0.514 mWh cm&#8722;2 and excellent cycling stability at the ultralow temperature of &#8722;60&#176;C.








Abstract
The sluggish ionic transport in thick electrodes and freezing electrolytes has limited electrochemical energy storage devices in lots of harsh environments for practical applications. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed proton pseudocapacitor based on high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading 3D&#8208;printed WO3 anodes, Prussian blue analog cathodes, and anti&#8208;freezing electrolytes is developed, which can achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance at low temperatures. Benefiting from the cross&#8208;scale 3D electrode structure using a 3D printing direct ink writing technique, the 3D&#8208;printed cathode realizes an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 7.39&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a high areal mass loading of 23.51&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the 3D&#8208;printed pseudocapacitor delivers an areal capacitance of 3.44 F&#160;cm&#8722;2 and excellent areal energy density (1.08 mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2). Owing to the fast ion kinetics in 3D electrodes and the high ionic conductivity of the hybrid electrolyte, the 3D&#8208;printed supercapacitor delivers 61.3% of the room&#8208;temperature capacitance even at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. This work provides an effective strategy for the practical applications of energy storage devices with complex physical structure at extreme temperatures.

         <title>Intermediate Phase Engineering with 2,2&#8208;Azodi(2&#8208;Methylbutyronitrile)&#160;for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique intermediate phase engineering strategy is developed to overcome the incomplete and random transformation of PbI2 film with organic ammonium salts by simultaneously introducing 2,2&#8208;azodi(2&#8208;methylbutyronitrile) to both PbI2 precursor solution and organic ammonium salts. This helps to achieve perovskite solar cells with efficiency &gt;25% and good stability of remaining 96% initial efficiency in the maximum power point tracking measurement after 1000 h.








Abstract
Sequential deposition has been widely employed to modulate the crystallization of perovskite solar cells because it can avoid the formation of nucleation centers and even initial crystallization in the precursor solution. However, challenges remain in overcoming the incomplete and random transformation of PbI2 films with organic ammonium salts. Herein, a unique intermediate phase engineering strategy has been developed by simultaneously introducing 2,2&#8208;azodi(2&#8208;methylbutyronitrile) (AMBN) to both PbI2 and ammonium salt solutions to regulate perovskite crystallization. AMBN not only coordinates with PbI2 to form a favorably mesoporous PbI2 film due to the coordination between Pb2+ and the cyano group (C&#8801;N), but also suppresses the vigorous activity of FA+ ions by interacting with FAI, leading to the full PbI2 transformation with the preferred orientation. Therefore, perovskites with favorable facet orientations are obtained, and the defects are largely suppressed owing to the passivation of uncoordinated Pb2+ and FA+. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency over 25% with a stabilized efficiency of 24.8% is achieved. Moreover, the device exhibits an improved operational stability, retaining 96% of initial power conversion efficiency under 1000 h continuous white&#8208;light illumination with an intensity of 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at &#8776;55&#160;&#176;C in N2 atmosphere.

         <title>Hierarchical Serpentine&#8208;Helix Combination for 3D Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural design of hierarchical 3D serpentine&#8208;helix combination, with repeating units winding in a helical manner, can enable large mechanical forces transferred down to a smaller scale with the dissipation of potentially damaging stresses by microscale buckling, endowing electronic devices made from hard&#8208;to&#8208;stretch materials with large stretchability in x&#8208;, y&#8208;, or z&#8208;axis direction, high structural stability, and extraordinary electromechanical performance.








Abstract
3D stretchable electronics attract growing interest due to their new and more complex functionalities compared to 1D or 2D counterparts. Among all 3D configuration designs, a 3D helical structure is commonly used as it can be designed to achieve outstanding stretching ratios as well as highly robust mechanical performance. However, the stretching ratio that mainly focuses on the axis direction hinders its applications. Inspired by hierarchies in a tendon, a novel structural design of hierarchical 3D serpentine&#8208;helix combination is proposed. The structural design constructed by a sequence with repeating small units winding in a helical manner around the axis can enable large mechanical forces transferred down to a smaller scale with the dissipation of potentially damaging stresses by microscale buckling, thereby endowing the electronic components made from high&#8208;performance but hard&#8208;to&#8208;stretch materials with large stretchability (&#8805;200%) in x&#8208;, y&#8208;, or z&#8208;axis direction, high structural stability, and extraordinary electromechanical performance. Two applications including a wireless charging patch and an epidermal electronic system are demonstrated. The epidermal electronic system made of several hierarchical 3D serpentine&#8208;helix combinations allows for high&#8208;fidelity monitoring of electrophysiological signals, galvanic skin response, and finger&#8208;movement&#8208;induced electrical signals, which can achieve good tactile pattern recognition when combined with an artificial neural network.

HM coating drives the targeted accumulation of NCs in the injured myocardium, and acid&#8208;triggered membrane shedding allows efficient delivery of siSav1 into cardiomyocytes, which suppresses the Hippo pathway and induces cardiomyocyte regeneration.








Abstract
siRNA&#8208;mediated management of myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is greatly hampered by the inefficient myocardial enrichment and cardiomyocyte transfection. Herein, nanocomplexes (NCs) reversibly camouflaged with a platelet&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (HM) are developed to efficiently deliver Sav1 siRNA (siSav1) into cardiomyocytes, suppressing the Hippo pathway and inducing cardiomyocyte regeneration. The biomimetic BSPC@HM NCs consist of a cationic nanocore assembled from a membrane&#8208;penetrating helical polypeptide (P&#8208;Ben) and siSav1, a charge&#8208;reversal intermediate layer of poly(l&#8208;lysine)&#8208;cis&#8208;aconitic acid (PC), and an outer shell of HM. Due to HM&#8208;mediated inflammation homing and microthrombus targeting, intravenously injected BSPC@HM NCs can efficiently accumulate in the IR&#8208;injured myocardium, where the acidic inflammatory microenvironment triggers charge reversal of PC to shed off both HM and PC layers and allow the penetration of the exposed P&#8208;Ben/siSav1 NCs into cardiomyocytes. In rats and pigs, BSPC@HM NCs remarkably downregulates Sav1 in IR&#8208;injured myocardium, promotes myocardium regeneration, suppresses myocardial apoptosis, and recovers cardiac functions. This study reports a bioinspired strategy to overcome the multiple systemic barriers against myocardial siRNA delivery, and holds profound potential for gene therapy against cardiac injuries.

         <title>Bioinspired Adaptable Indwelling Microneedles for Treatment of Diabetic Ulcers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the adaptive and self&#8208;regulating abilities of creatures in nature, indwelling microneedles are presented that can adjust their mechanical strengths to accommodate to surrounding tissues and release exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells. As the delivered exosomes can activate endogenous cells and regulate topical microenvironments, such indwelling microneedles demonstrate values in treating hard&#8208;healing wounds.








Abstract
Microneedles provide an effective strategy for transdermal drug delivery. Many endeavors have been devoted to developing smart microneedles that can respond to and interact with pathophysiological environments. Here, novel bioinspired adaptable indwelling microneedles with therapeutic exosome encapsulation are presented for diabetic wound healing by a combined fabrication strategy of template replication and 3D&#160;transfer printing. Such microneedles are composed of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)&#8208;exosomes&#8208;encapsulated adjustable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel needle tips and detachable 3M medical tape supporting substrate. As the mechanical strength of the PVA hydrogel is ionically responsive due to Hofmeister effects, the hardness of the resultant microneedle tips can be upregulated by sulfate ions to ensure skin penetration and be softened by nitrate ions after tip&#8211;substrate detachment to adapt to the surrounding tissue and release exosomes. Because the MSC&#8208;exosomes can effectively activate fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, and macrophages, the indwelling microneedles are demonstrated with the function of promoting tissue regeneration and diabetic wound healing in full&#8208;thickness cutaneous wounds of diabetic rat models. These features indicate that the bioinspired adaptable indwelling microneedles are with practical values and clinical prospects in tissue and wound regeneration.

         <title>2D Materials&#8208;Based Electrochemical Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental role played by the electrical double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) of few layers graphene (FLG)&#8208;electrodes, in rising the electrical power output of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs, 530 mW m&#8722;2) is unveiled. Highly capacitive FLG electrodes are obtained by integrating electrolyte gel composites based on 2D&#8208;transition metal dichalcogenides. This work introduces a novel design concept leading to sustainable electrochemical&#8208;TENGs.








Abstract
The integration of 2D materials in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is known to increase the mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical power conversion efficiency. 2D materials are used in TENGs with multiple roles as triboelectric material, charge&#8208;trapping fillers, or as electrodes. Here, novel TENGs based on few&#8208;layers graphene (FLG) electrodes and stable gel electrolytes composed of liquid phase exfoliated 2D&#8208;transition metal dichalcogenides and polyvinyl alcohol are developed. TENGs embedding FLG and gel composites show competitive open&#8208;circuit voltage (&#8776; 300 V), instant peak power (530 mW m&#8722;2), and stability (&gt; 11 months). These values correspond to a seven&#8208;fold higher electrical output compared to TENGs embedding bare FLG electrodes. It is demonstrated that such a significant improvement depends on the high electrical double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) of FLG electrodes functionalized with the gel composites. The wet encapsulation of the TENGs is shown to be an effective strategy to increase their power output further highlighting the EDLC role. It is also shown that the EDLC is dependent upon the transition metal (W vs Mo) rather than the relative abundance of 1T or 2H phases. Overall, this work lays down the roots for novel sustainable electrochemical&#8208;(e)&#8208;TENGs developed exploiting strategies typically used in electrochemical capacitors.

         <title>Programmed Self&#8208;Assembly of Single Colloidal Gyroids for Chiral Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;gyroid structure&#8212;despite supporting a complete photonic bandgap&#8212;has thus far been overlooked for programming colloidal self&#8208;assembly, presumably due to its structural complexity. In this work, two distinct routes are demonstrated in silico for programmed self&#8208;assembly of single colloidal gyroids from synthetically feasible chiral patchy colloidal spheres, paving the way for realizing 3D chiral photonic crystals at optical frequencies.








Abstract
Gyroid structures are of extensive interest because they provide a rich platform for chiroptics as well as topological photonics. While the double&#8208;gyroid morphology as a bicontinuous structure is not uncommon in self&#8208;assembled soft materials, direct self&#8208;assembly of single&#8208;network gyroids has proven elusive. Here, an enantiomorphic pair of single&#8208;gyroid crystals comprising colloidal spheres is presented, and two distinct routes are demonstrated for programmed self&#8208;assembly of each single colloidal gyroid enantiomorph from rationally designed patchy spheres. The designer colloidal patchy spheres, which closely hew to their synthetic feasibility, are chiral, having either two staggered rectangular patches at opposite poles or four circular patches arranged in a well&#8208;defined geometry. The single colloidal gyroid, as well as its inverse structure, is shown to support a wide complete photonic bandgap in addition to exhibiting rich chiroptical properties, making them attractive chiral photonic crystals. The versatility of this single colloidal gyroid, the bottom&#8208;up routes devised here in silico, and the robustness of the design space for the chiral colloidal patchy spheres together make a strong case for single colloidal gyroids to supersede colloidal diamond, as a target for programmed self&#8208;assembly, in the quest for photonic crystals operating at optical&#160;frequencies.

         <title>Coupling Probiotics with 2D CoCuMo&#8208;LDH Nanosheets as a Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Platform for Precise NIR&#8208;II Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>

A probiotics&#8208;based tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive platform is designed to remodel the TME to in situ activate CoCuMo layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets as effective photosensitizers for precise NIR&#8208;II PDT, which can effectively induce cell apoptosis and tumor eradication under 1270 nm laser irradiation.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become a promising cancer treatment approach with superior advantages. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive photosensitizers (PSs) for tumor&#8208;targeting precise PDT. Herein, the coupling Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) probiotics with 2D CoCuMo layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (LA&amp;LDH) is reported as a TME&#8208;responsive platform for precise NIR&#8208;II PDT. The CoCuMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets loaded on LA can be transformed from crystalline into amorphous through etching by the LA&#8208;metabolite&#8208;enabled low pH and overexpressed glutathione. The TME&#8208;induced in situ amorphization of CoCuMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets can boost its photodynamic activity for singlet oxygen (1O2) generation under 1270&#160;nm laser irradiation with relative 1O2 quantum yield of 1.06, which is the highest among previously reported NIR&#8208;excited PSs. In vitro and in vivo assays prove that the LA&amp;LDH can effectively achieve complete cell apoptosis and tumor eradication under 1270&#160;nm laser irradiation. This study proves that the probiotics can be used as a tumor&#8208;targeting platform for highly efficient precise NIR&#8208;II PDT.

Herein, the coupling &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus acidophilus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;LA&lt;/i&gt;) probiotics with 2D CoCuMo layered-double-hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (&lt;i&gt;LA&lt;/i&gt;&amp;LDH) is reported as a TME-responsive platform for precise NIR-II PDT. The CoCuMo-LDH nanosheets loaded on &lt;i&gt;LA&lt;/i&gt; can be transformed from crystalline into amorphous through etching by the &lt;i&gt;LA&lt;/i&gt;-metabolite-enabled low pH and overexpressed glutathione. The TME-induced in situ amorphization of CoCuMo-LDH nanosheets can boost its photodynamic activity for singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generation under 1270&#160;nm laser irradiation with relative &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum yield of 1.06, which is the highest among previously reported NIR-excited PSs. In vitro and in vivo assays prove that the &lt;i&gt;LA&lt;/i&gt;&amp;LDH can effectively achieve complete cell apoptosis and tumor eradication under 1270&#160;nm laser irradiation. This study proves that the probiotics can be used as a tumor-targeting platform for highly efficient precise NIR-II PDT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Organization of Iron Sulfide Nanoparticles into Complex Multicompartment Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeS2 NPs self&#8208;assemble into biomimetic supraparticles with multiple interconnected compartments. High complexity of the particles manifests in their functionality. They successfully encapsulate nucleic acid cargo, deliver it inside the cells, and protect it against degradation in the environment.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled compartments from nanoscale components are found in all life forms. Their characteristic dimensions are in 50&#8211;1000&#160;nm scale, typically assembled from a variety of bioorganic &#8220;building blocks&#8221;. Among the various functions that these mesoscale compartments carry out, protection of the content from the environment is central. Finding synthetic pathways to similarly complex and functional particles from technologically friendly inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) is needed for a multitude of biomedical, biochemical, and biotechnological processes. Here, it is shown that FeS2 NPs stabilized by l&#8208;cysteine self&#8208;assemble into multicompartment supraparticles (mSPs). The NPs initially produce &#8776;55&#160;nm concave assemblies that reconfigure into &#8776;75&#160;nm closed mSPs with &#8776;340 interconnected compartments with an average size of &#8776;5&#160;nm. The intercompartmental partitions and mSP surface are formed primarily from FeS2 and Fe2O3 NPs, respectively. The intermediate formation of cup&#8208;like particles enables encapsulation of biological cargo. This capability is demonstrated by loading mSPs with DNA and subsequent transfection of mammalian cells. Also it is found&#160;that the temperature stability of the DNA cargo is enhanced compared to the traditional delivery vehicles. These findings demonstrate that biomimetic compartmentalized particles can be used to successfully encapsulate and enhance temperature stability of the nucleic acid cargo for a variety of bioapplications.

         <title>Activatable Graphene Quantum&#8208;Dot&#8208;Based Nanotransformers for Long&#8208;Period Tumor Imaging and Repeated Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile nanovehicle, a quantum dot nanotransformes, smartly transforms its shape in tumor acidic microenvironment to prolong the tumor retention, and then disassembles and releases the encapsulated photosensitizers to &#8220;turn on&#8221; the imaging contrast. The total drug dose in repeated photodynamic therapy is reduced because one injection is enough for four times of light irradiation.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered as an emerging therapeutic modality against cancer with high spatiotemporal selectivity because the utilized photosensitizers (PSs) are only active and toxic upon light irradiation. To maximize its effectiveness, PDT is usually applied repetitively for ablating various tumors. However, the total overdose of PSs from repeated administrations causes severe side effects. Herein, acidity&#8208;activated graphene quantum dots&#8208;based nanotransformers (GQD NT) are developed as PS vehicles for long&#8208;period tumor imaging and repeated PDT. Under the guidance of Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp peptide, GQD NT targets to tumor tissues actively, and then loosens and enlarges in tumor acidity, thus promising long tumor retention. Afterwards, GQD NT transforms into small pieces for better penetration in tumor. Upon laser irradiation, GQD NT generates mild hyperthermia that enhances cell membrane permeability and further promotes the PSs uptake. Most intriguingly, the as&#8208;prepared GQD NT not only &#8220;turns&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence/magnetic resonance signals, but also achieves efficient repeated PDT. Notably, the total PSs dose is reduced to 3.5&#160;&#181;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1, which is 10&#8211;30&#160;times lower than that of other reported works. Overall, this study exploits a smart vehicle to enhance accumulation, retention, and release of PSs in tumors through programmed deformation, thus overcoming the overdose obstacle in repeated PDT.

         <title>A Nanotherapeutic Strategy to Reverse NK Cell Exhaustion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cetuximab can target EGFR, and then induce the decrease of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) content, accompanied by the inhibition of MTHFD2 activity by LY345899, leading to the boosting of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The generated ROS can oxidize C5SeSeC5 into seleninic acid, which can inhibit the expression of human leukocyte antigen E, further reverse the exhaustion of natural killer cells in conjunction with the antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity effect mediated by cetuximab.








Abstract
As a specialized immune effector cell, natural killer (NK) cells play a very important role in immunotherapy, but tumor immunosuppression caused by abnormal expression of cancer cells seriously weakens its therapeutic effect and leads to exhaustion. Here, self&#8208;assembled selenium&#8208;containing nanoparticles (NPs) composed of cetuximab, C5SeSeC5, and inhibitor LY345899 are developed to reverse NK cell exhaustion. The obtained NPs can target epidermal growth factor receptor on the surface of cancer cells and locate it in mitochondria. The released LY345899 can inhibit the activity of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 and produce excessive reactive oxygen species, leading to the formation of seleninic acid, further reducing the expression of human leukocyte antigen E , which is responsible for the NKG2A&#8208;related NK cell inhibition. As a result, the enhanced NK&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immunotherapy in conjunction with the cetuximab&#8208;mediated antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity effect can not only effectively inhibit the growth of xenograft tumors, but also significantly suppress the growth of untreated distant tumors via the abscopal effect. This work, the combination of seleninic acid, LY345899, and cetuximab, provides a new strategy for reversing NK cell exhaustion and has great potential for use in the treatment of metastatic tumors.

         <title>Experimental Demonstration of In&#8208;Memory Computing in a Ferrofluid System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;based ferrofluid system can implement a liquid in&#8208;memory computer when it is stimulated in direct current and its internal state is read in radio frequency mode. The liquid can recognize digits using either a custom pixel serialization scheme or reservoir computing with an ad&#8208;hoc read&#8208;out neural network layer.








Abstract
Magnetic fluids are excellent candidates for several important research fields including energy harvesting, biomedical applications, soft robotics, and exploration. However, notwithstanding relevant advancements such as shape reconfigurability, that have been demonstrated, there is no evidence for their computing capability, including the emulation of synaptic functions, which requires complex non&#8208;linear dynamics. Here, it is experimentally demonstrated that a Fe3O4 water&#8208;based ferrofluid (FF) can perform electrical analogue computing and be programmed using quasi direct current (DC) signals and read at radio frequency (RF) mode. Features have been observed in all respects attributable to a memristive behavior, featuring both short and long&#8208;term information storage capacity and plasticity. The colloid is capable of classifying digits of a 8&#160;&#215;&#160;8 pixel dataset using a custom in&#8208;memory signal processing scheme, and through physical reservoir computing by training a readout layer. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of in&#8208;memory computing using an amorphous FF system in a liquid aggregation state. This work poses the basis for the exploitation of a FF colloid as both an in&#8208;memory computing device and as a full&#8208;electric liquid computer thanks to its fluidity and the reported complex dynamics, via probing read&#8208;out and programming&#160;ports.

         <title>Bridging Synthesis and Controllable Doping of Monolayer 4 in. Length Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides Single Crystals with High Electron Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe&#8208;assisted epitaxial strategy to synthesize 4 in. length transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) single crystals on c&#8208;plane sapphire is designed, ultrahigh mobility and remarkable on/off current ratio are discovered due to the ultralow contact resistance. The introduction of Fe decreases the formation energy of parallel steps on sapphire surfaces and contributes to the edge&#8208;nucleation of unidirectional alignment of TMDCs domains.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth and controllable doping of wafer&#8208;scale atomically thin semiconductor single crystals are two central tasks to tackle the scaling challenge of transistors. Despite considerable efforts are devoted, addressing such crucial issues simultaneously under 2D confinement is yet to be realized. Here, an ingenious strategy to synthesize record&#8208;breaking 4 in. length Fe&#8208;doped transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) single crystals on industry&#8208;compatible c&#8208;plane sapphire without special miscut angle is designed. Atomically thin transistors with high electron mobility (&#8776;146 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and remarkable on/off current ratio (&#8776;109) are fabricated based on 4 in. length Fe&#8208;MoS2 single crystals, due to the ultralow contact resistance (&#8776;489 &#937; &#181;m). In&#8208;depth characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Fe significantly decreases the formation energy of parallel steps on sapphire surfaces and contributes to the edge&#8208;nucleation of unidirectional alignment TMDCs domains (&gt;99%). This work represents a substantial leap in terms of bridging synthesis and doping of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductor single crystals, which should promote the further device downscaling and extension of Moore's law.

         <title>Brightening Blue Photoluminescence in Nonemission MOF&#8208;2 by Pressure Treatment Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Initially nonemission MOF&#8208;2 shows a conspicuous pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) with bright blue&#8208;light within 7.0&#160;GPa, and the excellent PIE is unprecedentedly retained to ambient conditions with photoluminescence quantum yield up to 70.4%. The hydrogen bonding cooperativity effect effectively elevates the rotational barrier of the linker rotors by pressure treatment engineering, which turns on the photoluminescence in MOF&#8208;2.








Abstract
As equally essential as the synthesis of new materials, maneuvering new structure configurations can endow the brand&#8208;new functional properties to existing materials, which is also one of the core goals in the synthesis community. In this respect, pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) that triggers photoluminescence (PL) in nonemission materials is an emerging stimuli&#8208;responsive smart materials technology. In the PIE paradigms, harvesting bright PL at ambient conditions, however, has remained elusive. Herein, a remarkable PIE phenomenon is reported in initially nonemission Zn(BDC)(DMF)(H2O) (MOF&#8208;2), which shows bright blue&#8208;emission at 455&#160;nm under pressure. Intriguingly, the bright blue PL with an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield up to 70.4% is unprecedentedly retained to ambient conditions upon decompression from 16.2&#160;GPa. The detailed structural analyses combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that hydrogen bonding cooperativity effect elevates powerfully the rotational barrier of the linker rotor to 3.87&#160;eV mol&#8722;1 from initial 0.91&#160;eV mol&#8722;1 through pressure treatment. The downgrade rotational freedom turns on PL of MOF&#8208;2 after releasing pressure completely. This is the first case of harvesting PIE to ambient conditions. These findings offer a new platform for the creation of promising alternatives to high&#8208;performance PL materials based on initially nonemission counterparts.

         <title>An Organic Chiroptical Detector Favoring Circularly Polarized Light Detection from Near&#8208;Infrared to Ultraviolet and Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Amplifying Dissymmetry in Detectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized light detection has attracted growing attention due to the great applications in optical communication and biological detection. Organic chiroptical detectors with circularly polarized light detection ranging from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared are fabricated successfully. Furthermore, the external magnetic field can increase the factor of dissymmetry in electric current from 0.18 to 0.23 at room temperature.








Abstract
Circularly polarized light detection has attracted growing attention because of its unique application in security surveillance and quantum optics. Here, through designing a chiral polymer as a donor, a high&#8208;performance circularly polarized light detector is fabricated, successfully enabling detection from ultraviolet (300&#160;nm) to near&#8208;infrared (1100&#160;nm). The chiroptical detector presents an excellent ability to distinguish right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light, where dissymmetries in detectivity, responsivity, and electric current are obtained and then optimized. The dissymmetry in electric current can be increased from 0.18 to 0.23 once an external magnetic field is applied. This is a very rare report on the dissymmetry tunability by an external field in chiroptical detectors. Moreover, the chirality&#8208;generated orbital angular momentum is one of the key factors determining the performance of the circularly polarized light detection. Overall, the organic chiroptical detector presents excellent stability in detection, which provides great potential for future flexible and compact integrated platforms.

         <title>Full Site&#8208;Specific Addressability in DNA Origami&#8208;Templated Silica Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami&#8208;templated silica nanostructures combine the excellent properties of both materials resulting in a new type of nanostructure with the precise programmability of DNA origami and the mechanical and structural resilience of silica. It is here shown that these structures also retain one of the most attractive features of DNA origami: complete site&#8208;specific addressability for guest molecule placement after silicification.








Abstract
DNA nanotechnology allows for the fabrication of nanometer&#8208;sized objects with high precision and selective addressability as a result of the programmable hybridization of complementary DNA strands. Such structures can template the formation of other materials, including metals and complex silica nanostructures, where the silica shell simultaneously acts to protect the DNA from external detrimental factors. However, the formation of silica nanostructures with site&#8208;specific addressability has thus far not been explored. Here, it is shown that silica nanostructures templated by DNA origami remain addressable for post silicification modification with guest molecules even if the silica shell measures several nm in thickness. The conjugation of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides is used to different silicified DNA origami structures carrying a complementary ssDNA handle as well as DNA&#8208;PAINT super&#8208;resolution imaging to show that ssDNA handles remain unsilicified and thus ensure retained addressability. It is also demonstrated that not only handles, but also ssDNA scaffold segments within a DNA origami nanostructure remain accessible, allowing for the formation of dynamic silica nanostructures. Finally, the power of this approach is demonstrated by forming 3D DNA origami crystals from silicified monomers. These results thus present a fully site&#8208;specifically addressable silica nanostructure with complete control over size and shape.

         <title>Heterologous Assembly of Pleomorphic Bacterial Microcompartment Shell Architectures Spanning the Nano&#8208; to Microscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling shell proteins derived from bacterial microcompartments are a promising new biomaterial with applications in drug delivery, metabolic engineering, cell&#8208;free synthesis, and bioelectronics. A synthetic platform produces pleomorphic shells spanning the nano&#8208; to microscale that are rapidly purified. Geometric models of new morphologies suggest shared design principles with asymmetric carbon and viral protein analogs.








Abstract
Many bacteria use protein&#8208;based organelles known as bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) to organize and sequester sequential enzymatic reactions. Regardless of their specialized metabolic function, all BMCs are delimited by a shell made of multiple structurally redundant, yet functionally diverse, hexameric (BMC&#8208;H), pseudohexameric/trimeric (BMC&#8208;T), or pentameric (BMC&#8208;P) shell protein paralogs. When expressed without their native cargo, shell proteins have been shown to self&#8208;assemble into 2D sheets, open&#8208;ended nanotubes, and closed shells of &#8776;40&#160;nm diameter that are being developed as scaffolds and nanocontainers for applications in biotechnology. Here, by leveraging a strategy for affinity&#8208;based purification, it is demonstrated that a wide range of empty synthetic shells, many differing in end&#8208;cap structures, can be derived from a glycyl radical enzyme&#8208;associated microcompartment. The range of pleomorphic shells observed, which span &#8776;2 orders of magnitude in size from &#8776;25&#160;nm to &#8776;1.8&#160;&#181;m, reveal the remarkable plasticity of BMC&#8208;based biomaterials. In addition, new capped nanotube and nanocone morphologies are observed that are consistent with a multicomponent geometric model in which architectural principles are shared among asymmetric carbon, viral protein, and BMC&#8208;based structures.

&lt;p&gt;Self-assembling shell proteins derived from bacterial microcompartments are a promising new biomaterial with applications in drug delivery, metabolic engineering, cell-free synthesis, and bioelectronics. A synthetic platform produces pleomorphic shells spanning the nano- to microscale that are rapidly purified. Geometric models of new morphologies suggest shared design principles with asymmetric carbon and viral protein analogs.

         <title>A Nitroxide Radical Conjugated Polymer as an Additive to Reduce Nonradiative Energy Loss in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitroxide radical side chain substituted conjugated polymer, GDTA, employed as a solid additive to generally boost the power conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells from a broad range of photovoltaic material systems, especially for the nonfullerene acceptor&#8208;based cells, is reported.








Abstract
Nonfullerene&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based organic solar cells (NFA&#8208;OSCs) are now set off to the 20% power conversion efficiency milestone. To achieve this, minimizing all loss channels, including nonradiative photovoltage losses, seems a necessity. Nonradiative recombination, to a great extent, is known to be an inherent material property due to vibrationally induced decay of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) states or their back electron transfer to the triplet excitons. Herein, it is shown that the use of a new conjugated nitroxide radical polymer with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl piperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl side groups (GDTA) as an additive results in an improvement of the photovoltaic performance of NFA&#8208;OSCs based on different active layer materials. Upon the addition of GDTA, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) improve simultaneously. This approach is applied to several material systems including state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art donor/acceptor pairs showing improvement from 15.8% to 17.6% (in the case of PM6:Y6) and from 17.5% to 18.3% (for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9). Then, the possible reasons behind the observed improvements are discussed. The results point toward the suppression of the CT state to triplet excitons loss channel. This work presents a facile, promising, and generic approach to further improve the performance of NFA&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>A Conformable Ultrasound Patch for Cavitation&#8208;Enhanced Transdermal Cosmeceutical Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft, conformable embodiment of a wearable ultrasound patch for transdermal delivery of cosmeceuticals to the skin is reported. The patch comprises a 2D array of bulk piezoelectric transducers embedded in a poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrate. The patch demonstrates a 26.2&#8208;fold enhancement in the delivery of niacinamide to porcine skin in vitro with 10 min ultrasound application.








Abstract
Increased consumer interest in healthy&#8208;looking skin demands a safe and effective method to increase transdermal absorption of innovative therapeutic cosmeceuticals. However, permeation of small&#8208;molecule drugs is limited by the innate barrier function of the stratum corneum. Here, a conformable ultrasound patch (cUSP) that enhances transdermal transport of niacinamide by inducing intermediate&#8208;frequency sonophoresis in the fluid coupling medium between the patch and the skin is reported. The cUSP consists of piezoelectric transducers embedded in a soft elastomer to create localized cavitation pockets (0.8 cm2, 1&#160;mm deep) over larger areas of conformal contact (20 cm2). Multiphysics simulation models, acoustic spectrum analysis, and high&#8208;speed videography are used to characterize transducer deflection, acoustic pressure fields, and resulting cavitation bubble dynamics in the coupling medium. The final system demonstrates a 26.2&#8208;fold enhancement in niacinamide transport in a porcine model in vitro with a 10 min ultrasound application, demonstrating the suitability of the device for short&#8208;exposure, large&#8208;area application of sonophoresis for patients and consumers suffering from skin conditions and premature skin aging.

         <title>Colorful Electrochromic Displays with High Visual Quality Based on Porous Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design strategy that is structured around a new type of porous metamaterial is developed to circumvent the critical problem in electrochromic displays, which offers personalized devices that exhibit non&#8208;iridescent and large viewable angles, fast switching responses, excellent cycling performance, and extremely low power consumption.








Abstract
The introduction of metamaterials into electrochromic (EC) displays has recently inspired a great breakthrough in the EC field, as this can offer a variety of new attractive features, from a very wide gamut of colors to very fast switching times. However, such metamaterial&#8208;based EC displays still face significant constraints when developing from single electrodes to full devices, because other supportive&#160;components in devices, such as counter electrodes and electrolytes, significantly affect light propagation and the subsequent perceived color quality in metamaterial&#8208;based EC devices. Herein, a new, cost&#8208;effective device design structured around a new type of porous metamaterial is reported to circumvent the critical problem in metamaterial&#8208;based EC displays. Owing to its unique design, the metamaterial&#8208;based EC device achieves good color quality with no drop in brightness or shift in color chromaticity when compared with a single electrode. Moreover, the porous&#8208;metamaterial&#8208;based EC device can exhibit non&#8208;iridescence and be viewed from a wide range of angles (5&#176;&#8211;85&#176;) and has fast switching response (2.4 and 2.5 s for coloration and bleaching, respectively), excellent cycling performance (at least 2000 cycles), and extremely low power consumption (4.0&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Multimodal&#8208;Driven Magnetic Microrobots with Enhanced Bactericidal Activity for Biofilm Eradication and Removal from Titanium Mesh</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic microrobots, composed of halloysite nanotubes (backbone), iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (magnetic actuators), and coated with polyethylenimine in order to load ampicillin, exhibit multimodal and reconfigurable motion. These magnetic microrobots are used to kill and remove efficiently Staphylococcus aureus biofilm colonized on titanium mesh used for bone restoration.








Abstract
Modern micro/nanorobots can perform multiple tasks for biomedical and environmental applications. Particularly, magnetic microrobots can be completely controlled by a rotating magnetic field and their motion powered and controlled without the use of toxic fuels, which makes them most promising for biomedical application. Moreover, they are able to form swarms, allowing them to perform specific tasks at a larger scale than a single microrobot. In this work, they developed magnetic microrobots composed of halloysite nanotubes as backbone and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles as magnetic material allowing magnetic propulsion and covered these with polyethylenimine to load ampicillin and prevent the microrobots from disassembling. These microrobots exhibit multimodal motion as single robots as well as in swarms. In addition, they can transform from tumbling to spinning motion and vice&#8208;versa, and when in swarm mode they can change their motion from vortex to ribbon and back again. Finally, the vortex motion mode is used to penetrate and disrupt the extracellular matrix of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm colonized on titanium mesh used for bone restoration, which improves the effect of the antibiotic's activity. Such magnetic microrobots for biofilm removal from medical implants could reduce implant rejection and improve patients&#8217; well&#8208;being.

Such magnetic microrobots for biofilm removal from medical implants could reduce implant rejection and improve patients&#8217; well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Mixed Conduction in a Fused Oligomer n&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductor Enabled by 3D Transport Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fused and highly electron&#8208;deficient oligomeric organic semiconductor bridging the small&#8208;molecule and polymeric semiconductor domains is presented. By careful control of side&#8208;chain motifs, a highly efficient mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor is obtained. The high performance is ascribed to favorable interactions between semiconductor and aqueous electrolyte that result in a molecular packing with oblique orientation enabling 3D transport pathways.








Abstract
Tailoring organic semiconductors to facilitate mixed conduction of ionic and electronic charges when interfaced with an aqueous media has spurred many recent advances in organic bioelectronics. The field is still restricted, however, by very few n&#8208;type (electron&#8208;transporting) organic semiconductors with adequate performance metrics. Here, a new electron&#8208;deficient, fused polycyclic aromatic system, TNR, is reported with excellent n&#8208;type mixed conduction properties including a &#181;C* figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value exceeding 30 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for the best performing derivative. Comprising three naphthalene bis&#8208;isatin moieties, this new molecular design builds on successful small&#8208;molecule mixed conductors; by extending the molecular scaffold into the oligomer domain, good film&#8208;forming properties, strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and consequently excellent charge&#8208;transport properties are obtained. Through judicious optimization of the side chains, the linear oligoether and branched alkyl chain derivative bgTNR is obtained which shows superior mixed conduction in an organic electrochemical transistor configuration including an electron mobility around 0.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. By optimizing the side chains, the dominant molecular packing can be changed from a preferential edge&#8208;on orientation (with high charge&#8208;transport anisotropy) to an oblique orientation that can support 3D transport pathways which in turn ensure highly efficient mixed conduction properties across the bulk semiconductor film.

         <title>Horizontal and Vertical Coalescent Microrobotic Collectives Using Ferrofluid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed coalescent collective system exploits the ferrofluid droplets' splitting and coalescence properties to trigger the formation of horizontal and vertical collectives. Under a&#160;time&#8208;varying magnetic field, the droplet swarm exhibits a variety of morphologies ranging from vortex&#8208;like, chain&#8208;like, and crystal&#8208;like patterns, to vertical layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer patterns. The reconfigurability of these droplet collectives significantly extends the functionality of ferrofluid&#8208;based soft robots.








Abstract
Many artificial miniature robotic collectives have been developed to overcome the inherent limitations of inadequate individual capabilities. However, the basic building blocks of the reported collectives are mainly in the solid state, where the morphological boundaries of internal individuals are clear and cannot genuinely merge. Miniature robotic collectives based on liquid units still need to be explored; such on&#8208;demand mergeable swarm systems are advantageous for adapting to the changing external environment. Here, a strategy to achieve a coalescent collective system we&#160;presented that exploits the ferrofluid droplets' splitting and coalescence properties to trigger the formation of horizontal multimodal and vertical gravity&#8208;resistant collectives and unveil pattern&#8208;enabled robotic functionalities. When subjected to a time&#8208;varying magnetic field, the droplet swarm exhibits a variety of morphologies ranging from horizontal collectives, including vortex&#8208;like, chain&#8208;like, and crystal&#8208;like patterns to vertical layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer patterns. Using experiments and simulations, the formation and transformation of different morphological collectives are shown and their robust environmental adaptability are demonstrated. Potential applications of the multimodal droplet collectives are presented, including exploring an unknown environment, targeted object delivery, and fluid flow filtration in a lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip. This work may facilitate the design of microrobotic swarm systems and expand the range of materials for miniature robots.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Small Molecule Organic Solar Cells Enabled by a Symmetric&#8208;Asymmetric Alloy Acceptor with a Broad Composition Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and stable ternary system by introducing a new asymmetric electron acceptor SSe&#8208;NIC into the MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9 host system is developed, which exhibits a record&#8208;high PCE of 18.02% and demonstrates better operational stability as compared to the host system.








Abstract
Using a combinatory blending strategy is demonstrated as a promising path for designing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) by boosting the short&#8208;circuit current density and fill factor. Herein, a high&#8208;performance ternary all&#8208;small molecule OSC (all&#8208;SMOSCs) using a narrow&#8208;bandgap alloy acceptor containing symmetric and asymmetric molecules (BTP&#8208;eC9 and SSe&#8208;NIC) and a wide&#8208;bandgap small molecule donor MPhS&#8208;C2 is reported. Introducing the synthesized SSe&#8208;NIC into the MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9 host system can broaden the absorption spectrum, modulate energy offsets, and optimize the molecular packing of the host materials. After systematically optimizing the weight ratio of MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9:SSe&#8208;NIC, a champion efficiency of 18.02% is achieved. Impressively, the ternary system not only delivered a broad composition tolerance with device efficiencies over 17% throughout the whole blend ratios, but also exhibited less non&#8208;geminate recombination and energy loss, and better&#8208;light&#8208;soaking stability than the corresponding binary systems. This work promotes the development of high&#8208;performance ternary all&#8208;SMOSCs and heralds their brighter application prospects.

         <title>Impairing Tumor Metabolic Plasticity via a Stable Metal&#8208;Phenolic&#8208;Based Polymeric Nanomedicine to Suppress Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
pOEG&#8208;b&#8208;D&#8208;SH@NP with favorable stability and enhanced tumor&#8208;targeting ability simultaneously inhibits oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in CT26 cells, and shifts the balance of programmed cell death from apoptosis toward necroptosis, which induces severe energy crisis and avoids single&#8208;targeting therapeutic tolerance due to metabolic plasticity, thus potently suppressing colorectal cancer growth and peritoneal intestinal metastasis in mouse models.








Abstract
Targeting metabolic vulnerability of tumor cells is a promising anticancer strategy. However, the therapeutic efficacy of existing metabolism&#8208;regulating agents is often compromised due to tolerance resulting from tumor metabolic plasticity, as well as their poor bioavailability and tumor&#8208;targetability. Inspired by the inhibitive effect of N&#8208;ethylmaleimide on the mitochondrial function, a dendronized&#8208;polymer&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;phenolic nanomedicine (pOEG&#8208;b&#8208;D&#8208;SH@NP) encapsulating maleimide&#8208;modified doxorubicin (Mal&#8208;DOX) is developed to enable improvement in the overall delivery efficiency and inhibition of the tumor metabolism via multiple pathways. It is observed that Mal&#8208;DOX and its derived nanomedicine induces energy depletion of CT26 colorectal cancer cells more efficiently than doxorubicin, and shifts the balance of programmed cell death from apoptosis toward necroptosis. Notably, pOEG&#8208;b&#8208;D&#8208;SH@NP simultaneously inhibits cellular oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, thus potently suppressing cancer growth and peritoneal intestinal metastasis in mouse models. Overall, the study provides a promising dendronized&#8208;polymer&#8208;derived nanoplatform for the treatment of cancers through impairing metabolic plasticity.

         <title>Target&#8208;Driven Design of Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Materials via Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target&#8208;driven materials design framework combining high&#8208;throughput calculations, crystal structure prediction, and machine learning is proposed to accelerate the discovery of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials. The machine learning regression model for predicting birefringence is developed for the first time. As&#160;an application, eight compounds with promising NLO&#8208;related properties which show potential applications in the deep&#8208;UV region are identified.








Abstract
The development of a data&#8208;driven science paradigm is greatly revolutionizing the process of materials discovery. Particularly, exploring novel nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with the birefringent phase&#8208;matching ability to deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) region is of vital significance for the field of laser technologies. Herein, a target&#8208;driven materials design framework combining high&#8208;throughput calculations (HTC), crystal structure prediction, and interpretable machine learning (ML) is proposed to accelerate the discovery of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials. Using a dataset generated from HTC, an ML regression model for predicting birefringence is developed for the first time, which exhibits a possibility of achieving fast and accurate prediction. Essentially, crystal structures are adopted as the only known input of this model to establish a close structure&#8208;property relationship mapping birefringence. Utilizing the ML&#8208;predicted birefringence which can affect the shortest phase&#8208;matching wavelength, a full list of potential chemical compositions based on an efficient screening strategy is identified. Further, eight structures with good stability are discovered to show potential applications in the deep&#8208;UV region, owing to their promising NLO&#8208;related properties. This study provides a new insight into the discovery of NLO materials and this design framework can identify desired materials with high performances in the broad chemical space at a low computational cost.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Doped Heterointerfaced Ru/RuSe2 Nanosheets with Optimized H and H2O Adsorption Boost Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 heterogeneous nanosheets for highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is designed and synthesized. The superior HER performance is attributed to a synergistic effect of the unique heterogeneous interface structure and Cu doping, which leads to the optimized H and H2O adsorption to boost hydrogen evolution catalysis.








Abstract
Ruthenium chalcogenide is a highly promising catalytic system as a Pt alternative for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, well&#8208;studied ruthenium selenide (RuSe2) still exhibits sluggish HER kinetics in alkaline media due to the inappropriate adsorption strength of H and H2O. Herein, xx report a new design of Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 heterogeneous nanosheets (NSs) with optimized H and H2O adsorption strength for highly efficient HER catalysis in alkaline media. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superior HER performance is attributed to a synergistic effect of the unique heterointerfaced structure and Cu doping, which not only optimizes the electronic structure with a suitable d&#8208;band center to suppress proton overbinding but also alleviates the energy barrier with enhanced H2O adsorption. As a result, Cu&#8208;doped heterogeneous Ru/RuSe2 NSs exhibit a small overpotential of 23&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a low Tafel slope of 58.5&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 and a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.88 s&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mV for HER in alkaline media, which is among the best catalysts in noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward HER. The present Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 NSs interface catalyst is very stable for HER by showing no activity decay after 5000&#8208;cycle potential sweeps. This work heralds that heterogeneous interface modulation opens up a new strategy for the designing of more efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Space&#8208;Confined Metal Ion Strategy for Carbon Materials Derived from Cobalt Benzimidazole Frameworks with High Desalination Performance in Simulated Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various metal ions (Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Ti4+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Ce4+) with different valence states are confined in the quasi&#8208;microcube shaped cobalt benzimidazole frameworks (CoZIF9) using a space&#8208;confined synthesis strategy. A series of derived carbon materials with limited metal ions are obtained through high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis and applied in capacitive deionization.








Abstract
Various metal ions with different valence states (Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Ti4+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Ce4+) are successfully confined in quasi&#8208;microcube shaped cobalt benzimidazole frameworks using a space&#8208;confined synthesis strategy. More importantly, a series of derived carbon materials that confine metal ions are obtained by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. Interestingly, the derived carbon materials exhibited electric double&#8208;layer and pseudocapacitance properties because of the presence of metal ions with various valence states. Moreover, the presence of additional metal ions within carbon materials may create new phases, which can accelerate Na+ insertion/extraction and thus increase electrochemical adsorption. Density functional theory results showed that carbon materials in which Ti ions are confined exhibit enhanced insertion/extraction of Na+ resulting from the presence of the characteristic anatase crystalline phases of TiO2. The Ti&#8208;containing materials have an impressive desalination capacity (62.8&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1) in capacitive deionization (CDI) applications with high cycling stability. This work provides a facile synthetic strategy for the confinement of metal ions in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and thus supports the further development of derived carbon materials for seawater desalination by CDI.

         <title>Module&#8208;Assembled Elastomer Showing Large Strain Stiffening Capability and High Stretchability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elastomer with controlled polymer network structure is synthesized via the module&#8208;assembly strategy. The elastomer shows not only a high mechanical strength, stretchability, and damage tolerance, but also unprecedented strain&#8208;stiffening capability, where the apparent stiffness increases by &#8776;2000&#8208;fold upon stretching. This unusual strain stiffening is caused by strain&#8208;induced ordering of network chains.








Abstract
Elastomers are indispensable materials due to their flexible, stretchable, and elastic nature. However, the polymer network structure constituting an elastomer is generally inhomogeneous, limiting the performance of the material. Here, a highly stretchable elastomer with unprecedented strain&#8208;stiffening capability is developed based on a highly homogeneous network structure enabled by a module assembly strategy. The elastomer is synthesized by efficient end&#8208;linking of a star&#8208;shaped aliphatic polyester precursor with a narrow molecular&#8208;weight distribution. The resulting product shows high strength (&#8776;26&#160;MPa) and remarkable stretchability (stretch ratio at break &#8776;1900%), as well as good fatigue resistance and notch insensitivity. Moreover, it shows extraordinary strain&#8208;stiffening capability (&gt;2000&#8208;fold increase in the apparent stiffness) that exceeds the performance of any existing soft material. These unique properties are due to strain&#8208;induced ordering of the polymer chains in a uniformly stretched network, as revealed by in situ X&#8208;ray scattering analyses. The utility of this great strain&#8208;stiffening capability is demonstrated by realizing a simple variable stiffness actuator for soft robotics.

         <title>Fill in the Blank: Transferrable Deep Learning Approaches to Recover Missing Physical Field Information</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tackling with engineering problems requires filling in missing information and translation from limited data input to understand complex material behaviors. This study provides a deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based method to complete mechanical fields given part of the domain, further identify the internal composite microstructures, and solve the inverse problem in an efficient way, which overcomes the difficulty conventional approaches are faced with.








Abstract
Solving materials engineering tasks is often hindered by limited information, such as in inverse problems with only boundary data information or design tasks with a simple objective but a vast search space. To address these challenges, multiple deep learning (DL) architectures are leveraged to predict missing mechanical information given limited known data in part of the domain, and further characterize the composite geometries from the recovered mechanical fields for 2D and 3D complex microstructures. In 2D, a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) is utilized to complete partially masked field maps and predict the composite geometry with convolutional models with great accuracy and generality by making precise predictions on field data with mixed stress/strain components, hierarchical geometries, distinct materials properties and various types of microstructures including ill&#8208;posed inverse problems. In 3D, a Transformer&#8208;based architecture is implemented to predict complete 3D mechanical fields from input field snapshots. The model manifests excellent performance regardless of microstructural complexity and recovers the entire bulk field even from a single surface field image, allowing internal structural characterization from only boundary measurements. The whole frameworks provide efficient ways for analysis and design with incomplete information and allow the direct inverse translation from properties back to materials structures.

         <title>Bifunctional Ultrathin RhRu0.5&#8208;Alloy Nanowire Electrocatalysts for Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional ultrathin RhRu0.5&#8208;alloy wavy nanowire electrocatalysts are designed and synthesized via a facile solvothermal method, demonstrating excellent performance for the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and offering an attractive electrocatalyst system for hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis without ammonia as a byproduct.








Abstract
Hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis offers a feasible path for low&#8208;voltage green hydrogen production. Herein, the design and synthesis of ultrathin RhRu0.5&#8208;alloy wavy nanowires as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. It is shown that the RhRu0.5&#8208;alloy wavy nanowires can achieve complete electrooxidation of hydrazine with a low overpotential and high mass activity, as well as improved performance for the HER. The resulting RhRu0.5 bifunctional electrocatalysts enable, high performance hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis delivering a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at an ultralow cell voltage of 54 mV and a high current density of 853&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 0.6&#160;V. The RhRu0.5&#160;electrocatalysts further demonstrate a stable operation at a high current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 80 hours of testing period with little irreversible degradation. The overall performance greatly&#160;exceeds that of the previously reported hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolyzers, offering a pathway for efficiently converting hazardous hydrazine into molecular hydrogen.

         <title>Molecular Sensitization Enabled High Performance Organic Metal Halide Hybrid Scintillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new material design concept is developed for the preparation of high performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillation materials via low&#8208;temperature processes. With metal halides as X&#8208;ray sensitizer and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) organic cations as emitter, a single crystalline 0D organic metal halide hybrid ((TPA&#8208;P)2ZnBr4) is discovered to exhibit radioluminescence with an absolute light yield of 14,700 &#177; 800 Photons/MeV and a short decay lifetime of 9.96&#160;ns.








Abstract
Scintillators, one of the essential components in medical imaging and security checking devices, rely heavily on rare&#8208;earth&#8208;containing inorganic materials. Here, a new type of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillators containing earth abundant elements that can be prepared via low&#8208;temperature processes is reported. With room temperature co&#8208;crystallization of an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) organic halide, 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino) phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(propyl)&#8208;pyrindin&#8208;1ium bromide (TPA&#8208;PBr), and a metal halide, zinc bromide (ZnBr2), a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D)&#160;organic metal halide hybrid (TPA&#8208;P)2ZnBr4 with a yellowish&#8208;green emission peaked at 550&#160;nm has been developed. In this hybrid material, dramatically enhanced X&#8208;ray scintillation of TPA&#8208;P+ is achieved via the sensitization by ZnBr42&#8722;. The absolute light yield (14,700&#160;&#177;&#160;800 Photons/MeV) of (TPA&#8208;P)2ZnBr4 is found to be higher than that of anthracene (&#8776;13,500 Photons/MeV), a well&#8208;known organic scintillator, while its X&#8208;ray absorption is comparable to those of inorganic scintillators. With TPA&#8208;P+ as an emitting center, short photoluminescence and radioluminescence decay lifetimes of 3.56 and 9.96&#160;ns have been achieved. Taking the advantages of high X&#8208;ray absorption of metal halides and efficient radioluminescence with short decay lifetimes of organic cations, the material design paves a new pathway to address the issues of low X&#8208;ray absorption of organic scintillators and long decay lifetimes of inorganic scintillators simultaneously.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles: Efficient Nanozyme for Enhancing Tumor Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultra&#8208;small PtPdRuRhIr high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (US&#8208;HEANPs) are fabricated by the universal metal&#8208;ligand cross&#8208;linking strategy. This strategy takes advantage of simplicity, scalability, and genericity. The developed US&#8208;HEANPs exhibit excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity and possess a high photothermal conversion effect. Under the synergistic effects of peroxidase&#8208;like activity and photothermal action, the US&#8208;HEANPs can effectively ablate cancer cells and treat tumors.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys nanoparticles (HEANPs) are receiving extensive attention due to their broad compositional tunability and unlimited potential in bioapplication. However, developing new methods to prepare ultra&#8208;small high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (US&#8208;HEANPs) faces severe challenges owing to their intrinsic thermodynamic instability. Furthermore, there are few reports on studying the effect of HEANPs in tumor therapy. Herein, the fabricated PtPdRuRhIr US&#8208;HEANPs act as bifunctional nanoplatforms for the highly efficient treatment of tumors. The US&#8208;HEANPs are engineered by the universal metal&#8208;ligand cross&#8208;linking strategy. This simple and scalable strategy is based on the aldol condensation of organometallics to form the target US&#8208;HEANPs. The synthesized US&#8208;HEANPs exhibit excellent peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) activity and can catalyze the endogenous hydrogen peroxide to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, the US&#8208;HEANPs possess a high photothermal conversion effect for converting 808&#160;nm near&#8208;infrared light into heat energy. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that under the synergistic effect of POD&#8208;like activity and photothermal action, the US&#8208;HEANPs can effectively ablate cancer cells and treat tumors. It is believed that this work not only provides a new perspective for the fabrication of HEANPs, but also opens the high&#8208;entropy nanozymes research direction and their biomedical application.

         <title>Asymmetrically Coordinated CoB1N3 Moieties for Selective Generation of High&#8208;Valence Co&#8208;Oxo Species via Coupled Electron&#8211;Proton Transfer in Fenton&#8208;like Reactions</title>

Asymmetrically coordinated CoB1N3 offers an external electric field for the cleavage of O&#63743;H bond to boost the selective conversion of high&#8208;valence Co&#8208;Oxo species in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, upon which the rational design of tunable active sites at atomic level in triggering efficient Fenton&#8208;like reactions is expected.








Abstract
High&#8208;valence metal species generated in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like processes are promising candidates for selective degradation of contaminants in water, the formation of which necessitates the cleavage of O&#63743;H and O&#63743;O bonds as well as efficient electron transfer. However, the high dissociation energy of O&#63743;H bond makes its cleavage quite challenging, largely hampering the selective generation of reactive oxygen species. Herein, an asymmetrical configuration characterized by a single cobalt atom coordinated with boron and nitrogen (CoB1N3) is established to offer a strong local electric field, upon which the cleavage of O&#63743;H bond is thermodynamically favored via a promoted coupled electron&#8211;proton transfer process, which serves an essential step to further allow O&#63743;O bond cleavage and efficient electron transfer. Accordingly, the selective formation of Co(IV)&#63742;O in a single&#8208;atom Co/PMS system enables highly efficient removal performance toward various organic pollutants. The proposed strategy also holds true in other heteroatom doping systems to configure asymmetric coordination, thus paving alternative pathways for specific reactive species conversion by rationalized design of catalysts at atomic level toward environmental applications and more.

         <title>Atomic Displacements Enabling the Observation of the Anomalous Hall Effect in a Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis shows that in thin films of some non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets the magnetic atoms can be displaced away from high&#8208;symmetry positions. The resulting spin canting allows for control of domain structure. In Mn3SnN this allows for the observation of an unusual temperature&#8208;dependent anomalous Hall effect that indicates the presence of a coherent spin&#8208;rotational non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnetic phase.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets with non&#8208;collinear spin structures display various properties that make them attractive for spintronic devices. Some of the most interesting examples are an anomalous Hall effect despite negligible magnetization and a spin Hall effect with unusual spin polarization directions. However, these effects can only be observed when the sample is set predominantly into a single antiferromagnetic domain state. This can only be achieved when the compensated spin structure is perturbed and displays weak moments due to spin canting that allows for external domain control. In thin films of cubic non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets, this imbalance is previously assumed to require tetragonal distortions induced by substrate strain. Here, it is shown that in Mn3SnN and Mn3GaN, spin canting is due to structural symmetry lowering induced by large displacements of the magnetic manganese atoms away from high&#8208;symmetry positions. These displacements remain hidden in X&#8208;ray diffraction when only probing the lattice metric and require measurement of a large set of scattering vectors to resolve the local atomic positions. In Mn3SnN, the induced net moments enable the observation of the anomalous Hall effect with an unusual temperature dependence, which is conjectured to result from a bulk&#8208;like temperature&#8208;dependent coherent spin rotation within the kagome&#160;plane.

         <title>An Integrally Formed Janus Hydrogel for Robust Wet&#8208;Tissue Adhesive and Anti&#8208;Postoperative Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrally formed asymmetrically adhesive hydrogel is fabricated by controlling the interfacial distribution of free &#8211;COOH groups via simply adjusting the stirring speed. The difference in adhesive strength achieves as high as 20 times between the two sides of one hydrogel, which attains one&#8208;sided robust adhesion to the wet tissue, simultaneously preventing the postoperative adhesion for the opposite side.








Abstract
Facile fabrication of asymmetrically adhesive hydrogel with robust wet tissue adhesion simultaneously with effective anti&#8208;postoperative adhesion still remains a great challenge. In this work, an integrally formed Janus hydrogel is facilely fabricated in one step by controlling the interfacial distribution of free carboxyl groups on the two sides of hydrogels. At a lower stirring speed, the generated bigger sized emulsion droplets mainly occupy the top surface of hydrogel, which effectively hinders the exposition of carboxyl groups on the top surface, driving them to be more distributed on the bottom surface, ultimately resulting in the poor adhesion of top surface but robust adhesion of bottom surface to various wet tissue even underwater. The difference in adhesive strength achieves as high as 20 times between the two surfaces. In vivo rabbit experiment outcomes clearly validate that the bottom surface of hydrogel firmly adheres to the stomach defect, and the other opposite surface can efficiently address the postoperative adhesion problem. Besides, this hydrogel exhibits superior mechanical toughness and conductivity which has been used as a highly adhesive strain sensor to real&#8208;time monitor the beating heart in vivo. This simple yet effective strategy provides a much more feasible approach for creating Janus hydrogels bioadhesives.

         <dc:description>
A new series of hydrophobic conducting polymers containing pyrrolopyrrole (PPr) and thioalkylated/alkylated bithiophene (SBT/BT) moieties is designed and synthesized to serve as hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) for tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells to attain a power conversion efficiency of 7.6% with shelf&#8208;storage stability over 6000 h, which opens a new avenue for future development of non&#8208;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) HTMs with great performance and stability.








Abstract
A new set of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based (PPr) polymers incorporated with thioalkylated/alkylated bithiophene (SBT/BT) is synthesized and explored as hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) for Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Three bithiophenyl spacers bearing the thioalkylated hexyl (SBT&#8208;6), thioalkylated tetradecyl (SBT&#8208;14), and tetradecyl (BT&#8208;14) chains are utilized to examine the effect of the alkyl chain lengths. Among them, the TPSCs are fabricated using PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 as HTMs through a two&#8208;step approach by attaining a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.6% with a remarkable long&#8208;term stability beyond 6000 h, which has not been reported elsewhere for a non&#8208;PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based TPSC. The PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 device is stable under light irradiation for 5 h in air (50% relative humidity) at the maximum power point (MPP). The highly planar structure, strong intramolecular S(alkyl)&#183;&#183;&#183;S(thiophene) interactions, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation of SBT enable the PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 device to outperform the standard poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene,&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl (P3HT) and other devices. The longer thio&#8208;tetradecyl chain in SBT&#8208;14 restricts molecular rotation and strongly affects the molecular conformation, solubility, and film wettability over other polymers. Thus, the present study makes a promising dopant&#8208;free polymeric HTM model for the future design of highly efficient and stable TPSCs.

Interfacial nonradiative recombination loss is a huge barrier to advance the photovoltaic performance. Here, one effective interfacial defect and carrier dynamics management strategy by synergistic modulation of functional groups and spatial conformation of ammonium salt molecules is proposed. The surface treatment with 3&#8208;ammonium propionic acid iodide (3&#8208;APAI) does not form 2D perovskite passivation layer while the propylammonium ions and 5&#8208;aminopentanoic acid hydroiodide post&#8208;treatment lead to the formation of 2D perovskite passivation layers. Due to appropriate alkyl chain length, theoretical and experimental results manifest that &#63743;COOH and &#63743;NH3+ groups in 3&#8208;APAI molecules can form coordination bonding with undercoordinated Pb2+ and ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding with octahedron PbI64&#8722;, respectively, which makes both groups be simultaneously firmly anchored on the surface of perovskite films. This will strengthen defect passivation effect and improve interfacial carrier transport and transfer. The synergistic effect of functional groups and spatial conformation confers 3&#8208;APAI better defect passivation effect than 2D perovskite layers. The 3&#8208;APAI&#8208;modified device based on vacuum flash technology achieves an alluring peak efficiency of 24.72% (certified 23.68%), which is among highly efficient devices fabricated without antisolvents. Furthermore, the encapsulated 3&#8208;APAI&#8208;modified device degrades by less than 4% after 1400&#160;h of continuous one sun illumination.

&lt;p&gt;An effective interfacial defect and carrier management strategy is developed by synergistically modulating organic functional groups and spatial conformation of organic ammonium salt modification molecules. The 3-ammonium propionic acid iodide-modified device based on vacuum flash technology achieves an alluring peak efficiency of 24.72% (certified 23.68%), which is among highly efficient devices fabricated without antisolvents.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interfacial nonradiative recombination loss is a huge barrier to advance the photovoltaic performance. Here, one effective interfacial defect and carrier dynamics management strategy by synergistic modulation of functional groups and spatial conformation of ammonium salt molecules is proposed. The surface treatment with 3-ammonium propionic acid iodide (3-APAI) does not form 2D perovskite passivation layer while the propylammonium ions and 5-aminopentanoic acid hydroiodide post-treatment lead to the formation of 2D perovskite passivation layers. Due to appropriate alkyl chain length, theoretical and experimental results manifest that &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;COOH and &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups in 3-APAI molecules can form coordination bonding with undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding with octahedron PbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, which makes both groups be simultaneously firmly anchored on the surface of perovskite films. This will strengthen defect passivation effect and improve interfacial carrier transport and transfer. The synergistic effect of functional groups and spatial conformation confers 3-APAI better defect passivation effect than 2D perovskite layers. The 3-APAI-modified device based on vacuum flash technology achieves an alluring peak efficiency of 24.72% (certified 23.68%), which is among highly efficient devices fabricated without antisolvents. Furthermore, the encapsulated 3-APAI-modified device degrades by less than 4% after 1400&#160;h of continuous one sun illumination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Transdermal Drug Delivery
In article 2300066, Canan Dagdeviren and co&#8208;workers report a soft, conformable embodiment of a wearable ultrasound patch for transdermal delivery of cosmeceuticals to the skin. The patch comprises a 2D array of bulk piezoelectric transducers embedded in a poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrate. The patch demonstrates a 26.2&#8208;fold enhancement in the delivery of niacinamide to porcine skin in vitro with 10 min ultrasound application.

Hydrogel Bioadhesive
In article number 2300394, Tao Liu, Zhenzhen Liu, and co&#8208;workers propose a facile strategy to construct an asymmetrically adhesive hydrogel bioadhesive in one&#8208;step. The difference in adhesive strength achieved is as high as 20 times that between the two sides of one hydrogel, attaining one&#8208;sided robust adhesion to wet tissue, simultaneously preventing post&#8208;operative adhesion for the opposite side.

Artificial Intelligence
The search for new advanced materials has been a slow process, in which testing numerous compositions, morphologies etc. for their properties slows down discovery. High&#8208;throughput screening methods can greatly benefit from incorporating artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, techniques. These two routes combine in a cycle of materials science and technology progress reviewed by Cefe L&#243;pez in article number 2208683.

Colloidal Self Assembly
In article number 2211197, Dwaipayan Chakrabarti and co&#8208;workers report on the self&#8208;assembly of enantiomorphic single colloidal gyroid crystals in silico from designer chiral patchy spheres. Each of these crystals is shown to support a complete photonic bandgap, whilst also exhibiting rich chiroptical properties. This computational study introduces single colloidal gyroids as attractive targets for chiral photonic crystals operating at optical frequencies. Image credit: Wesley Flavell.

In&#8208;Memory Computing
In article number 2211406, Alessandro Chiolerio and co&#8208;workers report that an Fe3O4 water&#8208;based ferrofluid can perform electrical analogue computing and can be programmed using quasi&#8208;direct&#8208;current (DC) signals and read at radio&#8208;frequency (RF) mode. The colloid is capable of classifying digits of an 8 &#215; 8 pixel dataset through physical reservoir computing by training a readout layer.

Multicompartment Supraparticles
In article number 2211244, J. Scott VanEpps, Nicholas A. Kotov, and co&#8208;workers report how l&#8208;cysteine&#8208;stabilized FeS2 nanoparticles self&#8208;assemble into supraparticles with multiple interconnected compartments. Their structure can be described by graph theoretical representations that show similar organization and complexity to those of viruses. Similarly to the latter, the inorganic supraparticles pack the nucleic acid cargo for intracellular delivery while protecting it against environmental factors, such as temperature.

Circular Polarized Light Detection
In article number 2211935, Renjie Hu, Wei Qin, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate how a chiral polymer PCDTPT can achieve clear resolution of circularly polarized light (CPL) from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regions based on the optimized device structures. The chirality&#8208;generated orbital angular momentum is one of the key factors determining the performance of circularly polarized light detection. Moreover, a magnetic field can enhance circularly polarized light detection, which provides a new perspective for the subsequent development of polarized light detectors.

         <title>Convective Thermal Metamaterials: Exploring High&#8208;Efficiency, Directional, and Wave&#8208;Like Heat Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Providing a new knob for controlling heat transfer, convective effects have gained significant interest in the design of thermal metamaterials. With the introduced efficient, directional, and wave&#8208;like heat transfer, many novel phenomena are observed in dissipative regime. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advancements in this emerging field are brought under the same umbrella, and a future perspective on promising directions is provided.








Abstract
Convective thermal metamaterials are artificial structures where convection dominates in the thermal process. Due to the field coupling between velocity and temperature, convection provides a new knob for controlling heat transfer beyond pure conduction, thus allowing active and robust thermal modulations. With the introduced convective effects, the original parabolic Fourier heat equation for pure conduction can be transformed to hyperbolic. Therefore, the hybrid diffusive system can be interpreted in a wave&#8208;like fashion, reviving many wave phenomena in dissipative diffusion. Here, recent advancements in convective thermal metamaterials are reviewed and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art discoveries are classified into the following four aspects, enhancing heat transfer, porous&#8208;media&#8208;based thermal effects, nonreciprocal heat transfer, and non&#8208;Hermitian phenomena. Finally, a prospect is cast on convective thermal metamaterials from two aspects. One is to utilize the convective parameter space to explore topological thermal effects. The other is to further broaden the convective parameter space with spatiotemporal modulation and multi&#8208;physical effects.

         <title>Graphene Spin Valves&#160;for Spin Logic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of spin logic devices and spin&#8208;FETs in graphene marks an important step for the future development of spin&#8208;based computing technology. Their low on/off switching energy, low Joule heating losses, and scalability are attractive features from a device perspective. The non&#8208;volatile nature of graphene spin logic devices can be exploited for logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory applications for neuromorphic computing architectures.








Abstract
An alternative to charge&#8208;based electronics identifies the spin degree of freedom for information communication and processing. The long spin&#8208;diffusion length in graphene at room temperature demonstrates its ability for highly scalable spintronics. The development of the graphene spin valve (SV) has inspired spin devices in graphene including spin field&#8208;effect transistors and spin majority logic gates. A comprehensive picture of spin transport in graphene SVs is required for further development of spin logic. This review examines the advances in graphene SVs and their role in the development of spin logic devices. Different transport and scattering mechanisms in charge and spin are discussed. Furthermore, the on/off switching energy between graphene SVs and charge&#8208;based FETs is compared to highlight their prospects for low&#8208;power devices. The challenges and perspectives that need to be addressed for the future development of spin logic devices are then outlined.

         <title>Intrinsic Optical Properties and Emerging Applications of Gold Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in nanoscience and technology have been promoted to reveal the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures with consideration of size, shape, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning. The perspectives on the future developments, challenges, and opportunities of gold nanostructures are discussed to provide insights for improving their optical properties and performance in various applications.








Abstract
The collective oscillation of free electrons at the nanoscale surface of gold nanostructures is closely modulated by tuning the size, shape/morphology, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning, along with the surroundings of the plasmonic surface located at a dielectric interface with air, liquid, and solid. This review first introduces the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures and further summarizes stimuli&#8208;responsive changes in optical properties, metal&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced optical signals, luminescence spectral shaping, chiroptical response, and photogenerated hot carriers. The current success in the landscape of nanoscience and nanotechnology mainly originates from the abundant optical properties of gold nanostructures in the thermodynamically stable face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase. It has been further extended by crystal phase engineering to prepare thermodynamically unfavorable phases (e.g., kinetically stable) and heterophases to modulate their intriguing phase&#8208;dependent optical properties. A broad range of promising applications, including but not limited to full&#8208;color displays, solar energy harvesting, photochemical reactions, optical sensing, and microscopic/biomedical imaging, have fostered parallel research on the multitude of physical effects occurring in gold nanostructures.

&lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art advances in nanoscience and technology have been promoted to reveal the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures with consideration of size, shape, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning. The perspectives on the future developments, challenges, and opportunities of gold nanostructures are discussed to provide insights for improving their optical properties and performance in various applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collective oscillation of free electrons at the nanoscale surface of gold nanostructures is closely modulated by tuning the size, shape/morphology, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning, along with the surroundings of the plasmonic surface located at a dielectric interface with air, liquid, and solid. This review first introduces the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures and further summarizes stimuli-responsive changes in optical properties, metal-field-enhanced optical signals, luminescence spectral shaping, chiroptical response, and photogenerated hot carriers. The current success in the landscape of nanoscience and nanotechnology mainly originates from the abundant optical properties of gold nanostructures in the thermodynamically stable face-centered cubic (fcc) phase. It has been further extended by crystal phase engineering to prepare thermodynamically unfavorable phases (e.g., kinetically stable) and heterophases to modulate their intriguing phase-dependent optical properties. A broad range of promising applications, including but not limited to full-color displays, solar energy harvesting, photochemical reactions, optical sensing, and microscopic/biomedical imaging, have fostered parallel research on the multitude of physical effects occurring in gold nanostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Artificial intelligence in general and machine learning in particular are gaining ever more importance in science and technology. In materials science, they are taking over tedious screening tasks and helping design and discover materials based on both explicit and tacit previous knowledge possessed by the scientist. Social and humanistic aspects are acquiring tremendous importance, as power and explainability seem to grow at the expense of each other.








Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining strength, and materials science can both contribute to and profit from it. In a simultaneous progress race, new materials, systems, and processes can be devised and optimized thanks to machine learning (ML) techniques, and such progress can be turned into innovative computing platforms. Future materials scientists will profit from understanding how ML can boost the conception of advanced materials. This review covers aspects of computation from the fundamentals to directions taken and repercussions produced by computation to account for the origins, procedures, and applications of AI. ML and its methods are reviewed to provide basic knowledge of its implementation and its potential. The materials and systems used to implement AI with electric charges are finding serious competition from other information&#8208;carrying and processing agents. The impact these techniques have on the inception of new advanced materials is so deep that a new paradigm is developing where implicit knowledge is being mined to conceive materials and systems for functions instead of finding applications to found materials. How far this trend can be carried is hard to fathom, as exemplified by the power to discover unheard of materials or physical laws buried in data.

         <title>Recent Advances in 4D Printing of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) exhibit attractive stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, showing great application potential in soft robotics, biomedicine, optics, etc. The advent of 4D printing opens a new door for the design and fabrication of LCEs with programmable stimuli&#8208;responsive properties and 3D geometries. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in 4D printing of LCEs are reviewed, with emphasis on both mechanisms and potential applications.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are renowned for their large, reversible, and anisotropic shape change in response to various external stimuli due to their lightly cross&#8208;linked polymer networks with an oriented mesogen direction, thus showing great potential for applications in robotics, bio&#8208;medics, electronics, optics, and energy. To fully take advantage of the anisotropic stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors of LCEs, it is preferable to achieve a locally controlled mesogen alignment into monodomain orientations. In recent years, the application of 4D printing to LCEs opens new doors for simultaneously programming the mesogen alignment and the 3D geometry, offering more opportunities and higher feasibility for the fabrication of 4D&#8208;printed LCE objects with desirable stimuli&#8208;responsive properties. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in 4D printing of LCEs are reviewed, with emphasis on both the mechanisms and potential applications. First, the fundamental properties of LCEs and the working principles of the representative 4D printing techniques are briefly introduced. Then, the fabrication of LCEs by 4D printing techniques and the advantages over conventional manufacturing methods are demonstrated. Finally, perspectives on the current challenges and potential development trends toward the 4D printing of LCEs are discussed, which may shed light on future research directions in this new field.

         <title>Molecular One&#8208; and Two&#8208;qubit Systems with very Long Coherence Times</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
General&#8208;purpose quantum computation and quantum simulation require multi&#8208;qubit architectures with precisely defined, robust interqubit interactions, coupled with local addressability. This is an unsolved challenge, primarily due to scalability issues. These issues often derive from poor control over interqubit interactions. Molecular systems are promising materials for the realization of large&#8208;scale quantum architectures, due to their high degree of positionability and the possibility to precisely tailor interqubit interactions. The simplest quantum architecture is the two&#8208;qubit system, with which quantum gate operations can be implemented. To be viable, a two&#8208;qubit system must possess long coherence times, the interqubit interaction must be well defined and the two qubits must also be addressable individually within the same quantum manipulation sequence. Here we present results on the investigation of the spin dynamics of chlorinated triphenylmethyl organic radicals, in particular perchlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical, a mono&#8208;functionalized PTM and a biradical PTM dimer. We find extraordinarily long ensemble coherence times up to 148 &#956;s at all temperatures below 100&#160;K. We demonstrate two&#8208;qubit and, importantly, individual qubit addressability in the biradical system. These results underline the potential of molecular materials for the development of quantum architectures.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis and Excited&#8208;State Dynamics of Null Exciton&#8208;Coupled Diketopyrrolopyrroles Oligo&#8208;Grids</title>

Abstract
Exciton coupling in molecular aggregates plays a vital role in impacting and fine&#8208;tuning optoelectronic materials and their efficiencies in devices. A versatile platform to decipher aggregation&#8208;property relationships is built around multichromophoric architectures. Here, we designed a series of cyclic diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs) oligomers featuring nanoscale gridarene structures and rigid bifluorenyl spacers. Dimers and trimers, that is, [2]Grid and [3]Grid, were synthesized via one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions. The two of them, which are cyclic rigid nanoarchitectures of rather different sizes, were characterized by means of steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. This was not only meant to systematically investigate exciton couplings among DPPs but also to determine their excited&#8208;state dynamics. [2]Grid and [3]Grid exhibited monomer&#8208;like spectroscopic signatures in the steady&#8208;state measurements, from which we derive null exciton couplings. Moreover, in apolar solvent, high fluorescence quantum yields and excited&#8208;state dynamics that resembled DPP monomer were gathered. In polar solvent, the localized singlet excited state on a single DPP dissociates into the adjacent null coupling DPPs with charge transfer characteristics. This pathway facilitates the evolution of charge&#8208;separated states. [2]Grid, for example, reveals an efficient population of the symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state (SB&#8208;CS) in benzonitrile. Notable is the fact that the SB&#8208;CS of [2]Grid is, on one hand, in an equilibrium with the singlet excited state and promotes, on the other hand, the formation of the triplet excited state with a yield of 32% via charge recombination.

         <title>Defective Metal Oxides: Lessons from CO2RR and Applications in NOxRR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on oxide surfaces is a critical factor in promoting electrochemical conversion reactions. A special focus is placed on the structure&#8211;performance relationship of oxygen vacancies in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR)/nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) electrocatalysts. This work examines the formation/characterization of defects for CO2RR, taking learnings, challenges, and future directions in designing defective oxides for the emerging field of NO3RR.








Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics and the undesired side reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction and self&#8208;reduction) are the main bottlenecks of electrochemical conversion reactions, such as the carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions (CO2RR and NO3RR). To date, conventional strategies to overcome these challenges involve electronic structure modification and modulation&#160;of the&#160;charge&#8208;transfer behavior. Nonetheless, key aspects of surface modification, focused on boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on the catalyst surface, are yet to be fully understood. Engingeering of oxygen vacancies (OVs) can tune surface/bulk electronic structure and improve surface active sites of electrocatalysts. The continuous breakthroughs and significant progress in the last decade position engineering of OVs as a potential technique for advancing electrocatalysis. Motivated by this, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art findings of the roles of OVs in both the CO2RR and the NO3RR are presented. The review starts with a description of approaches to constructing and techniques for characterizing OVs. This is followed by an overview of the mechanistic understanding of the CO2RR and a detailed discussion on the roles of OVs in the CO2RR. Then, insights into the NO3RR mechanism and the potential of OVs on NO3RR based on early findings are&#160;highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;Boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on oxide surfaces is a critical factor in promoting electrochemical conversion reactions. A special focus is placed on the structure&#8211;performance relationship of oxygen vacancies in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR)/nitrate reduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR) electrocatalysts. This work examines the formation/characterization of defects for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, taking learnings, challenges, and future directions in designing defective oxides for the emerging field of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sluggish reaction kinetics and the undesired side reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction and self-reduction) are the main bottlenecks of electrochemical conversion reactions, such as the carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR). To date, conventional strategies to overcome these challenges involve electronic structure modification and modulation&#160;of the&#160;charge-transfer behavior. Nonetheless, key aspects of surface modification, focused on boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on the catalyst surface, are yet to be fully understood. Engingeering of oxygen vacancies (OVs) can tune surface/bulk electronic structure and improve surface active sites of electrocatalysts. The continuous breakthroughs and significant progress in the last decade position engineering of OVs as a potential technique for advancing electrocatalysis. Motivated by this, the state-of-the-art findings of the roles of OVs in both the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR are presented. The review starts with a description of approaches to constructing and techniques for characterizing OVs. This is followed by an overview of the mechanistic understanding of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and a detailed discussion on the roles of OVs in the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. Then, insights into the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR mechanism and the potential of OVs on NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR based on early findings are&#160;highlighted. Finally, the challenges in designing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR/NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR electrocatalysts and perspectives in studying OV engineering are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface Engineering Toward Expedited Li2S Deposition in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: A Critical Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li2S deposition, the final discharge step contributing 75% capacity to Li&#8211;S batteries, remains a formidable issue due to its sluggish kinetics. The inferior deposition kinetics stem from the huge interfacial impedances, suggesting its interface&#8208;dominated nature. In this review, the progress and outlook of interface engineering for Li2S deposition, associated with the underlying mechanisms and potential problem&#8208;solving strategies, are reviewed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) with superior energy density are among the most promising candidates of next&#8208;generation energy storage techniques. As the key step contributing to 75% of the overall capacity, Li2S deposition remains a formidable challenge for LSBs applications because of its sluggish kinetics. The severe kinetic issue originates from the huge interfacial impedances, indicative of the interface&#8208;dominated nature of Li2S deposition. Accordingly, increasing efforts have been devoted to interface engineering for efficient Li2S deposition, which has attained inspiring success to date. However, a systematic overview and in&#8208;depth understanding of this critical field are still absent. In this review, the principles of interface&#8208;controlled Li2S precipitation are presented, clarifying the pivotal roles of electrolyte&#8211;substrate and electrolyte&#8211;Li2S interfaces in regulating Li2S depositing behavior. For the optimization of the electrolyte&#8211;substrate interface, efforts on the design of substrates including metal compounds, functionalized carbons, and organic compounds are systematically summarized. Regarding the regulation of electrolyte&#8211;Li2S interface, the progress of applying polysulfides catholytes, redox mediators, and high&#8208;donicity/polarity electrolytes is overviewed in detail. Finally, the challenges and possible solutions aiming at optimizing Li2S deposition are given for further development of practical LSBs. This review would inspire more insightful works and, more importantly, may enlighten other electrochemical areas concerning heterogeneous deposition processes.

         <title>Terpolymerization and Regioisomerization Strategy to Construct Efficient Terpolymer Donors Enabling High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chlorine regioisomeric units are developed and incorporated into star polymer PM6 to achieve one of the most efficient polymer donors for organic solar cells. It is demonstrated that Cl&#8208;regioisomerization not only affects molecular coplanarity, crystallinity, and aggregation behavior, but also modulates electrostatic potential, donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, and phase&#8208;separation morphology, which are of great importance for device performance.








Abstract
Terpolymerization and regioisomerization strategies are combined to develop novel polymer donors to overcome the difficulty of improving organic solar cells (OSCs) performance. Two novel isomeric units, bis(2&#8208;hexyldecyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;chlorothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarboxylate (TTO) and bis(2&#8208;hexyldecyl) 2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;chlorothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarboxylate (TTI), are obtained and incorporated into the PM6 backbone via random copolymerization to form a series of terpolymers. Interestingly, it is found that different chlorine (Cl) substituent positions can significantly change the molecular planarity and electrostatic potential (ESP) owing to the steric hindrance effect of the heavy Cl atom, which leads to different molecular aggregation behaviors and miscibility between the donor and acceptor. The TTO unit features a higher number of multiple S&#183;&#183;&#183;O non&#8208;covalent interactions, more positive ESP, and fewer isomer structures than TTI. As a result, the terpolymer PM6&#8208;TTO&#8208;10 exhibits a much better molecular coplanarity, stronger crystallinity, more obvious aggregation behavior, and proper phase separation in the blend film, which are conducive to more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer. Consequently, the PM6&#8208;TTO&#8208;10:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 18.37% with an outstanding fill factor of 79.97%, which are among the highest values reported for terpolymer&#8208;based OSCs. This work demonstrates that terpolymerization combined with Cl regioisomerization is an efficient approach for achieving high&#8208;performance polymer donors.

         <title>Chloride&#8208;Based Additive Engineering for Efficient and Stable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key role of methylammonium chloride additive in directing the crystallization of 1.8&#160;eV perovskites to induce more effective halide homogenization is elucidated. The as&#8208;formed perovskite demonstrates suppressed halide segregation, improved optoelectronic properties, and ambient stability. In conjunction with a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (Me&#8208;4PACz), a VOC of 1.25&#160;V and steady&#8208;state PCE of 17% are achieved.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite based tandem solar cells are promising to achieve power conversion efficiency beyond the theoretical limit of their single&#8208;junction counterparts. However, overcoming the significant open&#8208;circuit voltage deficit present in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells remains a major hurdle for realizing efficient and stable perovskite tandem cells. Here, a holistic approach to overcoming challenges in 1.8&#160;eV perovskite solar cells is reported by engineering the perovskite crystallization pathway by means of chloride additives. In conjunction with employing a self&#8208;assembled monolayer as the hole&#8208;transport layer, an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.25&#160;V and a power conversion efficiency of 17.0% are achieved. The key role of methylammonium chloride addition is elucidated in facilitating the growth of a chloride&#8208;rich intermediate phase that directs crystallization of the desired cubic perovskite phase and induces more effective halide homogenization. The as&#8208;formed 1.8&#160;eV perovskite demonstrates suppressed halide segregation and improved optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction Enabling Highly Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are ideal candidates for indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) because of their easy&#8208;to&#8208;adjust bandgaps, which can be designed to cover the spectrum of any artificial light source. However, the serious non&#8208;radiative carrier recombination under low light illumination restrains the application of perovskite&#8208;based IPVs (PIPVs). Herein, polar molecules of amino naphthalene sulfonates were employed to functionalize the TiO2 substrate, anchoring the CsPbI3 perovskite crystal grains with a strong ion&#8208;dipole interaction between the molecule&#8208;level polar interlayer and the ionic perovskite film. The resulting high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films with the merit of defect&#8208;immunity and large shunt resistance under low light conditions enabled the corresponding PIPVs with an indoor power conversion efficiency of up to 41.2% (Pin: 334.11 &#120583;W/cm2, Pout: 137.66 &#120583;W/cm2) under illumination from a commonly used indoor light&#8208;emitting diode light source (2956 K, 1062 lux). Furthermore, the device also achieved efficiencies of 29.45% (Pout: 9.80 &#120583;W/cm2) and 32.54% (Pout: 54.34 &#120583;W/cm2) at 106 (Pin: 33.84 &#120583;W/cm2) and 522 lux (Pin: 168.21 &#120583;W/cm2), respectively.

         <title>Extreme &#947;&#8208;Ray Radiation Tolerance of Spectrometer&#8208;Grade CsPbBr3 Perovskite Detectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The perovskite compound CsPbBr3 has recently been discovered as a promising room&#8208;temperature semiconductor radiation detector, offering an inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;manufacture alternative to the current benchmark material Cd1&#8208;xZnxTe (CZT). We have evaluated the performance of CsPbBr3 sensors under harsh conditions, such as high radiation doses often found in industrial settings and extreme radiation in space. Results showed minimal degradation in detector performance after exposure to 1 Mrad of Co&#8208;60 gamma radiation, with no significant change to energy resolution or hole mobility and lifetime. Additionally, many of the devices were still functional after being exposed to a 10 Mrad dose over three days, and those that did not survive could still be refabricated into working detectors. These results suggest that the failure mode in these devices is likely related to the interface between the electrode and material and their reaction, or the electrode itself and not the material itself. Overall, the study suggests that CsPbBr3 has high potential as a reliable and efficient radiation detector in various applications, including those involving extreme fluxes and energies of gamma&#8208;ray radiation.

         <title>Reconfigurable Neuromorphic Computing: Materials, Devices and Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neuromorphic computing has been attracting ever&#8208;increasing attention due to superior energy efficiency, with great promise to promote the next wave of artificial general intelligence in the post&#8208;Moore era. Current approaches are, however, broadly designed for stationary and unitary assignments, thus encountering reluctant interconnections, power consumption, and data&#8208;intensive computing in that domain. Reconfigurable neuromorphic computing, an on&#8208;demand paradigm inspired by the inherent programmability of brain, can maximally reallocate finite resources to perform the proliferation of reproducibly brain&#8208;inspired functions, highlighting a disruptive framework for bridging the gap between different primitives. Although relevant research has flourished in diverse materials and devices with novel mechanisms and architectures, a precise overview remains blank and urgently desirable. Herein, the recent strides along this pursuit are systematically reviewed from material, device, and integration perspectives. At the material and device level, we comprehensively conclude the dominant mechanisms for reconfigurability, categorized into ion migration, carrier migration, phase transition, spintronics, and photonics. Integration&#8208;level developments for reconfigurable neuromorphic computing are also exhibited. Finally, a perspective on the future challenges for reconfigurable neuromorphic computing is discussed, definitely expanding its horizon for scientific communities.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Intercalation Dominated Ferromagnetism of van der Waals Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fe3GeTe2 have proven to be of greatly intrigue. However, the underlying mechanism behind the varying Curie temperature (Tc) values remains a puzzle. Here, we&#160;explored the atomic structure of Fe3GeTe2 crystals exhibiting Tc values of 160, 210, and 230 K. The elemental mapping reveals a Fe&#8208;intercalation on the interstitial sites within the van der Waals gap of the high&#8208; Tc (210 and 230 K) samples, which are observed an exchange bias effect by electrical transport measurements, while Fe intercalation or the bias effect is absent in the low&#8208;Tc (160 K) samples. First&#8208;principles calculations further suggest that the Fe&#8208;intercalation layer may be responsible for the local antiferromagnetic coupling that gives rise to the exchange bias effect, and that the interlayer exchange paths greatly contributes to the enhancement of Tc. This discovery of the Fe&#8208;intercalation layer elucidates the mechanism behind the hidden antiferromagnetic ordering that underlies the enhancement of Tc in Fe3GeTe2.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich MoSe2 2H/1T Hybrid Nanoparticles Prepared from Femtosecond Laser Ablation in Liquid and Their Enhanced Photothermal Conversion Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of spherical MoSe2 2H/1T hybrid nanoparticles are formed by ablating MoSe2 powder in isopropyl alcohol with a femtosecond laser: onion&#8208;structured nanoparticles and polycrystalline nanoparticles. Different formation mechanisms are identified for the two types of nanoparticles and the spherical nanoparticles have high photothermal conversion efficiencies thanks to defects and structural disorder in the nanoparticles.








Abstract
MoSe2 2H/1T hybrid nanoparticles are prepared by femtosecond laser ablation of MoSe2 powder in isopropyl alcohol with different laser powers and ablation times, and their formation mechanisms and photothermal conversion efficiencies (PTCEs) are studied. Two types of spherical nanoparticles are observed. The first type is onion&#8208;structured nanoparticles that are formed by nucleation on the surfaces of melted droplets followed by inward growth of {002} planes of MoSe2. The second type is polycrystalline nanoparticles, formed by coalescence of crystalline nanoclusters fragmented from the powder during the laser ablation. The nanoparticle size in all samples shows a bimodal distribution, corresponding to different fragmentation mechanisms. The 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T phase transition in the nanoparticles is likely caused by electron doping from the laser&#8208;induced plasma. The PTCEs of the nanoparticles increase with laser power and ablation time; the highest PTCE is around 38%. After examining the bandgaps and the Urbach energies of the nanoparticles, it is found that the high PTCEs are primarily attributed to defects and structural disorder in the laser&#8208;synthesized nanoparticles, which allow absorption of photons with energies smaller than the bandgap energy and facilitate non&#8208;radiative recombination of photoexcited carriers.

         <title>Bifunctional Single Atom Catalysts for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries: From Dynamic Mechanism to Rational Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ever&#8208;growing demands for rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries call for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. Among various electrocatalysts, single atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to the merits of high atom utilization, structural tunability and remarkable activity. Rational design of bifunctional SACs relies heavily on an in&#8208;depth understanding of reaction mechanisms, especially dynamic evolution under electrochemical conditions. This requires a systematic study in dynamic mechanisms to replace current trial and error modes. Herein, fundamental understanding of dynamic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanisms for SACs are first presented combining in situ and/or operando characterizations and theoretical calculations. By highlighting structure&#8208;performance relationships, rational regulation strategies are particularly proposed to facilitate the design of efficient bifunctional SACs. Furthermore, future perspectives and challenges are discussed. This review provides a thorough understanding of dynamic mechanisms and regulation strategies for bifunctional SACs, which are expected to pave the avenue for exploring optimum single atom bifunctional oxygen catalysts and effective ZABs.

         <title>Therapeutic DNAzymes: From Structure Design to Clinical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the tortuous development period, the research direction of therapeutic deoxyribozymes changes from verification of therapeutic ability to precise design, material construction, and collaborative application. This review summarizes the development process of therapeutic deoxyribozymes and analyzes the problems within the process and the corresponding solutions.








Abstract
Therapeutic DNAzymes have unceasingly intrigued the scientific community owing to their prosperous gene regulation capability. The efficacy of DNAzymes against many types of diseases has been extensively studied for over two decades. However, the high expectations for DNAzymes are still not translated to the clinic because of their low effectiveness in vivo. Over the last five years, several aspects have been considered to optimize DNAzyme&#8208;integrated therapeutics, including structural stability, mechanism exploration, cell internalization rate, cofactor activation, and off&#8208;target effects. Hence, this review first discusses the early monotherapy and structural design of DNAzymes. Subsequently, the latest modes of action are reviewed, followed by an elaboration on structural stabilization strategies considering the catalytic core and substrate&#8208;binding arms. DNAzyme&#8208;based synergistic therapy is then examined, highlighting responsive carrier construction, synergistic effects, the latest discovered advanced functions, and off&#8208;target concerns. Beyond this, key clinical advances in DNAzyme&#8208;based therapy are elucidated by showcasing clinical progress. Finally, future trends and development challenges for DNAzyme&#8208;powered therapeutics in the coming years are discussed in detail.

         <title>Renal Clearable Ultraminiature Chain&#8208;like Gold Nanoparticle Clusters for Multimodal Molecular Imaging of Choroidal Neovascularization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Currently available gold nanoparticles (GNPs) typically accumulate in the liver and spleen, leading to concerns for their long&#8208;term biosafety. To address this long&#8208;standing problem, we developed ultraminiature chain&#8208;like gold nanoparticle clusters (GNCs). Via self&#8208;assembly of 7&#8211;8&#160;nm GNP monomers, GNCs provide red&#8208;shifted optical absorption and scattering contrast in the near&#8208;infrared window. After disassembly, GNCs turn back to GNPs with a size&#160;smaller than the renal glomerular filtration size cutoff, allowing their&#160;excretion via urine. Our one&#8208;month longitudinal study in a rabbit eye model demonstrated that GNCs facilitate multimodal molecular imaging of choroidal neovascularization (CNV)&#160;in vivo, non&#8208;invasively, with excellent sensitivity and spatial resolution. GNCs targeting &#945;v&#946;3&#160;integrins enhanced photoacoustic and OCT signals from CNV by 25.3&#8208;fold and 150%, respectively. With excellent biosafety and biocompatibility demonstrated,&#160;GNCs render a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind nanoplatform for biomedical imaging.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Metastable Hidden Skyrmion Phase in the Mott Insulator Cu2OSeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The article reports the discovery of a novel long&#8208;lived metastable skyrmion phase in the multiferroic insulator Cu2OSeO3 visualized with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy for magnetic fields below the equilibrium skyrmion pocket. This phase can be accessed by exciting the sample non&#8208;adiabatically with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser pulses and can not be reached by any conventional field cooling protocol referred as a hidden phase. From the strong wavelength dependence of the photocreation process and via spin dynamics simulations, the magnetoelastic effect is identified as the most likely photocreation mechanism. This effect results in a transient modification of the magnetic free energy landscape extending the equilibrium skyrmion pocket to lower magnetic fields. We&#160;monitored the evolution of the photoinduced phase for over 15 minutes and found no decay. Because such a time is much longer than the duration of any transient effect induced by a laser pulse in a material, we&#160;assume that the new skyrmion state we&#160;discovered is stable for practical purposes, thus breaking ground for a novel approach to control magnetic state on demand at ultrafast timescales and drastically reducing heat dissipation relevant for next generation spintronic devices.

         <title>Surface Reconstruction for Efficient and Stable Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells with Greatly Suppressed Residual Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface reconstruction strategy is employed to achieve a strain&#8208;free perovskite film with simultaneously reduced defect density, suppressed ion migration, and improved energy level alignment. The resultant monolithic perovskite/black&#8208;silicon tandem realizes a certified stabilized efficiency &#8776;29.0%, which is among the best performances for perovskite/silicon tandems based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts.








Abstract
Despite the swift rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE) to more than 32%, the instability of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is still one of the key obstacles to practical application and is closely related to the residual strain of perovskite films. Herein, a simple surface reconstruction strategy is developed to achieve a global incorporation of butylammonium cations at both surface and bulk grain boundaries by post&#8208;treating perovskite films with a mixture of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide and n&#8208;butylammonium iodide in isopropanol solvent, enabling strain&#8208;free perovskite films with simultaneously reduced defect density, suppressed ion migration, and improved energy level alignment. As a result, the corresponding single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells yield a champion PCE of 21.8%, while maintaining 100% and 81% of their initial PCEs without encapsulation after storage for over 2500&#160;h in N2 and 1800&#160;h in air, respectively. Remarkably, a certified stabilized PCE of 29.0% for the monolithic perovskite/silicon tandems based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts is further demonstrated. The unencapsulated tandem device retains 86.6% of its initial performance after 306 h at maximum power point (MPP) tracking under continuous xenon&#8208;lamp illumination without filtering ultraviolet light (in air, 20&#8211;35 &#176;C, 25&#8211;75%RH, most often &#8776;60%RH).

         <title>Albumin&#8208;Hitchhiking Drug Delivery to Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Nodes Precisely Boosts Tumor&#8208;Specific Immunity through Autophagy Modulation of Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;responsive &#8220;albumin&#8208;hitchhiking&#8221; micelle POR/DT is established by self&#8208;assembly of tumor&#8208;targeting oxaliplatin prodrug (POR) and lipophilized trehalose prodrug (DT). POR prodrug can cause tumor cells&#8217; immunogenic death and antigen release, while lipophilic modification enhances autophagy inducer's binding to endogenous albumin and realizes TDLN&#8208;selective reflux, where it upregulates autophagy&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation in DCs.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are the first sites where tumor components reach and dendritic cells (DCs) present tumor&#8208;associated antigens to T cells. DCs rely on autophagy to process tumor antigens into epitope peptides to form epitope&#8208;MHC complexes. Selective delivery of autophagy&#8208;stimulating drugs to TDLNs may be a precise strategy to boost chemotherapy&#8208;induced antitumor immunity. Here, a multistage stimulating strategy is proposed to activate the antitumor immunity cascade by inducing immunogenic death of tumor cells and elevating antigen presentation of DCs in TDLNs. A tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive &#8220;albumin&#8208;hitchhiking&#8221; micelle is established by self&#8208;assembling tumor&#8208;targeting oxaliplatin prodrug and lipophilized trehalose prodrug. This demonstrates that lipophilic modification of trehalose with a DSPE tail and the precise exposure in the tumor site enhances its binding to endogenous albumin and realizes TDLNs&#8208;selective reflux, where it upregulates antigen processing and presentation of DCs. This study introduces an approach for targeted delivery to TDLNs and provides insights into mechanisms of autophagy in tumor&#8208;specific immunity.

Three&#8208;electrode rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (T&#8208;RZABs) have a hydrophobic discharge cathode, a hydrophilic charge cathode, and a zinc&#8208;free anode. The decoupled cathodes enable fast ORR/OER kinetics and avoid oxidization of the ORR catalyst. The zinc&#8208;free anode suppresses hydrogen evolution and prevents Zn dendrites. The T&#8208;RZABs have an energy density of 151.8 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a cost of 46.7 US dollars kWh&#8722;1.








Abstract
A conventional two&#8208;electrode rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery (RZAB) has two major problems: 1) opposing requirements for the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions from the catalyst at the air cathode; and 2) zinc&#8208;dendrite formation, hydrogen generation, and zinc corrosion at the zinc anode. To tackle these problems, a three&#8208;electrode RZAB (T&#8208;RZAB) including a hydrophobic discharge cathode, a hydrophilic charge cathode, and a zinc&#8208;free anode is developed. The decoupled cathodes enable fast ORR and OER kinetics, and avoid oxidization of the ORR catalyst. The zinc&#8208;free anode using tin&#8208;coated copper foam that induces the growth of (002)Zn planes, suppresses hydrogen evolution, and prevents Zn corrosion. As a result, the T&#8208;RZABs have a high discharge capacity per cycle of 800 mAh cm&#8722;2, a low voltage gap between the discharge/charge platforms of 0.66&#160;V, and an ultralong cycle life of 5220 h at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. A large T&#8208;RZAB with a discharge capacity of 10 Ah per cycle with no obvious degradation after cycling for 1000 h is developed. Finally, a T&#8208;RZAB pack that has an energy density of 151.8 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a low cost of 46.7 US dollars kWh&#8722;1&#160;is assembled.

         <title>Reinforcing Co&#63743;O Covalency via Ce(4f)&#9472;O(2p)&#9472;Co(3d) Gradient Orbital Coupling for High&#8208;Efficiency Oxygen Evolution</title>

Atomically dispersed Ce on CoO is prepared as a model to identify the active sites of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based transition metal oxides toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the corresponding catalytic mechanism is elucidated. The Ce&#63743;O&#63743;Co unit site is identified as the active center. The enhanced OER performance is ascribed to reinforce Co&#63743;O covalency through Ce(4f)&#9472;O(2p)&#9472;Co(3d) gradient orbital coupling.








Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth (RE)&#8208;based transition metal oxides (TMO) are emerging as a frontier toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet the knowledge regarding their electrocatalytic mechanism and active sites is very limited. In this work, atomically dispersed Ce on CoO is successfully designed and synthesized by an effective plasma (P)&#8208;assisted strategy as a model (P&#8208;Ce SAs@CoO) to investigate the origin of OER performance in RE&#8211;TMO systems. The P&#8208;Ce SAs@CoO exhibits favorable performance with an overpotential of only 261&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and robust electrochemical stability, superior to individual CoO. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that the Ce&#8208;induced electron redistribution inhibits Co&#63743;O bond breakage in the Co&#63743;O&#63743;Ce unit site. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the gradient orbital coupling reinforces the Co&#63743;O covalency of the Ce(4f)&#9472;O(2p)&#9472;Co(3d) unit active site with an optimized Co&#8208;3d&#8208;eg occupancy, which can balance the adsorption strength of intermediates and in turn reach the apex of the theoretical OER maximum, in excellent agreement with experimental observations. It is believed that the establishment of this Ce&#8211;CoO model can set a basis for the mechanistic understanding and structural design of high&#8208;performance RE&#8211;TMO catalysts.

         <title>Enhancing Bioavailability of Fertilizer through an Amyloid&#8208;Like Protein Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible and biodegradable protein coating can enhance droplet deposition and adhesion on superhydrophobic plant leaves. This coating packaging with fertilizers through electrostatic and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions affords a top&#8208;level retention capability for fertilizers, which could further improve the bioavailability of fertilizers and reduce at least 30% fertilizer use in scale&#8208;up applications in agriculture.








Abstract
Foliar fertilization acts as a ubiquitous component of conventional crop production, which brings considerable economic and ecological costs. Due to droplets rebounding and splashing during spraying and rain erosion, low bioavailability of fertilizer results in severe environmental pollution. Contrary to conventional fertilizer formulations with polymers, surfactants, and organic reagents, a method of improving fertilizer bioavailability based on a biocompatible protein coating is presented herein. In this system, whey protein concentrate (WPC) can undergo amyloid&#8208;like aggregation after the reduction of its disulfide bond by the reducing agent tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP). Such aggregation affords a fast formation of the optically transparent and colorless phase&#8208;transitioned WPC (PTW) coating at the solid/water interface, with robust interfacial adhesion stability. Upon packaging with fertilizers through electrostatic and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, such reliable interfacial adhesion thereby facilitates the effective deposition of fertilizers on superhydrophobic and hydrophobic leaf surfaces, with excellent adhesion stability. Based on practical farmland test, this work demonstrates that the application of PTW can significantly boost the bioavailability of fertilizers and decrease at least 30% fertilizer use in large&#8208;scale crop planting. This innovative strategy has the great potential to offer a transformative step forward in managing fertilizer contamination and overuse in future agriculture.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na2Ti3O7 microspheres with unique chemically bonded interfaces that demonstrate unparalleled cycling stability over the entire temperature range are fabricated as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), highlighting the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.








Abstract
Titanates have been widely reported as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, their wide temperature suitability and cycle life remain fundamental issues that hinder their practical application. Herein, a novel hollow Na2Ti3O7 microsphere (H&#8208;NTO) with a unique chemically bonded NTO/C(N) interface is reported. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the NTO/C(N) interface stabilizes the crystal structure, and the optimized interface enables the H&#8208;NTO anode to stably operate for 80&#160;000 cycles in a conventional ester electrolyte with negligible capacity loss. Optimizing the electrolyte allows the H&#8208;NTO electrode to cycle stably for 200 calendar days without capacity degradation at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The excellent cycling stability is attributed to the NTO/C(N) interface and the stable solid electrolyte interphase formed by the highly adaptable electrolyte/electrode interface. Titanate exhibits solvent co&#8208;intercalation behavior in ether&#8208;based electrolytes, and its robust structure ensures that it can adapt to large volume changes at low temperatures. This study provides a unique perspective on the long&#8208;cycle mechanism of titanate anodes and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Narrowband Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitter Fusing Indolocarbazole Donors for BT. 2020 Red Electroluminescence and Ultralong Operation Lifetime</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pure&#8208;red multi&#8208;resonance emitter fused with indolocarbazole segments is developed, simultaneously redshifting and narrowing the emission color. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode realizes BT.2020 red coordinates of (0.708, 0.292), also achieving an impressive maximum external quantum efficiency of 34.4% and an ultralong LT95 of over 10&#160;000&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Polycyclic heteroaromatics with multi&#8208;resonance (MR) characteristics are attractive materials for narrowband emitters in wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, MR emitters with pure&#8208;red colors are still rare and usually exhibit problematic spectral broadening when redshifting emission. Here, a narrowband pure&#8208;red MR emitter is reported by fusing indolocarbazole segments into a boron/oxygen&#8208;embedded skeleton, realizing BT.2020 red electroluminescence for the first time together with a high efficiency and an ultralong lifetime.

&lt;p&gt;A pure-red multi-resonance emitter fused with indolocarbazole segments is developed, simultaneously redshifting and narrowing the emission color. The corresponding organic light-emitting diode realizes BT.2020 red coordinates of (0.708, 0.292), also achieving an impressive maximum external quantum efficiency of 34.4% and an ultralong LT95 of over 10&#160;000&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycyclic heteroaromatics with multi-resonance (MR) characteristics are attractive materials for narrowband emitters in wide-color-gamut organic light-emitting diodes. However, MR emitters with pure-red colors are still rare and usually exhibit problematic spectral broadening when redshifting emission. Here, a narrowband pure-red MR emitter is reported by fusing indolocarbazole segments into a boron/oxygen-embedded skeleton, realizing BT.2020 red electroluminescence for the first time together with a high efficiency and an ultralong lifetime. The rigid indolocarbazole segment possesses a strong electron-donating ability due to its &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-positioned nitrogen&#8211;&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;nitrogen backbone and also enlarges the &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-extension of the MR skeleton to suppress structural displacement during radiation, achieving concurrently redshifted and narrowed emission spectrum. An emission maximum at 637 nm with a full width at half-maxima of merely 32&#160;nm (0.097&#160;eV) is recorded in toluene. The corresponding device simultaneously exhibits CIE coordinates of (0.708, 0.292) precisely matching the BT.2020 red point, a high external quantum efficiency of 34.4% with low roll-off and an ultralong LT95 (time to 95% of the initial luminance) of &amp;gt;10&#160;000&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These performance characteristics are superior even to those of state-of-the-art perovskite and quantum-dot-based devices for this specific color, paving the way toward practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;gate in&#8208;transistor readout of current superposition and collapse utilizing quantum tunneling and ferroelectric switching</title>

Abstract
In nanostructure assemblies, the superposition of current paths forms microscopic electric circuits, and different circuit networks produce varying results, particularly when utilized as transistor channels for computing applications. However, the intricate nature of assembly networks and the winding paths of commensurate currents hinder standard circuit modeling. Inspired by the quantum collapse of superposition states for information decoding in quantum circuits, the implementation of analogous current path collapse to facilitate the detection of microscopic circuits by modifying their network topology is explored. Here, the superposition and collapse of current paths in gate&#8208;all&#8208;around polysilicon nanosheet arrays are demonstrated to enrich the computational resources within transistors by engineering the channel length and quantity. Switching the ferroelectric polarization of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 gate dielectric, which drives these transistors out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, decodes the output polymorphism through circuit topological modifications. Furthermore, a protocol for the single&#8208;electron readout of ferroelectric polarization is presented with tailoring the channel coherence. The introduction of lateral path superposition results into intriguing metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transitions due to transient behavior of ferroelectric switching. This ability to adjust the current networks within transistors and their interaction with ferroelectric polarization in polycrystalline nanostructures lays the groundwork for generating diverse current characteristics as potential physical databases for optimization&#8208;based computing.

         <title>Brightened Bicomponent Perovskite Nanocomposite Based on F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer for Micro&#8208;LED Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicomponent perovskite nanocomposite based on F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer realizes near 100% quantum yield under excitation of 460 nm blue light. Color gamut of 135.90% NTSC and 101.47% BT.2020 is achieved when the bicomponent perovskite nanocomposites, as color conversion materials, combine with a GaN micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode (micro&#8208;LED) array.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are&#160;making their way toward next&#8208;generation display applications, such as serving as color conversion layers in micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode (micro&#8208;LED)&#160;arrays. Red PQDs containing iodine exhibit weaker brightness compared with their green counterpart when employed as color conversion layers. Therefore, PQDs with enhanced brightness are highly favorable for micro/mini&#8208;LED displays. A universal strategy of bicomponent perovskite nanocomposite (BPNC) with significantly enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensity is proposed through the built&#8208;in F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the core CsPbBr3 to the shell &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3, and it is confirmed that it is through a pair of combined quasi&#8208;degenerate energy levels in the blue spectra region that the FRET is conducted, resulting in a high excitation wavelength selectivity. Owing to the highly efficient energy transition route from blue excitation to red emission established by the FRET, the BPNC exhibits the brightest single&#8208;peak red photoluminescence with near 100% quantum yield. The BPNC with FRET is further proven to be adaptable to a wide range of emission wavelengths. The BPNCs in a blue micro&#8208;LED array are employed as color downconversion layers, and excellent color conversion properties and high color gamut are demonstrated. This strategy of BPNC paves a road to the full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LED&#160;displays.

         <title>Activatable Sonoafterglow Nanoprobes for T&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encompassing sonosensitizers, substrates, and quenchers, an ultrasound&#8208;induced afterglow imaging nanoprobe that can emit afterglow in deep&#8208;seated organs is presented. Only in response to granzyme B that is overexpressed by cytotoxic T cells, such a nanoprobe can be activated to emit sonoafterglow, permitting in vivo longitudinal monitoring of T&#8208;cell dysfunction in deep&#8208;seated autoimmune hepatitis after intravenous injection.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time imaging of immune systems benefits early diagnosis of disease and precision immunotherapy; however, most existing imaging probes either have &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; signals with poor correlation to immune responses, or rely on light excitation with limited imaging depth. In this work, an ultrasound&#8208;induced afterglow (sonoafterglow) nanoprobe is developed to specifically detect granzyme B for accurate imaging of T&#8208;cell immunoactivation in vivo. The sonoafterglow nanoprobe (Q&#8208;SNAP) consists of sonosensitizers, afterglow substrates, and quenchers. Upon ultrasound irradiation, sonosensitizers generate singlet oxygen, which converts substrates to high&#8208;energy dioxetane intermediates that slowly release energy after ultrasound cessation. Due to the proximity, energy from substrates can be transferred to quenchers, leading to afterglow quenching. Only in the presence of granzyme B,&#160;quenchers are liberated from Q&#8208;SNAP, resulting in bright afterglow emission with a limit of detection (LOD, 2.1&#160;nm) much lower than most existing fluorescent probes. Due to the deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrating ultrasound, sonoafterglow can be induced through a tissue of 4&#160;cm thickness. Based on the correlation between sonoafterglow and granzyme B, Q&#8208;SNAP not only distinguishes autoimmune hepatitis from healthy liver as early as 4 h after probe injection, but also effectively monitors the cyclosporin&#8208;A&#8208;mediated reversal of T&#8208;cell hyperactivation. Q&#8208;SNAP thus offers the possibilities of dynamic monitoring of T&#8208;cell dysfunction and evaluation of prophylactic immunotherapy in deep&#8208;seated lesions.

         <title>Azide&#8208;Masked Resiquimod Activated by Hypoxia for Selective Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel azide&#8208;masked resiquimod prodrug (R848&#8208;N3) is designed to block its active amino group, which can be selectively activated in hypoxic tumors. The combination of R848&#8208;N3 and polymer vascular disrupting agent (CA4&#8208;NPs) results in higher tumor selectivity than the intratumor (i.t.) injection of R848 and combination with anti&#8208;PD1 can achieve 40% tumor cure rate without obvious side effects.








Abstract
Resiquimod (R848) is an immunomodulator that causes a severe systemic inflammatory reaction due to low tumor selectivity, thus hindering its use in cancer therapy. Therefore, an azide&#8208;masked prodrug (R848&#8208;N3) of R848 is developed, which is selectively activated to R848 in hypoxic tumors. R848&#8208;N3 significantly reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in treated mice to 1/12 compared to R848 at the same dose. In addition, combretastatin A4 nanoparticles (CA4&#8208;NPs) are used to enhance the tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3 by elevating the level of tumor hypoxia. R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs has higher tumor selectivity than the intratumoral injection of R848 at 1&#160;h after administration. The concentration of the active R848 in the tumor is 21.45&#8208;fold that in the heart. Benefiting from the high tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3, R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs+anti&#8208;PD1 exerted 94.1% tumor suppression and 40.0% tumor cure. Therefore, this work highlights the potential of azide&#8208;masking strategy in the development of tumor&#8208;selective prodrugs with reduced toxicity.

In addition, combretastatin A4 nanoparticles (CA4-NPs) are used to enhance the tumor selectivity of R848-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by elevating the level of tumor hypoxia. R848-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+CA4-NPs has higher tumor selectivity than the intratumoral injection of R848 at 1&#160;h after administration. The concentration of the active R848 in the tumor is 21.45-fold that in the heart. Benefiting from the high tumor selectivity of R848-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, R848-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+CA4-NPs+anti-PD1 exerted 94.1% tumor suppression and 40.0% tumor cure. Therefore, this work highlights the potential of azide-masking strategy in the development of tumor-selective prodrugs with reduced toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Mie Resonator Arrays for Broadband Light Trapping in Ultrathin c&#8208;Si Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanophotonic design strategy to realize Mie&#8208;resonator arrays that can combine antireflection and light&#8208;trapping functions in a single, thin layer is discussed. The proposed light&#8208;trapping antireflection coating is experimentally demonstrated on a 2.8&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cell, resulting in a 48% enhancement in the short&#8208;circuit current as compared to a planar cell and an absolute efficiency of 11.2%.








Abstract
Effective photon management is critical to realize high power conversion efficiencies for thin crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cells. Standard few&#8208;100&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick bulk cells achieve light trapping with macroscopic surface textures covered by thin, continuous antireflection coatings. Such sizeable textures are challenging to implement on ultrathin cells. Here, it is illustrated how nanoscale Mie&#8208;resonator&#8208;arrays with a bimodal size distribution support multiple resonances that can work in concert to achieve simultaneous antireflection and light&#8208;trapping across the broad solar spectrum. The effectiveness of these light&#8208;trapping antireflection coatings is experimentally demonstrated on a 2.8&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick c&#8208;Si solar cell. The measured short&#8208;circuit current and corresponding power conversion efficiency are notably improved, achieving efficiencies as high as 11.2%. Measurements of the saturation current density on completed cells indicate that thermal oxides can effectively limit surface recombination. The presented design principles are applicable to a wide range of solar cells.

         <title>Defect engineering of a high&#8208;entropy metallic glass surface for high&#8208;performance overall water splitting at ampere&#8208;level current densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based electrocatalysts possess high water electrolysis activity and are essential components for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A major challenge, however, is how to break the cost&#8208;efficiency trade&#8208;off. Here, a novel defect engineering strategy is presented to construct a nanoporous (FeCoNiB0.75)97Pt3 (atomic %) high&#8208;entropy metallic glass (HEMG) with a nanocrystalline surface structure that contains large amounts of lattice distortion and stacking faults to achieve excellent electrocatalytic performance using only 3 at.% of Pt. The defect&#8208;rich HEMG achieves ultralow overpotentials at ampere&#8208;level current density of 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for HER (104&#160;mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (301&#160;mV) under alkaline conditions, while retains a long&#8208;term durability exceeding 200&#160;h at 100&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it only requires 81&#160;mV and 122&#160;mV to drive the current densities of 1000 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for HER under acidic and neutral conditions, respectively. Modelling results reveal that lattice distortion and stacking fault defects help to optimize atomic configuration and modulate electronic interaction, while the surface nanoporous architecture provides abundant active sites, thus synergistically contributing to the reduced energy barrier for water electrolysis. This defect engineering approach combined with a HEMG design strategy is expected to be widely applicable for development of high&#8208;performance alloy catalysts.

         <title>A&#160;Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Activatable Molecular Pro&#8208;Theranostic Agent for Photodynamic and Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fibroblast activation protein &#945; (FAP&#945;)&#8208;activatable pro&#8208;theranostic probe&#160;(FMP) has&#160;activated fluorescence and photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy immunotherapy for the simultaneous killing of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cancer cells. FMP&#8208;mediated immunotherapy can not only improve tumor immunogenicity, but also exhaust CAFs, promote cytotoxic T lymphocytes and aPD&#8208;L1 to enter the CAF&#8208;rich tumors, thus strengthening the synergistic antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major components of the tumor&#8208;associated matrix and play an important role in tumor progression and immunosuppression. Therefore, precise theranostics of CAFs are beneficial for CAFs&#8208;targeted therapies. However, imaging agents enabling precise theranostics of CAFs have been rarely exploited. To tackle this issue, a molecular pro&#8208;theranostic probe (FMP) with activatable fluorescence, photoacoustic (PA) imaging, and photodynamic therapy (PDT) is developed in response to fibroblast activation protein &#945; (FAP&#945;) overexpressed in &gt;90% types of CAFs and some tumor cells. Attributed to efficient activatable phototoxicity toward CAFs and tumor cells, together with activated immunogenic cell death (ICD), complete tumor regression of primary tumors and abscopal effect of distant tumors are observed in a 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice model. By integration with PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, enhanced systemic immune responses are evoked to obtain long&#8208;lasting tumor suppression of both primary and distant tumors as well as arrest systemic cancer metastasis in living mice.

An LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation system based on 3D superhydrophilic foam offers a record&#8208;high steam generation for clean water production and salt recovery from high salinity water (seawater or wastewater)








Abstract
Clean water scarcity and energy shortage have become urgent global problems due to population growth and human industrial development. Low&#8208;grade waste heat (LGWH) is a widely available and ubiquitous byproduct of human activities worldwide, which can provide effective power to address the fresh water crisis without additional energy consumption and carbon emissions. In this regard, 3D superhydrophilic polyurethane/sodium alginate (PU/SA) foam and LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation systems are developed, which can precipitate over 80&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 steam generation from seawater and has favorable durability for purification of high salinity wastewater. The excellent water absorption ability, unobstructed water transport, and uniform thin water layer formed on 3D skeletons of PU/SA foam ensure the strong heat exchange between LGWH and fluidic water. As a result, the heat&#8208;localized PU/SA foam enables the efficient energy utilization and ultrafast water evaporation once LGWH is introduced into PU/SA foam as heat flow. In addition, the precipitated salt on PU/SA foam can be easily removed by mechanical compression, and almost no decrease in water evaporation rate after salt precipitation and removal for many times. Meanwhile, the collected clean water has high rejection of ions of 99.6%, which meets the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of drinking water. Above all, this LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation system presents a promising and easily accessible solution for clean water production and water&#8211;salt separation without additional energy burden for the society.

         <title>Interface Modification for Efficient and Stable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to their excellent thermal stability and ideal bandgap, metal halide inorganic perovskite based solar cells (PSCs) with inverted structure are considered as an excellent choice for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted inorganic PSCs still lags far behind that of conventional n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs due to interfacial energy level mismatch and high nonradiative charge recombination. Herein, the performance of inverted PSCs was significantly improved by interfacial engineering of CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx films with 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to their excellent thermal stability and ideal bandgap, metal halide inorganic perovskite based solar cells (PSCs) with inverted structure are considered as an excellent choice for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted inorganic PSCs still lags far behind that of conventional n-i-p PSCs due to interfacial energy level mismatch and high nonradiative charge recombination. Herein, the performance of inverted PSCs was significantly improved by interfacial engineering of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; films with 2-mercapto-1-methylimidazole (MMI). It is found that the mercapto group can preferably react with the undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from perovskite by forming Pb-S bonds, which appreciably reduces the surface trap density. Moreover, MMI modification results in a better energy level alignment with the electron transporting material, promoting carrier transfer and reducing voltage deficit. The above combination results in an open circuit voltage enhancement by 120&#160;mV, yielding a champion PCE of 20.6% for 0.09 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area and 17.3% for 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area. Furthermore, the ambient, operational and heat stabilities of inorganic PSCs with MMI modification are also greatly improved. Our work demonstrates a simple but effective approach for fabricating highly efficient and stable inverted inorganic PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Supramolecular Photothermal Cascade Nano&#8208;Reactor Enables Photothermal Effect, Cascade Reaction, and In Situ Hydrogelation for Biofilm&#8208;Associated Tooth&#8208;Extraction Wound Healing</title>

Abstract
Due to the emergence of drug resistance in bacteria and biofilm protection, achieving a satisfactory therapeutic effect for bacteria&#8208;infected open wounds with conventional measures is problematic. Here, we construct a photothermal cascade nano&#8208;reactor (CPNC@GOx&#8208;Fe2+) through a supramolecular strategy through hydrogen bonding and coordination interactions between chitosan&#8208;modified palladium nano&#8208;cube (CPNC), glucose oxidase (GOx), and ferrous iron (Fe2+). CPNC@GOx&#8208;Fe2+ exhibits excellent photothermal effect and powers the GOx&#8208;assisted cascade reaction to generate hydroxyl radicals, enabling photothermal and chemodynamic combination therapy against bacteria and biofilms. Further proteomics, metabolomics, and all&#8208;atom simulation results indicate that the damage of hydroxyl radical to the function and structure of the cell membrane and the thermal effect enhances the fluidity and inhomogeneity of the bacterial cell membrane, resulting in the synergistic anti&#8208;bacterial effect. In the biofilm&#8208;associated tooth extraction wound model, hydroxyl radical generated from the cascade reaction process could initiate the radical polymerization process to form a hydrogel in situ for wound protection. In vivo experiments confirm synergistic anti&#8208;bacterial and wound protection can accelerate the healing of infected tooth&#8208;extraction wounds without affecting the oral commensal microbiota. This study provides a way to propose a multifunctional supramolecular system for the treatment of open wound infection.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Uniform and Functionalized Nano&#8208;Ion Divider for Regulating Ion Distribution toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ionic dividers with uniform pores and functionalized surfaces display significant potential for solving Li dendrite issues in Li metal bstteries. In this study, we designed and fabricated single metal and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;sandwiched MXene (M&#8208;NC@MXene) nanosheets that possess highly ordered nanochannels with a diameter of &#8764;10&#160;nm. The experiments and computational calculations verified that the M&#8208;NC@MXene nanosheets eliminate Li dendrites in several ways: (1) redistributing the Li&#8208;ion flux via the highly ordered ion channels, (2) selectively conducting Li ions and anchoring anions by heteroatom doping to extend the nucleation time for Li dendrite, and (3) tightly staggering on a routine polypropylene (PP) separator to obstruct the growth path of Li dendrites. With a Zn&#8208;NC@MXene&#8208;coated PP divider, the assembled Li||Li symmetric battery showed an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of &#8764;25&#160;mV and a cycle life of 1500&#160;h at a high current density of 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and high capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, the life of the Li||Ni83 pouch cell with an energy density of 305&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 was improved by five&#8208;fold. Moreover, the remarkable performance of Li||Li, Li||LiFePO4, and Li||Sulfur batteries revealed the significant potential of the well&#8208;designed multifunctional ion divider for further practical applications.

         <title>Monolayer High&#8208;Entropy Layered Hydroxide Frame for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials with tailored geometric and elemental composition provide a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is a most efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. However, due to the huge difference in ionic solubility product, an extremely strong alkali environment is necessary to prepare high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxides (HELHs), which results in the uncontrollable structure, poor stability and scarce active sites. Here, we&#160;present a universal synthesis of monolayer HELH frame in a mild environment, regardless of the solubility product limit. Mild reaction conditions allow us&#160;to precisely control the fine structure and elemental composition of the final product. Consequently, the surface area of the HELHs is up to 380.5 m2 g&#8211;1. The current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 is achieved in 1&#160;M KOH at an overpotential of 259&#160;mV. And after 1000 hours operation at the current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, the catalytic performance shows no obvious deterioration. The high&#8208;entropy engineering and fine nanostructure control open opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, very few active sites, instability, low conductance during OER for LDH catalysts.

         <title>Additive manufacturing of liquid crystal elastomer actuators based on knitting technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) exhibits large and reversible deformability originating from the alignment of liquid crystal mesogens. Additive manufacturing provides high controllability in the alignment and shaping process of LCE actuators. However, it still remains a challenge to customize LCE actuators with both diverse three&#8208;dimensional deformability and recyclability. In this work, a new strategy is developed to exploit knitting technique to additively manufacture LCE actuators. The obtained LCE actuators are fabric&#8208;structured with designed geometry and deformability. By accurately adjusting the parameters of the knitting patterns as modules, diverse geometry is pixel&#8208;wise designed, and complex three&#8208;dimensional deformations including bending, twisting and folding are quantitatively controlled. In addition, the fabric&#8208;structured LCE actuators can be threaded, stitched, and reknitted to achieve advanced geometry, integrated multi&#8208;functions and efficient recyclability. This approach allows the fabrication of versatile LCE actuators with potential applications in smart textiles and soft robots.

         <title>Controllable Synthesis of 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 Lateral Heterostructures and Their Tunable Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Constructing heterostructures and doping are valid ways to improve the optoelectronic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and optimize the performance of TMDs&#8208;based photodetectors. Compared with transfer techniques, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has higher efficiency in preparing heterostructures. As for the one&#8208;step CVD growth of heterostructures, cross&#8208;contamination between the two materials may occur during the growth process, which may provide the possibility of one&#8208;step simultaneous realization of controllable doping and formation of alloy&#8208;based heterostructures by finely tuning the growth dynamics. Here, 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 alloy&#8208;to&#8208;alloy lateral heterostructures are synthesized through this one&#8208;step CVD growth method, utilizing the cross&#8208;contamination and different growth temperatures of the two alloys. Due to the doping of a small amount of Re atoms in 2H MoS2, 2H MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 has a high response rejection ratio in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (SBUV) region and exhibits a positive photoconductive (PPC) effect. While the 1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 formed by heavily doping Mo atoms into 1T' ReS2 will produce a negative photoconductivity (NPC) effect under ultraviolet (UV) laser irradiation. The optoelectronic property of 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2&#8208;based heterostructures can be modulated by gate voltage. These findings are expected to expand the functionality of traditional optoelectronic devices and have potential applications in optoelectronic logic devices.

         <title>High Mass Loading Li&#8208;S Batteries Catalytically Activated by Cerium Oxide: Performance and Failure Analysis under Lean Electrolyte Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Increasing sulfur mass loading and minimizing electrolyte amount remains a major challenge for the development of high energy density Li&#8208;S batteries, which needs to be tackled with combined efforts of materials development and mechanistic analysis. In this work, following our most recent identification of the potential&#8208;limiting step of Li&#8208;S batteries under lean electrolyte conditions, we seek to advance the understanding by extending it to a new catalyst and into the region of high sulfur mass loading. We integrate CeOx nanostructures into cotton&#8208;derived carbon to develop a multifunctional 3D network that can host a large amount of active material, facilitate electron transport, and catalyze the sulfur lithiation reaction. The resulting S/CeOx/C electrode can deliver a stable areal capacity of 9 mAh cm&#8722;2 with a high sulfur loading of 14&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 at a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5&#160;&#956;L mg&#8722;1. We discover that Li||S/CeOx/C cells usually fail during a charging step at high current density, as a consequence of local short circuiting caused by electrochemically deposited Li dendrites penetrating through the separator, a previously overlooked failure pattern distinctive to cells operating under lean electrolyte conditions. This work highlights the importance of developing new material structures and analyzing failure mechanisms in the advancement of Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Flowthrough Capture of Microplastics through Polyphenol&#8208;mediated Interfacial Interactions on Wood Sawdust</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nano&#8208;/microplastics accumulate in aquatic bodies and raise increasing threats to ecosystems and human health. The limitation of existing water cleanup strategies, especially in the context of nano&#8208;/microplastics, primarily arises from their complexity (morphological, compositional, and dimensional). Here, we report highly efficient and bio&#8208;based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) to remove a broad spectrum of nano&#8208;/microplastics from water: polyethylene terephthalate (anionic, irregular shape), polyethylene (net neutral, irregular shape), polystyrene (anionic and cationic, spherical shape), and other anionic and spherical shaped particles (polymethyl methacrylate, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride). We demonstrate highly efficient bioCap systems that adsorb the ubiquitous particles released from beverage bags. As evidence of removal from drinking water, we profile the in vivo biodistribution of nano&#8208;/microplastics, confirming a significant reduction of particle accumulation in main organs. The unique advantage of phenolic&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;molecular interactions is employed in sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and facile strategies based on wood sawdust support for the removal of challenging nano&#8208;/microplastics pollutions.

         <title>Dynamical Behaviors of Oscillating Metallosurfactant Coacervate Microdroplets under Redox Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic coacervation is presented from redox&#8208;active metallosurfactants as a model system to study non&#8208;equilibrium phenomena in life. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles sustaining both in solution and at colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport and passing through nanosized channels.








Abstract
Living systems create complex structures and functions by mastering self&#8208;organization in a variety of equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium states. Mimicking the dynamical phenomena with synthetic cell&#8208;like entities (protocells) under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions offers an important step toward the representation of minimum life. Here, the cell&#8208;sized coacervate microdroplets assembled from associative metallosurfactant coacervation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) that exhibits non&#8208;equilibrium behaviors are reported. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles with external redox stress. The collective oscillation of abiotic metallosurfactant microdroplets can sustain both in solution and at the colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport, and passing through nanosized channels, reminiscent of red blood cells&#160;that can deform and squeeze through narrow capillaries. The design of self&#8208;oscillating cell&#8208;sized constructs will shed a light on the creation of life&#8208;like soft materials with autonomous motion driven by complex chemical stimuli, which can be further used as nonbiological models for dynamic aggregates and intercellular communication.

         <title>Active Thermal Metasurfaces for Remote Heating/Cooling by Mimicking Negative Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;focus thermal lens with equivalent negative thermal conductivity is designed and experimentally realized to achieve a remote heating/cooling effect. The thermal lens consists of active thermal metasurfaces, which are constructed by p/n&#8208;type semiconductor pairs driven by a DC power supply. The proposed method can also achieve other novel thermal effects, such as thermal superlens and thermal tunneling effects.








Abstract
Remote temperature control can be obtained by a long&#8208;focus thermal lens that can focus heat fluxes into a spot far from the back surface of the lens and create a virtual thermal source/sink in the background material, around which the temperature field distribution can be remotely controlled by varying the parameters of the thermal lens. However, because of the lack of negative thermal conductivity, existing thermal lenses have extremely short focal lengths and cannot be used to remotely control the temperature field around the virtual thermal source/sink. In this study, a general approach is proposed to equivalently realize materials with negative thermal conductivity using elaborately distributed active thermal metasurfaces (ATMSs). Subsequently, the proposed ATMS is used to implement a novel thermal lens with a long focal length designed using transformation thermodynamics, and finally realize the ATMS with realistic materials and experimentally verify the performance of the designed long&#8208;focus thermal lens (measured focal length of 19.8&#160;mm) for remote heating/cooling. The proposed method expands the scope of the thermal conductivity and provides new pathways to realize unprecedented thermal effects with effective negative thermal conductivity, such as &#8220;thermal surface plasmon polaritons,&#8221; a thermal superlens, the thermal tunneling effect, and the thermal invisible gateway.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances in the elaborate design and fabrication of functional natural materials and natural&#8208;materials&#8208;based green flexible electronics are reviewed. Natural materials and derivatives, functionalization techniques of natural materials, and applications to green flexible electronics are presented in detail in sequence. Last, the perspectives on current challenges and opportunities of green flexible electronics based on natural materials are provided.








Abstract
The emergence of plastic electronics satisfies the increasing demand for flexible electronics. However, it has caused severe ecological problems. Flexible electronics based on natural materials are increasing to hopefully realize the &#8220;green&#8221; and eco&#8208;friendly concept. Herein, recent advances in the design and fabrication of green flexible electronics are reviewed. First, this review comprehensively introduces various natural materials and derivatives, focusing particularly on fibroin and silk, wood and paper, plants, and biomass. Second, fabrication techniques for modifying natural materials, including physical and chemical methods, are presented, after which their merits and demerits are thoroughly discussed. Green flexible electronics based on natural materials, comprising electrical wires/electrodes, antennas, thermal management devices, transistors, memristors, sensors, energy&#8208;harvesting devices, energy&#8208;storage devices, displays, actuators, electromagnetic shielding, and integration systems, are described in detail. Finally, perspectives on the existing challenges and opportunities to employ natural materials in green flexible electronics are presented.

         <title>Hierarchically Ordered Macro&#8211;Mesoporous Electrocatalyst with Hydrophilic Surface for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt supported on carbon electrocatalyst with hollow&#8208;wall and 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous structures and hydrophilic surface is successfully prepared, showing high electrocatalytic performance in the oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer versatile templates/precursors to prepare supported metal catalysts. However, the afforded catalysts usually exhibit microporous structures and unsuitable wettability, which will restrict the accessibility of active sites in liquid&#8208;phase reactions. Herein, an etching&#8211;functionalization strategy is developed for the construction of a tannic&#8208;acid&#8208;functionalized MOF with a unique hollow&#8208;wall and 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous (H&#8208;3DOM) structure. The functional MOF can be further employed as an ideal precursor for the synthesis of cobalt supported on oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon composites with H&#8208;3DOM structures, and hydrophilic surface. The H&#8208;3DOM structure can improve the external surface area to maximize the exposure of active sites. Moreover, the oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups can enhance the surface wettability to guarantee the external active sites to be more electrochemically accessible in aqueous electrolyte. Benefitting from these outstanding characteristics, H&#8208;3DOM&#8208;Co/ONC exhibits high electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction, superior to its counterparts without the hierarchically ordered structure and surface functionalization.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Channel&#8208;Restructured Zwitterionic Covalent Organic Framework Solid Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

A zwitterionic covalent organic framework (Zwitt&#8208;COF) is developed as a solid electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. The Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte exhibits a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity with a wide electrochemical window, leading to superior long&#8208;term cycle performance in the battery. Theoretical simulations reveal that Zwitt&#8208;COF promotes the dissociation of Li&#8208;ion pairs and provides ion channels for effective Li+ transport.








Abstract
Organic solid electrolytes offer an effective route for safe and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries. However, it remains a challenge to devise a new strategy to promote the dissociation of strong ion pairs and the transport of ionic components in organic solid electrolytes. Herein, a zwitterionic covalent organic framework (Zwitt&#8208;COF) with well&#8208;defined chemical and pore structures is prepared as a solid electrolyte capable of accelerating the dissociation and transport of Li ions. The Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte exhibits a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 1.65&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 with a wide electrochemical stability window. Besides, the Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte displays stable Li plating/stripping behavior via effective inhibition of the formation of Li dendrites and dead Li, leading to superior long&#8208;term cycle performance with retention of 99% discharge capacity and 98% Coulombic efficiency in an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal battery. Theoretical simulations reveal that the incorporation of zwitterionic groups into COF can facilitate the dissociation of strong ion pairs and reconstruct the AA&#8208;stacking configuration by dissociative adsorption of Li+ ions on Zwitt&#8208;COF producing linear hexagonal ion channels in the Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte. This strategy based on Zwitt&#8208;COF can provide an alternative way to construct various solid&#8208;state Li batteries.

         <title>Selective Potassium Deposition Enables Dendrite&#8208;Resistant Anodes for Ultrastable Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
K@Bi80/NrGO anode is successfully designed as a dendrite&#8208;resistant anode. The K@Bi80/NrGO||K@Bi80/NrGO symmetric cell achieves an ultrastable reversible cycle up to 3000 h at a current density of 0.2 mA cm&#8211;2. The newly designed anode is expected to provide a fresh impetus to advance the development of potassium&#8208;metal anodes and beyond.








Abstract
Instability at the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and uncontrollable growth of potassium dendrites have been pressing issues for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a self&#8208;supporting electrode composed of bismuth and nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide (Bi80/NrGO) is designed as an anode host for potassium&#8208;metal batteries. Following the molten potassium diffusion into Bi80/NrGO, the resulting K@Bi80/NrGO exhibits unique hollow pores that provide K+&#8208;diffusion channels and deposition space to buffer volume expansion, thus maintaining the electrode structure and SEI stability. The K@Bi80/NrGO also provides a controlled electric field that promotes uniform K+ flux, abundant potassiophilic N sites, and Bi alloying active sites, collectively enabling precise nucleation and selective deposition of potassium to achieve dendrite&#8208;resistant anodes. With the K@Bi80/NrGO&#8208;based optimized electrodes, the assembled K@Bi80/NrGO symmetrical cells can sustain stable cycling over 3000&#160;h at a current density of 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Full cells with a&#160;Prussian blue cathode and K@Bi80/NrGO anode exhibit high stability (with no degradation for 1960 cycles at 1000&#160;mA g&#8722;1) with 99% Coulombic efficiency. This work may lead to the design of anodes with the triple attributes of precise nucleation, smooth diffusion, and dendrite inhibition, ideal for developing stable potassium&#8208;metal anodes and beyond.

A novel H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT composite of hierarchical porous H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 and hollow halloysite nanotube is employed as an electrolyte in lithium&#8208;ion conduction in solid&#8208;state batteries, presenting excellent comprehensive electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a promising rechargeable electrochemical energy storage material have emerged in the field of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, low ionic conductivity and high interfacial impedance still severely hamper the application of MOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSE). In this work, a novel hierarchical porous H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) material is harvested through the in situ growth of zinc nitrate hydroxide nanosheets, expressing excellent ion conductivity of 1.04 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and Li+&#8208;transference number of 0.71. Moreover, the morphology and structure of H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 is further optimized to obtain a composite H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT by decorating halloysite nanotubes (HNT). Notably, functionalized H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT as an electrolyte presents obvious enhancement on electrochemical properties: higher ionic conductivity of 7.74 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, better single&#8208;ion transmittability (tLi+${t}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^{+}}$ = 0.84), good interfacial compatibility as well as excellent rate performance. More importantly, the Li/LiFePO4 battery equipped with H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT SSE has efficient lithium&#8208;dendrite suppression and up to 84% capacity retention (104.16&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1) after 200 times galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles. This work enriches the solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion composite electrolyte materials, opening an entirely new way for enhancing electrochemical performance.

The critical effect of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization on O2 adsorption is demonstrated by the structurally defined Gr&#8208;MG&#8208;O&#8208;MPPc catalysts.

Metal phthalocyanine (MPc) material with a well&#8208;defined MN4 moiety offers a platform for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the practical performance is often limited by the insufficient O2 adsorption due to the planar MN4 configuration. Here, a design (called Gr&#8208;MG&#8208;O&#8208;MPPc) is proposed, where the metal of MPc (MP) is axially coordinated to a single metal atom in graphene (Gr&#8208;MG) through a bridge&#8208;bonded oxygen atom (O), introducing effective out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization to promote O2 adsorption on MPc. Manipulating the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization charge by varying types of MP and MG (MP&#160;=&#160;Fe/Co/Ni, MG&#160;=&#160;Ti/V/Cr/Mn/Fe/Co/Ni) in the axial coordination zone of &#8208;MG&#8208;O&#8208;MP&#8208; are examined by density functional theory simulations. Among them, the catalyst of Gr&#8208;V&#8208;O&#8208;FePc stands out with the highest calculated O2 adsorption energy, which is synthesized successfully and verified by systemic X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements. Importantly, it delivers a remarkable ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.925&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and kinetic current density of 26.7&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This thus demonstrates a new and simple way to pursue high catalytic performance by inducing out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization in catalysts.

         <title>Biodegradable NIR&#8208;II Pseudo Conjugate Polymeric Nanoparticles Amplify Photodynamic Immunotherapy via Alleviation of Tumor Hypoxia and Tumor&#8208;associated Macrophage Reprogramming</title>

Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has achieved great success in cancer treatment. Despite its great promise, the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy could be limited by the hypoxia in solid tumors which is closely related to the abnormal tumor vasculature. These abnormal vasculatures are a hallmark of most solid tumors and facilitate immune evasion. Therefore, tumor vascular normalization was developed as a promising strategy to overcome tumor hypoxia, resulting in improved cancer therapy. Here, a NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;degradable pseudo&#8208;conjugate polymer (PSP)&#8208;based photodynamic polymer was designed to deliver a vascular normalization agent, i.e., regorafenib (Reg) in nanoparticles (NP&#8208;PDT@Reg). NP&#8208;PDT@Reg under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation (NP&#8208;PDT@Reg + L) can efficiently release Reg to improve the tumor hypoxia via vascular normalization, making more NP&#8208;PDT@Reg and oxygen enter the tumors. Moreover, NP&#8208;PDT@Reg + L could further result in generation of more reactive oxygen species (ROS) to eradicate tumor cells while inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) to activate anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. In addition, Reg could reprogram TAM from a pro&#8208;tumor M2 phenotype to a tumor&#8208;killing M1 phenotype as well, thereby reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Taken together, the current study provides an innovative perspective on the development of novel nanomaterials to overcome the limitations in photodynamic immunotherapy.

         <title>Diatomite&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt&#8208;Doped MoS2/Carbon Composites to Boost Sodium Storage</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrodes for energy conversion/storage because of the layered structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency. However, the integration of such two type materials and the relevant sodium storage applications remain daunting challenges. Here an ingenious diatomite&#8208;templated synthetic strategy is designed to fabricate single&#8208;atom cobalt&#8208;doped MoS2/carbon (SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C) composites toward the high&#8208;performance sodium storage. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure, high electron/sodium&#8208;ion conductivity, and abundant active sites, the obtained SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity (&#8764;604.0 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.1 A g&#8211;1), high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. Particularly, the sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200. The internal sodium storage mechanism is clarified with the aid of density function theory calculations and in situ experimental characterizations. This work not only represents a substantial leap in terms of synthesizing SACs on 2D TMDCs, but also provides a crucial step toward the practical sodium&#8208;ion battery applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Doping in Ordered and Disordered Domains of Organic Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel organic bioelectronic technologies rely on the efficient electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers. In this work, it is investigated how the doping process can be controlled by the co&#8208;existence of ordered and disordered domains in polymeric films. It is shown that both domains are doped trough different mechanisms and extents, and that optimal conductivity can be achieved by modulating film order.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers are increasingly used as organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors in electrochemical applications for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and energy harvesting. The design of efficient electrochemical devices relies on large modulations of the polymer conductivity, fast doping/dedoping kinetics, and high ionic uptake. In this work, structure&#8211;property relations are established and control of these parameters by the co&#8208;existence of order and disorder in the phase morphology is demonstrated. Using in&#160;situ time&#8208;resolved spectroelectrochemistry, resonant Raman, and terahertz (THz) conductivity measurements, the electrochemical doping in the different morphological domains of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is investigated. The main finding is that bipolarons are found preferentially in disordered polymer regions, where they are formed faster and are thermodynamically more favored. On the other hand, polarons show a preference for ordered domains, leading to drastically different bipolaron/polaron ratios and doping/dedoping dynamics in the distinct regions. A significant enhancement of the electronic conductivity is evident when bipolarons start forming in the disordered regions, while the presence of bipolarons in the ordered regions is detrimental for transport. This study provides significant advances in the understanding of the impact of morphology on the electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers and the induced increase in conductivity.

         <title>Optical Switching of Hole Transfer in Double&#8208;Perovskite/Graphene Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer across heterostructure interfaces crucially determines device applications, including light sensing. In this work, an optical switching of the hole&#8208;transfer direction and efficiency across strongly coupled double&#8208;perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6/graphene heterostructures by tuning the excitation wavelength is reported. This provides a novel way to control the interfacial charge flow across a semiconductor/graphene heterojunction.








Abstract
Synergically combining their respective ultrahigh charge mobility and strong light absorption, graphene (Gr)/semiconductor heterostructures are promising building blocks for efficient optoelectronics, particularly photodetectors. Charge transfer (CT) across the heterostructure interface crucially determines device efficiency and functionality. Here, it is reported that hole&#8208;transfer processes dominate the ultrafast CT across strongly coupled double&#8208;perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6/graphene (DP/Gr) heterostructures following optical excitation. While holes are the primary charges flowing across interfaces, their transfer direction, as well as efficiency, show a remarkable dependence on the excitation wavelength. For excitation with photon energies below the bandgap of DPs, the photoexcited hot holes in Gr can compete with the thermalization process and inject into in&#8208;gap defect states in DPs. In contrast, above&#8208;bandgap excitation of DP reverses the hole&#8208;transfer direction, leading to hole transfer from the valence band of DPs to Gr. Experimental evidence that increasing the excitation photon energy enhances CT efficiency for both below&#8208; and above&#8208;bandgap photoexcitation regimes is further provided, unveiling the positive role of excess energy in enhancing interfacial CT. The possibility of switching the hole&#8208;transfer direction and thus the interfacial photogating field by tuning the excitation wavelength, provides a novel way to control the interfacial charge flow across a DP/Gr heterojunction.

         <title>A Sodium Alginate&#8208;Based Multifunctional Nanoplatform for Synergistic Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sodium alginate (ALG)&#8208;based multifunctional nanoplatform is developed by using constant &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;mannuronic acid (M) units and modulated &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;guluronic acid (G) units in the ALG structure for synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which not only integrates the natural immunity of ALG and the immunogenic cell death (ICD) triggering function of DOX, but also shows dual targeting properties to HCC cells.








Abstract
Efficient hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment remains a significant challenge due to&#160;the inherent limitations of traditional strategies. The exploration of polysaccharides&#8217; natural immunity for HCC immunotherapy is rarely explored. For this purpose, facile construction of a multifunctional nanoplatform, biotinylated aldehyde alginate&#8208;doxorubicin nano micelle (BEA&#63743;C&#63742;N&#63743;DOX&#63743;M) is reported in this study for synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy by using constant &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;mannuronic acid (M) units and modulated &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;guluronic acid (G) units in the alginate (ALG) structure. The M units show natural immunity and specific binding ability with mannose receptors (MRs) via strong receptor&#8208;ligand interactions, and the G units serve as highly reactive conjugation sites for biotin (Bio) and DOX. Therefore, this formulation not only integrates the natural immunity of ALG and the immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#160;triggering function of DOX, but also shows dual targeting properties to HCC cells via MRs and Bio receptors (BRs)&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Notably, BEA&#63743;C&#63742;N&#63743;DOX&#63743;M mediates a tumor inhibitory efficiency 12.10% and 4.70% higher than free DOX and single targeting aldehyde alginate&#8208;doxorubicin nano micelle controls, respectively, at an equivalent DOX dose of 3 mg kg&#8722;1 in Hepa1&#8208;6 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study reports the first example of integrating the natural immunity of ALG and the ICD effect of anticancer drugs&#160;for enhanced chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of HCC.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Nanozyme&#8208;Armed Bacteriophages Efficiently Combat Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative nanozyme&#8208;armed phage system is fabricated for combating bacterial infection. The phage@Pd preserves the phages' capacity toward precise recognition and adhesion to the host. The Pd nanozymes with pH&#8208;dependent peroxidase&#8208;like activity can generate toxic hydroxyl radical in the acidic and H2O2&#8208;overexpressed infection microenvironment, thusrealizing&#160;noteworthy elimination of bacteria at infected site.








Abstract
Bacterial infection is one of the greatest challenges to public health, requiring new therapeutic methods. Herein, an innovative nanozyme&#8208;armed phage (phage@palladium (Pd)) system is fabricated for combating bacterial infection. The proposed phage@Pd preserves the function of the phages to achieve precise recognition and adhesion to the host Escherichia coli. In aid of the phages, the ultrasmall Pd nanozymes equipped with conspicuous pH&#8208;dependent peroxidase&#8208;like activity can generate toxic hydroxyl radical around the bacteria in acidic and hydrogen&#8208;peroxide&#8208;overexpressed infection microenvironment while remaining inert in physiological conditions, thus realizing the noteworthy elimination of bacteria at infected sites, and in the meantime ensuring the biological safety of phage@Pd in healthy tissues. In addition, the filamentous structure of phage@Pd can also enhance its bactericidal efficiency toward nonhost bacteria by randomly entangling on them, indicating possible broad&#8208;spectrum germicidal efficacy. Notably, phage@Pd can not only eradicate planktonic bacteria, but also kill the bacteria inside the biofilm in vitro. For both in vivo models of acute bacterial pneumonia or subcutaneous abscess, phage@Pd shows significant activity in eliminating infection and promoting tissue recovery. These results demonstrate that the phage@Pd nanohybrid is a safe and effective antimicrobial agent, providing a new insight into development of advanced antibacterial materials.

         <title>Stabilizing Supersaturation with Extreme Grain Refinement in Spinodal Aluminum Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Supersaturated solid solutions can be formed in alloys from various non&#8208;equilibrium processes, but stabilizing the metastable phases against decomposition is challenging, particularly the spinodal decomposition which occurs via chemical fluctuations without energy barriers to nucleation. Herein, we found that spinodal decomposition in supersaturated Al(Zn) solid solutions can be inhibited with straining&#8208;induced extreme grain refinement. For the refined supersaturated grains in the nano&#8208;scale, their spinodal decomposition is obviously resisted by the relaxed grain boundaries and reduced lattice defects. As grains are refined below 10&#160;nm the decomposition is completely inhibited, in which atomic diffusion are blocked by the stable Schwarz crystal structure with vacancy&#8208;free grains. The extreme grain refinement offers a general approach to stabilize supersaturated phases with broadened compositional windows for property modulation of alloys.

         <title>Symmetry Control of Unconventional Spin&#8208;Orbit Torques in IrO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torques generated by a spin current are key to magnetic switching in spintronic applications. The polarization of the spin current dictates the direction of switching required for energy&#8208;efficient devices. Conventionally, the polarizations of these spin currents are restricted to be along a certain direction due to the symmetry of the material allowing only for efficient in&#8208;plane magnetic switching. Unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torques arising from novel spin current polarizations, however, have the potential to switch other magnetization orientations such as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy which is desired for higher density spintronic&#8208;based memory devices. Here, we demonstrate that low crystalline symmetry is not required for unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torques and can be generated in a non&#8208;magnetic high symmetry material, iridium dioxide (IrO2), using epitaxial design. We show by reducing the relative crystalline symmetry with respect to the growth direction we can generate large unconventional spin currents and hence spin&#8208;orbit torques. Furthermore, we compare the spin polarizations detected in (001), (110), and (111) oriented IrO2 thin films to show which crystal symmetries restrict unconventional spin transport. Understanding and tuning unconventional spin transport generation in high symmetry materials can provide a new route towards energy&#8208;efficient magnetic switching in spintronic devices.

         <title>Switching chirality in arrays of shape&#8208;reconfigurable spindle microparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Giant circular photo&#8208;galvanic effect has been realized in chiral metals when illuminated by the circularly polarized light. However, the structure itself is not switchable nor is the crystal chirality in the adjacent chiral domains. Here w e synthesize spindle&#8208;shaped liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) microparticles that can switch from prolate to spherical to oblate reversibly upon heating above the nematic to isotropic transition temperature. When arranged in a honeycomb lattice, the continuous shape change of the microparticles leads to lattice reconfiguration, from a right&#8208;handed chiral state to achiral one, then to a left&#8208;handed chiral state, without breaking the translational symmetry. Accordingly, the sign of rotation of the polarized light passing through the lattices changes as measured by time&#8208;domain terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. Further, w e can locally alter the chirality in the adjacent domains using near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light illumination. The reconfigurable chiral microarrays will allow us to explore non&#8208;trivial symmetry protected transport modes of topological lattices at the light&#8208;matter interface. Specifically, the ability to controllably create chiral states at the boundary of the achiral/chiral domains will lead to rich structures emerging from the interplay of symmetry and topology.

         <title>Unique Tridentate Coordination Tailored Solvation Sheath Towards Highly Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrolyte optimization by solvent molecule design has been recognized as an effective approach for stabilizing lithium (Li) metal batteries. However, the coordination pattern of Li+ with solvent molecules has been sparsely considered. Here, we report an electrolyte design strategy based on bi/tridentate chelation of Li+ and solvent to tune the solvation structure. As a proof of concept, a novel solvent with multi oxygen coordination sites is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of an anion&#8208;aggregated solvation shell, enhancing the interfacial stability and de&#8208;solvation kinetics. As a result, the as&#8208;developed electrolyte exhibits ultra&#8208;stable cycling over 1400&#160;h in symmetric cells with 50&#160;&#956;m&#8208;thin Li foils. When paired with high&#8208;loading LiFePO4, full cells maintain 92% capacity over 500 cycles and deliver improved electrochemical performances over a wide temperature range from &#8208;10 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C. Furthermore, the concept is validated in a pouch cell (570 mAh), achieving a capacity retention of 99.5% after 100 cycles. This brand&#8208;new insight on electrolyte engineering provides guidelines for practical high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

         <title>Ferroelectric Modulation in Flexible Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Schottky Direct&#8208;Current Nanogenerator for Capsule&#8208;Like Magnetic Suspension Sensor</title>

Abstract
Tribovoltaic nanogenerator (TVNG), a promising semiconductor energy technology, displays outstanding advantages such as low matching impedance and continuous direct&#8208;current output. However, the lack of controllable and stable performance modulation strategies is still a major bottleneck that impedes further practical applications of TVNG. Herein, by leveraging the ferroelectricity&#8208;enhanced mechanism and the control of interfacial energy band bending, we&#160;construct a lead&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;based [3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium]2CuCl4 ((DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4)/Al Schottky junction TVNG. The multiaxial ferroelectricity of (DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4 enables an excellent surface charge modulating capacity, realizing a high work function regulation of &#8764; 0.7&#160;eV and over 15&#8208;fold current regulation (from 6&#160;&#956;A to 93&#160;&#956;A) via an electrical poling control. The controllable electrical poling leads to elevated work function difference between Al electrode and (DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4 compared to traditional semiconductors and halide perovskites, which creates a stronger built&#8208;in electric field at the Schottky interface to enhance the electrical output. This TVNG device exhibits outstanding flexibility and long&#8208;term stability (&gt; 20000 cycles) that can endure extreme mechanical deformations, and can also be used in a capsule&#8208;like magnetic suspension device capable of detecting vibration and weights of different objects as well as harvesting energy from human motions and water waves.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Dermal Fibroblasts Attenuate Inflammation in a Murine Model of Acute Lung Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered extracellular vesicles (eEVs) derived from adult dermal fibroblasts show enhanced intrapulmonary targeting and retention and can effectively deliver therapeutic cargo to the inflamed lung to reduce inflammation, mediate tissue repair, and drive metabolic changes that favor further activation of anti&#8208;inflammatory pathways. These eEVs could potentially represent a powerful tool for the treatment of acute lung injury.








Abstract
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a significant burden to the healthcare system, with &#8776;200&#160;000 cases diagnosed annually in the USA. ARDS patients suffer from severe refractory hypoxemia, alveolar&#8208;capillary barrier dysfunction, impaired surfactant function, and abnormal upregulation of inflammatory pathways that lead to intensive care unit admission, prolonged hospitalization, and increased disability&#8208;adjusted life years. Currently, there is no cure or FDA&#8208;approved therapy for ARDS. This work describes the implementation of engineered extracellular vesicle (eEV)&#8208;based nanocarriers for targeted nonviral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory payloads to the inflamed/injured lung. The results show the ability of surfactant protein A (SPA)&#8208;functionalized IL&#8208;4&#8208; and IL&#8208;10&#8208;loaded eEVs to promote intrapulmonary retention and reduce inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. Significant attenuation is observed in tissue damage, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, macrophage activation, influx of protein&#8208;rich fluid, and neutrophil infiltration into the alveolar space as early as 6 h post&#8208;eEVs treatment. Additionally, metabolomics analyses show that eEV treatment causes significant changes in the metabolic profile of inflamed lungs, driving the secretion of key anti&#8208;inflammatory metabolites. Altogether, these results establish the potential of eEVs derived from dermal fibroblasts to reduce inflammation, tissue damage, and the prevalence/progression of injury during ARDS via nonviral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory genes/transcripts.

         <title>Solar Biomass Reforming and Hydrogen Production with Earth&#8208;Abundant Si&#8208;Based Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient, stable, and non&#8208;toxic photocatalysts for biomass photo&#8208;reforming, which can simultaneously produce hydrogen and valuable chemicals under mild conditions, have garnered great attention. In this study, a Si&#8208;based hybrid photocatalyst enables record&#8208;high hydrogen productivity and concurrent selective production of value&#8208;added chemicals from biomass under simulated sunlight, without any buffering agent or sacrificial electron donors.








Abstract
Efficient electrochemical hydrogen production and biomass refinery are crucial for the decarbonization of various sectors. However, their energy&#8208;intensive nature and low efficiency have hindered their practical application. In this study, earth&#8208;abundant and non&#8208;toxic photocatalysts that can produce hydrogen and reform biomass efficiently, utilizing unlimited solar energy, are presented. The approach involves using low&#8208;bandgap Si flakes (SiF) for efficient light&#8208;harvesting, followed by modification with Ni&#8208;coordinated N&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (Ni&#8208;NGQDs) to enable efficient and stable light&#8208;driven biomass reforming and hydrogen production. When using kraft lignin as a model biomass, SiF/Ni&#8208;NQGDs facilitate record&#8208;high hydrogen productivity at 14.2&#160;mmol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and vanillin yield of 147.1&#160;mg&#160;glignin&#8722;1 under simulated sunlight without any buffering agent and sacrificial electron donors. SiF/Ni&#8208;NQGDs can be readily recycled without any noticeable performance degradation owing to the prevention of deactivation of Si via oxidation. This strategy provides valuable insights into the efficient utilization of solar energy and practical applications of electro&#8208;synthesis and biomass refinement.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Size&#8208;Transformable and Bioactivity&#8208;Switchable Self&#8208;Assembling Chimeric Peptide Nanoassemblies for Combating Drug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria and Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chimeric peptide nanoassembly consisting of a 14&#8208;carbon alkyl chain unit, a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#160;and pH&#8208;responsive unit, a P. aeruginosa target recognition unit, and a hydrophilic unit is developed. The nanoassemblies exhibit good bactericidal ability in acidic environments and are able to penetrate mature biofilms and kill drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. These results provide a reference for the development of peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
Drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections are prominent problems in the field of antibacterial medicine, seriously affecting human and animal health. Despite the great potential of nanomaterials in the antibacterial field, overcoming the paradox of size and charge, efficient penetration, and retention within biofilms remain a formidable challenge. Here, self&#8208;assembling chimeric peptide nanoassemblies composed of multiple functional fragments are designed for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections. Notably, the chimeric peptide self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers at pH 7.4 and is transformable into nanoparticles in the acidic biofilm&#8208;infected microenvironment at pH 5.0, and thus achieves a size reduction and charge increase, improving the penetration into the bacterial biofilms and killing drug&#8208;resistant bacteria by a mechanism dominated by membrane cleavage. In vivo mouse and piglet infection models confirm the ability of chimeric peptide nanoassemblies to reduce bacterial load within biofilms. Collectively, this research on pathological&#8208;environment&#8208;driven nanostructural transformations may provide a theoretical basis for designing high&#8208;performance antibacterial nanomaterials and advance the application of peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials in medicine and animal husbandry.

Collectively, this research on pathological-environment-driven nanostructural transformations may provide a theoretical basis for designing high-performance antibacterial nanomaterials and advance the application of peptide-based nanomaterials in medicine and animal husbandry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydroiodic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Initiated Dense yet Porous Ti3C2Tx MXene Monoliths toward Superhigh Areal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gelation&#8211;densification approach of MXenes to produce thick and dense electrodes with superhigh areal capacitance is proposed. Hydroiodide acids can not only serve as initiators to trigger the gelation of MXenes and construct stable 3D&#160;networks, but also leave highly shrinking porous structures by application of capillary forces during their controlled removal.








Abstract
The assembly of 3D&#160;structured materials from 2D&#160;units paves a royal road for building thick and dense electrodes, which are long sought after for practical energy&#8208;storage devices. 2D transitional metal carbides (MXene) are promising for this due to their capabilities of solution&#8208;based assembly and intrinsic high density, yet face huge challenges in yielding high areal capacitance electrodes owing to the absence of porous ion&#8208;transport paths. Here, a gelation&#8211;densification process initiated by hydroiodide acids (HI) is proposed, where the protons break the electrostatic balance of MXene nanosheets to trigger gelation, while HI serves as a spacer to prevent nanosheets from restacking during capillary shrinkage. More promising, the controlled evaporation of reductive HI leaves superiorly shrinking yet porous network for ion transport, and the produced monoliths exhibit a high density of 2.74&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and an unprecedented areal capacitance of 18.6 F cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Saddle&#8208;Shaped Third Component with Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Electrostatic Dipole for Realizing High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaic Donor Terpolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PM6&#8208;based terpolymers containing a saddle&#8208;shaped group with a double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) as the third component designed for fabrication of polymer solar cells feature strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dipole for optimizing blend morphology and improving the photovoltaic performances, thus achieving 19.13% efficiency.








Abstract
Terpolymer fabrication is an effective methodology for molecular engineering and generating high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic materials to construct highly efficient polymer solar cells. Modification of the polymer PM6 by incorporating a third component resulting in the formation of a ternary copolymer is reported to outperform PM6 in achieving enhanced device performances. However, one of the major challenges in constructing high&#8208;performance terpolymers is to counter the molecular disorder caused by the backbone entropy induced by the third moiety. In this work, double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) is used as the third component, which possesses a&#160;strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrostatic dipole owing to the saddle&#8208;shaped B&#8592;N fused ring structure. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dipole moment introduced in the modified PM6 terpolymer can be used as a means for tuning and optimizing the nanostructures of the blended films. The prepared PM6&#8208;BNBP&#8208;4 blend polymer with 4% of the benzodithiophene dione monomers replaced by BNBP results in excellent power conversion efficiency of 19.13%. This work demonstrates that the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrostatic dipole moment in saddle&#8208;shaped molecules is valuable for achieving high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic donor materials.

         <title>Unconventional Giant &#8220;Magnetoresistance&#8221; in Bosonic Semiconducting Diamond Nanorings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale &#8220;diamond rings&#8221; provide unconventional giant &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; for the development of new quantum devices. The unconventional giant &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; caused by the trapping of Cooper pairs within the heavily boron&#8208;doped diamond nanorings, distinguishes itself from the conventional giant magnetoresistance originating from spin&#8208;dependent scattering of single electrons in layered magnetic materials.








Abstract
The emergence of superconductivity in doped insulators such as cuprates and pnictides coincides with their doping&#8208;driven insulator&#8211;metal transitions. Above the critical doping threshold, a metallic state sets in at high temperatures, while superconductivity sets in at low temperatures. An unanswered question is whether the formation of Cooper pairsin a well&#8208;established metal will inevitably transform the host material into a superconductor, as manifested by a resistance drop. Here, this question is addressed by investigating the electrical transport in nanoscale rings (full loops) and half loops manufactured from heavily boron&#8208;doped diamond. It is shown that in contrast to the diamond half&#8208;loops (DHLs) exhibiting a metal&#8211;superconductor transition, the diamond nanorings (DNRs) demonstrate a sharp resistance increase up to 430% and a giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; below the superconducting transition temperature of the starting material. The finding of the unconventional giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221;, as distinct from existing categories of magnetoresistance, that is, the conventional giant magnetoresistance&#160;in magnetic multilayers, the colossal magnetoresistance&#160;in perovskites, and the geometric magnetoresistance in semiconductor&#8211;metal hybrids, reveals the transformation of the DNRs from metals to bosonic semiconductors upon the formation of Cooper pairs. DNRs like these could be used to manipulate Cooper pairs in superconducting quantum devices.

         <title>Expanding Embedded 3D Bioprinting Capability for Engineering Complex Organs with Freeform Vascular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro replication of the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures simultaneously remains one of the greatest challenges in the biofabrication field. This study introduces a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT) to address this limitation. Moreover, the SPIRIT technique significantly reduces the printing time compared to conventional bioprinting strategies.








Abstract
Creating functional tissues and organs in vitro on demand is a major goal in biofabrication, but the ability to replicate the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures such as blood vessels simultaneously remains one of the greatest impediments. Here, this limitation is addressed by developing a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT). It is demonstrated that this microgel&#8208;based biphasic (MB) bioink can be used as both an excellent bioink and a suspension medium that supports embedded 3D printing due to its shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing behavior. When encapsulating human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cells, the MB bioink is 3D printed to generate cardiac tissues and organoids by extensive stem cell proliferation and cardiac differentiation. By incorporating MB bioink, the SPIRIT strategy enables the effective printing of a ventricle model with a perfusable vascular network, which is not possible to fabricate using extant 3D printing strategies. This SPIRIT technique offers an unparalleled bioprinting capability to replicate the complex organ geometry and internal structure in a faster manner, which will accelerate the biofabrication and therapeutic applications of tissue and organ constructs.

         <title>Stacking Faults Inducing Oxygen Anion Activities in Li2MnO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking faults can promote the properties of materials in Li2MnO3. In this paper, the role and reasons for stacking faults in Li2MnO3&#160;are explored, revealing the importance of the O local environment. It is found that the longer Li&#63743;O bonds and smaller Li&#63743;O&#63743;Li bond angles induced by stacking faults promote O activities and Li ion migration.








Abstract
Controllable anionic redox for a transformational increase in the energy density is the pursuit of next generation Li&#8208;ion battery cathode materials.

&lt;p&gt;Stacking faults can promote the properties of materials in Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In this paper, the role and reasons for stacking faults in Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;are explored, revealing the importance of the O local environment. It is found that the longer Li&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bonds and smaller Li&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Li bond angles induced by stacking faults promote O activities and Li ion migration.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controllable anionic redox for a transformational increase in the energy density is the pursuit of next generation Li-ion battery cathode materials. Its activation mechanism is coupled with the local coordination environment around O, which posts experimental challenges for control. Here, the tuning capability of anionic redox is shown by varying O local environment via experimentally controlling the density of stacking faults in Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the parent compound of Li-rich oxides. By combining computational analysis and spectroscopic study, it is quantitatively revealed that more stacking faults can trigger smaller Li&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Li bond angles and larger Li&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bond distance in local Li-rich environments and subsequently activate oxygen redox reactivity, which in turn enhances the reactivity of Mn upon the following reduction process. This study highlights the critical role of local structure environment in tuning the anionic reactivity, which provides guidance in designing high-capacity layered cathodes by appropriately adjusting stacking faults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ablation of Gap Junction Protein Improves the Efficiency of Nanozyme&#8208;Mediated Catalytic/Starvation/Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>

FePGOGA&#160;nanozymes are constructed by Fe(III)&#8208;mediated oxidative polymerization, and co&#8208;loaded with GOx and Cx43 blockade peptides GAP19. The FePGOGAs exhibit excellent cascade peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like activities that efficiently generate ROS and prevent ROS efflux through Cx43 degradation. The good synergistic effects of the catalytic/starvation/mildPTT therapies are confirmed in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated tumor catalytic therapy is typically hindered by gap junction proteins that form cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell channels to remove cytotoxic ROS, thereby protecting tumor cells from oxidative damage. In this work, a multifunctional nanozyme, FePGOGA, is designed and prepared by Fe(III)&#8208;mediated oxidative polymerization (FeP), followed by glucose oxidase (GOx) and GAP19 peptides co&#8208;loading through electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The FePGOGA nanozyme exhibits excellent cascade peroxidase&#8208; and glutathione&#8208;oxidase&#8208;like activities that efficiently catalyze hydrogen peroxide conversion to hydroxyl radicals and convert reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione disulfide. The loaded GOx starves the tumors and aggravates tumor oxidative stress through glucose decomposition, while GAP19 peptides block the hemichannels by inducing degradation of Cx43, thus increasing the accumulation of intracellular ROS, and decreasing the transport of intracellular glucose. Furthermore, the ROS reacts with primary amines of heat shock proteins to destroy their structure and function, enabling tumor photothermal therapy at the widely sought&#8208;after mild temperature (mildPTT, &#8804;45&#160;&#176;C). In vivo experiments demonstrate the significant antitumor effectof FePGOGA on cal27 xenograft tumors under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. This study demonstrates the successful ablation of gap junction proteins to overcome resistance to ROS&#8208;mediated therapy, providing a regulator to suppress tumor self&#8208;preservation during tumor starvation, catalytic therapy, and mildPTT.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Tailored 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson Perovskites for Reconfigurable Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive mechanistic study of reconfigurable optoelectronic properties based on a nontrivial library of 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson perovskites with diamino group ligands by exposing/removing moisture is presented. The key to the moisture&#8208;controlled reconfigurable properties lies in the formation of hydrogen bonding between the diamino group and water molecules, preventing their escape.








Abstract
Humidity&#8208; and moisture&#8208;induced degradation has been a longstanding problem in perovskite materials, affecting their long&#8208;term stability during applications. Counterintuitively, the moisture is leveraged to tailor the reversible hydrochromic behaviors of a new series of 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites for reconfigurable optoelectronics. In particular, the hydrogen bonds between organic cations and water molecules can be dynamically modulated via moisture removal/exposure. Remarkably, such modulation confines the movement of the organic cations close to the original position, preventing their escape from crystal lattices. Furthermore, this mechanism is elucidated by theoretical analysis using first&#8208;principles calculations and confirmed with the experimental characterizations. The reversible fluorescent transition 2D DJ perovskites show excellent cyclical properties, presenting untapped opportunities for reconfigurable optoelectronic applications. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, an anti&#8208;counterfeiting display is shown based on patterned reversible 2D DJ perovskites. The results represent a new avenue of reconfigurable optoelectronic application with 2D DJ perovskites for humidity detection, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, and other emerging photoelectric intelligent technologies.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Thin Lithium Silicide Interlayer for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;thin nanoporous lithium silicide&#8208;based interlayer, acting as a mixed ionic and electronic conductor, is proposed for high energy and safe all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8208;batteries using lithium anode. The interlayer not only regulates LiBCC deposition and stripping but also serves as a 3D scaffold for Li ad&#8208;atom formation, LiBCC nucleation, and long&#8208;range transport of ions and electrons at solid&#8208;state electrolyte/LiBCC interface.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with metallic lithium (LiBCC) anode and solid electrolyte (SE) are under active development. However, an unstable SE/LiBCC interface due to electrochemical and mechanical instabilities hinders their operation. Herein, an ultra&#8208;thin nanoporous mixed ionic and electronic conductor (MIEC) interlayer (&#8776;3.25 &#181;m), which regulates LiBCC deposition and stripping, serving as a 3D scaffold for Li0 ad&#8208;atom formation, LiBCC nucleation, and long&#8208;range transport of ions and electrons at SE/LiBCC interface is demonstrated. Consisting of lithium silicide and carbon nanotubes, the MIEC interlayer is thermodynamically stable against LiBCC and highly lithiophilic. Moreover, its nanopores (&lt;100 nm) confine the deposited LiBCC to the size regime where LiBCC exhibits &#8220;smaller is much softer&#8221; size&#8208;dependent plasticity governed by diffusive deformation mechanisms. The LiBCC thus remains soft enough not to mechanically penetrate SE in contact. Upon further plating, LiBCC grows in between the current collector and the MIEC interlayer, not directly contacting the SE. As a result, a full&#8208;cell having Li3.75Si&#8208;CNT/LiBCC foil as an anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as a cathode displays a high specific capacity of 207.8 mAh g&#8722;1, 92.0% initial Coulombic efficiency, 88.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles (Coulombic efficiency reaches 99.9% after tens of cycles), and excellent rate capability (76% at 5 C).

         <title>Monolayer Superconductivity and Tunable Topological Electronic Structure at the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45 is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity but the inhomogeneity from doping raises doubts about the existence of Majorana modes. This work explores thin films of FeTe1&#8208;ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 that reveal superconductivity at the monolayer limit. Control over the interfacial electronic structure is demonstrated to maintain the spin&#8208;momentum locking necessary for topological superconductivity with significantly less doping.








Abstract
The interface between 2D topological Dirac states and an s&#8208;wave superconductor is expected to support Majorana&#8208;bound states (MBS) that can be used for quantum computing applications. Realizing these novel states of matter and their applications requires control over superconductivity and spin&#8208;orbit coupling to achieve spin&#8208;momentum&#8208;locked topological interface states (TIS) which are simultaneously superconducting. While signatures of MBS have been observed in the magnetic vortex cores of bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45, inhomogeneity and disorder from doping make these signatures unclear and inconsistent between vortices. Here superconductivity is reported in monolayer (ML) FeTe1&#8211;ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Spin and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) directly resolve the interfacial spin and electronic structure of Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 heterostructures. For y&#160;= 0.25, the Fe(Te,Se) electronic structure is found to overlap with the Bi2Te3 TIS and the desired spin&#8208;momentum locking is not observed. In contrast, for y&#160;= 0.1, reduced inhomogeneity measured by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and a smaller Fe(Te,Se) Fermi surface with clear spin&#8208;momentum locking in the topological states are found. Hence, it is demonstrated that the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 system is a highly tunable platform for realizing MBS where reduced doping can improve characteristics important for Majorana interrogation and potential applications.

     alt="Monolayer Superconductivity and Tunable Topological Electronic Structure at the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 Interface"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulk FeTe&lt;sub&gt;0.55&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.45&lt;/sub&gt; is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity but the inhomogeneity from doping raises doubts about the existence of Majorana modes. This work explores thin films of FeTe&lt;sub&gt;1-y&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that reveal superconductivity at the monolayer limit. Control over the interfacial electronic structure is demonstrated to maintain the spin-momentum locking necessary for topological superconductivity with significantly less doping.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface between 2D topological Dirac states and an &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-wave superconductor is expected to support Majorana-bound states (MBS) that can be used for quantum computing applications. Realizing these novel states of matter and their applications requires control over superconductivity and spin-orbit coupling to achieve spin-momentum-locked topological interface states (TIS) which are simultaneously superconducting. While signatures of MBS have been observed in the magnetic vortex cores of bulk FeTe&lt;sub&gt;0.55&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.45&lt;/sub&gt;, inhomogeneity and disorder from doping make these signatures unclear and inconsistent between vortices. Here superconductivity is reported in monolayer (ML) FeTe&lt;sub&gt;1&#8211;y&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Spin and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) directly resolve the interfacial spin and electronic structure of Fe(Te,Se)/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures. For &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 0.25, the Fe(Te,Se) electronic structure is found to overlap with the Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; TIS and the desired spin-momentum locking is not observed. In contrast, for &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 0.1, reduced inhomogeneity measured by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and a smaller Fe(Te,Se) Fermi surface with clear spin-momentum locking in the topological states are found. Hence, it is demonstrated that the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; system is a highly tunable platform for realizing MBS where reduced doping can improve characteristics important for Majorana interrogation and potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Interfacial Polymer Self&#8208;Assembly Coordinates Ultrahigh Drug Loading and Zero&#8208;Order Release in Particles Prepared under Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled interfacial polymer self&#8208;assembly enables the engineering of a microparticle that simultaneously features efficient protein and peptide encapsulation (up to 99.9%), ultrahigh mass fraction of therapeutics (up to 49.9%), and zero&#8208;order release of payloads. The developed strategy sets a new paradigm to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological performances of water&#8208;soluble therapeutics.








Abstract
Microparticles are successfully engineered through controlled interfacial self&#8208;assembly of polymers to harmonize ultrahigh drug loading with zero&#8208;order release of protein payloads. To address their poor miscibility with carrier materials, protein molecules are transformed into nanoparticles, whose surfaces are covered with polymer molecules. This polymer layer hinders the transfer of cargo nanoparticles from oil to water, achieving superior encapsulation efficiency (up to 99.9%). To control payload release, the polymer density at the oil&#8211;water interface is enhanced, forming a compact shell for microparticles. The resultant microparticles can harvest up to 49.9% mass fraction of proteins with zero&#8208;order release kinetics in vivo, enabling an efficient glycemic control in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the precise control of engineering process offered through continuous flow results in high batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and, ultimately, excellent scale&#8208;up feasibility.

         <title>Orbital Symmetry Engineering in Fused Polycyclic Heteroaromatics toward Extremely Narrowband Green Emissions with an FWHM of 13&#160;nm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular orbital interactions are demonstrated to be crucial to the energy gap and spectral bandwidth of multi&#8208;resonance emitters. Correspondingly, the first indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole embedded green fluorophore is developed with the smallest full width at half maximum of 13&#160;nm (0.064&#160;eV), accompanied by high external quantum efficiency of 30.9% and significantly alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Multiresonance (MR) molecules generally face spectral broadening issues with redshifted emissions. Thus, green emitters with full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of &lt;20&#160;nm are rarely reported, despite being highly desired. Herein, by properly fusing indolo(3,2,1&#8208;jk)carbazole (ICZ) and naphthalene moieties, green MR emitters are reported, which have FWHMs of merely 13&#160;nm (0.064&#160;eV) and 14&#160;nm (0.069&#160;eV) in dichloromethane, accompanied by high photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;95%, which represent not only the smallest FWHMs among all green MR emitters but also the first green emitters based on ICZ MR derivatives. Theoretical studies reveal that the orbital interactions between the antisymmetric sites of the segments play an important role in extending the conjugation length in the fusion architectures while simultaneously maintaining a small FWHM. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit green emission peaks at 508&#8211;509&#160;nm and the first green electroluminescence FWHM of &lt;20&#160;nm ever reported. Benefiting from the preferential horizontal dipole orientation, a high maximum external quantum efficiency of up to 30.9% is obtained, which remains at 28.9% and 23.2% under luminances of 1000 and 10&#160;000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively, outperforming most reported green devices based on narrowband emitters.

         <title>Hygrothermic Wood Actuated Robotic Hand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygrothermic wood actuator with asymmetric water affinity is developed, which generates stretching and bending responses to moisture and thermal/light stimulation. Multiple advantages are realized, including good mechanical properties, multi&#8208;stimulus response, complex deformation, wide working temperature range, low manufacturing cost, and biocompatibility. A robotic hand and grippers are designed for dexterous object&#8211;hand interactions and fire rescue scenarios.








Abstract
Stimulus&#8211;responsive actuators play a vital role in the new generation of intelligent systems. However, poor mechanical performance, complicated fabrication processes, and the inability to complex deformation limit their practical applications. Herein, these challenges are overcome via designing a strong hygrothermic wood actuator with asymmetric water affinity. The actuator is readily constructed by sandwiching polypyrrole&#8208;coated wood with a Ni complex hygroscopic gel top layer for moisture absorption and a polyimide bottom layer as the water barrier. The resulting hygrothermic wood spontaneously stretches and bends itself in response to moisture and thermal/light stimulation. A robotic hand and a series of grippers made of hygrothermic wood demonstrate dexterous object&#8211;hand interactions during grasping and holding, while the reversible hygrothermic property allows the actuator to be potentially applied in fire rescue scenarios to rescue trapped objects. A combination of good mechanical properties, multi&#8208;stimulus&#8208;response, complex deformation, wide working temperature range, low manufacturing cost, and biocompatibility are simultaneously realized by one device. It is thus believed that such a strong wood actuator will open up a new avenue for building intelligent robotic hand systems.

         <title>Efficient Inorganic Vapor&#8208;Assisted Defects Passivation for Perovskite Solar Module</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CS2 vapor passivation strategy is proposed to reduce defects in FAPbI3 films. It is revealed that the CS2 can strongly coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+ and passivate iodide vacancy defects, aligns the interface to facilitate the carrier transport, resulting in remarkably enhance efficiency of the devices (25.20% for 0.08&#160;cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6&#160;cm2).








Abstract
Surface trap as intrinsic defects&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative charge recombination is a major obstacle to achieving the reliable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency and large&#8208;area perovskite photovoltaics. Here a CS2 vapor&#8208;assisted passivation strategy is proposed for perovskite solar module, aiming to passivate the iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ caused by ion migration. Significantly, this method can avoid the disadvantages of inhomogeneity film caused by spin&#8208;coating&#8208;assisted passivation and reconstruction of perovskite surface from solvent. The CS2 vapor passivated perovskite device presents a higher defect formation energy (0.54&#160;eV) of iodine vacancy than the pristine (0.37&#160;eV), while uncoordinated Pb2+ is bonded with CS2. The shallow level defect passivation of iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ has obviously enhanced the device efficiencies (25.20% for 0.08&#160;cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6&#160;cm2) and the stability, exhibiting an average T80&#8208;lifetime of 1040&#160;h working at the maximum power point, and maintaining over 90% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h at RH&#160;=&#160;30% and 30&#160;&#176;C.

Here a CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vapor-assisted passivation strategy is proposed for perovskite solar module, aiming to passivate the iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; caused by ion migration. Significantly, this method can avoid the disadvantages of inhomogeneity film caused by spin-coating-assisted passivation and reconstruction of perovskite surface from solvent. The CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vapor passivated perovskite device presents a higher defect formation energy (0.54&#160;eV) of iodine vacancy than the pristine (0.37&#160;eV), while uncoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is bonded with CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The shallow level defect passivation of iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has obviously enhanced the device efficiencies (25.20% for 0.08&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 20.66% for 40.6&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and the stability, exhibiting an average T&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;-lifetime of 1040&#160;h working at the maximum power point, and maintaining over 90% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h at RH&#160;=&#160;30% and 30&#160;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wide&#8208;Humidity Range Applicable, Anti&#8208;Freezing, and Healable Zwitterionic Hydrogels for Ion&#8208;Leakage&#8208;Free Iontronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solketal, outperforming the commonly used solvent glycerol, endows healable zwitterionic hydrogels with wide&#8208;humidity range applicability and freeze resistance. The optimized zwitterionic hydrogel satisfactorily serves as a dielectric layer to construct iontronic sensors with no ionic leakage, high sensitivity, and environmental stability. A whole&#8208;body healable, stretchable, and highly&#8208;sensitive sensor based on the zwitterionic hydrogels and composites is demonstrated.








Abstract
Hydrogels have entered the spotlight for applications in soft electronics. It is essential and challenging to obtain hydrogels that can function properly under varying environmental circumstances, that is, 30&#8211;90% relative humidity (RH) and &#8722;20 to 40&#160;&#176;C due to their intrinsic nature to lose and absorb water upon variations in humidity and temperature. In this work, a green solvent, solketal, is introduced into poly 3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;2&#8208;enoyloxy)ethyl azaniumyl propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (poly(DMAPS)) zwitterionic hydrogels. Compared to glycerol, solketal endows hydrogels with greater possibility for further modification as well as improved water content and mechanical performance consistency over 30&#8211;90% RH. Encouragingly, the optimized hydrogel demonstrates its unique merits as a dielectric layer in iontronic sensors, featuring non&#8208;leaky ions, high sensitivity (1100 kPa&#8722;1), wide humidity, and temperature range applicability. A wide&#8208;humidity range healable and stretchable electrode is attained by combining the hydrogel substrate with Ag paste. A&#160;full&#8208;device healable and highly&#8208;sensitive sensor is developed. This study is a pioneering work that tackles the broad humidity range applicability issue of hydrogels, and demonstrates the ion&#8208;leakage&#8208;free ionic skins with zwitterionic dielectrics. The outcomes of the study will considerably promote advancements in the fields of hydrogel electronics and iontronic sensors.

         <title>Extremely Tough, Stretchable Gel Electrolytes with Strong Interpolymer Hydrogen Bonding Prepared Using Concentrated Electrolytes to Stabilize Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extremely tough and stretchable gel electrolytes are prepared by leveraging the strong interpolymer hydrogen bonding in concentrated electrolytes. The tough gel electrolyte can be used as an artificial protective layer for lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anodes. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded gel&#8208;coated Li&#8208;metal anode considerably enhances the cycling stability of a Li symmetric cell as well as a Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NMC622) full cell.








Abstract
Extremely tough and stretchable gel electrolytes, which can be prepared by leveraging the strong interpolymer hydrogen bonding in concentrated lithium (Li)&#8208;salt electrolytes, are reported. These electrolytes can be realized by optimizing the competitive hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between polymer chains, solvent molecules, Li cations, and counteranions. Free polar solvent molecules, which typically impede interpolymer hydrogen bonding, are scarce in concentrated electrolytes; this feature can be exploited to prepare hydrogen&#8208;bonded gel electrolytes with unprecedented toughness. In contrast, free solvent molecules are abundant in electrolytes with typical concentrations, yielding considerably weaker gel electrolytes. The tough gel electrolyte can be used an artificial protective layer for Li&#8208;metal anodes, as it considerably enhances the cycling stability of a Li symmetric cell through uniform Li deposition/dissolution. Additionally, employing the gel electrolyte as the protecting layer significantly improves the cycling performance of the Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 full cell.

         <title>Ti3C2Tx MXene van der Waals Gate Contact for GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ti3C2Tx MXene films are integrated into GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) as gate contacts, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions are formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The Schottky gate GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibit a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8776;1013 and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Gate controllability is a key factor that determines the performance of GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). However, at the traditional metal&#8208;GaN interface, direct chemical interaction between metal and GaN can result in fixed charges and traps, which can significantly deteriorate the gate controllability. In this study, Ti3C2Tx MXene films are integrated into GaN HEMTs as the gate contact, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions are formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibit an extremely low off&#8208;state current (IOFF) of 10&#8722;7 mA&#160;mm&#8722;1, a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8776;1013 (which is six orders of magnitude higher than conventional Ni/Au contact), a high off&#8208;state drain breakdown voltage of 1085&#160;V, and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. This work shows the great potential of MXene films as gate electrodes in wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor devices.

         <title>Unusual Temperature Dependence of Water Sorption in Semicrystalline Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials typically lose their water sorption capability with increasing temperature. Can this temperature effect be reversed? By leveraging the phase transformation of semicrystalline hydrogels, an unusual water sorption behavior is demonstrated where the water uptake can be doubled with an increased temperature of 25&#160;&#176;C. This finding will enable a new degree of freedom to harness moisture and heat.








Abstract
Water vapor sorption is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature and plays an important role in various applications, including humidity regulation, energy storage, thermal management, and water harvesting. In particular, capturing moisture at elevated temperatures is highly desirable to prevent dehydration and to enlarge the tunability of water uptake. However, owing to the thermodynamic limit of conventional materials, sorbents inevitably tend to capture less water vapor at higher temperatures, impeding their broad applications. Here, an inverse temperature dependence of water sorption in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels, where their water uptake can be doubled with increasing temperature from 25 to 50&#160;&#176;C, is reported. With mechanistic modeling of water&#8211;polymer interactions, this unusual water sorption is attributed to the first&#8208;order phase transformation of PEG structures, and the key parameters for a more generalized strategy in materials development are identified. This work elucidates a new regime of water sorption with an unusual temperature dependence, enabling a promising engineering space for harnessing moisture and heat.

         <title>Artificial Tendrils Mimicking Plant Movements by Mismatching Modulus and Strain in Core and Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological principles of tendril movement and coiling in plants are studied and used as design criteria to implement coiling movements in an artificial multimaterial fiber (MMFs) system. The MMFs are composed of a shape&#8208;memory core and an elastic shell, such that the core enables the implementation of strain displacement in the MMF by physical means and provides thermally controlled reversible coiling movement.








Abstract
Motile organs have evolved in climbing plants enabling them to find a support and, after secure attachment, to reach for sunlight without investing in a self&#8208;supporting stem. Searching movements, the twining of stems, and the coiling of tendrils are involved in successful plant attachment. Such coiling movements have great potential in robotic applications, especially if they are reversible. Here, the underlying mechanism of tendril movement based on contractile fibers is reported, as illustrated by a function&#8211;morphological analysis of tendrils in several liana species and the encoding of such a principle in a core&#8211;shell multimaterial fiber (MMF) system. MMFs are composed of a shape&#8208;memory core fiber (SMCF) and an elastic shell. The shape&#8208;memory effect of the core fibers enables the implementation of strain mismatch in the MMF by physical means and provides thermally controlled reversible motion. The produced MMFs show coiling and/or uncoiling behavior, with a high reversible actuation magnitude of &#8776;400%, which is almost 20 times higher compared with similar stimuli for sensitive soft actuators. The movements in these MMFs rely on the crystallization/melting behavior of oriented macromolecules of SMCF.

         <title>Diagnosing and Correcting the Failure of the Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolyte for Enhancing Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; polysulfides on the electrode interface in a diffusion&#8208;restricted solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) is identified as a critical failure cause of solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries, which can be addressed by applying single&#8208;atom electrocatalysis to tailor the chemical environment in the SPE.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) attract great interest in developing high&#8208;performance yet reliable solid&#8208;state batteries. However, understanding of the failure mechanism of the SPE and SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries remains in its infancy, posing a great barrier to practical solid&#8208;state batteries. Herein, the high accumulation and clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; lithium polysulfides (LiPS) on the interface between the cathode and SPE with intrinsic diffusion limitation is identified as a critical failure cause of SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries. It induces a poorly reversible chemical environment with retarded kinetics on the cathode&#8211;SPE interface and in bulk SPEs, starving the Li&#8211;S redox in solid&#8208;state cells. This observation is different from the case in liquid electrolytes with free solvent and charge carriers, where LiPS dissolve but remain alive for electrochemical/chemical redox without interfacial clogging. Electrocatalysis demonstrates the feasibility of tailoring the chemical environment in diffusion&#8208;restricted reaction media for reducing Li&#8211;S redox failure in the SPE. It enables Ah&#8208;level solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S pouch cells with a high specific energy of 343&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 on the cell level. This work may shed new light on the understanding of the failure mechanism of SPE for bottom&#8208;up improvement of solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Graphene Biointerface for Cardiac Arrhythmia Diagnosis and Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of graphene biointerfaces for cardiac electrophysiology is presented. The devices feature effective electrochemical properties: low impedance and high charge storage and injection capacities. The transparency of graphene allows for simultaneous optical mapping and optogenetic stimulation while performing electrical measurements and stimulation. This report indicates that graphene biointerfaces are fundamental for future diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.








Abstract
Heart rhythm disorders, known as arrhythmias, cause significant morbidity and are one of the leading causes of mortality. Cardiac arrhythmias are frequently treated by implantable devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, or by ablation therapy guided by electroanatomical mapping. Both implantable and ablation therapies require sophisticated biointerfaces for electrophysiological measurements of electrograms and delivery of therapeutic stimulation or ablation energy. In this work, a graphene biointerface for in vivo cardiac electrophysiology is reported for the first time. Leveraging sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;thick tissue&#8208;conformable graphene arrays, sensing and stimulation of the open mammalian heart are demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the graphene biointerface treatment of atrioventricular block (the kind of arrhythmia where the electrical conduction from the atria to the ventricles is interrupted) is demonstrated. The graphene arrays show effective electrochemical properties, namely interface impedance down to 40&#160;&#937;&#8201;cm2 at 1&#160;kHz, charge storage capacity up to 63.7&#160;mC&#160;cm&#8722;2, and charge injection capacity up to 704&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2. Transparency of the graphene structures allows for simultaneous optical mapping of cardiac action potentials, calcium transients, and optogenetic stimulation while performing electrical measurements and stimulation. The report presents evidence of the significant potential of graphene biointerfaces for advanced cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia therapy.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Stable Hyperfluorescence Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Improved Color Purities and Ultrahigh Power Efficiencies Based on Low&#8208;Polar Sensitizing Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer with low polarity, high steric hindrance, and concentration&#8208;quenching free feature is created, based on which low&#8208;polar sensitizing systems with small carrier injection barrier and full exciton utilization are achieved for hyperfluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, providing high color purity, record&#8208;high electroluminescence efficiencies and long operational lifetime.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are emerging as promising candidates for high&#8208;definition displays because of their narrow emission spectra. However, the electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies and spectra of MR&#8208;TADF molecules are highly sensitive to hosts and sensitizers when applied to organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), and the highly polar environments in devices often lead to significantly broadened EL spectra. In this study, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept TADF sensitizer (BTDMAC&#8208;XT) with low polarity, high steric hindrance, and concentration&#8208;quenching free feature is constructed, which acts as a good emitter in doped and non&#8208;doped OLEDs with high external quantum efficiencies (&#951;exts) of 26.7% and 29.3%, respectively. By combining BTDMAC&#8208;XT with conventional low&#8208;polarity hosts, low&#8208;polarity sensitizing systems with a small carrier injection barrier and full exciton utilization are constructed for the MR&#8208;TADF molecule BN2. Hyperfluorescence (HF) OLEDs employing the low&#8208;polar sensitizing systems successfully improve the color quality of BN2 and afford an excellent &#951;ext of 34.4%, a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 166.3&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 and a long operational lifetime (LT50&#160;=&#160;40309&#160;h) at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. These results provide instructive guidance for the sensitizer design and device optimization for energy&#8208;efficient and stable HF&#8208;OLEDs with high&#8208;quality light.

         <title>Reconfigurable Multilevel Optical PUF by Spatiotemporally Programmed Crystallization of Supersaturated Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of reconfigurable multilevel optical physical unclonable function (PUF) based on the stochastic crystallization of supersaturated solution, intended for a hierarchical identification process with recyclable tokens, is presented. The global parameters introduced in this study act as prefixes to classify PUFs into subgroups, which allows for a fast authentication process.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are&#160;emerging as an alternative to information security by providing an advanced level of cryptographic keys with non&#8208;replicable characteristics, yet the cryptographic keys of conventional PUFs are not reconfigurable from the ones assigned at the manufacturing stage and the overall authentication process slows down as the number of entities in the dataset or the length of cryptographic key increases. Herein, a supersaturated solution&#8208;based PUF (S&#8208;PUF) is presented that utilizes stochastic crystallization of a supersaturated sodium acetate solution to allow a time&#8208;efficient, hierarchical authentication process together with on&#8208;demand rewritability of cryptographic keys. By controlling the orientation and the average grain size of the sodium acetate crystals via a spatiotemporally programmed temperature profile, the S&#8208;PUF now includes two global parameters, that is, angle of rotation and divergence of the diffracted beam, in addition to the speckle pattern to produce multilevel cryptographic keys, and these parameters function as prefixes for the classification of each entity for a fast authentication process. At the same time, the reversible phase change of sodium acetate enables repeated reconfiguration of the cryptographic key, which is expected to offer new possibilities for a next&#8208;generation, recyclable anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform.

         <title>Vertical Array of Graphite Oxide Liquid Crystal by Microwire Shearing for Highly Thermally Conductive Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly vertically ordered liquid crystals of giant graphite oxide (more than 100&#160;&#181;m in lateral dimension) is realized by microwire shearing, which endows the composite with a record high through&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 94&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, 15% higher than that of pure Indium foil (81.8&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1).








Abstract
Excellent through&#8208;plane thermally conductive composites are highly demanded for efficient heat dissipation. Giant sheets have large crystalline domain and significantly reduce interface phonon scattering, making them promising to build highly thermally conductive composites. However, realizing vertical orientation of giant sheets remains challenging due to their enormous mass and huge hydrodynamic drag force. Here,&#160;we&#160;achieve highly vertically ordered liquid crystals of giant graphite oxide (more than 100&#160;&#181;m in lateral dimension) by microwire shearing, which endows the composite with a recorded through&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 94&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Microscale shearing fields induced by vertical motion of microwires conquer huge hydrodynamic energy barrier and vertically reorient giant sheets. The resulting liquid crystals exhibit extremely retarded relaxation and impart large&#8208;scale vertical array with bidirectional ordering degree as high as 0.82. The graphite array&#8208;based composites demonstrate an ultrahigh thermal enhancement efficiency of over 35 times per unit volume. Furthermore, the composites improve cooling efficiency by 93% for thermal management tests compared to commercial thermal interface materials. This work offers a novel methodology to precisely manipulate the orientation of giant particles and promote large&#8208;scale fabrication of vertical array with advanced functionalities.

         <title>Novel Organic Superbase Dopants for Ultraefficient N&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of two organic superbase dopants as ultra&#8208;efficient n&#8208;dopants for OSCs is reported. In&#8208;depth studies reveal that the dopants lead to record&#8208;high conductivity in doped N2200 and PC61BM films, and exhibit particularly high polaron generation efficiency and doping efficiency. A possible deprotonation&#8208;induced nucleophilic&#8208;attack n&#8208;doping mechanism is suggested for the organic superbase dopants.








Abstract
Doping is a powerful technique for engineering the electrical properties of organic semiconductors (OSCs), yet efficient n&#8208;doping of OSCs remains a central challenge. Herein, the discovery of two organic superbase dopants, namely P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu and P4&#8208;t&#8208;Bu as ultra&#8208;efficient n&#8208;dopants for OSCs is reported. Typical n&#8208;type semiconductors such as N2200 and PC61BM are shown to experience a significant increase of conductivity upon doping by the two dopants. In particular, the optimized electrical conductivity of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped PC61BM reaches a record&#8208;high value of 2.64&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. The polaron generation efficiency of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped in PC61BM is found to be over 35%, which is 2&#8211;3 times higher than that of benchmark n&#8208;dopant N&#8208;DMBI. In addition, a deprotonation&#8208;initiated, nucleophilic&#8208;attack&#8208;based n&#8208;doping mechanism is proposed for the organic superbases, which involves the deprotonation of OSC molecules, the nucleophilic attack of the resulting carbanions on the OSC's &#960;&#8208;bonds, and the subsequent n&#8208;doping through single electron transfer process between the anionized and neutral OSCs. This work highlights organic superbases as promising n&#8208;dopants for OSCs and opens up opportunities to explore and develop highly efficient n&#8208;dopants.

         <dc:description>
A blue light excitable Cr3+&#8208;doped&#160;Mg4Ta2O9phosphor is explored, and 61.25% of the record EQE detected at 450&#160;nm excitation&#160;is&#160;achieved through lithium&#8208;ion compensation. As a key and efficient broadband NIR transmitter, it can achieve high optical output power of the NIR light source. It provides a new option&#160;for the next&#8208;generation&#160;compact NIR light source and can be utilized to improve the current detection sensitivity based on intelligent NIR spectroscopy technology.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;efficient broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs) are urgently needed to improve the detection sensitivity and spatial resolution of current smart NIR spectroscopy&#8208;based techniques. Nonetheless, the performance of NIR pc&#8208;LED has severely limited owing to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) bottleneck of NIR light&#8208;emitting materials. Herein, a blue LED excitable Cr3+&#8208;doped tetramagnesium ditantalate (Mg4Ta2O9, MT) phosphor is advantageously modified through lithium ion as a key efficient broadband NIR emitter to achieve high optical output power of the NIR light source. The emission spectrum encompasses the 700&#8211;1300&#160;nm electromagnetic spectrum of first biological window (&#955;max&#160;= 842&#160;nm) with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of &#8776;2280 cm&#8722;1 (&#8776;167&#160;nm), and achieves a record EQE of 61.25% detected at 450&#160;nm excitation through Li&#8208;ion compensation. A prototype NIR pc&#8208;LED is fabricated with MT:Cr3+, Li+ to evaluate its potential practical application, which reveals an NIR output power of 53.22&#160;mW at a driving current of 100&#160;mA, and a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 25.09% at 10&#160;mA. This work provides an ultra&#8208;efficient broadband NIR luminescent material, which shows great promise in practical applications and presents a novel option for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power compact NIR light sources.

         <title>Two Functions from a Single Photoresist: Tuning Microstructure Degradability from Light&#8208;Stabilized Dynamic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;in&#8208;one photoresist for 3D direct laser writing applications is introduced, which allows the degradation properties of the printed structure to be carefully tuned by simply altering the laser intensity during the fabrication process. The unique ability to fabricate 3D microstructures consisting of both degradable and nondegradable segments from a single photoresist is a critical advancement in photoresist technology.








Abstract
A photoresist&#8212;based on a light&#8208;stabilized dynamic material driven by an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium photo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of triazolinediones with naphthalenes&#8212;whose ability to intrinsically degrade postprinting can be tuned by a simple adjustment of laser intensity during 3D laser lithography is introduced. The resist's ability to form stable networks under green light irradiation that degrade in the dark is transformed into a tunable degradable 3D printing material platform. In&#8208;depth characterization of the printed microstructures via atomic force microscopy before and during degradation reveals the high dependency of the final structures&#8217; properties on the writing parameters. Upon identifying the ideal writing parameters and their effect on the network structure, it is possible to selectively toggle between stable and fully degradable structures. This simplifies the direct laser writing manufacturing process of multifunctional materials significantly, which typically requires the use of separate resists and consecutive writing efforts to achieve degradable and nondegradable material sections.

         <title>A Scalable Platform for Fabricating Biodegradable Microparticles with Pulsatile Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs (PULSED) is a high&#8208;throughput method for fabricating biodegradable microparticles that release drug in a discrete pulse after a tunable delay. The PULSED encapsulation technique is compatible with crystalline and semi&#8208;crystalline polymers, and is gentle enough to preserve the bioactivity of proteins.








Abstract
Pulsatile drug delivery systems have the potential to improve patient adherence and therapeutic efficacy by providing a sequence of doses in a single injection. Herein, a novel platform, termed Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs (PULSED) is developed, which enables the high&#8208;throughput fabrication of microparticles exhibiting pulsatile release. In PULSED, biodegradable polymeric microstructures with an open cavity are formed using high&#8208;resolution 3D printing and soft lithography, filled with drug, and sealed using a contactless heating step in which the polymer flows over the orifice to form a complete shell around a drug&#8208;loaded core. Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) particles with this structure can rapidly release encapsulated material after delays of 10 &#177; 1, 15 &#177; 1, 17 &#177; 2, or 36 &#177; 1 days in vivo, depending on polymer molecular weight and end group. The system is even compatible with biologics, releasing over 90% of bevacizumab in its bioactive form after a two&#8208;week delay in vitro. The PULSED system is highly versatile, offering compatibility with crystalline and amorphous polymers, easily injectable particle sizes, and compatibility with several newly developed drug loading methods. Together, these results suggest that PULSED is a promising platform for creating long&#8208;acting drug formulations that improve patient outcomes due to its simplicity, low cost, and scalability.

         <title>High Energy Harvesting Performances Silicone Elastomer via Filling Soft Dielectric with Stretching Deformability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft dielectric with good interfacial interaction, dielectric enhancement, and deformability is developed and used as novel filler for dielectric elastomer, significantly improving the stretched breakdown strength of nanocomposite under 800% plane strain. Dielectric elastomer generator based on this soft filler shows high power generation energy density (130.5 mJ g&#8722;1) and record electromechanical conversion efficiency (44.5%).








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer generators (DEGs) with high generated energy density and high conversion efficiency are of great interest. Among several dielectric elastomers (DEs), silicone elastomer filled with ceramic fillers have been extensively studied for their high elasticity, insulation, and permittivity. However, the stretched breakdown strength (Ebs) of such composites decreases significantly under large strain, thus sharply reduces its energy harvesting performances. In this study, a polar rubber&#8208;based dielectric (GNBR) is synthetized and creatively used as &#8220;soft filler&#8221; for silicone elastomer. Benefiting from the deformability under stretching and its inherent strong interface bonding with silicone elastomer, this soft filler effectively avoids the formation of weak interface under large strain and reduces the local field strength of interface area. As expected, the composite filled with soft filler (GNBR/PMVS) shows enhanced Ebs of 2.8 times that of composite with traditional hard filler (TiO2/PMVS) under equibiaxial strain of 200%. As a result, GNBR/PMVS composite exhibits maximum energy density of 130.5 mJ g&#8722;1 with up&#8208;to&#8208;date highest power conversion efficiency of reported DEG (44.5%). The findings will provide new insights in the rational design of DE composites characterized by high stretched breakdown strength for advanced energy harvesting system.

         <title>Launching and Manipulation of Higher&#8208;Order In&#8208;Plane Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in Low&#8208;Dimensional Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly confined, directionally dependent in&#8208;plane hyperbolic light propagation is demonstrated in a heterostructure composed of a 3C&#8208;SiC nanowire on &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flake. Such low&#8208;dimensional heterostructure showcases the efficient and precise manipulation of the extremely anisotropic light&#8208;matter interactions at the deeply subwavelength scale, opening opportunities for a wide range of IR applications.








Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) are stimulated by coupling infrared (IR) photons with the polar lattice vibrations. Such HPhPs offer low&#8208;loss, highly confined light propagation at subwavelength scales with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane or in&#8208;plane hyperbolic wavefronts. For HPhPs, while a hyperbolic dispersion implies multiple propagating modes with a distribution of wavevectors at a given frequency, so far it has been challenging to experimentally launch and probe the higher&#8208;order modes that offer stronger wavelength compression, especially for in&#8208;plane HPhPs. In this work, the experimental observation of higher&#8208;order in&#8208;plane HPhP modes stimulated on a 3C&#8208;SiC nanowire (NW)/&#945;&#8208;MoO3 heterostructure is reported where leveraging both the low&#8208;dimensionality and low&#8208;loss nature of the polar NWs, higher&#8208;order HPhPs modes within 2D &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal are launched by the 1D 3C&#8208;SiC NW. The launching mechanism is further studied and the requirements for efficiently launching of such higher&#8208;order modes are determined. In addition, by altering the geometric orientation between the 3C&#8208;SiC NW and &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal, the manipulation of higher&#8208;order HPhP dispersions as a method of tuning is demonstrated. This work illustrates an extremely anisotropic low dimensional heterostructure platform to confine and configure electromagnetic waves at the deep&#8208;subwavelength scales for a range of IR applications including sensing, nano&#8208;imaging, and on&#8208;chip photonics.

         <title>Improved Carrier Management via a Multifunctional Modifier for High&#8208;Quality Low&#8208;Bandgap Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskites and Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and excellent contacts at the perovskite/C60 interface are developed by introducing a one&#8208;in&#8208;all modifier. The introduction of cysteine hydrochloride (CysHCl) to Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites restrains non&#8208;radiative recombination and facilitates electron transfer. Consequently, the CysHCl&#8208;processed devices achieve the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.15% for low&#8208;bandgap (LBG) Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) and 26.16% for all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem devices.








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) hold great promise in terms of ultrahigh efficiency, low manufacturing cost, and flexibility, stepping forward to the next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. However, their further development is hampered by the relatively low performance of low&#8208;bandgap (LBG) tin (Sn)&#8211;lead (Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Improving the carrier management, including suppressing trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination and promoting carrier transfer, is of great significance to enhance the performance of Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs. Herein, a carrier management strategy is reported for using cysteine hydrochloride (CysHCl) simultaneously as a bulky passivator and a surface anchoring agent for Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite. CysHCl processing effectively reduces trap density and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination, enabling the growth of high&#8208;quality Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite with greatly improved carrier diffusion length of &gt;8&#160;&#181;m. Furthermore, the electron transfer at the perovskite/C60 interface is accelerated due to the formation of surface dipoles and favorable energy band bending. As a result, these advances enable the demonstration of champion efficiency of 22.15% for CysHCl&#8208;processed LBG Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs with remarkable enhancement in both open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor. When paired with a wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite subcell, a certified 25.7%&#8208;efficient all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem device is further demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;High-quality Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and excellent contacts at the perovskite/C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; interface are developed by introducing a one-in-all modifier. The introduction of cysteine hydrochloride (CysHCl) to Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites restrains non-radiative recombination and facilitates electron transfer. Consequently, the CysHCl-processed devices achieve the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.15% for low-bandgap (LBG) Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) and 26.16% for all-perovskite monolithic tandem devices.

         <title>Trans&#8208;Reflective Structural Color Filters Assisting Multifunctional&#8208;Integrated Semitransparent Photovoltaic Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multifunctional STOPVs for smart windows are presented, based on strong resonance effect of asymmetrical MIM microcavities. These devices present a recorded QUE of 80%, flowery trans&#8208;reflective structural colors scanning visible region, superior UV&#8208;blocking (300&#8211;400&#160;nm) of 95%, and IR&#8208;rejection (700&#8211;1400&#160;nm) of 100%, of which, the rear two performances are individually better than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial optical films for solar window.








Abstract
Multifunction&#8208;integrated semitransparent organic photovoltaic cells (STOPVs), with high power generation, colorful transmittance/reflectance, excellent&#160;ultraviolet (UV) protection, and thermal insulation, are fully in line with the concept of architectural aesthetics and photoprotection characteristics for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic&#8208;window. For the indelible rainbow color photovoltaic window, one crucial issue is to realize the integration of these photons&#8208; and photoelectric&#8208;related multifunction. Herein, dynamic transmissive and reflective structural color controllable filters, with asymmetrical metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;metal (MIM) configurations (20&#160;nm&#8208;Ag&#8208;HATCN&#8208;30&#160;nm&#8208;Ag) through machine learning, are deliberately designed for colorful STOPV devices. This endows the resultant integrated devices with &#8776;5% enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the bare&#8208;STOPVs, gifted UV (300&#8211;400&#160;nm) blocking rates as high as 93.5, 94.1, 90.2, and 94.5%, as well as a superior&#160;infrared radiation (IR) (700&#8208;1400&#160;nm) rejection approaching 100% for transparent purple&#8208;, blue&#8208;, green&#8208; and red&#8208;STOPV cells, respectively. Most importantly, benefiting from the photonic recycling effect beyond microcavity resonance wavelength, a reported quantum utilization efficiency (QUE) as high as 80%, is first presented for the transparent&#8208;green&#8208;STOPVs with an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV. These asymmetrical Febry&#8208;P&#233;rot transmissive and reflective structural color filters can also be extended to silicon&#8208; and perovskite&#8208;based optoelectric devices and make it possible to integrate additional target optical functions for multi&#8208;purpose optoelectric devices.

         <title>Superlattice Nanofilm on a Touchscreen for Photoexcited Bacteria and Virus Killing by Tuning Electronic Defects in the Heterointerface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering electronic defects in ZnO&#8211;Fe2O3 superlattice heterointerfaces is applied for smartphone&#8208;/solar&#8208;triggered bactericidal and virucidal touchscreens, even against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and H1N1 viruses under simulated solar or low&#8208;power LED light irradiation. Meanwhile, this superlattice nanofilm on a touchscreen exhibits excellent light transmission (&gt;90%), abrasion resistance (106 times the round&#8208;trip friction), and biocompatibility.








Abstract
Currently, the global COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has significantly increased the public attention toward the spread of pathogenic viruses and bacteria on various high&#8208;frequency touch surfaces. Developing a self&#8208;disinfecting coating on a touchscreen is an urgent and meaningful task. Superlattice materials are among the most promising photocatalysts owing to their efficient charge transfer in abundant heterointerfaces. However, excess electronic defects at the heterointerfaces result in the loss of substantial amounts of photogenerated charge carrier. In this study, a ZnO&#63743;Fe2O3 superlattice nanofilm is designed via atomic layer deposition for photocatalytic bactericidal and virucidal touchscreen. Additionally, electronic defects in the superlattice heterointerface are engineered. Photogenerated electrons and holes will be rapidly separated and transferred into ZnO and Fe2O3 across the heterointerfaces owing to the formation of Zn&#63743;O, Fe&#63743;O, and Zn&#63743;Fe covalent bonds at the heterointerfaces, where ZnO and Fe2O3 function as electronic donors and receptors, respectively. The high generation capacity of reactive oxygen species results in a high antibacterial and antiviral efficacy (&gt;90%) even against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and H1N1 viruses under simulated solar or low&#8208;power LED light irradiation. Meanwhile, this superlattice nanofilm on a touchscreen shows excellent light transmission (&gt;90%), abrasion resistance (106 times the round&#8208;trip friction), and biocompatibility.

         <title>Move Aside Pentacene: Diazapentacene&#8208;Doped para&#8208;Terphenyl, a Zero&#8208;Field Room&#8208;Temperature Maser with Strong Coupling for Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

6,13&#8208;Diazapentacene doped in para&#8208;terphenyl is discovered to act as a maser, the microwave analogue of lasers. As&#160;only the second material ever discovered to mase at room&#8208;temperature and zero external magnetic&#8208;field,&#160;optical and paramagnetic characterizations of this new material, to spearhead studies of maser materials for quantum sensors, magnetic spintronics, and tailored organic materials in optoelectronics, are presented.








Abstract
Masers can deliver ultralow&#8208;noise amplification of microwave signals in medical imaging and deep&#8208;space communication, with recent research being rekindled through the discovery of gain media operating at room&#8208;temperature, eschewing bulky cryogenics that hindered their use. This work shows the discovery of 6,13&#8208;diazapentacene doped in para&#8208;terphenyl (DAP:PTP) as a maser gain medium that can operate at room&#8208;temperature, without an external magnetic field. With a maser output power of &#8722;10 dBm, it is on par with pentacene&#8208;doped para&#8208;terphenyl in masing power, while possessing compelling advantages such as faster amplification startup times, being pumped by longer wavelength light at 620 nm and greater chemical stability from nitrogen groups. Furthermore, the maser bursts from DAP:PTP allow one to reach the strong coupling regime for cavity quantum electrodynamics, with a high&#160;cooperativity of 182. The optical and microwave spin dynamics of DAP:PTP are studied in order to evaluate its capabilities as a maser gain medium, where it features fast intersystem crossing and an advantageously higher triplet quantum yield. The results pave the way for the future discovery of similar maser materials and help designate them as promising candidates for quantum sensors, optoelectronic devices and the study of cavity quantum electrodynamic effects at&#160;room&#8208;temperature.

         <title>Achieving Ferroelectricity in a Centrosymmetric High&#8208;Performance Semiconductor by Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>In a high&#8208;performance semiconductor Bi2O2Se, a strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric transition is demonstrated by the appearance of butterfly loops and 180&#176; phase switching in the piezoelectric force microscopy measurements, together with the evolution of optical second&#8208;harmonic generation. Materials with paraelectrics at ambient pressure and ferroelectrics under strain are rare.








Abstract
Phase engineering by strain in 2D semiconductors is of great importance for a variety of applications. Here, a study of the strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric (FE) transition in bismuth oxyselenide (Bi2O2Se) films, a high&#8208;performance (HP) semiconductor for next&#8208;generation electronics, is presented. Bi2O2Se is not FE at ambient pressure. At a loading force of &#8819;400 nN, the piezoelectric force responses exhibit butterfly loops in magnitude and 180&#176; phase switching. By carefully ruling out extrinsic factors, these features are attributed to a transition to the FE phase. The transition is further supported by the appearance of a sharp peak in optical second&#8208;harmonic generation under uniaxial strain. In general, solids with paraelectrics at ambient pressure and FE under strain are rare. The FE transition is discussed using first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical simulations. The switching of FE polarization acts as a knob for Schottky barrier engineering at contacts and serves as the basis for a memristor with a huge on/off current ratio of 106. This work adds a new degree of freedom to HP electronic/optoelectronic semiconductors, and the integration of FE and HP semiconductivity paves the way for many exciting functionalities, including HP neuromorphic computing and bulk&#160;piezophotovoltaics.

         <dc:description>
An ultrathin crystalline ferroelectric polymer based on trichloromethyl (CCl3)&#8208;terminated poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifloroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) is developed on AlOX to realize negative&#8208;capacitance metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (MOSFETs) with a MoS2 channel. Systematic adjustment of the thickness ratio between the polymer and dielectric AlOX achieves a hysteresis&#8208;free FET with a minimum subthreshold swing of 28 mV dec&#8722;1, operating at less than 2 V.








Abstract
Negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) have gathered enormous interest as a way to reduce subthreshold swing (SS) and overcome the issue of power dissipation in modern integrated circuits. For stable NC behavior at low operating voltages, the development of ultrathin ferroelectrics (FE), which are compatible with the industrial process, is of great interest. Here, a new scalable ultrathin ferroelectric polymer layer is developed based on trichloromethyl (CCl3)&#8208;terminated poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifloroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) to achieve the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of NC&#8208;FETs. The crystalline phase of 5&#8211;10&#160;nm ultrathin P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) is prepared on AlOX by a newly developed brush method, which enables an FE/dielectric (DE) bilayer. FE/DE thickness ratios are then systematically tuned at ease to achieve ideal capacitance matching. NC&#8208;FETs with optimized FE/DE thickness at a thickness limit demonstrate hysteresis&#8208;free operation with an SS of 28&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 at &#8776;1.5&#160;V, which competes with the best reports. This P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;brush layer can be broadly adapted to NC&#8208;FETs, opening an exciting avenue for low&#8208;power devices.

         <title>Ultrafast, High&#8208;Strain, and Strong Uniaxial Hydrogel Actuators from Recyclable Nanofibril Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators benefit from high actuation strain and mechanical properties that mimic biological tissues but suffer from low actuation rates and limited controllability. It is shown that the performance of hydrogel actuators can be improved by orders of magnitude using uniaxial fibrillar hydrogels that focus the entire swelling in the actuation direction&#8211;a significant advancement toward hydrogel&#8208;based lifelike machines.








Abstract
Polymer hydrogels mimic biological tissues and are suitable for future lifelike machines. However, their actuation is isotropic, so they must be crosslinked or placed in a turgor membrane to achieve high actuation pressures, severely impeding their performance. Here, it is shown that organizing cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) in anisotropic hydrogel sheets leads to mechanical in&#8208;plane reinforcement that generates a uniaxial, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane strain with performance far surpassing polymer hydrogels. These fibrillar hydrogel actuators expand uniaxially by 250 times with an initial rate of 100&#8211;130%&#160;s&#8722;1, compared to &lt;10 times and &lt;1%&#160;s&#8722;1 in directional strain rate for isotropic hydrogels, respectively. The blocking pressure reaches 0.9&#160;MPa, similar to turgor actuators, while the time to reach 90% of the maximum&#160;pressure is 1&#8211;2&#160;min, compared to 10&#160;min to hours for polymer hydrogel actuators. Uniaxial actuators that lift objects 120&#160;000 times their weight and soft grippers are showcased. In addition, the hydrogels can be recycled without a loss in performance. The uniaxial swelling allows adding channels through the gel for local solvent delivery, further increasing the actuation rate and cyclability. Thus, fibrillar networks can overcome the major drawbacks of hydrogel actuators and is a significant advancement towards hydrogel&#8208;based lifelike machines.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Efficient Electrochemical Catalysts for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular design and crystal engineering strategy are applied to construct thiol&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). This MOF platform is successfully decorated with&#160;nickel&#8211;sulfur links cooperating in the network. The prepared 2D MOF with enhanced electro&#8208;conductivity and modified electronic structure demonstrates superior activity and robust stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which paves the way to design MOFs at a molecular level.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) solids with their variable functionalities are relevant for energy conversion technologies. However, the development of electroactive and stable MOFs for electrocatalysis still faces challenges. Here, a molecularly engineered MOF system featuring a 2D coordination network based on mercaptan&#8211;metal links (e.g., nickel, as for Ni(DMBD)&#8208;MOF) is designed. The crystal structure is solved from microcrystals by a continuous&#8208;rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique. Computational results indicate a metallic electronic structure of Ni(DMBD)&#8208;MOF due to the Ni&#8211;S coordination, highlighting the effective design of the thiol ligand for enhancing electroconductivity. Additionally, both experimental and theoretical studies indicate that (DMBD)&#8208;MOF offers advantages in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over non&#8208;thiol (e.g., 1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylic acid) analog (BDC)&#8208;MOF, because it poses fewer energy barriers during the rate&#8208;limiting *O intermediate formation step. Iron&#8208;substituted NiFe(DMBD)&#8208;MOF achieves a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 at a small overpotential of 280&#160;mV, indicating a new MOF platform for efficient OER catalysis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Membranes Enabled High Energy Density in PEI&#8208;Based Composites for High&#8208;Temperature Electrostatic Capacitors</title>

         <dc:description>
The sandwich structured BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (BZT)/polyetherimide&#8211;boron nitride composites are prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique with water&#8208;dissolvent transfer method and hot&#8208;pressing process. By inserting the single&#8208;crystalline BZT membranes as the inner layer, the composites exhibit good dielectric&#8208;temperature stability and ultra&#8208;high energy&#8208;density. This study paves a scalable way to develop novel high&#8208;temperature dielectric materials and capacitors with superior energy storage performance.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are promising for high power energy storage, but their breakdown strength (Eb) and energy density (Ue) usually degrade rapidly at high temperatures. Adding boron nitride (BN) nanosheets can improve the Eb and high&#8208;temperature endurance but with a limited Ue due to its low dielectric constant. Here, freestanding single&#8208;crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (BZT) membranes with high dielectric constant are fabricated, and introduced into BN doped polyetherimide (PEI) to obtain laminated PEI&#8211;BN/BZT/PEI&#8211;BN composites. At room temperature, the composite shows a maximum Ue of 17.94&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;at 730&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1, which is more than two times the pure PEI. Particularly, the composites exhibit excellent dielectric&#8208;temperature stability between 25&#160;and 150&#160;&#176;C. An outstanding Ue&#160;=&#160;7.90&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;is obtained at a relatively large electric field of 650&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;under 150&#160;&#176;C, which is superior to the most high&#8208;temperature dielectric capacitors reported so far. Phase&#8208;field simulation reveals that the depolarization electric field generated at the BZT/PEI&#8211;BN interfaces can effectively reduce carrier mobility, leading to the remarkable enhancement of the Eb and Ue over a wide temperature range. This work provides a promising and scalable route to develop sandwich&#8208;structured composites with prominent energy storage performances for high&#8208;temperature capacitive applications.

         <title>A Microbial Community Cultured in Gradient Hydrogel for Investigating Gut Microbiome&#8208;Drug Interaction and Guiding Therapeutic Decisions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient hydrogel&#8208;based microbial community is presented to simulate the real intestinal microbiome for bridging microbiome&#8208;drug interaction research and treatment decision. This model reveals three mechanisms of drug&#8208;microbiota interaction: immunological effect, bio&#8208;accumulation, and drug metabolism, which provide innovative regulatory approaches for improving the anti&#8208;cancer effect of drugs.








Abstract
Despite the recognition that the gut microbiota acts a clinically significant role in cancer chemotherapy, both mechanistic understanding and translational research are still limited. Maximizing drug efficacy requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of how the microbiota contributes to therapeutic responses, while microbiota modulation is hindered by the complexity of the human body. To address this issue, a 3D experimental model named engineered microbiota (EM) is reported for bridging microbiota&#8208;drug interaction research and therapeutic decision&#8208;making. EM can be manipulated in vitro and faithfully recapitulate the human gut microbiota at the genus/species level while allowing co&#8208;culture with cells, organoids, and isolated tissues for testing drug responses. Examination of various clinical and experimental drugs by EM reveales that the gut microbiota affects drug efficacy through three pathways: immunological effects, bioaccumulation, and drug metabolism. Guided by discovered mechanisms, custom&#8208;tailored strategies are adopted to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of drugs on orthotopic tumor models with patient&#8208;derived gut microbiota. These strategies include immune synergy, nanoparticle encapsulation, and host&#8211;guest complex formation, respectively. Given the important role of the gut microbiota in influencing drug efficacy, EM will likely become an indispensable tool to guide drug translation and clinical decision&#8208;making.

A fully composited benzo[b]naphtho[2',3':5,6][1,4]dithiino[2,3&#8208;i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,9,14,16,18&#8208;hexone/reduced graphene oxide (BNDTH/RGO)&#160;is designed to simultaneously conquer the low utilization of active sites, intrinsic poor conductivity, and strong solubility of organic electrode materials, realizing the construction of Zn&#8208;organic batteries with record&#8208;high cycling stability. This work brings new opportunities for the exploration of ultra&#8208;stable organic cathode materials for Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Organic materials have attracted much attention in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their sustainability and structure&#8208;designable, but their further development is hindered by the high solubility, poor conductivity, and low utilization of active groups, resulting in poor cycling stability, terrible rate capability, and low capacity. In order to solve these three major obstacles, a novel organic host, benzo[b]naphtho[2&#8217;,3&#8217;:5,6][1,4]dithiino[2,3&#8208;i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,9,14,16,18&#8208;hexone (BNDTH), with abundant electroactive groups and stable extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure is synthesized and composited with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) through a solvent exchange composition method to act as the cathode material for AZIBs. The well&#8208;designed BNDTH/RGO composite exhibits a high capacity of 296&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (nearly a full utilization of the active groups), superior rate capability of 120&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and a long lifetime of 58&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 65% at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Such excellent performance can be attributed to the ingenious structural design of the active molecule, as well as the unique solvent exchange composition strategy that enables effective dispersion of excess charge on the active molecule during discharge/charge process. This work provides important insights for the rational design of organic cathode materials and has significant guidance for realizing ideal high performance in AZIBs.

         <title>Tuning 2D Magnetism in Cobalt Monoxide Nanosheets Via In Situ Nickel&#8208;Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide (Ni&#8208;doped CoO) nanosheets with a high substitution doping concentration is proposed for the first time. 2D Ni&#8208;doped CoO exhibits obvious ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature of &#8776;180 K, in sharp contrast to the pristine non&#8208;ferromagnetic 2D CoO, opening up a prospective way for tuning the magnetism of 2D nonlayered oxide semiconductors.








Abstract
Element doping has become an effective strategy to engineer the magnetic properties of two&#8208;dimensional&#160;(2D) materials and is widely explored in van der Waals layered transition metal dichalcogenides. However, the high&#8208;concentration substitution doping of 2D nonlayered metal oxides, which can preserve the original crystal texture and guarantee the homogeneity of doping distribution, is still a critical challenge due to the isotropic bonding of closed&#8208;packed structures. In this work, the synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D nonlayered nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide nanosheets via in situ atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition method is reported. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed that nickel atoms are doped at the intrinsic cobalt atom sites. The nickel doping concentration is stable at &#8776;15%, superior to most magnetic dopants doping in 2D materials and metal oxides. Magnetic measurements showed that pristine cobalt monoxide is nonferromagnetic, whereas nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide exhibits robust ferromagnetic behavior with a Curie temperature of &#8776;180 K. Density functional theory calculations reveal that nickel atoms can improve the internal ferromagnetic correlation, giving rise to significant ferromagnetic performance of cobalt monoxide nanosheets. These results provide a valuable case for tuning the competing correlated states and magnetic ordering by substitution doping in 2D nonlayered oxide semiconductors.

These results provide a valuable case for tuning the competing correlated states and magnetic ordering by substitution doping in 2D nonlayered oxide semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Maximum Emission Peak Over 1500&#160;nm of Organic Assembly for Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier&#8208;Crossing NIR&#8208;IIb Phototheranostics of Orthotopic Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic assembly with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm is prepared through the self&#8208;assembly of organic small molecule IR&#8208;1064 for blood&#8211;brain barrier&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic glioblastoma.








Abstract
The development of blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB)&#8208;crossing phototheranostic agents in second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), especially in the range of 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb), affords great opportunities for glioblastoma (GBM) management. Herein, an organic assembly (denoted as LET&#8208;12) with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm through the self&#8208;assembly of organic small molecule IR&#8208;1064 is designed and subsequently decorated with choline and acetylcholine analogs. The LET&#8208;12 can effectively cross BBB through the brain's choline&#8208;like receptors&#8208;mediated transcytosis and accumulated in tumor tissues, thus achieving fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) duplex imaging of orthotopic GBM with &#8776;3.0&#160;mm depth and a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal tissue signal ratio (20.93 &#177; 0.59 for FL imaging and 32.63 &#177; 1.16 for PA imaging, respectively). Owing to its good photothermal conversion ability, the LET&#8208;12 also can serve as a photothermal conversion agent, achieving obvious tumor repression of orthotopic murine GBM model after once treatment. The findings indicate that the LET&#8208;12 holds great potential for BBB&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic GBM. This self&#8208;assembly strategy of organic small molecules opens a new avenue for the construction of NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Determination of the Global Zero&#8208;Temperature Phase Diagram of Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining crystal graph attention networks with a newly created dataset, a compound space spanning 1 billion materials is scanned for new stable materials. As a result, the number of known theoretically synthesizable materials is increased by 30%. The resulting materials are then studied for extreme values of several properties.








Abstract
Crystal&#8208;graph attention neural networks have emerged recently as remarkable tools for the prediction of thermodynamic stability. The efficacy of their learning capabilities and their reliability is however subject to the quantity and quality of the data they are fed. Previous networks exhibit strong biases due to the inhomogeneity of the training data. Here a high&#8208;quality dataset is engineered to provide a better balance across chemical and crystal&#8208;symmetry space. Crystal&#8208;graph neural networks trained with this dataset show unprecedented generalization accuracy. Such networks are applied to perform machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted high&#8208;throughput searches of stable materials, spanning 1 billion candidates. In this way, the number of vertices of the global T&#160;= 0&#160;K phase diagram is increased by 30% and find more than &#8776;150&#160;000 compounds with a distance to the convex hull of stability of less than 50&#160;meV&#160;atom&#8722;1. The discovered materials are then accessed for applications, identifying compounds with extreme values of a few properties, such as superconductivity, superhardness, and giant gap&#8208;deformation potentials.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Wall Engineering Enables Thermal Modulation in PMN&#8211;PT Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal conductivity modulation in PMN&#8211;xPT single crystals is demonstrated with a maximum enhancement of more than 20% at the intermediate poling state (intermediate d33). The enhancement is attributed to the reduction in domain wall density due to alternating current poling. The thermal conductivity decreases at optimized poling (maximum d33) due to increasing domain size inhomogeneity.








Abstract
Acting like thermal resistances, ferroelectric domain walls can be manipulated to realize dynamic modulation of thermal conductivity (k), which is essential for developing novel phononic circuits. Despite the interest, little attention has been paid to achieving room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in bulk materials due to challenges in obtaining a high thermal conductivity switching ratio (khigh/klow), particularly in commercially viable materials. Here, room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in 2.5&#160;mm&#8208;thick Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8211;xPbTiO3 (PMN&#8211;xPT) single crystals is demonstrated. With the use of advanced poling conditions, assisted by the systematic study on composition and orientation dependence of PMN&#8211;xPT, a range of thermal conductivity switching ratios with a maximum of &#8776;1.27 is observed. Simultaneous measurements of piezoelectric coefficient (d33) to characterize the poling state, domain wall density using polarized light microscopy (PLM), and birefringence change using quantitative PLM&#160;reveal that compared to the unpoled state, the domain wall density at intermediate poling states (0&lt; d33&lt;d33,max) is lower due to the enlargement in domain size. At optimized poling conditions (d33,max), the domain sizes show increased inhomogeneity that leads to enhancement in the domain wall density. This work highlights the potential of commercially available PMN&#8211;xPT single crystals among other relaxor&#8208;ferroelectrics for achieving temperature control in solid&#8208;state devices.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 at 4.7&#160;V by Interface Stabilization and Band Structure Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modified&#160;LCO has a gradient doping of Mg, uniform doping of Ni in Li layers, and uniform LiMgxNi1&#8722;xPO4 coating. The doping and coating simultaneously modify the band structure to improve the oxygen redox reversibility during cycles. Therefore, the modified LCO shows excellent cycling performance both at 4.6 V and 4.7 V.








Abstract
Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) is widely used in Li&#8208;ion batteries due to its high volumetric energy density, which is generally charged to 4.3 V. Lifting the cut&#8208;off voltage of LCO from 4.3 V to 4.7 V will increase the specific capacity from 150 to 230 mAh g&#8208;1 with a significant improvement of 53%. However, LCO suffers serious problems of H1&#8208;3/O1 phase transformation, unstable interface between cathode and electrolyte, and irreversible oxygen redox reaction at 4.7 V. Herein, interface stabilization and band structure modification are proposed to strengthen the crystal structure of LCO for stable cycling of LCO at an ultrahigh voltage of 4.7 V. Gradient distribution of magnesium and uniform doping of nickel in Li layers inhibit the harmful phase transitions of LCO, while uniform LiMgxNi1&#8722;xPO4 coating stabilizes the LCO&#8208;electrolyte interface during cycles. Moreover, the modified band structure improves the oxygen redox reaction reversibility and electrochemical performance of the modified LCO. As a result, the modified LCO has a high capacity retention of 78% after 200 cycles at 4.7 V in the half cell and 63% after 500 cycles at 4.6 V in the full cell. This work makes the capacity of LCO one step closer to its theoretical specific capacity.

&lt;/i&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; coating stabilizes the LCO-electrolyte interface during cycles. Moreover, the modified band structure improves the oxygen redox reaction reversibility and electrochemical performance of the modified LCO. As a result, the modified LCO has a high capacity retention of 78% after 200 cycles at 4.7 V in the half cell and 63% after 500 cycles at 4.6 V in the full cell. This work makes the capacity of LCO one step closer to its theoretical specific capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Walking Ferroelectric Liquid Droplets with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motion of ferroelectric liquid dropletson a ferroelectric solid substrate is controlled by a light beam of moderate intensity. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase, droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on which side of the ferroelectric substrate is exposed to light. Moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate.








Abstract
The motion of ferroelectric liquid sessile droplets deposited on a ferroelectric lithium niobate substrate can be controlled by a light beam of moderate intensity irradiating the substrate at a distance of several droplet diameters from the droplet itself. The ferroelectric liquid is a nematic liquid crystal, in which almost complete polar ordering of the molecular dipoles generates an internal macroscopic polarization locally collinear to the mean molecular long axis. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase, droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on the side of the lithium niobate exposed to light irradiation. Moreover, moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate. This behavior is understood as due to the coupling between the polarization of the ferroelectric droplet and the polarization photoinduced in the irradiated region of the lithium niobate substrate. Indeed, the effect is not observed in the conventional nematic phase, suggesting the crucial role of the ferroelectric liquid crystal polarization.

         <title>Cuproptosis Induced by ROS Responsive Nanoparticles with Elesclomol and Copper Combined with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2212267, Nianzeng Xing, Haihua Xiao, and co&#8208;workers provides a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve synergistic cancer immunotherapy via cuproptosis induced by ROS&#8208;responsive nanomedicine loaded with elesclomol and copper (NP@ESCu). With this approach, the tumor microenvironment is reprogrammed, and the expression of PD&#8208;L1 is increased, which consequently improves responsiveness of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Cuproptosis is a new cell death that depends on copper (Cu) ionophores to transport Cu into cancer cells, which induces cell death. However, existing Cu ionophores are small molecules with a short blood half&#8208;life making it hard to transport enough Cu into cancer cells. Herein, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer (PHPM) is designed, which is used to co&#8208;encapsulate elesclomol (ES) and Cu to form nanoparticles (NP@ESCu). After entering cancer cells, ES and Cu, triggered by excessive intracellular ROS, are readily released. ES and Cu work in a concerted way to not only kill cancer cells by cuproptosis, but also induce immune responses. In vitro, the ability of NP@ESCu to efficiently transport Cu and induce cuproptosis is investigated. In addition, the change in the transcriptomes of cancer cells treated with NP@ESCu is explored by RNA&#8208;Seq. In vivo, NP@ESCu is found to induce cuproptosis in the mice model with subcutaneous bladder cancer, reprograming the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, NP@ESCu is further combined with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand&#8208;1&#160;antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1). This study provides the first report of combining nanomedicine that can induce cuproptosis with &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#160;for enhanced cancer therapy, thereby providing a novel strategy for future cancer therapy.

Immunotherapy
In article 2212267, Haihua Xiao, Nianzeng Xing, and co&#8208;workers present a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve synergistic cancer immunotherapy via cuproptosis induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanomedicine loaded with elesclomol and copper (NP@ESCu). With this approach, the tumor microenvironment is reprogrammed, and the expression of PD&#8208;L1 is increased, which consequently improves responsiveness of immunotherapy.

Perovskite Solar Modules
In article number 2211593, Yang Wang, Yanlin Song, and co&#8208;workers propose a strategy of vapor&#8208;assisted defect passivation to manage defects in perovskite solar modules. CS2 can strongly coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ and passivate iodide vacancy defects, resulting in remarkable enhancement of the device efficiency (25.20% for 0.08 cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6 cm2).

         <title>Molecular Complementarity of Proteomimetic Materials for Target&#8208;Specific Recognition and Recognition&#8208;Mediated Complex Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nature, proteins perform various recognition&#8208;mediated molecular functions relying on the principle of molecular complementarity. This review introduces how diverse synthesizable and modifiable materials with elaborate structural and molecular designs can achieve the molecular complementarity in mediating complex protein&#8208;like functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions, expanding the landscape of their proteomimetic applications.








Abstract
As biomolecules essential for sustaining life, proteins are generated from long chains of 20 different &#945;&#8208;amino acids that are folded into unique 3D structures. In particular, many proteins have molecular recognition functions owing to their binding pockets, which have complementary shapes, charges, and polarities for specific targets, making these biopolymers unique and highly valuable for biomedical and biocatalytic applications. Based on the understanding of protein structures and microenvironments, molecular complementarity can be exhibited by synthesizable and modifiable materials. This has prompted researchers to explore the proteomimetic potentials of a diverse range of materials, including biologically available peptides and oligonucleotides, synthetic supramolecules, inorganic molecules, and related coordination networks. To fully resemble a protein, proteomimetic materials perform the molecular recognition to mediate complex molecular functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions; this can also expand the landscape of their potential bio&#8208;applications. This review focuses on the recognitive aspects of proteomimetic designs derived for individual materials and their conformations. Recent progress provides insights to help guide the development of advanced protein mimicry with material heterogeneity, design modularity, and tailored functionality. The perspectives and challenges of current proteomimetic designs and tools are also discussed in relation to future applications.

         <title>Molecular Electronics: Creating and Bridging Molecular Junctions and Promoting Its Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation of nanogap electrode fabrication protocols according to new classification principles is provided. How to integrate molecules into nanogap electrodes to form molecular junctions and highlight recent efforts toward the commercialization of molecular circuits are summarized, eventually overcoming the Achilles&#8217; heel of molecular electronics as a whole.








Abstract
Molecular electronics is driven by the dream of expanding Moore's law to the molecular level for next&#8208;generation electronics through incorporating individual or ensemble molecules into electronic circuits. For nearly 50 years, numerous efforts have been made to explore the intrinsic properties of molecules and develop diverse fascinating molecular electronic devices with the desired functionalities. The flourishing of molecular electronics is inseparable from the development of various elegant methodologies for creating nanogap electrodes and bridging the nanogap with molecules. This review first focuses on the techniques for making lateral and vertical nanogap electrodes by breaking, narrowing, and fixed modes, and highlights their capabilities, applications, merits, and shortcomings. After summarizing the approaches of growing single molecules or molecular layers on the electrodes, the methods of constructing a complete molecular circuit are comprehensively grouped into three categories: 1) directly bridging one&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode component with another electrode, 2) physically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components, and 3) chemically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components. Finally, the current state of molecular circuit integration and commercialization is discussed and perspectives are provided, hoping to encourage the community to accelerate the realization of fully scalable molecular electronics for a new era of integrated microsystems and applications.

         <title>Modulations in Superconductors: Probes of Underlying Physics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulations in superconductors are summarized comprehensively, which includes state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and those established methods. The significance of modulations in exploring the superconductivity is highlighted by applications into several newly discovered superconductors. Three directions for development of modulations are also outlined.








Abstract
The importance of modulations is elevated to an unprecedented level, due to the delicate conditions required to bring out exotic phenomena in quantum materials, such as topological materials, magnetic materials, and superconductors. Recently, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modulation techniques in material science, such as electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer transistor, piezoelectric&#8208;based strain apparatus, angle twisting, and nanofabrication, have been utilized in superconductors. They not only efficiently increase the tuning capability to the broader ranges but also extend the tuning dimensionality to unprecedented degrees of freedom, including quantum fluctuations of competing phases, electronic correlation, and phase coherence essential to global superconductivity. Here, for a comprehensive review, these techniques together with the established modulation methods, such as elemental substitution, annealing, and polarization&#8208;induced gating, are contextualized. Depending on the mechanism of each method, the modulations are categorized into stoichiometric manipulation, electrostatic gating, mechanical modulation, and geometrical design. Their recent advances are highlighted by applications in newly discovered superconductors, e.g., nickelates, Kagome metals, and magic&#8208;angle graphene. Overall, the review is to provide systematic modulations in emergent superconductors and serve as the coordinate for future investigations, which can stimulate researchers in superconductivity and other fields to perform various modulations toward a thorough understanding of quantum materials.

Recent developments in hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials and their applications are comprehensively reviewed, with an in&#8208;depth analysis of ferroelectric transistors and their array structures. The relevant technological issues and their solutions are also discussed. This review provides a roadmap for the development of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memory and neuromorphic devices based on ferroelectric transistors.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials have been intensively investigated for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memory devices in the past decades, owing to their nonvolatile polarization characteristics. Ferroelectric memory devices are expected to exhibit lower power consumption and higher speed than conventional memory devices. However, non&#8208;complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility and degradation due to fatigue of traditional perovskite&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have hindered the development of high&#8208;density and high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memories in the past. The recently developed hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have attracted immense attention in the development of advanced semiconductor devices. Because hafnia is typically used in CMOS processes, it can be directly incorporated into current semiconductor technologies. Additionally, hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectrics show high scalability and large coercive fields that are advantageous for high&#8208;density memory devices. This review summarizes the recent developments in ferroelectric devices, especially ferroelectric transistors, for next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications. First, the types of ferroelectric memories and their operation mechanisms are reviewed. Then, issues limiting the realization of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric transistors and possible solutions are discussed. The experimental demonstration of ferroelectric transistor arrays, including 3D ferroelectric NAND and its operation characteristics, are also reviewed. Finally, challenges and strategies toward the development of next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications based on ferroelectric transistors are outlined.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of proton exchange membrane based electrolyzers is highly dependent on the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode. The recent progress on the design of acidic OER electrocatalysts is reviewed, along with theoretical and experimental studies on the intrinsic mechanisms. Furthermore, some unresolved but urgent questions and the perspectives regarding future research for acidic OER electrocatalysts are provided.








Abstract
The well&#8208;established proton exchange membrane (PEM)&#8208;based water electrolysis, which operates under acidic conditions, possesses many advantages compared to alkaline water electrolysis, such as compact design, higher voltage efficiency, and higher gas purity. However, PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis is hampered by the low efficiency, instability, and high cost of anodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this review, the recently reported acidic OER electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized, classified, and discussed. The related fundamental studies on OER mechanisms and the relationship between activity and stability are particularly highlighted in order to provide an atomistic&#8208;level understanding for OER catalysis. A stability test protocol is suggested to evaluate the intrinsic activity degradation. Some current challenges and unresolved questions, such as the usage of carbon&#8208;based materials and the differences between the electrocatalyst performances in acidic electrolytes and PEM&#8208;based electrolyzers are also discussed. Finally, suggestions for the most promising electrocatalysts and a perspective for future research are outlined. This review presents a fresh impetus and guideline to the rational design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance acidic OER electrocatalysts for PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis.

&lt;p&gt;The well-established proton exchange membrane (PEM)-based water electrolysis, which operates under acidic conditions, possesses many advantages compared to alkaline water electrolysis, such as compact design, higher voltage efficiency, and higher gas purity. However, PEM-based water electrolysis is hampered by the low efficiency, instability, and high cost of anodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this review, the recently reported acidic OER electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized, classified, and discussed. The related fundamental studies on OER mechanisms and the relationship between activity and stability are particularly highlighted in order to provide an atomistic-level understanding for OER catalysis. A stability test protocol is suggested to evaluate the intrinsic activity degradation. Some current challenges and unresolved questions, such as the usage of carbon-based materials and the differences between the electrocatalyst performances in acidic electrolytes and PEM-based electrolyzers are also discussed. Finally, suggestions for the most promising electrocatalysts and a perspective for future research are outlined.
