Abstract
Cancer&#8208;targeting ligands used for nanomedicines have been limited to mostly antibodies, peptides, aptamers, and small molecules thus far. Here we report a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles as a platform enabling screening and identification of cancer&#8208;targeting nanomedicines. Specifically, a library of 31 artificial glycopolymers composed of either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (&#946;&#8208;Glc, &#946;&#8208;Gal, &#945;&#8208;Man, &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc, and &#946;&#8208;GalNAc) was converted to a library of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs). We systematically screened and identified GlyNPs optimal for targeting CT26, DU145, A549, and PC3 tumors. The cypate&#8208;conjugated GlyNP displaying &#945;&#8208;Man and &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc showed selective targeting and potent photothermal therapeutic efficacy against A549 human lung tumors. The docetaxel&#8208;contained GlyNP displaying &#946;&#8208;Glc, &#946;&#8208;Gal, and &#945;&#8208;Man demonstrated targeted chemotherapy against DU145 human prostate tumors. The results presented herein collectively demonstrated that the GlyNP library is a versatile platform enabling the identification of cancer&#8208;targeting glyconanoparticles and suggested its potential applicability for targeting various diseased cells beyond cancer.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Auto&#8208;Detachable Patterning of Flexible Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible electrodes that are multilayer, multi&#8208;material and conformal are pivotal for multifunctional wearable electronics. Traditional electronic circuits manufacturing requires substrate&#8208;supported transfer printing, which limits their multilayer integrity and device conformability on arbitrary surfaces. Herein, we report a SHrinkage&#8208;Assisted Patterning by Evaporation (SHAPE) method, by employing evaporation&#8208;induced interfacial strain mismatch, to fabricate auto&#8208;detachable, freestanding, and patternable electrodes. The SHAPE method utilizes vacuum&#8208;filtration of polyaniline/bacterial cellulose (PANI/BC) ink through a masked filtration membrane to print high&#8208;resolution, patterned, and multilayer electrodes. The strong inter&#8208;layer hydrogen bonding ensures robust multilayer integrity, while the controllable evaporative shrinking property of PANI/BC induces mismatch between the strains of the electrode and filtration membrane at the interface and thus autodetachment of electrodes. Notably, a 500&#8208;layer substrateless microsupercapacitor fabricated using the SHAPE method exhibits an energy density of 350 mWh cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 40&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 100 times higher than reported substrate&#8208;confined counterparts. Moreover, a digital circuit fabricated using the SHAPE method functioned stably on a deformed glove, highlighting the broad wearable applications of the SHAPE method.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled 3D Penetrating Nanonetwork for High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork tactic is developed based on high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to achieve increased stretchability and charge transportability simultaneously for blended emissive films. The obtained intrinsically stretchable polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit low turn&#8208;on voltage (6.5 V) and high luminescence (over 3780 cd m&#8211;2), simultaneously.








Abstract
The emergence of wearable technology can significantly benefit from electronic displays fabricated using intrinsically stretchable (is&#8208;) materials. Typically, an improvement in the stretchability of conventional light&#8208;emitting polymers is accompanied by a decrease in charge transportability, thus resulting in a significant decrease in device efficiency. In this study, a self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork is developed to achieve increased stretchability and mobility simultaneously, based on high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). The mobility of L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN increases by 5&#8211;6 times and the stretchability increases from 20% (pristine L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV film) to 100%. A high current efficiency (CE) of 8.13&#160;cd A&#8722;1 is observed in polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) fabricated using 40% stretched L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN. Furthermore, using a polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE), an 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline monohydrate (pBphen), and a reduced Triton X&#8208;100 (TR) chelated Zn&#8208;based is&#8208; electron&#8208;injection layer of Zn&#8208;PEIE&#8208;pBphen&#8208;TR, an is&#8208;PLED is realized with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 6.5&#160;V and a high CE of 2.35&#160;cd A&#8722;1. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using the self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork for the fabrication of is&#8208;PLEDs.

         <title>Submolecular Ligand Size and Spacing for Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Submolecular tuning of ligand size and spacing is demonstrated via template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles. It is revealed that submolecular ligand spacing stimulates integrin binding to facilitate the adhesion&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of macrophages. Increasing ligand spacing only significantly inhibits macrophage adhesion, whereas increasing both ligand size and spacing slightly hinders macrophage adhesion.








Abstract
Cell adhesion occurs when integrin recognizes and binds to Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD) ligands present in fibronectin. In this work, submolecular ligand size and spacing are tuned via template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles for dynamic macrophage modulation. To tune liganded gold nanoparticle (GNP) size and spacing from 3 to 20&#160;nm, in situ localized assemblies of GNP arrays on nanomagnetite templates are engineered. 3&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands stimulate the binding of integrin, which mediates macrophage&#8208;adhesion&#8208;assisted pro&#8208;regenerative polarization as compared to 20&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands, which can be dynamically anchored to the substrate for stabilizing integrin binding and facilitating dynamic macrophage adhesion. Increasing the ligand size from 7 to 20&#160;nm only slightly promotes macrophage adhesion, not observed with 13&#160;nm&#8208;sized ligands. Increasing the ligand spacing from 3 to 17&#160;nm significantly hinders macrophage adhesion that induces inflammatory polarization. Submolecular tuning of ligand spacing can dominantly modulate host macrophages.

A nanococktail therapeutic strategy is proposed to treat epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR&#8208;TKI)&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by employing stimuli&#8208;responsive block&#8208;dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles for targeted co&#8208;delivery of gefitinib and Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP)&#8208;siRNA. The nanosystem can block the EGFR signaling pathway with gefitinib, inhibit the EGFR bypass signaling pathway via YAP&#8208;siRNA, and induce tumor cell apoptosis by photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) has been identified as a key driver for epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR&#8208;TKI) resistance. Inhibition of YAP expression could be a potential therapeutic option for treating non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Herein, a nanococktail therapeutic strategy is proposed by employing amphiphilic and block&#8208;dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles (NPs) for targeted co&#8208;delivery of EGFR&#8208;TKI gefitinib (Gef) and YAP&#8208;siRNA to achieve a targeted drug/gene/photodynamic therapy. The resulting NPs are effectively internalized into Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC cells, successfully escape from late endosomes/lysosomes, and responsively release Gef and YAP&#8208;siRNA in an intracellular reductive environment. They preferentially accumulate at the tumor site after intravenous injection in both cell&#8208;line&#8208;derived xenograft (CDX) and patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) models of Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC, resulting in potent antitumor efficacy without distinct toxicity after laser irradiation. Mechanism studies reveal that the cocktail therapy could block the EGFR signaling pathway with Gef, inhibit activation of the EGFR bypass signaling pathway via YAP&#8208;siRNA, and induce tumor cell apoptosis through photodynamic therapy (PDT). Furthermore, this combination nanomedicine can sensitize PDT and impair glycolysis by downregulating HIF&#8208;1&#945;. These results suggest that this stimuli&#8208;responsive dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanococktail therapy may provide a promising approach for the treatment of EGFR&#8208;TKI resistant NSCLC.

         <title>Local Coordination Regulation through Tuning Atomic&#8208;Scale Cavities of Pd Metallene toward Efficient Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;scale cavities of ultrathin (111)&#8208;exposed Pd metallene, which can increase coordination number and result in moderate downshifting of the d&#8208;band center, are proposed as a new active site for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Moderate adsorption of oxygenated intermediates takes a significant role in rational design of high&#8208;efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Long&#8208;serving as a reliable strategy to tune geometric structure of nanomaterials, defect engineering enjoys the great ability of adjusting the coordination environment of catalytic active sites, which enables dominant regulation of adsorption energy and kinetics of ORR catalysis. However, limited to controllable nanocrystals fabrication, inducing uniformly dispersed high&#8208;coordinated defects into ultrathin 2D nanosheets remains challenging. Herein, atomic&#8208;scale cavities (ASCs) are proposed as a new kind of high&#8208;coordinated active site and successfully introduced into suprathin Pd (111)&#8208;exposed metallene. Due to its atomic concave architecture, leading to elevated CN and moderately downshifted d&#8208;band center, the as&#8208;made Pd metallene with ASCs (c&#8208;Pd M) exhibits excellent ORR performance with mass activity of 2.76 A mgPd&#8722;1 at 0.9&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and half&#8208;wave potential as high as 0.947&#160;V, which is 18.9 (2.7) times higher and 104 (46) mV larger than that of commercial Pt/C (Pd metallene without ASCs). Besides, the durability of c&#8208;Pd M exceeds its commercial counterpart with &#8776;30% loss after 5000 cycles. This work highlights a new&#8208;style mentality of designing fancy active sites toward efficient ORR electrocatalysis.

         <title>CsPbCl3&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Widened Bandgap and Inhibited Phase Segregation in a Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite and its Application to NiOx&#8208;Based Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The bandgap of Cs0.22FA0.78Pb (I0.85Br0.15)3 is widened from 1.64 to 1.67 eV by adding 3 mol% CsPbCl3&#8208;clusters. Adding extra 2 mol% CsCl can enrich Cl at the NiOx/perovskite interface, thereby preventing the redox reaction at the interface and improving the photostability of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite. This enables efficient p&#8211;i&#8211;n&#8208;type NiOx&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with PCE up to 27.26%.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is an attractive hole&#8208;transport material for efficient and stable p&#8211;i&#8211;n metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, an undesirable redox reaction occurs at the NiOx/perovskite interface, which results in a low open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), instability, and phase separation of the NiOx&#8208;based wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite (Br &gt; 20%). In order to simultaneously address the abovementioned phase separation problem and redox chemistry at the perovskite/NiOx interface, the bandgap is widened from 1.64 to 1.67 eV by adding inorganic CsPbCl3&#8208;clusters (3 mol%) to the Cs22Br15 perovskite precursor solution. Moreover, adding extra 2 mol% CsCl enriches the NiOx/perovskite interface with Cl, thereby preventing the redox reaction at the interface, while controlling the Br content to within 15% improves the photostability of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a single&#8208;junction p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSC increases from 17.82% to 19.76%, which leads to the fabrication of highly efficient monolithic p&#8211;i&#8211;n&#8208;type NiOx&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with PCEs of up to 27.26% (certified PCE: 27.15%). The perovskite to an n&#8211;i&#8211;p&#8208;type perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is also applied to deliver a VOC of 1.93 V and a final efficiency of 25.5%. These findings provide critical insight into the fabrication of highly efficient and stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites.

         <title>Ge Bidirectional Diffusion to Simultaneously Engineer Back Interface and Bulk Defects in the Absorber for Efficient CZTSSe Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge bidirectional diffusion, simultaneously toward the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorber and MoSe2 at the back interface, is realized by an easy&#8208;handling method. The crystal growth of the absorbers is regulated and the work function of MoSe2 is enhanced as well. Up to 13.14% efficiency is achieved for Ge&#8208;involved CZTSSe solar cells, which present a certified efficiency of 12.8%.








Abstract
Aiming at a large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells, a new and effective strategy to simultaneously regulate the back interface and restrain bulk defects of CZTSSe absorbers is developed by directly introducing a thin GeO2 layer on Mo substrates. Power conversion efficiency (power&#8208;to&#8208;efficiency) as high as 13.14% with a VOC of 547&#160;mV is achieved for the champion device, which presents a certified efficiency of 12.8% (aperture area: 0.25667 cm2). Further investigation reveals that Ge bidirectional diffusion simultaneously occurs toward the CZTSSe absorber and MoSe2 layer at the back interface while being selenized. That is, some Ge element from the GeO2 diffuses into the CZTSSe absorber layer to afford Ge&#8208;doped absorbers, which can significantly reduce the defect density and band tailing, and facilitate quasi&#8208;Fermi level split by relatively higher hole concentration. Meanwhile, a small amount of Ge element also participates in the formation of MoSe2 at the back interface, thus enhancing the work function of MoSe2 and effectively separating photoinduced carriers. This work highlights the synergistic effect of Ge element toward the bulk absorber and the back interface and also provides an easy&#8208;handling way to achieve high&#8208;performance CZTSSe solar cells.

Meanwhile, a small amount of Ge element also participates in the formation of MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the back interface, thus enhancing the work function of MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and effectively separating photoinduced carriers. This work highlights the synergistic effect of Ge element toward the bulk absorber and the back interface and also provides an easy-handling way to achieve high-performance CZTSSe solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biaxially Strained MoS2 Nanoshells with Controllable Layers Boost Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of biaxial strain and layer numbers of MoS2 nanoshells on the electrocatalytic activity is investigated in detail. Calculations reveal the superiority of biaxial strain over uniaxial strain and identify the ideal Mo coordination and S vacancies for maximal catalytic activity.








Abstract
Strain in layered transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a type of effective approach to enhance the catalytic performance by activating their inert basal plane. However, compared with traditional uniaxial strain, the influence of biaxial strain and the TMD layer number on the local electronic configuration remains unexplored. Herein, via a new in situ self&#8208;vulcanization strategy, biaxially strained MoS2 nanoshells in the form of a single&#8208;crystalline Ni3S2@MoS2 core&#8211;shell heterostructure are realized, where the MoS2 layer is precisely controlled between the 1 and 5 layers. In particular, an electrode with the bilayer MoS2 nanoshells shows a remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction activity with a small overpotential of 78.1&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2, and negligible activity degradation after durability testing. Density functional theory calculations reveal the contribution of the optimized biaxial strain together with the induced sulfur vacancies and identify the origin of superior catalytic sites in these biaxially strained MoS2 nanoshells. This work highlights the importance of the atomic&#8208;scale layer number and multiaxial strain in unlocking the potential of 2D TMD electrocatalysts.

         <title>Engineering DNA&#8208;Guided Hydroxyapatite Bulk Materials with High Stiffness and Outstanding Antimicrobial Ability for Dental Inlay Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastiff DNA&#8211;hydroxyapatite bulk composites are fabricated by in situ mineralization in a long&#8208;range ordered DNA scaffold. The as&#8208;prepared composites exhibit an ultrahigh Young's modulus and a long&#8208;lasting and local antibacterial behavior. A new type of artificial dental inlay with outstanding antibacterial ability is thus developed for dental restoration applications.








Abstract
Programmable base pair interactions at the nanoscale make DNA an attractive scaffold for forming hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanostructures. However, engineering macroscale HAP mineralization guided by DNA molecules remains challenging. To overcome this issue, a facile strategy is developed for the fabrication of ultrastiff DNA&#8211;HAP bulk composites. The electrostatic complexation of DNA and a surfactant with a quaternary ammonium salt group enables the formation of long&#8208;range ordered scaffolds using electrospinning. The growth of 1D and 2D HAP minerals is thus realized by this DNA template at a macroscale. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared DNA&#8211;HAP composites exhibit an ultrahigh Young's modulus of &#8776;25&#160;GPa, which is comparable to natural HAP and superior to most artificial mineralized composites. Furthermore, a&#160;new type of dental inlay with outstanding antibacterial properties is developed using the stiff DNA&#8211;HAP. The encapsulated quaternary ammonium group within the dense HAP endows the composite with long&#8208;lasting and local antibacterial activity. Therefore, this new type of super&#8208;stiff biomaterial holds great potential for oral prosthetic applications.

         <title>More Powerful Twistron Carbon Nanotube Yarn Mechanical Energy Harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More powerful twistron carbon nanotube yarn mechanical energy harvesters are achieved by mechanically and thermally modifying the fundamental structure of twistrons and by incorporating graphene sheets within twistrons. The energy conversion efficiency of the twistrons can be increased over 7&#8208;fold and the peak power output can reach values that are 12&#8208;fold those reported for previous materials&#8208;based technologies for key frequency ranges.








Abstract
Stretching a coiled carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn can provide large, reversible electrochemical capacitance changes, which convert mechanical energy to electricity. Here, it is shown that the performance of these &#8220;twistron&#8221; harvesters can be increased by optimizing the alignment of precursor CNT forests, plastically stretching the precursor twisted yarn, applying much higher tensile loads during precoiling twist than for coiling, using electrothermal pulse annealing under tension, and incorporating reduced graphene oxide nanoplates. The peak output power for a 1 and a 30&#160;Hz sinusoidal deformation are 0.73 and 3.19&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, which are 24&#8208; and 13&#8208;fold that of previous twistron harvesters at these respective frequencies. This performance at 30&#160;Hz is over 12&#8208;fold that of other prior&#8208;art mechanical energy harvesters for frequencies between 0.1 and 600&#160;Hz. The maximum energy conversion efficiency is 7.2&#8208;fold that for previous twistrons. Twistron anode and cathode yarn arrays are stretched 180&#176; out&#8208;of&#8208;phase by locating them in the negative and positive compressibility directions of hinged wine&#8208;rack frames, thereby doubling the output voltage and reducing the input mechanical energy.

         <title>Nanochitin and Nanochitosan: Chitin Nanostructure Engineering with Multiscale Properties for Biomedical and Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanochitin and nanochitosan (with random copolymer&#8208;based multiscale architectures of glucosamine and N&#8208;acetylglucosamine units) have recently attracted immense attention for the development of green, sustainable, and advanced functional materials. Nanochitin and nanochitosan are multiscale materials from small oligomers, rod&#8208;shaped nanocrystals, longer nanofibers, to hierarchical assemblies of nanofibers. Various physical properties of chitin and chitosan depend on their molecular&#8208; and nano&#8208;structures; translational research has utilized them for a wide range of applications (biomedical, industrial, environmental, and so on). Instead of reviewing the entire extensive literature on chitin and chitosan, this paper highlights recent developments in multiscale&#8208;dependent material properties and their applications; immune, medical, reinforcing, adhesive, green electrochemical materials, biological scaffolds, and sustainable food packaging have been discussed considering the size, shape, and assembly of chitin nanostructures. In summary, new perspectives for the development of sustainable advanced functional materials based on nanochitin and nanochitosan by understanding and engineering their multiscale properties are described.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Spectroscopy: An Abundance of Materials and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy provides unique information on the composition and dynamics of biochemical systems by resolving the characteristic absorption fingerprints of their constituent molecules. Based on this inherent chemical specificity and the capability for label&#8208;free, non&#8208;invasive, and real&#8208;time detection, IR spectroscopy approaches have unlocked a plethora of breakthrough application perspectives for fields ranging from environmental monitoring and defense to chemical analysis and medical diagnostics. Nanophotonics has played a crucial role for pushing the sensitivity limits of traditional far&#8208;field spectroscopy by using resonant nanostructures to focus the incident light into nanoscale hot&#8208;spots of the electromagnetic field, greatly enhancing light&#8208;matter interaction. Metasurfaces composed of regular arrangements of such resonators further increase the design space for tailoring this nanoscale light control both spectrally and spatially, which has established them as an invaluable toolkit for surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy. Starting from the fundamental concepts of metasurface&#8208;enhanced IR spectroscopy, we showcase a broad palette of resonator geometries, materials and arrangements for realizing highly sensitive metadevices, with a special focus on emerging systems such as phononic and 2D van der Waals materials, and integration with waveguides for lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices. Furthermore, we will highlight some advanced sensor functionalities of metasurface&#8208;based IR spectroscopy, including multiresonance, tunability, dielectrophoresis, live cell sensing, and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;aided analysis.

Starting from the fundamental concepts of metasurface-enhanced IR spectroscopy, we showcase a broad palette of resonator geometries, materials and arrangements for realizing highly sensitive metadevices, with a special focus on emerging systems such as phononic and 2D van der Waals materials, and integration with waveguides for lab-on-a-chip devices. Furthermore, we will highlight some advanced sensor functionalities of metasurface-based IR spectroscopy, including multiresonance, tunability, dielectrophoresis, live cell sensing, and machine-learning-aided analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Carrier Transport Mechanism in Organic Antiambipolar Transistors Unveiled by Operando Photoemission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic antiambipolar transistors (AATs) have partially overlapped p&#8211;n junctions. At room temperature, this p&#8211;n junction induces a negative differential transconductance in an AAT. However, the detailed carrier transport mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we use operando photoemission electron microscopy to tackle this issue owing to the technique's ability to visualize conductive electrons in real time during the transistor operation. Notably, we observed that when the AAT is on, a depletion layer forms at the lateral p&#8211;n junction. The visualized depletion layer showed that both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type channels have pinch&#8208;off states in the gate voltage range when the AAT is in on state. The steep potential gradient at the lateral p&#8211;n interface enhances the electron conduction from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type semiconductor. Another significant finding is that most electrons are considered to recombine with the accumulated holes in the p&#8208;type semiconductor, affording the reduction of photoemission intensity by approximately 80%. Our technique provides a thorough understanding of carrier transport in AATs, further improving the device performance.

         <title>Raman scattering measurement of suspended graphene under extreme strain induced by nanoindentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Graphene is known as a super&#8208;stiff and extremely strong material. Hence, applying strains greater than 1% to graphene and simultaneously measuring changes in its physical properties has been challenging because of the limited methodologies for measuring both high strain and other physical properties. Here, we report the Raman scattering measurement of suspended graphene under extremely high biaxial strain as large as 6.1% using an atomic force microscopy (AFM)&#8211;Raman spectroscopy measurement tool. Nanoindentation was performed using AFM tips machined to have a flat top and a hole shape, resulting in a strained graphene area sufficiently large to enable the acquisition of a Raman signal. At the same time, the laser light was focused on the strained flat area of the graphene membrane. The Raman signal of the G and 2D bands of graphene was redshifted by 282 and 684 cm&#8722;1, respectively, which is unprecedented for graphene. Our measurement technique provides an effective methodology to measure variations in the physical properties of atomically thin materials under super&#8208;high strain.

         <title>Semi&#8208;immobilized Ionic Liquid Regulator with Fast Kinetics towards Highly Stable Zinc Anode under &#8208;35&#176;C to 60&#176;C</title>

Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries have been extensively investigated as next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries due to their advantages including high theoretical capacity, reliable safety, environment friendly, and low cost. However, the critical issues of irregular dendrite growth and intricate side reactions severely restrict the further industrialization of zinc ion batteries. Here, a strategy to fabricate a semi&#8208;immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is proposed to protect the Zn anode in a wide temperature range from &#8208;35&#176;C to 60&#176;C. The immobilized SiO2@cation can form high conjugate racks that can regulate the Zn2+ concentration gradient and self&#8208;polarizing electric field to guarantee uniform nucleation and planar deposition, the free anions of ILs can weaken hydrogen bonds of water to promote rapid Zn2+ desolvation and accelerate ion transport kinetics simultaneously. Because of these unique advantages, the cycling performance of the symmetric Zn batteries has been greatly enhanced, evidenced by a cycling life of 1800 h at 20&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, and a cycle lifespan of 2000 h under a wide temperature window from &#8208;35&#176;C&#8764;60&#176;C. The efficiency of this semi&#8208;immobilizing strategy has been well demonstrated in various full cells including pouch cells, showing high performance at large current (20 A g&#8211;1) and wide temperatures with extra&#8208;long cycles up to 80000 cycles. This work provides a new platform for constructing stable Zn anode and high&#8208;performance zinc ion batteries.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Integration of a Zinc Metasilicate Interface Layer Guiding Well&#8208;Regulated Zn Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

A low&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry strategy with industrial operability is developed to realize large&#8208;scale integration of Zn&#8211;Si&#8211;O nanosheet arrays on Zn foil. Zn&#8208;island&#8208;based identical&#8208;location electron microscopy characterization is designed to visualize and uncover the in situ integration mechanism of Zn&#8211;Si&#8211;O layer. The life spans of symmetric cells, and full cells coupled with high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading cathode, have increased by 3&#8211;7 times.








Abstract
Uneven distribution of electric fields at the electrolyte&#8211;anode interface and associated Zn dendrite growth is one of the most critical barriers that limit the life span of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, new&#8208;type Zn&#8211;A&#8211;O (A = Si, Ti) interface layers with thin and uniform thickness, porosity, and hydrophilicity properties are developed to realize homogeneous and smooth Zn plating. For ZnSiO3 nanosheet arrays on Zn foil (Zn@ZSO), their formation follows an &#8220;etching&#8211;nucleation&#8211;growth&#8221; mechanism that is confirmed by a well&#8208;designed Zn&#8208;island&#8208;based identical&#8208;location microscopy method, the geometric area of which is up to 1000 cm2 in one&#8208;pot synthesis based on a low&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemical method. Guided by the structural advantages of the ZSO layer, the Zn2+ flux gets equalized. Besides ultralow polarization, the life spans of symmetric cells and full cells coupled with a high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading K0.27MnO2&#183;0.54H2O (8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cathode, are increased by 3&#8211;7 times with the Zn@ZSO anode. Moreover, the large&#8208;scale preparation of Zn@ZSO foil contributes to a 0.5 Ah multilayer pouch cell with high performance, further confirming its prospects for practical application.

         <title>Targeting the Microenvironment of Vulnerable Atherosclerotic Plaques: An Emerging Diagnosis and Therapy Strategy for Atherosclerosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the characteristics of the microenvironment of vulnerable plaques, nanomedicine targeting strategies for assessing plaque vulnerability by imaging are systematically summarized, developments in construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoplatforms and surface&#8208;functionalized nanoagents to boost the efficacy of plaque stabilization therapy are highlighted, and existing challenges and prospects in the fields of diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerosis based on nanomaterials are discussed.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis is considered one of the primary causes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Unpredictable rupture of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques triggers adverse cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial syndrome and even sudden cardiac death. Therefore, assessing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques and early intervention are of significance in reducing CVD mortality. Nanomedicine possesses tremendous advantages in achieving the integration of the diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerotic plaques because of its magnetic, optical, thermal, and catalytic properties. Based on the pathological characteristics of vulnerable plaques, stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoplatforms and surface&#8208;functionalized nanoagents are designed and have drawn great attention for accomplishing the precise imaging and treatment of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques due to their superior properties, such as high bioavailability, lesion&#8208;targeting specificity, on&#8208;demand cargo release, and low off&#8208;target damage. Here, the characteristics of vulnerable plaques are generalized, and some targeted strategies for boosting the accuracy of plaque vulnerability evaluation by imaging and the efficacy of plaque stabilization therapy (including antioxidant therapy, macrophage depletion therapy, regulation of lipid metabolism therapy, anti&#8208;inflammation therapy, etc.) are systematically summarized. In addition, existing challenges and prospects in this field are discussed, and it is believed to provide new thinking for the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs in the near future.

Nanomedicine possesses tremendous advantages in achieving the integration of the diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerotic plaques because of its magnetic, optical, thermal, and catalytic properties. Based on the pathological characteristics of vulnerable plaques, stimuli-responsive nanoplatforms and surface-functionalized nanoagents are designed and have drawn great attention for accomplishing the precise imaging and treatment of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques due to their superior properties, such as high bioavailability, lesion-targeting specificity, on-demand cargo release, and low off-target damage. Here, the characteristics of vulnerable plaques are generalized, and some targeted strategies for boosting the accuracy of plaque vulnerability evaluation by imaging and the efficacy of plaque stabilization therapy (including antioxidant therapy, macrophage depletion therapy, regulation of lipid metabolism therapy, anti-inflammation therapy, etc.) are systematically summarized. In addition, existing challenges and prospects in this field are discussed, and it is believed to provide new thinking for the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Charge transport is a key process that dominates battery performance, and the microstructure of battery key components plays a central role in guiding the charge transport. By gradient design, optimal local charge&#8208;transport dynamics can be realized and high energy/power supported. Recent processes in the gradient design strategies of cathodes, lithium&#8208;metal anodes, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes are presented with future research directions highlighted.








Abstract
Charge transport is a key process that dominates battery performance, and the microstructures of the cathode, anode, and electrolyte play a central role in guiding ion and/or electron transport inside the battery. Rational design of key battery components with varying microstructure along the charge&#8208;transport direction to realize optimal local charge&#8208;transport dynamics can compensate for reaction polarization, which accelerates electrochemical reaction kinetics. Here, the principles of charge&#8208;transport mechanisms and their decisive role in battery performance are presented, followed by a discussion of the correlation between charge&#8208;transport regulation and battery microstructure design. The design strategies of the gradient cathodes, lithium&#8208;metal anodes, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes are summarized. Future directions and perspectives of gradient design are provided at the end to enable practically accessible high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>A New Polystyrene&#8211;Poly(vinylpyridinium) Ionic Copolymer Dopant for n&#8208;Type All&#8208;Polymer Thermoelectrics with High and Stable Conductivity Relative to the Seebeck Coefficient giving High Power Factor</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel polystyrene&#8211;poly(vinylpyridinium)&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer dopant is designed and synthesized. It can dope n&#8208;type conjugated polymers to make n&#8208;type all&#8208;polymer conducting materials and thermoelectrics, analogous to poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonate). An electron conductivity of 4.2 S cm&#8211;1, mobility of 0.86 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and power factor of 67 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are achieved.








Abstract
A novel n&#8208;type copolymer dopant polystyrene&#8211;poly(4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;hexylpyridinium fluoride) (PSpF) with fluoride anions is designed and synthesized by reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. This is thought to be the first polymeric fluoride dopant. Electrical conductivity of 4.2 S cm&#8211;1 and high power factor of 67 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are achieved for PSpF&#8208;doped polymer films, with a corresponding decrease in thermal conductivity as the PSpF concentration is increased, giving the highest ZT of 0.1. An especially high electrical conductivity of 58 S cm&#8211;1 at 88&#160;&#176;C and outstanding thermal stability are recorded. Further, organic transistors of PSpF&#8208;doped thin films exhibit high electron mobility and Hall mobility of 0.86 and 1.70 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, respectively. The results suggest that polystyrene&#8211;poly(vinylpyridinium) salt copolymers with fluoride anions are promising for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type all&#8208;polymer thermoelectrics. This work provides a new way to realize organic thermoelectrics with high conductivity relative to the Seebeck coefficient, high power factor, thermal stability, and broad processing window.

         <title>Polystyrene Pocket Lithography: Sculpting Plastic with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct deep ultraviolet (DUV) photolithography method, which enables fabrication of microstructures in bulk polystyrene cell culture substrates, is presented. Pipelines for generating ink&#8208;based DUV masks and micropattern virtualization further increase the remarkable straightforwardness of the process. This, combined with the high applicability, can significantly improve accessibility of this class of microfabrication techniques to a broad biological research community.








Abstract
Tissue&#8208;culture&#8208;ware polystyrene is the gold standard for in vitro cell culture. While microengineering techniques can create advanced cell microenvironments in polystyrene, they require specialized equipment and reagents, which hinder their accessibility for most biological researchers. An economical and easily accessible method is developed and validated for fabricating microstructures directly in polystyrene with sizes approaching subcellular dimensions while requiring minimal processing time. The process involves deep ultraviolet irradiation through a shadow mask or ink pattern using inexpensive, handheld devices followed by selective chemical development with common reagents to generate micropatterns with depths/heights between 5 and 10&#160;&#181;m, which can be used to guide cell behavior. The remarkable straightforwardness of the process enables this class of microengineering techniques to be broadly accessible to diverse research communities.

         <title>Active Ultrahigh&#8208;Q (0.2 &#215; 106) THz Topological Cavities on a Chip</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;loss terahertz (THz) silicon topological interconnect&#8211;cavity system that can actively route signals through sharp bends by critically coupling to a topological cavity with an ultrahigh&#8208;quality (Q) factor of 0.2 &#215; 106 is shown. On&#8208;chip active tailoring is demonstrated of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation at extremely low power through complete suppression of the back reflection, essential for sixth generation (6G) communication with THz topological integrated photonic circuits.








Abstract
Rapid scaling of semiconductor devices has led to an increase in the number of processor cores and integrated functionalities onto a single chip to support the growing demands of high&#8208;speed and large&#8208;volume consumer electronics. To meet this burgeoning demand, an improved interconnect capacity in terms of bandwidth density and active tunability is required for enhanced throughput and energy efficiency. Low&#8208;loss terahertz silicon interconnects with larger bandwidth offer a solution for the existing inter&#8208;/intrachip bandwidth density and energy&#8208;efficiency bottleneck. Here, a low&#8208;loss terahertz topological interconnect&#8211;cavity system is presented that can actively route signals through sharp bends, by critically coupling to a topological cavity with an ultrahigh&#8208;quality (Q) factor of 0.2 &#215; 106. The topologically protected large Q factor cavity enables energy&#8208;efficient optical control showing 60&#160;dB modulation. Dynamic control is further demonstrated of the critical coupling between the topological interconnect&#8211;cavity for on&#8208;chip active tailoring of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation through complete suppression of the back reflection. The silicon topological cavity is complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible and highly desirable for hybrid electronic&#8211;photonic technologies for sixth (6G) generation terahertz communication devices. Ultrahigh&#8208;Q cavity also paves the path for designing ultrasensitive topological sensors, terahertz topological integrated circuits, and nonlinear topological photonic devices.

A vinylene&#8208;linker&#8208;based polymer acceptor (PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;) with rigid and coplanar chain conformations is synthesized, exhibiting redshifted absorption and ordered packing. When employed in all&#8208;polymer solar cells, the PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based devices yield a higher efficiency of 17.1% than PY&#8208;T&#8208;&#947;&#8208; and PY&#8208;2T&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based ones and exhibit robust mechanical stability in flexible devices, suggesting the potential for commercial application.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;art Y&#8208;series polymer acceptors are typically based on a mono&#8208;thiophene linker, which can cause some twisted molecular conformations and thus limit the performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Here, a high&#8208;performance polymer acceptor based on vinylene linkers is reported, which leads to surprising changes in the polymers&#8217; molecular conformations, optoelectronic properties, and enhanced photovoltaic performance. It is found that the polymer acceptors based on thiophene or bithiophene linkers (PY&#8208;T&#8208;&#947; and PY&#8208;2T&#8208;&#947;) display significant molecular twisting between end&#8208;groups and linker units, while the vinylene&#8208;based polymer (PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;) exhibits a more coplanar and rigid molecular conformation. As a result, PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947; demonstrates a better conjugation and tighter interchain stacking, which results in higher mobility and a reduced energetic disorder. Furthermore, detailed morphology investigations reveal that the PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based blend exhibits high domain purity and thus a better fill factor in its all&#8208;PSCs. With these, a higher efficiency of 17.1% is achieved in PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for binary all&#8208;PSCs to date. This work demonstrates that the vinylene&#8208;linker is a superior unit to build polymer acceptors with more coplanar and rigid chain conformation, which is beneficial for polymer aggregation and efficient all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Magnetic Anisotropy Control with Curie Temperature above 400 K in a van der Waals Ferromagnet for Spintronic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic phase control is the source of fascinating correlated phenomena and the frontier research direction in materials science and spintronic devices. Magnetic anisotropy control and a dramatically enhanced Tc up to 400 K are realized in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 during a high&#8208;pressure loading&#8211;deloading process, shedding light on exploring the exchange interaction mechanism and realizing practical spintronic applications.








Abstract
The technological appeal of van der Waals ferromagnetic materials is the ability to control magnetism under external fields with desired thickness toward novel spintronic applications. For practically useful devices, ferromagnetism above room temperature or tunable magnetic anisotropy is highly demanded but remains challenging. To date, only a few layered materials exhibit unambiguous ferromagnetic ordering at room temperature via gating techniques or interface engineering. Here, it is demonstrated that the magnetic anisotropy control and dramatic modulation of Curie temperature (Tc) up to 400 K are realized in layered Fe5GeTe2 via the high&#8208;pressure diamond&#8208;anvil&#8208;cell technique. Magnetic phases manifesting with in&#8208;plane anisotropic, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropic and nearly isotropic magnetic states can be tuned in a controllable way, depicted by the phase diagram with a maximum Tc up to 360 K. Remarkably, the Tc can be gradually enhanced to above 400 K owing to the Fermi surface evolution during a pressure loading&#8211;deloading process. Such an observation sheds light on the understanding and control of emergent magnetic states in practical spintronic applications.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Mid&#8208;Infrared Biosensing in Aqueous Solutions with Graphene Plasmons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ identification of biomolecules in aqueous solutions by IR spectroscopy is important for exploring biological processes. However, the strong and broad IR absorption of water overwhelms the vibrations of the biomolecules. In this work, a tunable graphene plasmonic aqueous IR biosensor is exploited to directly probe a protein's vibrations and characterize the deuterium effects, which provides a platform for studying nanoscale biological processes.








Abstract
Identifying nanoscale biomolecules in aqueous solutions by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provides an in situ and noninvasive method for exploring the structure, reactions, and transport of biologically active molecules. However, this remains a challenge due to the strong and broad IR absorption of water which overwhelms the respective vibrational fingerprints of the biomolecules. In this work, a tunable IR transparent microfluidic system with graphene plasmons is exploited to identify &#8776;2&#160;nm&#8208;thick proteins in physiological conditions. The acquired in situ tunability makes it possible to eliminate the IR absorption of water outside the graphene plasmonic hotspots by background subtraction. Most importantly, the ultrahigh confinement of graphene plasmons (confined to &#8776;15&#160;nm) permits the implementation of nanoscale sensitivity. Then, the deuterium effects on monolayer proteins are characterized within an aqueous solution. The tunable graphene&#8208;plasmon&#8208;enhanced FTIR technology provides a novel platform for studying biological processes in an aqueous solution at the nanoscale.

Abstract
Long processing time and high temperatures are often required in sintering ceramic electrolytes, which lead to volatile element loss and high cost. Here, we report an ultrafast sintering method of microwave&#8208;induced carbothermal shock to fabricate various ceramic electrolytes in seconds. Furthermore, it is also able to integrate electrode and electrolyte in one step by simultaneous co&#8208;sintering. Based on this ultrafast co&#8208;sintering technique, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery with a high areal capacity is successfully achieved, realizing a promising electrochemical performance at room temperature. This method can extend to other various ceramic multilayer based solid devices.

         <title>Stable Zinc Anodes Enabled by a Zincophilic Polyanionic Hydrogel Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique polyanionic hydrogel is employed as an artificial protective layer for reversible Zn&#8208;metal anodes. The polyanions in the hydrogel framework facilitate a homogeneous zinc&#8208;ion flux, and the Zn&#8211;O bonding strengthens the interface and suppresses surface corrosion and irregular Zn dendrites growth. This strategy could apply also to other aqueous metal batteries.








Abstract
The practical application of the Zn&#8208;metal anode for aqueous batteries is greatly restricted by catastrophic dendrite growth, intricate hydrogen evolution, and parasitic surface passivation. Herein, a polyanionic hydrogel film is introduced as a protective layer on the Zn anode with the assistance of a silane coupling agent (denoted as Zn&#8211;SHn). The hydrogel framework with zincophilic &#8211;SO3&#8722; functional groups uniformizes the zinc ions flux and transport. Furthermore, such a hydrogel layer chemically bonded on the Zn surface possesses an anti&#8208;catalysis effect, which effectively suppresses both the hydrogen evolution reaction and formation of Zn dendrites. As a result, stable and reversible Zn stripping/plating at various currents and capacities is achieved. A full cell by pairing the Zn&#8211;SHn anode with a NaV3O8&#183;1.5 H2O cathode shows a capacity of around 176 mAh g&#8722;1 with a retention around 67% over 4000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This polyanionic hydrogel film protection strategy paves a new way for future Zn&#8208;anode design and safe aqueous batteries construction.

         <title>Boosting Electrochemical Styrene Transformation via Tandem Water Oxidation over a Single&#8208;Atom Cr1/CoSe2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem oxidation strategy based on a Co&#8211;Cr cooperated single&#8208;atom Cr1/CoSe2 electrocatalyst is presented, turning the competition between the oxygen evolution reaction and styrene oxidation into mutual benefits via the migration of the *OOH intermediate from the Co to the Cr site, achieving an efficient and mild selective oxidation of styrene without any exogenous oxidizing reagent.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of organics using water as the oxygen source is a prospective but challenging method to produce high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals; especially, the competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits its efficiency. Herein, a tandem catalysis strategy based on a single&#8208;atom catalyst with Cr atoms atomically dispersed at a CoSe2 support (Cr1/CoSe2) is presented. Thereinto, Co and Cr sites are endowed with a specific function to activate water and styrene respectively, and the competition between the OER and styrene oxidation is turned into mutual benefits via cooperated active sites. Under a potential of 1.6&#160;VAg/AgCl, excellent selectivity of 95% to benzaldehyde and a high conversion rate of styrene at 88% without any exogenous oxidizing reagent are achieved. Isotopic tracing, isotope&#8208;labeled in situ Raman spectra, and detailed theoretical calculation further reveal the tandem mechanism, showing that the transfer of *OOH intermediates from the Co to the Cr sites serves as a bridge to link the oxidation of water and styrene. This work develops a new strategy for the co&#8208;oxidation of multi&#8208;species based on tandem catalysis, providing novel insights for the design of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Simultaneous Electrochemical Exfoliation and Covalent Functionalization of MoS2 Membrane for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through exfoliation of the electrochemically lithium&#8208;intercalated MoS2 in iodoacetamide water solution, the covalent functionalization of single&#8208;layer MoS2 with iodoacetamide molecules can be shortened to 15 min, and functionalized MoS2 membranes are fabricated via vacuum filtration. Under reverse osmosis mode, the functionalized MoS2 membranes exhibit rejection rates of &gt;90% and &gt;80% for various dyes and NaCl, respectively.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide membranes exhibit good antiswelling properties but poor water desalination property. Here, a one&#8208;step covalent functionalization of MoS2 nanosheets for membrane fabrication is reported, which is accomplished by simultaneous exfoliating and grafting the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;intercalated MoS2 in organic iodide water solution. The lithium intercalation amount in MoS2 is optimized so that the quality of the produced 2D nanosheets is improved with homogeneous size distribution. The lamellar MoS2 membranes are tested in reverse osmosis (RO), and the functionalized MoS2 membrane exhibits rejection rates of &gt;90% and &gt;80% for various dyes (Rhodamine B, Crystal Violet, Acid Fuchsin, Methyl Orange, and Evans Blue) and NaCl, respectively. The excellent ion&#8208;sieving performance and good water permeability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes are attributed to the suitable channel widths that are tuned by iodoacetamide. Furthermore, the stability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes in NaCl and dye solutions is also confirmed by RO tests. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that water molecules tend to form a single layer between the amide&#8208;functionalized MoS2 layers but a double layer between the ethanol&#8208;functionalized MoS2 (MoS2&#8208;ethanol) layers, which indicates that a less packed structure of water between the MoS2&#8208;ethanol layers leads to lower hydrodynamic resistance and higher permeation.

         <title>Engineered Exosomes with Independent Module/Cascading Function for Therapy of Parkinson's Disease by Multistep Targeting and Multistage Intervention Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of an &#8220;independent module/cascading function&#8221; to construct an engineered exosome nanotherapy platform is proposed. The artificial module with movement/chemotaxis ability is controllably combined with a natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode by using a &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method, which realizes the &#8220;cascading function&#8221; for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Current exosome engineering methods usually lead to the damage of exosome morphology and membrane, which cannot meet the complex needs of disease treatment. Herein, the concept of an &#8220;independent module/cascading function&#8221; is proposed to construct an engineered exosome nanotherapy platform including an independent artificial module and a natural module. The artificial module with movement/chemotaxis function is first synthesized, and then it is controllably combined with the natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode through a &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method. The whole process can not only maintain the activity of the natural exosome module, but also endows it with motion ability, so as to realize the purpose of &#8220;cascading function&#8221; in the process of disease treatment. The above engineered exosomes are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, the multistep targeting strategy of &#8220;disease microenvironment&#8208;damaged cells&#8208;diseased mitochondria&#8221; and the multistage intervention concept of &#8220;inhibiting deterioration and promoting repair&#8221; are proposed, so as to break through the bottleneck of the existing treatment of PD.

Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical cycles enable an entire environment to operate in a more complex, yet effective, way to perform natural photosynthesis. However, such artificial systems suffer from a lack of well&#8208;established photocatalysts with the ability to harvest the solar spectrum and rich catalytic active&#8208;site density. Benefiting from extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, this bottleneck may be overcome by devising a photocatalytic platform based on metal sulfides with predominant electronic, physical, and chemical properties. These tunable properties can endow them with abundant active sites, favorable light utilization, and expedited charge transportation for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. In this review, we describe how some vital lessons extracted from previous investigations are employed to promote the further development of metal sulfides for artificial photosynthesis, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, and pollutant removal. Their functions, properties, synthetic strategies, emerging issues, design principles, and intrinsic functional mechanisms for photocatalytic redox reactions are discussed in detail. Finally, we highlight the associated challenges and prospects for the utilization of metal sulfides and envision future development trends in photocatalysis.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Powered Janus Cell Robots Loaded with Oncolytic Adenovirus for Active and Targeted Virotherapy of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus oncolytic adenovirus&#8208;loaded 293T cell robots with full coating of targeted peptides and Janus modification of magnetic nanoparticles are capable of controllable magnetic propulsion and tumor&#8208;specific binding and killing. Such active medical platform with enhanced tissue retention and penetration shows the highest therapeutic efficacy in treating orthoptic mice bladder cancer models with minimized damage to normal tissues.








Abstract
A unique robotic medical platform is designed by utilizing cell robots as the active &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; of oncolytic adenovirus (OA), capable of tumor&#8208;selective binding and killing. The OA&#8208;loaded cell robots are fabricated by entirely modifying OA&#8208;infected 293T cells with cyclic arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartic acid tripeptide (cRGD) to specifically bind with bladder cancer cells, followed by asymmetric immobilization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) on the cell surface. OA can replicate in host cells and induce cytolysis to release the virus progeny to the surrounding tumor sites for sustainable infection and oncolysis. The asymmetric coating of magnetic NPs bestows the cell robots with effective movement in various media and wireless manipulation with directional migration in a microfluidic device and bladder mold under magnetic control, further enabling steerable movement and prolonged retention of cell robots in the mouse bladder. The biorecognition of cRGD and robust, controllable propulsion of cell robots work synergistically to greatly enhance their tissue penetration and anticancer efficacy in the 3D cancer spheroid and orthotopic mouse bladder tumor model. Overall, this study integrates cell&#8208;based microrobots with virotherapy to generate an attractive robotic system with tumor specificity, expanding the operation scope of cell robots in biomedical community.

The OA-loaded cell robots are fabricated by entirely modifying OA-infected 293T cells with cyclic arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartic acid tripeptide (cRGD) to specifically bind with bladder cancer cells, followed by asymmetric immobilization of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (NPs) on the cell surface. OA can replicate in host cells and induce cytolysis to release the virus progeny to the surrounding tumor sites for sustainable infection and oncolysis. The asymmetric coating of magnetic NPs bestows the cell robots with effective movement in various media and wireless manipulation with directional migration in a microfluidic device and bladder mold under magnetic control, further enabling steerable movement and prolonged retention of cell robots in the mouse bladder. The biorecognition of cRGD and robust, controllable propulsion of cell robots work synergistically to greatly enhance their tissue penetration and anticancer efficacy in the 3D cancer spheroid and orthotopic mouse bladder tumor model. Overall, this study integrates cell-based microrobots with virotherapy to generate an attractive robotic system with tumor specificity, expanding the operation scope of cell robots in biomedical community.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of Long&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Group Spacers in Glycolated Copolymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New molecular design rules are established to overcome the trade&#8208;off between electronic and ionic conduction in OECTs. The gDPP&#8208;TTVTT copolymer achieves the best operational stability and maximum transconductance of 61.9 S cm&#8722;1. The long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group spacer prevents morphological and electrostatic disruptions to the conjugated backbone, maintaining high electronic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities, while increasing ion density for efficient and stable OECTs.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymers with oligoethylene glycol (OEG) sidechains have attracted strong research interest for organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) applications. However, key molecular design rules for high&#8208;performance OECTs via efficient mixed electronic/ionic charge transport are still unclear. In this work, new glycolated copolymers (gDPP&#8208;TTT and gDPP&#8208;TTVTT) with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor and thiophene (T) and vinylene (V) thiophene&#8208;based donor units are synthesized and characterized for accumulation mode OECTs, where a long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group (C12) attached to the DPP unit acts as a spacer distancing the OEG groups from the polymer backbone. gDPP&#8208;TTVTT shows the highest OECT transconductance (61.9 S cm&#8211;1) and high operational stability, compared to gDPP&#8208;TTT and their alkylated counterparts. Surprisingly, gDPP&#8208;TTVTT also shows high electronic charge mobility in a field&#8208;effect transistor, suggesting efficient ion injection/diffusion without hindering its efficient electronic charge transport. The elongated donor unit (TTVTT) facilitates hole polaron formation to be more localized to the donor unit, leading to faster and easier polaron formation with less impact on polymer structure during OECT operation, as opposed to the TTT unit. This is supported by molecular dynamics simulation. These simultaneously high electronic and ionic charge&#8208;transport properties are achieved due to the long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group spacer in amphipathic sidechains, providing an important molecular design rule for glycolated copolymers.

         <title>Revealing the Structural Coloration of Self&#8208;Assembled Chitin Nanocrystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The structural coloration of arthropods often arises from helicoidal structures made primarily of chitin. Although it is possible to achieve analogous helicoidal architectures by exploiting the self&#8208;assembly of chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs), to date no evidence of structural coloration has been reported from such structures. In this work, we identify that previous studies were constrained by both the experimental inability to access sub&#8208;micron helicoidal pitches and the intrinsically low birefringence of crystalline chitin. To expand the range of accessible pitches, here we isolate ChNCs from two phylogenetically distinct sources of &#945;&#8208;chitin, namely fungi and shrimp, while to increase the birefringence, we perform an in situ alkaline treatment, increasing the intensity of the reflected color by nearly two orders of magnitude. By combining this treatment with precise control over suspension formulation, we demonstrate structurally colored chitin&#8208;based films with reflection tunable from blue to near infrared.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Differentiated Dielectric Materials in Monolayer Graphene Charge&#8208;Regulated Field&#8208;Effect Transistors for an Artificial Reflex Arc and Pain Modulation System of the Spinal Cord</title>

Abstract
The nervous system is a vital part of organisms to survive and it endows them with remarkable abilities, such as perception, recognition, regulation, learning, and decision&#8208;making, by intertwining myriad neurons. To realize such outstanding efficacies and functions, many artificial devices and systems have been investigated to emulate the operating principles of the nervous system. Here, an artificial reflex arc (ARA) and artificial pain modulation system (APMS) are proposed to imitate the unconscious behaviors of the spinal cord. GdxOy&#8208; and AlxOy&#8208;based charge&#8208;regulated field effect transistors (CRFETs) with a monolayer graphene channel were fabricated and adopted as inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, under the same pulse signals to mimic the biological reflex arc through a connection with a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)&#8208;based actuator. Additionally, a memristor was integrated with a CRFET as the interneuron to regulate the Dirac point by controlling the voltage drop on the graphene channel, analogous to the descending pain inhibition system in the spinal cord, to prevent excessive pain perception. The proposed ARA and APMS have provided a significant step forward to realizing the functions of the nervous system, giving promising potential for developing future intelligent alarm systems, neuroprosthetics, and neurorobotics.

         <title>Inhibition and Reconstruction of Zener Tunneling in Photonic Honeycomb Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise site&#8208;dependent photonic material has the ability of modifying momentum&#8208;space properties and maintaining the coherence of bulk states in transport. Artificial honeycomb lattices with an effective force are constructed to realize highly controllable Zener tunneling and the coherence protection of particles transmitting on artificial quantum materials.








Abstract
Quantum coherence is the central element of particle states, and it characterizes the overall performance of various quantum materials. Bloch oscillation is a fundamental coherent behavior of particles under a static potential, which can be easily destroyed by Zener tunneling in multiband 2D lattice materials. The control of Zener tunneling therefore plays the key role in quantum engineering for complicated physical systems. Here, the inhibition and reconstruction of Zener tunneling in photonic honeycomb lattices are experimentally demonstrated. &#160;Deformed honeycomb lattices are integrated and an effective static potential is realized on the 2D lattice materials. Zener tunneling disappears in stretch&#8208;type lattices and wave packets stay in the dispersionless upper energy band. On the contrary, Zener tunneling is greatly enhanced in compression&#8208;type lattices and wave packets exhibit directional oscillations without branches, which manifest the preserved coherence of the wave packets. The results demonstrate the protection of photonic coherence by structurally controlling the Zener tunneling, representing a step toward flexible quantum engineering for large&#8208;scale artificial quantum&#160;materials.

Abstract
Riding on the rapid growth in electric vehicles and the stationary energy storage market, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries and next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries (i.e., advanced batteries) have been long&#8208;accepted as essential building blocks for future technology reaching the specific energy density of 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the cell&#8208;level. Such progress, mainly driven by the emerging electrode materials or electrolytes, necessitates the development of polymeric materials with advanced functionalities in the battery to address new challenges. Therefore, it is urgently required to understand the basic chemistry and essential research directions in polymeric materials and establish a library for the polymeric materials that enables the development of advanced batteries. Herein, based on indispensable polymeric materials in advanced high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion, lithium&#8208;sulfur, lithium metal, and dual&#8208;ion battery chemistry, the key research directions of polymeric materials for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safety are summarized and design strategies for further improving performance are examined. Furthermore, the challenges of polymeric materials for advanced battery technologies are discussed.

Abstract
Phase change materials (PCMs) offer tremendous potential to store thermal energy during reversible phase transitions for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. The practicality of these materials is adversely restricted by volume expansion, phase segregation, and leakage problems associated with conventional solid&#8208;liquid PCMs. Solid&#8208;solid PCMs, as promising alternatives to solid&#8208;liquid PCMs, are gaining much attention towards practical thermal energy storage (TES) owing to their inimitable advantages such as solid&#8208;state processing, negligible volume change during phase transition, no contamination, and long cyclic life. Herein, we aim to provide a holistic analysis of solid&#8208;solid PCMs suitable for thermal energy harvesting, storage, and utilization. We start by presenting developing strategies of solid&#8208;solid PCMs and then discuss the structure&#8208;property relationship followed by potential applications. We finish by presenting an outlook discussion with momentous challenges and future directions. We hope our efforts will provide a guideline to the scientific community to develop high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;solid PCMs for advanced TES applications

         <title>Reinforced Layered Double Hydroxide Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Electrocatalysts: A Polyoxometallic Acid Wet&#8208;Etching Approach and Synergistic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiskilled polyoxometallic acid etching approach to ingeniously reconstructing nickel&#8211;iron&#8208;based layered double hydroxides through morphology optimization, active site synergistic regulation, and defect regulation as a promising electrode post&#8208;treatment technique toward industrial anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane electrolyzer applications is reported.








Abstract
Nickel&#8211;iron&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) have attracted tremendous research and industrial interests for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis. However, methodologies on simultaneous regulation of performance&#8208;influencing factors remain scarce and their real synergistic effects are not clear enough. Herein, a versatile polyoxometallic acids (POMs) etching approach is reported to ingeniously reconstruct NiFe LDH, including 3D morphological nanotailoring, Fe3+ and &#945;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 active species reconfiguration, creation of multiple Ni, Fe, and O vacancies, and intercalation of POM polyanionic clusters. The experimental and theoretical data collaboratively unveil that control of the key performance&#8208;influencing factors and their multiple synergistic mechanisms dominantly contribute to the step&#8208;like OER performance enhancement. The reinforced electrocatalyst is further produced with low cost and high performance up to &#1060;180 mm in diameter, showing its feasibility and advancement of the promising configuration of NiFe LDH&#8208;PMo12(+) II Ni@NiFe LDH(&#8722;) for alkaline anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane electrode stack cells. Furthermore, to mathematically evaluate the evolution, a novel empirical formula is proposed for quantitative identification of structure&#8211;activity correlations, which offers an opportunity for first and fast reliability on materials screening.

         <title>Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conduction, a Multifunctional Property in Organic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and dynamic tuning of organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors influence a myriad of functional properties: energy levels, conductivity, color, modulus, and volume for a diverse range of real&#8208;world applications. Several chemical and structural design approaches to modify OMIECs&#8217; properties are highlighted, and how various stimuli such as electrical, chemical, and optical inputs fundamentally change OMIECs&#8217; properties dynamically, along with how these changes can be utilized in device applications, is discussed.








Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) have gained recent interest and rapid development due to their versatility in diverse applications ranging from sensing, actuation and computation to energy harvesting/storage, and information transfer. Their multifunctional properties arise from their ability to simultaneously participate in redox reactions as well as modulation of ionic and electronic charge density throughout the bulk of the material. Most importantly, the ability to access charge states with deep modulation through a large extent of its density of states and physical volume of the material enables OMIEC&#8208;based devices to display exciting new characteristics and opens up new degrees of freedom in device design. Leveraging the infinite possibilities of the organic synthetic toolbox, this perspective highlights several chemical and structural design approaches to modify OMIECs&#8217; properties important in device applications such as electronic and ionic conductivity, color, modulus, etc. Additionally, the ability for OMIECs to respond to external stimuli and transduce signals to myriad types of outputs has accelerated their development in smart systems. This perspective further illustrates how various stimuli such as electrical, chemical, and optical inputs fundamentally change OMIECs&#8217; properties dynamically and how these changes can be utilized in device applications.

         <title>Crosstalk&#8208;Free, High&#8208;Resolution Pressure Sensor Arrays Enabled by High&#8208;Throughput Laser Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;resolution flexible pressure sensor array with individual sensing pixels and their interconnects is sequentially defined by laser&#8208;induced graphenization and ablation to minimize crosstalk interferences. The new geometry of the interconnects induces a remarkable reduction of the crosstalk coefficient and enables a record high resolution of the sensor array.








Abstract
Simultaneously achieving high spatial resolution and low crosstalk interference has been a fundamental challenge for flexible pressure sensor arrays. Here the authors present a high&#8208;resolution flexible pressure sensor array fabricated through a two&#8208;step laser manufacturing process, where individual sensing pixels and their interconnects are sequentially defined by laser&#8208;induced graphenization and ablation to minimize crosstalk interferences. The geometry of the interconnects is optimized through theoretical modeling and experimental validation. Characterization results show that the new device design induces a remarkable reduction of the crosstalk coefficient, from &#8722;8.21 to &#8722;43.63 dB, of the 0.7 mm&#8208;resolution sensor arrays, and the crosstalk suppression is particularly beneficial for application scenarios involving pressure sensing on soft surfaces (e.g., human skin and organs). Applications of the sensor array in tactile pattern recognition and minimally&#8208;invasive cancer surgery are demonstrated.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Oriented Antibody&#8208;Decorated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanocrystals for Active&#8208;Targeting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the integration of oriented antibodies in MOFs is proposed. A synchrotron small angle X&#8208;ray scattering investigation demonstrates that the formation of the MOF (ZIF&#8208;C) is induced by the crystallizable fragment region (Fc) of antibodies, leaving the fragment antigen&#8208;binding (Fab) regions free to target antigens. ZIF&#8208;C*antibody particles are functionalized with fluorescent markers for active targeting and cancer cell imaging.








Abstract
Antibody (Ab)&#8208;targeted nanoparticles are becoming increasingly important for precision medicine. By controlling the Ab orientation, targeting properties can be enhanced; however, to afford such an ordered configuration, cumbersome chemical functionalization protocols are usually required. This aspect limits the progress of Abs&#8208;nanoparticles toward nanomedicine translation. Herein, a novel one&#8208;step synthesis of oriented monoclonal Ab&#8208;decorated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals is presented. The crystallization of a zinc&#8208;based MOF, Zn2(mIM)2(CO3), from a solution of Zn2+ and 2&#8208;methylimidazole (mIM), is triggered by the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of the Ab. This selective growth yields biocomposites with oriented Abs on the MOF nanocrystals (MOF*Ab): the Fc regions are partially inserted within the MOF surface and the antibody&#8208;binding regions protrude from the MOF surface toward the target. This ordered configuration imparts antibody&#8211;antigen recognition properties to the biocomposite and shows preserved target binding when compared to the parental antibodies. Next, the biosensing performance of the system is tested by loading MOF*Ab with luminescent quantum dots (QD). The targeting efficiency of the QD&#8208;containing MOF*Ab is again, fully preserved. The present work represents a simple self&#8208;assembly approach for the fabrication of antibody&#8208;decorated MOF nanocrystals with broad potential for sensing, diagnostic imaging, and targeted drug delivery.

This ordered configuration imparts antibody&#8211;antigen recognition properties to the biocomposite and shows preserved target binding when compared to the parental antibodies. Next, the biosensing performance of the system is tested by loading MOF*Ab with luminescent quantum dots (QD). The targeting efficiency of the QD-containing MOF*Ab is again, fully preserved. The present work represents a simple self-assembly approach for the fabrication of antibody-decorated MOF nanocrystals with broad potential for sensing, diagnostic imaging, and targeted drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Structure Engineering of Single&#8208;Atom Ru Sites via Co&#8211;N4 Sites for Bifunctional pH&#8208;Universal Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Ru and Co dual&#8208;sites anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon (Ru/Co&#8211;N&#8211;C) is developed as an efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal water splitting.








Abstract
The development of bifunctional water&#8208;splitting electrocatalysts that are efficient and stable over a wide range of pH is of great significance but challenging. Here, an atomically dispersed Ru/Co dual&#8208;sites catalyst is reported anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon (Ru/Co&#8211;N&#8211;C) for outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The Ru/Co&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst requires the overpotential of only 13 and 23&#160;mV for HER, 232 and 247&#160;mV for OER to deliver a current density of 10&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 1 m KOH, respectively, outperforming benchmark catalysts Pt/C and RuO2. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Co&#8211;N4 sites into Ru/Co&#8211;N&#8211;C efficiently modify the electronic structure of Ru by enlarging Ru&#8211;O covalency and increasing Ru electron density, which in turn optimize the bonding strength between oxygen/hydrogen intermediate species with Ru sites, thereby enhancing OER and HER performance. Furthermore, the incorporation of Co&#8211;N4 sites induces electron redistribution around Ru&#8211;N4, thus enhancing corrosion&#8211;resistance of Ru/Co&#8211;N&#8211;C during acid and alkaline electrolysis. The Ru/Co&#8211;N&#8211;C has been applied in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer and steady operation is demonstrated at a high current density of 450&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 for 330 h.

         <title>A Semiconducting Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer as an Organic Electrochemical Transistor Active Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymers feature synthetically tailored porosity and thus show both efficient electronic and ion transport. It is shown that two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) can be patterned on the micrometer scale, and can be used as the active material for organic electrochemical transistors.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are devices with broad potential in bioelectronic sensing, circuits, and neuromorphic hardware. Their unique properties arise from the use of organic mixed ionic/electronic conductors (OMIECs) as the active channel. Typical OMIECs are linear polymers, where defined and controlled microstructure/morphology, and reliable characterization of transport and charging can be elusive. Semiconducting two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) present a new avenue in OMIEC materials development, enabling electronic transport along with precise control of well&#8208;defined channels ideal for ion transport/intercalation. To this end, a recently reported 2DP, TIIP, is synthesized and patterned at 10&#160;&#181;m resolution as the channel of a transistor. The TIIP films demonstrate textured microstructure and show semiconducting properties with accessible oxidation states. Operating in an aqueous electrolyte, the 2DP&#8208;OECT exhibits a device&#8208;scale hole mobility of 0.05 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and a &#181;C* figure of merit of 1.75 F cm&#8211;1 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. 2DP OMIECs thus offer new synthetic degrees of freedom to control OECT performance and may enable additional opportunities such as ion selectivity or improved stability through reduced morphological modulation during device operation.

         <title>Rational Development of a Polysaccharide&#8211;Protein&#8208;Conjugated Nanoparticle Vaccine Against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants and Streptococcus pneumoniae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bivalent nanoparticle vaccine is rationally developed by conjugating capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 with the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. Immunization with this vaccine induces potent protective immune responses against both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants and S. pneumoniae. This universal polysaccharide&#8211;protein&#8208;conjugated vaccine platform provides a new tool to fight against cocirculating viral and bacterial pathogens.








Abstract
The ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has led to millions of deaths worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) remains a major cause of mortality in underdeveloped countries. A vaccine that prevents both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and S. pneumoniae infection represents a long&#8208;sought &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;. Herein, a nanoparticle vaccine, termed SCTV01B, is rationally developed by using the capsular polysaccharide of S. pneumoniae serotype 14 (PPS14) as the backbone to conjugate with the recombinant receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. The final formulation of conjugated nanoparticles in the network structure exhibits high thermal stability. Immunization with SCTV01B induces potent humoral and Type 1/Type 2 T helper cell (Th1/Th2) cellular immune responses in mice, rats, and rhesus macaques. In particular, SCTV01B&#8208;immunized serum not only broadly cross&#8208;neutralizes all SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants of concern (VOCs), including the most recent Omicron variant, but also shows high opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against S. pneumoniae serotype 14. Finally, SCTV01B vaccination confers protection against challenges with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 mouse&#8208;adapted strain and the original strain in established murine models. Collectively, these promising preclinical results support further clinical evaluation of SCTV01B, highlighting the potency of polysaccharide&#8208;RBD&#8208;conjugated nanoparticle vaccine platforms for the development of vaccines for COVID&#8208;19 and other infectious diseases.

         <title>Double&#8208;Lattice Packing of Pentagonal Gold Bipyramids in Supercrystals with Triclinic Symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pentagonal gold bipyramids are self&#8208;assembled into extended superlattices. Multimodal analysis indicate the formation of supercrystals with a low&#8208;symmetry triclinic structure and with a two&#8208;particle unit cell. Computer simulations confirm that the structure corresponds to the densest possible packing. The supercrystals display a facet&#8208;dependent optical response that is promising for sensing, metamaterials applications, and for fundamental studies of self&#8208;assembly processes.








Abstract
Pentagonal packing is a long&#8208;standing issue and a rich mathematical topic, brought to the fore by recent progress in nanoparticle design. Gold pentagonal bipyramids combine fivefold symmetry and anisotropy and their section varies along the length. In this work, colloidal supercrystals of pentagonal gold bipyramids are obtained in a compact arrangement that generalizes the optimal packing of regular pentagons in the plane. Multimodal investigations reveal a two&#8208;particle unit cell with triclinic symmetry, a lower symmetry than that of the building blocks. Monte Carlo computer simulations show that this lattice achieves the densest possible packing. Going beyond pentagons, further simulations show an odd&#8211;even effect of the number of sides on the packing: odd&#8208;sided bipyramids are non&#8208;centrosymmetric and require the double&#8208;lattice arrangement to recover inversion symmetry. The supercrystals display a facet&#8208;dependent optical response that is promising for sensing, metamaterials applications, and for fundamental studies of self&#8208;assembly processes.

Multimodal investigations reveal a two-particle unit cell with triclinic symmetry, a lower symmetry than that of the building blocks. Monte Carlo computer simulations show that this lattice achieves the densest possible packing. Going beyond pentagons, further simulations show an odd&#8211;even effect of the number of sides on the packing: odd-sided bipyramids are non-centrosymmetric and require the double-lattice arrangement to recover inversion symmetry. The supercrystals display a facet-dependent optical response that is promising for sensing, metamaterials applications, and for fundamental studies of self-assembly processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Alkaline Water/Seawater Hydrogen Evolution by a Nanorod&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Structured Ni&#8208;MoN Catalyst with Fast Water&#8208;Dissociation Kinetics</title>

         <dc:description>
Nanorod&#8211;nanoparticle&#8208;structured Ni&#8208;MoN is prepared as an efficient HER catalyst for alkaline water and seawater electrolysis. Benefiting from the high and stable catalytic performance, this Ni&#8208;MoN can be combined with stainless&#8208;steel mat for overall water/seawater electrolysis. This assembled electrolyzer can be driven by a thermoelectric module to generate hydrogen.








Abstract
Achieving efficient and durable nonprecious hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for scaling up alkaline water/seawater electrolysis is desirable but remains a significant challenge. Here, a heterogeneous Ni&#8208;MoN catalyst consisting of Ni and MoN nanoparticles on amorphous MoN nanorods that can sustain large&#8208;current&#8208;density HER with outstanding performance is demonstrated. The hierarchical nanorod&#8211;nanoparticle structure, along with a large surface area and multidimensional boundaries/defects endows the catalyst with abundant active sites. The hydrophilic surface helps to achieve accelerated gas&#8208;release capabilities and is effective in preventing catalyst degradation during water electrolysis. Theoretical calculations further prove that the combination of Ni and MoN effectively modulates the electron redistribution at their interface and promotes the sluggish water&#8208;dissociation kinetics at the Mo sites. Consequently, this Ni&#8208;MoN catalyst requires low overpotentials of 61 and 136&#160;mV to drive current densities of 100 and 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, in 1 m KOH and remains stable during operation for 200 h at a constant current density of 100 or 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This good HER catalyst also works well in alkaline seawater electrolyte and shows outstanding performance toward overall seawater electrolysis with ultralow cell voltages.

         <title>A Tumor Microenvironments&#8208;Adapted Polypeptide Hydrogel/Nanogel Composite Boosts Antitumor Molecularly Targeted Inhibition and Immunoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironments&#8208;adapted composite consisting of a thermosensitive hydrogel and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanogel achieves sequential release of molecularly targeted drug and TGF&#8208;&#946; inhibitor in the tumor cells, blocks the proliferation of tumor cells, reverses the epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition caused by elevated TGF&#8208;&#946;, and regulates the tumor immune microenvironments, thereby effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastases.








Abstract
Various macro/microscopic biomaterials have been developed for controlled drug delivery in the combination therapy of malignancies. However, uncertain loading ratio, release sequence, and spatiotemporal distribution of drugs hinder their synergistic therapeutic effects and clinical applications. In this work, a tumor microenvironments&#8208;adapted composite consisting of a thermosensitive hydrogel and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanogel is developed for precisely sequential drug release to enhance molecularly targeted therapy and amplify immune activation. LY3200882 (LY), a selective transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) inhibitor, is encapsulated in the ROS&#8208;responsive nanogel and dispersed uniformly with regorafenib (REG) in a thermosensitive hydrogel (Gel/(REG+NG/LY)). After in situ administration, REG is preferentially released from the hydrogel to inhibit tumor growth and promote ROS generation, which triggers the subsequent on&#8208;demand release of LY from the nanogel. LY contributes to preventing the epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition and immune escape of tumor cells induced by elevated TGF&#8208;&#946;. In subcutaneous and orthotopic colorectal tumor bearing mouse models, Gel/(REG+NG/LY) effectively inhibits tumor growth and liver metastases by increasing the tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells, reducing the recruitment of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and promoting the polarization of macrophages from M2 to M1 type, indicating the significant potential in improving the prognosis of advanced cancer patients.

         <title>Gires&#8211;Tournois Immunoassay Platform for Label&#8208;Free Bright&#8208;Field Imaging and Facile Quantification of Bioparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gires&#8211;Tournois immunoassay platform (GTIP) for label&#8208;free bright&#8208;field imaging and facile quantification of bioparticles is proposed. Bioparticles on GTIP slow down the velocity of reflected light, leading to vivid color change according to the local particle density and maximizing chromatic contrast. The particle distribution and density are analyzed through 2D raster&#8208;scanning&#8211;based chromaticity analysis.








Abstract
Bright&#8208;field imaging of nanoscale bioparticles is a challenging task for optical microscopy because the light&#8211;matter interactions of bioparticles are weak on conventional surfaces due to their low refractive index and small size. Alternatively, advanced imaging techniques, including near&#8208;field microscopy and phase microscopy, have enabled visualization and quantification of the bioparticles, but they require assistance of sophisticated/customized systems and post&#8208;processing with complex established algorithms. Here, a simple and fast immunoassay device, Gires&#8211;Tournois immunoassay platform (GTIP) is presented, which provides unique color dynamics in response to optical environment changes and thus enables the label&#8208;free bright&#8208;field imaging and facile quantification of bioparticles using conventional optical microscopy. Bioparticles on GTIP slow down the velocity of reflected light, leading to vivid color change according to the local particle density and maximizing chromatic contrast for high spatial distinguishability. The particle distribution and density on the surface of the resonator are readily analyzed through 2D raster&#8208;scanning&#8208;based chromaticity analysis. GTIP offers multiscale sensing capability for target analytes that possess different refractive indices and sizes.

         <title>Ionic Hydrogel for Efficient and Scalable Moisture&#8208;Electric Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic hydrogel moisture electric generator (IHMEG) shows high power&#8208;output and stable voltage by virtue of synergistic effect of enhanced moisture&#8208;enabled protons diffusion and long&#8208;maintained water gradient. With easy&#8208;to&#8208;scaleup fabrication, high cost&#8208;efficiency, and wide adaptability to temperature and humidity, the IHMEG device holds great potentials to develop a green, efficient, flexible, and versatile direct&#8208;current power source for Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things and wearable electronics.








Abstract
The progress of spontaneous energy generation from ubiquitous moisture is hindered the low output current and intermittent operating voltage of the moisture&#8208;electric generators. Herein a novel and efficient ionic hydrogel moisture&#8208;electric generator (IHMEG) is developed by rational combination of poly(vinyl alcohol), phytic acid, and glycerol&#8208;water binary solvent. Thanks to the synergistic effect of notable moisture&#8208;absorption capability and fast ion transport capability in the ionic hydrogel network, a single IHMEG unit of 0.25 cm2 can continuously generate direct&#8208;current electricity with a constant open&#8208;circuit voltage of &#8776;0.8&#160;V for over 1000 h, a high short&#8208;current density of 0.24 mA cm&#8722;2, and power density of up to 35 &#181;W cm&#8722;2. Of great importance is that large&#8208;scale integration of IHMEG units can be readily accomplished to offer a device with voltage up to 210&#160;V, capable of directly driving numerous commercial electronics, including electronic ink screen, metal electrodeposition setup, and light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode arrays. Such prominent performance is mainly attributed to the enhanced moisture&#8208;liberated proton diffusion proved by experimental observation and theoretical analysis. The ionic hydrogel with high cost&#8208;efficiency, easy&#8208;to&#8208;scaleup fabrication, and high power&#8208;output opens a brand&#8208;new perspective to develop a green, versatile, and efficient power source for Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things and wearable electronics.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride on Graphene with Giant Bandgap Renormalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable synthesis of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has remained a daunting challenge. An hBN/graphene&#8208;interface&#8208;mediated growth concept to enable scalable epitaxy of unidirectional high&#8208;quality monolayer hBN on graphene substrates is proposed and demonstrated. A uniform moir&#233; superlattice and robust deep&#8208;ultraviolet excitonic emission (around 6.12 eV) are achieved in such a monolayer hBN/graphene van der Waals heterostructure.








Abstract
Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been widely considered a fundamental building block for 2D heterostructures and devices. However, the controlled and scalable synthesis of hBN and its 2D heterostructures has remained a daunting challenge. Here, an hBN/graphene (hBN/G) interface&#8208;mediated growth process for the controlled synthesis of high&#8208;quality monolayer hBN is proposed and further demonstrated. It is discovered that the in&#8208;plane hBN/G interface can be precisely controlled, enabling the scalable epitaxy of unidirectional monolayer hBN on graphene, which exhibits a uniform moir&#233; superlattice consistent with single&#8208;domain hBN, aligned to the underlying graphene lattice. Furthermore, it is identified that the deep&#8208;ultraviolet emission at 6.12&#160;eV stems from the 1s&#8208;exciton state of monolayer hBN with a giant renormalized direct bandgap on graphene. This work provides a viable path for the controlled synthesis of ultraclean, wafer&#8208;scale, atomically ordered 2D quantum materials, as well as the fabrication of 2D quantum electronic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Diminishing Interfacial Turbulence by Colloid&#8208;Polymer Electrolyte to Stabilize Zinc Ion Flux for Deep&#8208;Cycling Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a new design of colloid&#8208;polymer electrolyte (CPE) for use in Zn metal batteries is proposed to diminish interfacial disturbance and realize stable Zn2+ environment at deep cycling. The efficacies of the designed CPE are determined with a combination of density functional theory, finite element simulation, in situ Raman measurements, and electrochemical tests for Zn&#8208;based cells.








Abstract
The fluidity of aqueous electrolytes and undesired H2 evolution reaction (HER) can cause severe interfacial turbulence in aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs) at deep cycling with high capacities and current densities, which would further perturb ion flux and aggravate Zn dendrite growth. In this study, a colloid&#8208;polymer electrolyte (CPE) with special colloidal phase and suppressed HER is designed to diminish interfacial turbulence and boost deep Zn electrochemistry. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the quantitative migratory barriers of Zn2+ along the transport pathway in CPE demonstrate much smaller fluctuations compared with normal aqueous electrolyte, indicating that CPE can effectively diminish interfacial disturbance. Benefitting from this, the Zn2+ ion flux can be homogenized and deposited evenly on the electrode, which is confirmed by finite element simulation and in situ Raman measurements. Consequently, CPE enables stable operation of Zn//Cu cells even with high capacity (up to 20 mAh cm&#8722;2) and current density (up to 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and Zn//Na5V12O32 full&#8208;cell with N/P ratio as low as 1 (i.e., 100%&#160;Zn utilization). It is believed that this strategy opens a brand&#8208;new avenue based on CPE toward boosting deep&#8208;cycling electrochemistry in ZMBs and even other aqueous energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Strain High&#8208;Capacity Silicon/Carbon Anode Enabled by a MOF&#8208;Derived Space&#8208;Confined Single&#8208;Atom Catalytic Strategy for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A new catalog of zero&#8208;strain electrode material made of ultrasmall Si nanodots within metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (MOF)&#8208;derived nanoreactors (Si NDs&#8834;MDN) is developed through a novel space&#8208;confined single&#8208;atom catalytic strategy. The Si NDs&#8834;MDN anode featuring both low strain and high capacity is completely distinct from the traditional single&#8208;crystal zero&#8208;strain materials, extending the concept of zero&#8208;strain electrode materials from single crystals to composite field.








Abstract
Developing zero&#8208;strain electrode materials with high capacity is crucial for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Here, a new zero&#8208;strain composite material made of ultrasmall Si nanodots (NDs) within metal organic framework&#8208;derived nanoreactors (Si NDs&#8834;MDN) through a novel space&#8208;confined catalytic strategy is reported. The unique Si NDs&#8834;MDN anode features a low strain (&lt;3%) and a high theoretical lithium storage capacity (1524 mAh g&#8208;1) which far surpasses the traditional single&#8208;crystal counterparts that suffer from a low capacity delivery. The zero&#8208;strain property is evidenced by substantial characterizations including ex/in situ transmission electron microscopy and mechanical simulations. The Si NDs&#8834;MDN exhibits superior cycling stability and high reversible capacity (1327 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles) in half&#8208;cells and high energy density (366&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 after 300 cycles) in a full cell. This study reports a new catalog of zero&#8208;strain electrode material with significantly improved capacity beyond the traditional single&#8208;crystal zero&#8208;strain materials.

         <title>An Asymmetric Hygroscopic Structure for Moisture&#8208;Driven Hygro&#8208;Ionic Electricity Generation and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual route for moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG) is proposed by an asymmetric hygroscopic structure (AHS), which simultaneously achieves MEG and energy storage. The water&#8208;absorption triggered dual function originates from the permanently maintained wet&#8208;dry asymmetry that is formed across the AHS by the asymmetric deposition of a hygroscopic ionic hydrogel over a functionalized&#8208;carbon layer.








Abstract
The interactions between moisture and materials give rise to the possibility of moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG). Current MEG materials and devices only establish this interaction during water sorption in specific configurations, and conversion is eventually ceased by saturated water uptake. This paper reports an asymmetric hygroscopic structure (AHS) that simultaneously achieves energy harvesting and storage from moisture absorption. The AHS is constructed by the asymmetric deposition of a hygroscopic ionic hydrogel over a layer of functionalized carbon. Water absorbed from the air creates wet&#8208;dry asymmetry across the AHS and hence an in&#8208;plane electric field. The asymmetry can be perpetually maintained even after saturated water absorption. The absorbed water triggers the spontaneous development of an electrical double layer (EDL) over the carbon surface, which is termed a hygro&#8208;ionic process, accounting for the capacitive properties of the AHS. A peak power density of 70 &#181;W cm&#8208;3&#160;was&#160;realized after geometry optimization. The AHS shows the ability to be recharged either by itself owing to a self&#8208;regeneration effect or via external electrical means, which allows it to serve as an energy storage device. In addition to insights into moisture&#8208;material interaction, AHSs further shows potential for electronics powering in assembled devices.

         <dc:description>
Bandgap&#8208;stable and efficient CsPbBrxI3&#8722;x perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are demonstrated by adopting an in situ inorganic ligand exchange. This strategy enables bandgap&#8208;stable mixed&#8208;halide perovskites with nanocrystal colloidal stability exceeding 1&#160;year at ambient conditions. The PLEDs exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.4% and sixfold&#8208;enhanced operating stability relative to the most stable prior red perovskite LEDs having EQEs &gt;20%.








Abstract
Instability in mixed&#8208;halide perovskites (MHPs) is a key issue limiting perovskite solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). One form of instability arises during the processing of MHP quantum dots using an antisolvent to precipitate and purify the dots forming surface traps that lead to decreased luminescence, compromised colloidal stability, and emission broadening. Here, the introduction of inorganic ligands in the antisolvents used in dot purification is reported in order to overcome this problem. MHPs that are colloidally stable for over 1&#160;year at 25&#160;&#176;C&#160;and 40% humidity are demonstrated and films that are stable under 100&#160;W cm&#8722;2 photoirradiation, 4&#215; longer than the best previously reported MHPs, are reported. In LEDs, the materials enable an EQE of 24.4% (average 22.5&#160;&#177; 1.3%) and narrow emission (full&#8208;width at half maximum of 30&#160;nm). Sixfold&#8208;enhanced operating stability relative to the most stable prior red perovskite LEDs having external quantum efficiency &gt;20% is reported.

         <title>Glutathione&#8208;Depleting Organic Metal Adjuvants for Effective NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic metal adjuvants, assembled from charge&#8208;transfer complexes and characterized by broad substrate scope, high accessibility, and flexibly&#8208;tuned optical properties, demonstrate strong second near&#8208;infrared photoacoustic and photothermal properties as well as high adjuvant abilities by perturbing redox homeostasis to potentiate immunogenicity and immune responsiveness.








Abstract
Although photothermal immunotherapy (PTI) is a compelling strategy for tumor therapy, the development of promising photothermal agents to overcome the insufficient immunogenicity of tumor cells and the poor immune response encountered in PTI is still challenging. Herein, commercial small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based organic metal adjuvants (OMAs) are presented, with second near&#8208;infrared photoacoustic and photothermal properties as well as the ability to perturb redox homeostasis to potentiate immunogenicity and immune responsiveness. OMAs, assembled from charge&#8208;transfer complexes and characterized by a broad substrate scope, high accessibility, and flexibly tuned optical properties, demonstrate strong phototherapeutic and adjuvant abilities via the depletion of glutathione and cysteine, and subsequently elicit systemic immunity by evoking immunogenic cell death, promoting dendritic cell maturation, and increasing T cell infiltration. Furthermore, programmed cell death protein 1 antibody can be employed to synergize with OMAs to suppress tumor immune evasion and ultimately improve the treatment outcomes. This study unlocks new paradigms to provide a versatile OMA&#8208;based scaffold for future practical applications.

         <title>Large Magnetic Gap in a Designer Ferromagnet&#8211;Topological Insulator&#8211;Ferromagnet Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnet/topological insulator heterostructure is fabricated comprising a sandwich structure of 2D ferromagnetic insulators with an ultrathin topological insulator in the middle. The ferromagnets induce magnetic order in the topological insulator via magnetic proximity leading to a quantum anomalous Hall insulator and large 75 meV magnetic bandgap. These findings reveal a promising platform for lossless transport applications at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Combining magnetism and nontrivial band topology gives rise to quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators and exotic quantum phases such as the QAH effect where current flows without dissipation along quantized edge states. Inducing magnetic order in topological insulators via proximity to a magnetic material offers a promising pathway toward achieving the QAH effect at a high temperature for lossless transport applications. One promising architecture involves a sandwich structure comprising two single&#8208;septuple layers (1SL) of MnBi2Te4 (a 2D ferromagnetic insulator) with ultrathin few quintuple layer (QL) Bi2Te3 in the middle, and it is predicted to yield a robust QAH insulator phase with a large bandgap greater than 50 meV. Here, the growth of a 1SL MnBi2Te4/4QL Bi2Te3/1SL MnBi2Te4 heterostructure via molecular beam epitaxy is demonstrated and the electronic structure probed using angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Strong hexagonally warped massive Dirac fermions and a bandgap of 75 &#177; 15 meV are observed. The magnetic origin of the gap is confirmed by the observation of the exchange&#8208;Rashba effect, as well as the vanishing bandgap above the Curie temperature, in agreement with density functional theory calculations. These findings provide insights into magnetic proximity effects in topological insulators and reveal a promising platform for realizing the QAH effect at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Engineering Hibiscus&#8208;Like Riboflavin/ZIF&#8208;8 Microsphere Composites to Enhance Transepithelial Corneal Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel engineering hydrangea&#8208;like RF@ZIF&#8208;8 microsphere composites with outstanding trans&#8208;epithelial corneal cross&#8208;linking (TE&#8208;CXL) efficacy are prepared using one pot methods. The obtained biocompatible composites display excellent tolerance, remarkable corneal permeation, improved CXL efficacy than conventional CXL protocol without corneal epithelium debridement, suggesting a promising nanomedicine for corneal cross&#8208;linking.








Abstract
Riboflavin&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate (RF) is the most commonly used photosensitizer in corneal cross&#8208;linking (CXL), but its hydrophilicity and negative charge limit its penetration through the corneal epithelium into the stroma. To enhance the corneal permeability of RF and promote its efficacy in the treatment of keratoconus, novel hibiscus&#8208;like RF@ZIF&#8208;8 microsphere composites [6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF (nanoflake)] are prepared using ZIF&#8208;8 nanomaterials as carriers, which are characterized by their hydrophobicity, positive potential, biocompatibility, high loading capacities, and large surface areas. Both hematoxylin and eosin endothelial staining and TUNEL assays demonstrate excellent biocompatibility of 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF. In in vivo studies, the 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF displayed excellent corneal permeation, and outstanding transepithelial CXL (TE&#8208;CXL) efficacy, slightly better than the conventional CXL protocol. Furthermore, the special hibiscus&#8208;like structures of 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF meant that it has better TE&#8208;CXL efficacy than that of 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NP (nanoparticles) due to the larger contact area with the epithelium and the shorter RF release passage. These results suggest that the 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF are promising for transepithelial corneal cross&#8208;linking, avoiding the need for epithelial debridement.

         <title>A High&#8208;Fidelity Skin&#8208;Attachable Acoustic Sensor for Realizing Auditory Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;attachable acoustic sensor for realizing auditory electronic skin, with wide auditory field of bandwidth (15&#8211;10&#8239;000&#160;Hz) and acoustic&#8208;pressure (29&#8211;134&#160;dBSPL), is presented. The sensor shows high sensing fidelity without distortion for human&#8208;audible sounds, and even loud or low&#8208;frequency sounds that human ears cannot detect. The sensor demonstrates successful sound&#8208;recognition applications for Internet of Things.








Abstract
Wearable auditory sensors are critical in user&#8208;friendly sound&#8208;recognition systems for smart human&#8211;machine interaction and the Internet of Things. However, previously reported wearable sensors have limited sound&#8208;sensing quality as a consequence of a poor frequency response and a narrow acoustic&#8208;pressure range. Here, a skin&#8208;attachable acoustic sensor is presented that has higher sensing accuracy in wider auditory field than human ears, with flat frequency response (15&#8211;10&#8239;000&#160;Hz) and a good range of linearity (29&#8211;134 dBSPL) as well as high conformality to flexible surfaces and human skin. This high sound&#8208;sensing quality is achieved by exploiting the low residual stress and high processability of polymer materials in a diaphragm structure designed using acousto&#8208;mechano&#8208;electric modeling. Thus, this acoustic sensor shows high acoustic fidelity by sensing human&#8208;audible sounds, even loud sounds and low&#8208;frequency sounds that human ears cannot detect without distorting them. The polymer&#8208;based ultrasmall (&lt;9 mm2) and thin sensor maintains sound&#8208;detection quality on flexible substrates and in a wide temperature range (25 to 90&#160;&#176;C). The acoustic sensor shows a significant potential of auditory electronic skin, by recognizing voice successfully when the sensor attached on human skin is connected to a commercial mobile device running the latest artificial intelligence assistant.

&lt;p&gt;A skin-attachable acoustic sensor for realizing auditory electronic skin, with wide auditory field of bandwidth (15&#8211;10&#8239;000&#160;Hz) and acoustic-pressure (29&#8211;134&#160;dB&lt;sub&gt;SPL&lt;/sub&gt;), is presented.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wearable auditory sensors are critical in user-friendly sound-recognition systems for smart human&#8211;machine interaction and the Internet of Things. However, previously reported wearable sensors have limited sound-sensing quality as a consequence of a poor frequency response and a narrow acoustic-pressure range. Here, a skin-attachable acoustic sensor is presented that has higher sensing accuracy in wider auditory field than human ears, with flat frequency response (15&#8211;10&#8239;000&#160;Hz) and a good range of linearity (29&#8211;134 dB&lt;sub&gt;SPL&lt;/sub&gt;) as well as high conformality to flexible surfaces and human skin. This high sound-sensing quality is achieved by exploiting the low residual stress and high processability of polymer materials in a diaphragm structure designed using acousto-mechano-electric modeling. Thus, this acoustic sensor shows high acoustic fidelity by sensing human-audible sounds, even loud sounds and low-frequency sounds that human ears cannot detect without distorting them. The polymer-based ultrasmall (&amp;lt;9 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and thin sensor maintains sound-detection quality on flexible substrates and in a wide temperature range (25 to 90&#160;&#176;C). The acoustic sensor shows a significant potential of auditory electronic skin, by recognizing voice successfully when the sensor attached on human skin is connected to a commercial mobile device running the latest artificial intelligence assistant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrothermal Synthesis of High&#8208;Yield Red Fluorescent Carbon Dots with Ultra&#8208;Narrow Emission by Controlled O/N Elements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;narrow emission and high yield red fluorescent carbon dots (r&#8208;CDs) are prepared using o&#8208;phenylenediamine through hydrothermal method by increasing the degree of dehydration and carbonization and the conversion rate of polymerization, respectively. The emission and synthesis mechanisms are discussed. Furthermore, a logarithmic relationship on the aggregation&#8208;induced emission of r&#8208;CDs and a highly ordered graphite nitrate&#8208;like structure are found.








Abstract
Red fluorescent carbon dots (r&#8208;CDs) with narrow dual emissions (600&#160;nm and 658&#8211;683&#160;nm, full width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 20&#160;nm and 30&#160;nm), fluorescence quantum yield of 41.0%, and yield of 83.3% are prepared by hydrothermal method using o&#8208;phenylenediamine as precursor and inorganic oxidant as yield enhancer, and they have graphite nitrate&#8208;like structures. The long&#8208;wavelength side emission is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). A logarithmic relationship between the AIE wavelength (y) and the concentration (x) (y&#160;=&#160;8.853ln(x)&#160;+&#160;688.53, R&#160;=&#160;0.998) is found. This regularity and the high monochromaticity of AIE are related to the existence of highly ordered structures proved by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Its intrinsic emission (FWHM: 20&#160;nm) is the narrowest among the r&#8208;CDs prepared by hydrothermal method. The reason is that the decrease of oxygen content makes the FWHMs become narrow, and the decrease of the pyridine nitrogen content and the increase of pyrrole nitrogen content make them narrower further. The Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectra and control experiment prove that oxidative polymerization is a necessary preparation step. The linear relationship between the amount of the oxidant and the CDs yield indicates that the yield can be increased only by increasing the conversion rate of the polymerization process.

         <title>Two&#8208;Pronged Intracellular Co&#8208;Delivery of Antigen and Adjuvant for Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

A cancer nanovaccine is constructed by encapsulating ovalbumin257&#8208;264 peptide (OVAp) and cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine (CpG) DNA co&#8208;conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles with dendritic cells (DC)&#8208;targeting lipid films for co&#8208;delivering OVAp and CpG into cytosol and lysosomes of DCs to maximize their synergistic effects. The nanovaccine accumulated in the DCs of draining lymph nodes effectively increases the antigen&#8208;specific T cell response against tumor.








Abstract
Nanovaccines have emerged as promising alternatives or complements to conventional cancer treatments. Despite the progresses, specific co&#8208;delivery of antigen and adjuvant to their corresponding intracellular destinations for maximizing the activation of antitumor immune responses remains a challenge. Herein, a lipid&#8208;coated iron oxide nanoparticle is delivered as nanovaccine (IONP&#8208;C/O@LP) that can co&#8208;deliver peptide antigen and adjuvant (CpG DNA) into cytosol and lysosomes of dendritic cells (DCs) through both membrane fusion and endosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Such two&#8208;pronged cellular uptake pattern enables IONP&#8208;C/O@LP to synergistically activate immature DCs. Iron oxide nanoparticle also exhibits adjuvant effects by generating intracellular reactive oxygen species, which further promotes DC maturation. IONP&#8208;C/O@LP accumulated in the DCs of draining lymph nodes effectively increases the antigen&#8208;specific T cells in both tumor and spleen, inhibits tumor growth, and improves animal survival. Moreover, it is demonstrated that this nanovaccine is a general platform of delivering clinically relevant peptide antigens derived from human papilloma virus 16 to trigger antigen&#8208;specific immune responses in vivo.

         <title>Establishing Thermal Infusion Method for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile thermal infusion approach is used to construct the multilevel electrode structure based on the porous Cu host for Zn metal anodes. The composite anode regulates the Zn deposition and inhibits the side reactions due to the in situ Cu&#8211;Zn solid solution and ZnO layer, thus achieving long&#8208;cycling aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Metallic zinc (Zn) having low cost, high capacity, environmentally friendly features is considered to be an attractive anode material for aqueous energy storage devices. However, dendritic growth and severe side reactions restrict the development of Zn&#8208;metal anodes. Numerous 3D hosts are extensively explored to settle these issues, whereas the accessible prestoring of Zn metal into structured electrodes is challenging. Here, a thermal infusion strategy is first reported to create a stable composite Zn&#8208;based anode. Upon this melting&#8211;wetting&#8211;cooling process, the metallic Zn is densely and firmly encapsulated in the 3D skeleton, efficiently inhibiting the dendritic growth. Meanwhile, through in/ex situ tests, the formation of ZnO layer on the metallic Zn surface inhibits the hydrogen evolution reactions (1.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and passivation during cycling. Consequently, the electrode enables a long&#8208;cycling life of over 1000 cycles at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a symmetrical cell. The pouch cells pairing this novel anode and LiMn2O4 cathode maintain over 94 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity retention after 300 cycles. This research presents an innovative Zn anode structure and extendable prestoring metallic Zn method for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Vertical&#8208;Graphene&#8208;Reinforced Titanium Alloy Bipolar Plates in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A directly grown vertical graphene (VG) coating is demonstrated to reinforce Ti alloy bipolar plates in fuel cells. Thus, the interfacial contact resistance of as&#8208;fabricated VG&#8208;coated Ti alloy decreases by &#8776;100 times compared with bare Ti alloy and its corrosion rate reduces by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude in simulated proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) operating environments.








Abstract
The bipolar plate (BP) serves as one of the crucial components in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Among BP materials, metallic BPs are widely employed due to their outstanding comprehensive properties. However, the interfacial contact resistance (ICR) between BP and gas diffusion layer together with corrosion of metallic BP under acidic operating conditions degrades the performance and stability of PEMFCs. Herein, an approach is proposed for the surface reinforcement of titanium (Ti) alloy BPs, relying on a directly grown vertical graphene (VG) coating via the plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition method. Compared with bare Ti alloy, the corrosion rate of VG&#8208;coated Ti alloy reduces by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude in the simulated PEMFC operating environments and ICR decreases by &#8776;100 times, while its thermal conductivity improves by &#8776;20% and water contact angle increases by 68.1&#176;. The results can be interpreted that the unique structure of VG enables excellent electrical and thermal conduction in PEMFCs, and the highly hydrophobic VG coating suppresses the penetration of corrosive liquid as well as contributing to water management. This study opens a new opportunity to reinforce metallic surfaces by the robust and versatile VG coating for high&#8208;performance electrodes used in energy and catalyst applications.

Thus, the interfacial contact resistance of as-fabricated VG-coated Ti alloy decreases by &#8776;100 times compared with bare Ti alloy and its corrosion rate reduces by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude in simulated proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) operating environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bipolar plate (BP) serves as one of the crucial components in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Among BP materials, metallic BPs are widely employed due to their outstanding comprehensive properties. However, the interfacial contact resistance (ICR) between BP and gas diffusion layer together with corrosion of metallic BP under acidic operating conditions degrades the performance and stability of PEMFCs. Herein, an approach is proposed for the surface reinforcement of titanium (Ti) alloy BPs, relying on a directly grown vertical graphene (VG) coating via the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition method. Compared with bare Ti alloy, the corrosion rate of VG-coated Ti alloy reduces by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude in the simulated PEMFC operating environments and ICR decreases by &#8776;100 times, while its thermal conductivity improves by &#8776;20% and water contact angle increases by 68.1&#176;. The results can be interpreted that the unique structure of VG enables excellent electrical and thermal conduction in PEMFCs, and the highly hydrophobic VG coating suppresses the penetration of corrosive liquid as well as contributing to water management. This study opens a new opportunity to reinforce metallic surfaces by the robust and versatile VG coating for high-performance electrodes used in energy and catalyst applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Energy and Stable Subfreezing Aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 Batteries with Selective and Pseudocapacitive Zn&#8208;Ion Insertion in MnO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable cycling of experimentally verified unit level 148 Wh kg&#8722;1 aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 batteries is reported at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. This battery utilizes antifreezing aqueous Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte, and has selective Zn&#8208;ion insertion instead of the problematic proton insertion at subfreezing temperatures. The selective Zn&#8208;ion insertion is primarily pseudocapacitive, and delivers outstanding rate performance with 80% capacity retention for 1000 cycles.








Abstract
One major challenge of aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 batteries for practical applications is their unacceptable performance below freezing temperatures. Here the use of simple Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous electrolytes is described for all&#8208;weather Zn&#8211;MnO2 batteries even down to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. The symmetric, bulky ClO4&#8722; anion effectively disrupts hydrogen bonds between water molecules and provides intrinsic ion diffusion even while frozen, and enables &#8776;260 mAh g&#8722;1 on MnO2 cathodes at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C . It is identified that subfreezing cycling shifts the reaction mechanism on the MnO2 cathode from unstable H+ insertion to predominantly pseudocapacitive Zn2+ insertion, which converts MnO2 nanofibers into complicated zincated MnOx that are largely disordered and appeared as crumpled paper sheets. The Zn2+ insertion at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C is faster and much more stable than at 20&#160;&#176;C, and delivers &#8776;80% capacity retention for 1000 cycles without Mn2+ additives. In addition, simple Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte also enables a nearly fully reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C with &#8776;98% Coulombic efficiency. Zn&#8211;MnO2 prototypes with an experimentally verified unit energy density of 148 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive ratio of 1.5 and an electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio of 2.0 are further demonstrated.

         <title>High Efficiency of over 25% and Long Device Lifetime of over 500 h at 1000 nit in Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized tandem device of the multi&#8208;resonance type blue emitter achieves high external quantum efficiency over 25% and extremely long device lifetime of over 500&#160;h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and 30000&#160;h at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 up to 95% of initial luminance.








Abstract
In this study, a multiple resonance (MR) type blue emitter is synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for highly efficient and stable blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The MR blue fluorescent emitter has a di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl benzene substituent in the MR core structure to minimize quenching mechanisms by intermolecular interaction. The emitter shows a high photoluminescence quantum yield and small full width at half maximum of 22 nm, which realize high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.4% in the single unit OLED and device lifetime up to 95% of the initial luminance (LT95) of 208 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and over 10&#160;000 h at 100 cd m&#8722;2. The optimized tandem device of the new blue emitter achieves high EQE over 25% and extremely long LT95 of over 500&#160;h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and 30&#160;000 h at 100 cd m&#8722;2. The lifetime of this work is one of the best data of blue OLED lifetime reported in the literature.

         <title>Hierarchically Structured Black Gold Film with Ultrahigh Porosity for Solar Steam Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile dealloying strategy is proposed to fabricate the self&#8208;supporting black gold film with hierarchically porous structure and ultrahigh porosity. Owing to the unique nanoporous nanowire structure, varying nanogaps between the nanowires and massive microgaps, the nanoporous gold film enables efficient broadband absorption, excellent hydrophilicity and continuous water transport, thus achieving highly efficient solar steam generation.








Abstract
Plasmonic metals demonstrate significant potential for solar steam generation (SSG) because of their localized surface plasmon resonance effect. However, the inherently narrow absorption spectra of plasmonic metals significantly limit their applications. The fabrication of nanostructures is essential to achieve broadband solar absorption for high&#8208;efficiency vapor generation. Herein, a self&#8208;supporting black gold (Au) film with an ultrahigh porosity and a hierarchically porous structure is fabricated by formulating an extremely dilute Cu99Au1 precursor and controlling the dealloying process. In situ and ex situ characterizations reveal the dealloying mechanism of Cu99Au1 in a 1 m HNO3 solution as that involving the phase transformation of Cu(Au) &#8594; Au(Cu) &#8594; Au, giant volume shrinkage (&#8776;87%), structural evolution/coarsening of ligaments, and development of ultrahigh porosity (86.2%). The multiscale structure, consisting of ultrafine nanoporous nanowires, aligned nanogaps, and various microgaps, provide efficient broadband absorption over 300&#8211;2500&#160;nm, excellent hydrophilicity, and continuous water transport. In particular, the nanoporous black Au film shows high SSG performance with an evaporation rate of 1.51&#160;kg m&#8211;2 h&#8211;1 and a photothermal conversion efficiency of 94.5% under a light intensity of 1&#160;kW m&#8211;2. These findings demonstrate that the nanoporous Au film has great potential for clean water production and seawater desalination.

         <title>Rapidly and Repeatedly Reprogrammable Liquid Crystalline Elastomer via a Shape Memory Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;phase LCE network with a crystalline transition temperature above the liquid crystalline transition temperature is designed. The crystalline phase serves as a built&#8208;in physical &#8220;alignment frame&#8221; via its shape memory function. Consequently, the actuation behaviors of the liquid crystal network can be conveniently and repeatedly programmed/reprogrammed within 10 s.








Abstract
Realization of muscle&#8208;like actuation for a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) requires mesogen alignment, which is typically achieved/fixed chemically during the synthesis. Post&#8208;synthesis regulation of the alignment in a convenient and repeatable manner is highly desirable yet challenging. Here, a dual&#8208;phase LCE network is designed and synthesized with a crystalline melting transition above a liquid crystalline transition. The crystalline phase can serve as an &#8220;alignment frame&#8221; to fix any mechanical deformation via a shape memory mechanism, leading to corresponding mesogen alignment in the liquid crystalline phase. The alignment can be erased by melting, which can be the starting point for reprogramming. This strategy that relies on a physical shape memory transition for mesogen alignment permits repeated reprogramming in a timescale of seconds, in stark contrast to typical methods. It further leads to unusual versatility in designing 3D printed LCE with unlimited programmable actuation modes.

The crystalline phase serves as a built-in physical &#8220;alignment frame&#8221; via its shape memory function. Consequently, the actuation behaviors of the liquid crystal network can be conveniently and repeatedly programmed/reprogrammed within 10 s.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realization of muscle-like actuation for a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) requires mesogen alignment, which is typically achieved/fixed chemically during the synthesis. Post-synthesis regulation of the alignment in a convenient and repeatable manner is highly desirable yet challenging. Here, a dual-phase LCE network is designed and synthesized with a crystalline melting transition above a liquid crystalline transition. The crystalline phase can serve as an &#8220;alignment frame&#8221; to fix any mechanical deformation via a shape memory mechanism, leading to corresponding mesogen alignment in the liquid crystalline phase. The alignment can be erased by melting, which can be the starting point for reprogramming. This strategy that relies on a physical shape memory transition for mesogen alignment permits repeated reprogramming in a timescale of seconds, in stark contrast to typical methods. It further leads to unusual versatility in designing 3D printed LCE with unlimited programmable actuation modes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pre&#8208;Buried Additive for Cross&#8208;Layer Modification in Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 22%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up infiltration method using HCOONH4 as pre&#8208;buried additive in SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) enables a cross&#8208;layer defect manipulation throughout the SnO2 ETL, perovskite layer, and their interface, along with a significantly reduced residual stress within perovskite film. As a result of the cross&#8208;layer treatment, a record power conversion efficiency of 22.37% (21.90% certified) is achieved on the optimized flexible perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have shown superior potentials in flexible photovoltaics due to their soft and high power&#8208;to&#8208;weight nature. However, interfacial residual stress and lattice mismatch due to the large deformation of flexible substrates have greatly limited the performance of flexible perovskite solar cells (F&#8208;PSCs). Here, ammonium formate (HCOONH4) is used as a pre&#8208;buried additive in electron transport layer (ETL) to realize a bottom&#8208;up infiltration process for an in situ, integral modification of ETL, perovskite layer, and their interface. The HCOONH4 treatment leads to an enhanced electron extraction in ETL, relaxed residual strain and micro&#8208;strain in perovskite film, along with reduced defect densities within these layers. As a result, a top power conversion efficiency of 22.37% and a certified 21.9% on F&#8208;PSCs are achieved, representing the highest performance reported so far. This work links the critical connection between multilayer mechanics/defect profiles of ETL&#8208;perovskite structure and device performance, thus providing meaningful scientific direction to further narrowing the efficiency gap between F&#8208;PSCs and rigid&#8208;substrate counterparts.

         <title>Exchange Bias in Molecule/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals Heterostructures via Spinterface Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinterface effects are demonstrated in a hybrid van der Waals heterostructure composed of a CoPc film interfaced with a layered ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. The interface interactions introduce an exchange bias field in Fe3GeTe2, which is among the strongest reported for layered magnetic materials. The results demonstrate the potential of molecular functionalization for tailoring the magnetic properties of layered materials.








Abstract
The exfoliation of layered magnetic materials generates atomically thin flakes characterized by an ultrahigh surface sensitivity, which makes their magnetic properties tunable via external stimuli, such as electrostatic gating and proximity effects. Another powerful approach to engineer magnetic materials is molecular functionalization, generating hybrid interfaces with tailored magnetic interactions, called spinterfaces. However, spinterface effects have not yet been explored on layered magnetic materials. Here, the emergence of spinterface effects is demonstrated at the interface between flakes of the prototypical layered magnetic metal Fe3GeTe2 and thin films of Co&#8208;phthalocyanine. Magnetotransport measurements show that the molecular layer induces a magnetic exchange bias in Fe3GeTe2, indicating that the unpaired spins in Co&#8208;phthalocyanine develop antiferromagnetic ordering and pin the magnetization reversal of Fe3GeTe2 via magnetic proximity. The effect is strongest for a Fe3GeTe2 thickness of 20 nm, for which the exchange bias field reaches &#8722;840 Oe at 10 K and is measurable up to &#8776;110 K. This value compares very favorably with previous exchange bias fields reported for Fe3GeTe2 in all&#8208;inorganic van der Waals heterostructures, demonstrating the potential of molecular functionalization to tailor the magnetism of van der Waals layered materials.

In this work, a gesture recognition wristband for virtual reality application with excellent prediction accuracy and good wearing experience is manufactured. This easy&#8208;to&#8208;wear wristband can translate and broadcast sign language words in real time with a prediction accuracy over 92.6%. And the gesture recognition wristband can also be designed as a special command input device.








Abstract
Virtual reality is a brand&#8208;new technology that can be applied extensively. To realize virtual reality, certain types of human&#8211;computer interaction equipment are necessary. Existing virtual reality technologies often rely on cameras, data gloves, game pads, and other equipment. These equipment are either bulky, inconvenient to carry and use, or expensive to popularize. Therefore, the development of a convenient and low&#8208;cost high&#8208;precision human&#8211;computer interaction device can contribute positively to the development of virtual reality technology. In this study, a gesture recognition wristband that can realize a full keyboard and multicommand input is developed. The wristband is convenient to wear, low in cost, and does not affect other daily operations of the hand. This wristband is based on physiological anatomy as well as aided by active sensor and machine learning technology; it can achieve a maximum accuracy of 92.6% in recognizing 26 letters. This wristband offers broad application prospects in the fields of gesture command recognition, assistive devices for the disabled, and wearable electronics.

         <title>PET&#8208;CT Imaging of Polymeric Nanoparticle Tumor Accumulation in Patients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the docetaxel&#8208;entrapping polymeric nanoparticle CPC634 is radiolabeled with 89Zr and its potential as clinical tool for patients selection before starting treatment is evaluated. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging of seven patients with solid tumors reveals that a low diagnostic dose of 89Zr&#8208;CPC634 accurately reflects on&#8208;treatment tumor accumulation which opens the possibility for patient stratification in cancer nanomedicine with polymeric nanoparticles.








Abstract
Several FDA/EMA&#8208;approved nanomedicines have demonstrated improved pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles compared to their conventional chemotherapeutic counterparts. The next step to increase therapeutic efficacy depends on tumor accumulation, which can be highly heterogeneous. A clinical tool for patient stratification is urgently awaited. Therefore, a docetaxel&#8208;entrapping polymeric nanoparticle (89Zr&#8208;CPC634) is radiolabeled, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging is performed in seven patients with solid tumors with two different doses of CPC634: an on&#8208;treatment (containing 60 mg m&#8722;2 docetaxel) and a diagnostic (1&#8211;2 mg docetaxel) dose (NCT03712423). Pharmacokinetic half&#8208;life for 89Zr&#8208;CPC634 is mean 97.0 &#177; 14.4 h on&#8208;treatment, and 62.4 &#177; 12.9 h for the diagnostic dose (p&#160;= 0.003). At these doses accumulation is observed in 46% and 41% of tumor lesions with a median accumulation in positive lesions 96 h post&#8208;injection of 4.94 and 4.45%IA kg&#8722;1 (p&#160;= 0.91), respectively. In conclusion, PET/CT imaging with a diagnostic dose of 89Zr&#8208;CPC634 accurately reflects on&#8208;treatment tumor accumulation and thus opens the possibility for patient stratification in cancer nanomedicine with polymeric nanoparticles.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Scale Approach for Modeling the Optical Response of Molecular Materials Inside Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical cavities filled with molecular materials are under intense experimental investigation. The theoretical description of such systems is challenging because physics, chemistry, and material science are intertwined together across spatial scales ranging from &#229;ngstr&#246;ms to millimeters. A new methodology uses quantum&#8208;chemistry calculations to predict the optical response of devices such as cavities filled with molecular materials.








Abstract
The recent fabrication advances in nanoscience and molecular materials point toward a new era where material properties are tailored in silico for target applications. To fully realize this potential, accurate and computationally efficient theoretical models are needed for: a) the computer&#8208;aided design and optimization of new materials before their fabrication; and b) the accurate interpretation of experiments. The development of such theoretical models is a challenging multi&#8208;disciplinary problem where physics, chemistry, and material science are intertwined across spatial scales ranging from the molecular to the device level, that is, from &#229;ngstr&#246;ms to millimeters. In photonic applications, molecular materials are often placed inside optical cavities. Together with the sought&#8208;after enhancement of light&#8208;molecule interactions, the cavities bring additional complexity to the modeling of such devices. Here, a multi&#8208;scale approach that, starting from ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations, can compute the electromagnetic response of macroscopic devices such as cavities containing molecular materials is presented. Molecular time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory calculations are combined with the efficient transition matrix based solution of Maxwell's equations. Some of the capabilities of the approach are demonstrated by simulating surface metal&#8208;organic frameworks &#8208;in&#8208;cavity and J&#8208;aggregates&#8208;in&#8208;cavity systems that have been recently investigated experimentally, and providing a refined understanding of the experimental results.

Antibody&#8208;Decorated Nanocrystals
Antibody&#8208;targeted nanoparticles are increasingly important for precision medicine. However, it is still challenging to attach antibodies to nanomaterials in a controlled way. In article number 2106607, Karen Alt, Christoph E. Hagemeyer, Paolo Falcaro, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a one&#8208;step synthesis of oriented antibody&#8208;decorated nanocrystals (in blue). The crystallization only occurs around the antibody's constant region (in red&#8208;yellow) leaving the binding regions free for target engagement. This work has broad potential for diagnostic imaging and targeted drug delivery.

Bioparticle Imaging and Analysis
In article number 2110003, Dae&#8208;Hyeong Kim, Young Min Song, and co&#8208;workers propose an intuitive and robust approach for the label&#8208;free bright&#8208;field imaging and facile quantification of bioparticles using a Gires&#8211;Tournois immunoassay platform (GTIP). The particle distribution and density on the surface of the resonator are readily analyzed through 2D raster&#8208;scanning&#8208;based chromaticity analysis.

Corneal Cross&#8208;Linking
ln article number 2109865, Rongrong Gao, Jinhai Huang, Xingtao Zhou, and co&#8208;workers report novel engineering of hydrangea&#8208;like RF@ZIF&#8208;8 microsphere composites with outstanding trans&#8208;epithelial corneal cross&#8208;linking (TE&#8208;CXL) efficacy, suggesting a promising nanomedicine strategy. The described use of the metal&#8211;organic framework as carrier to transfer hydrophilic negatively charged Riboflavin&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate (RF) molecules to the hydrophobic corneal epithelium, with excellent TE&#8208;CXL efficacy, may open up a new field of CXL.

         <title>Ultrathin Membranes for Separations: A New Era Driven by Advanced Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin membranes have undergone rapid development for fast and precise separations in the past 15 years. Here, a review is given on the assembly, structure, materials, and transport of sub&#8208;50&#160;nm membranes, with a focus on their fabrication&#8208;structure&#8208;transport relationships. Applications for liquid and gas separations are analyzed and compared to provide insights for future advances in high&#8208;performance membranes.








Abstract
Ultrathin membranes are at the forefront of membrane research, offering great opportunities in revolutionizing separations with ultrafast transport. Driven by advanced nanomaterials and manufacturing technology, tremendous progresses are made over the last 15 years in the fabrications and applications of sub&#8208;50&#160;nm membranes. Here, an overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultrathin membranes is first introduced, followed by a summary of the fabrication techniques with an emphasis on how to realize such extremely low thickness. Then, different types of ultrathin membranes, categorized based on their structures, that is, network, laminar, or framework structures, are discussed with a focus on the interplays among structure, fabrication methods, and separation performances. Recent research and development trends are highlighted. Meanwhile, the performances and applications of current ultrathin membranes for representative separations (gas separation and liquid separation) are thoroughly analyzed and compared. Last, the challenges in material design, structure construction, and coordination are given, in order to fully realize the potential of ultrathin membranes and facilitate the translation from scientific achievements to industrial productions.

         <title>Stiffness Variable Polymers Comprising Phase&#8208;Changing Side&#8208;Chains: Material Syntheses and Application Explorations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers comprising side chains undergoing reversible crystallization and melting in a narrow temperature span have been synthesized for stiffness control. A modulus change of more than 1000&#8208;fold can be achieved. Larger stiffness changes can be obtained. The phase&#8208;changing can additionally be exploited for reversible adhesions, bistable actuation, and opacity modulation. Important applications will be discussed.








Abstract
Stiffness variable materials have been applied in a variety of engineering fields that require adaptation, automatic modulation, and morphing because of their unique property to switch between a rigid, load&#8208;bearing state and a soft, compliant state. Stiffness variable polymers comprising phase&#8208;changing side&#8208;chains (s&#8208;SVPs) have densely grafted, highly crystallizable long alkyl side&#8208;chains in a crosslinked network. Such a bottlebrush network&#8208;like structure gives rise to rigidity modulation as a result of the reversible crystallization and melting of the side chains. The corresponding modulus changes can be more than 1000&#8208;fold within a narrow temperature span, from &#8776;102&#160;MPa to &#8776;102&#160;kPa or lower. Other important properties of the s&#8208;SVP, such as stretchability, optical transmittance, and adhesion, can also be altered. This work reviews the underlying molecular mechanisms in the s&#8208;SVP's, discusses the material's structure&#8211;property relationship, and summarizes important applications explored so far, including reversible shape transformation, bistable electromechanical transduction, optical modulation, and reversible adhesion.

&lt;p&gt;Polymers comprising side chains undergoing reversible crystallization and melting in a narrow temperature span have been synthesized for stiffness control. A modulus change of more than 1000-fold can be achieved. Larger stiffness changes can be obtained. The phase-changing can additionally be exploited for reversible adhesions, bistable actuation, and opacity modulation. Important applications will be discussed.

         <title>Advances in High&#8208;Performance Autonomous Energy and Self&#8208;Powered Sensing Textiles with Novel 3D Fabric Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart textiles with autonomous energy supply and self&#8208;powered sensing abilities are extremely important for the future Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things and artificial intelligence. The high&#8208;performance textile triboelectric nanogenerators with novel 3D fabrics are comprehensively reviewed by focusing on representative structural classifications. The remarkable superiorities and potential challenges of 3D fabrics are also prospectively discussed in the end.








Abstract
The seamless integration of emerging triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology with traditional wearable textile materials has given birth to the next&#8208;generation smart textiles, i.e., textile TENGs, which will play a vital role in the era of Internet of Things and artificial intelligences. However, low output power and inferior sensing ability have largely limited the development of textile TENGs. Among various approaches to improve the output and sensing performance, such as material modification, structural design, and environmental management, a 3D fabric structural scheme is a facile, efficient, controllable, and scalable strategy to increase the effective contact area for contact electrification of textile TENGs without cumbersome material processing and service area restrictions. Herein, the recent advances of the current reported textile TENGs with 3D fabric structures are comprehensively summarized and systematically analyzed in order to clarify their superiorities over 1D fiber and 2D fabric structures in terms of power output and pressure sensing. The forward&#8208;looking integration abilities of the 3D fabrics are also discussed at the end. It is believed that the overview and analysis of textile TENGs with distinctive 3D fabric structures will contribute to the development and realization of high&#8208;power output micro/nanowearable power sources and high&#8208;quality self&#8208;powered wearable sensors.

         <title>Wearable Pressure Sensors for Pulse Wave Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current advances of wearable pressure sensors for human pulse wave monitoring are presented, with a focus on the transduction mechanism, microengineering structures, and related applications in pulse wave monitoring and cardiovascular condition assessment. The biomechanics of arterial pulse waves, the working mechanism of various wearable pressure sensors, as well as opportunities and challenges are also concluded.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide. The rapid development of flexible sensing technologies and wearable pressure sensors have attracted keen research interest and have been widely used for long&#8208;term and real&#8208;time cardiovascular status monitoring. Owing to compelling characteristics, including light weight, wearing comfort, and high sensitivity to pulse pressures, physiological pulse waveforms can be precisely and continuously monitored by flexible pressure sensors for wearable health monitoring. Herein, an overview of wearable pressure sensors for human pulse wave monitoring is presented, with a focus on the transduction mechanism, microengineering structures, and related applications in pulse wave monitoring and cardiovascular condition assessment. The conceptualizations and methods for the acquisition of physiological and pathological information related to the cardiovascular system are outlined. The biomechanics of arterial pulse waves and the working mechanism of various wearable pressure sensors, including triboelectric, piezoelectric, magnetoelastic, piezoresistive, capacitive, and optical sensors, are also subject to systematic debate. Exemple applications of pulse wave measurement based on microengineering structured devices are then summarized. Finally, a discussion of the opportunities and challenges that wearable pressure sensors face, as well as their potential as a wearable intelligent system for personalized healthcare is given in conclusion.

         <title>Quantifying Efficiency Limitations in All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells is reviewed by performing a detailed meta&#8208;analysis of key performance parameters. Using a consistent way of determining the bandgap, a unified approach is adopted for analyzing performance losses in perovskite solar cells based on breaking down the losses into several figures of merit representing recombination losses, resistive losses, and optical losses.








Abstract
While halide perovskites have excellent optoelectronic properties, their poor stability is a major obstacle toward commercialization. There is a strong interest to move away from organic A&#8208;site cations such as methylammonium and formamidinium toward Cs with the aim of improving thermal stability of the perovskite layers. While the optoelectronic properties and the device performance of Cs&#8208;based all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskites are very good, they are still trailing behind those of perovskites that use organic cations. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of all&#8208;inorganic perovskites for photovoltaic applications is reviewed by performing detailed meta&#8208;analyses of key performance parameters on the cell and material level. Key material properties such as carrier mobilities, external photoluminescence quantum efficiency, and photoluminescence lifetime are discussed and what is known about defect tolerance in all&#8208;inorganic is compared relative to hybrid (organic&#8211;inorganic) perovskites. Subsequently, a unified approach is adopted for analyzing performance losses in perovskite solar cells based on breaking down the losses into several figures of merit representing recombination losses, resistive losses, and optical losses. Based on this detailed loss analysis, guidelines are eventually developed for future performance improvement of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells.

         <title>MXenes for Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 21, May 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in employing MXenes in energy harvesting applications is summarized. Different energy sources, including solar, ultrasound, electrokinetic, salinity&#8208;gradient, piezoelectric, triboelectric, thermoelectric, and humidity energy, are discussed separately. The future challenges and promising directions of MXene research for energy harvesting are presented.








Abstract
Energy harvesting modules play an increasingly important role in the development of autonomous self&#8208;powered microelectronic devices. MXenes (i.e., 2D transition metal carbide/nitride) have recently emerged as promising candidates for energy applications due to their excellent electronic conductivity, large specific surface area, and tunable properties. Herein, a perspective on using MXenes to harvest energy from various sources in the environment is presented. First, the characteristics of MXenes that facilitate energy capturing are systematically introduced and the preparation strategies of MXenes and their derived nanostructures tailored toward such applications are summarized. Subsequently, the harvesting mechanism of different energy sources (e.g., solar energy, thermoelectric energy, triboelectric energy, piezoelectric energy, salinity&#8208;gradient energy, electrokinetic energy, ultrasound energy, and humidity energy) are discussed. Then, the recent progress of MXene&#8208;based nanostructures in energy harvesting, as well as their applications, is introduced. Finally, opinions on the existing challenges and future directions of MXene&#8208;based nanostructure for energy harvesting are presented.

         <title>Short&#8208;Range Diffusion Enables General Synthesis of Medium&#8208;Entropy Alloy Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Medium&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (MEAAs) with the advantages of both multimetallic alloys and aerogels are promising new materials in catalytic and mechanical applications. However, limited by the immiscible behavior of different metals, it is still a grand challenge to achieve single&#8208;phase MEAAs using current synthetic methods. Herein, we report a general strategy for the preparation of ultralight three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous MEAAs with the lowest density of 39.3&#160;mg cm&#8722;3 among the metal materials and a very high porosity of 99.5% through combining the auto&#8208;combustion method and subsequent low&#8208;temperature reduction procedures. The homogenous mixing of precursors at ionic level makes the short&#8208;range diffusion of metal atoms possible to drive the formation of single&#8208;phase MEAAs. As a proof of concept in catalysis, as&#8208;synthesized Ni50Co15Fe30Cu5 MEAAs exhibit a high mass activity of 1.62 A mg&#8722;1 and specific activity of 132.24&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 towards methanol oxidation reactions, much higher than those of the low&#8208;entropy counterparts. In&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies reveal that the highly selective CO2&#8208;emission&#8208;free conversion of methanol to formate over MEAA catalysts. We also demonstrate that the methanol&#8208;oxidation&#8208;assisted MEAAs&#8208;based water electrolyzer can achieve a low cell voltage of 1.476&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 173&#160;mV lower than that of traditional alkaline water electrolyzer, and obtain value&#8208;added formate at anode to realize the sustainable H2 generation at cathode. This work lays the foundation for the design of advanced 3D MEAAs and broadens the electrocatalytic application of multimetallic MEAAs.

         <title>Phonon Symphony of Stacked of Multilayer and Weakly Bond Lowering Lattice Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling of lattice vibrations to obtain intrinsic low thermal conductivity play a critical role in thermal management of electronic and photonic devices, energy converters and thermal insulation, which necessitates exploring new compounds and a thorough understanding of their chemical structure, bonding and lattice dynamics. Herein, we demonstrated a new chalcogenide, Ga6Cr5Se16, shows intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity, which crystallizes in the monoclinic phase (C2/m) with the stacked inversed GaSe4 layers (g&#8217;), closed&#8208;packed Cr3+Se6 layers (c), GaSe4 layers (g) and loosely&#8208;stacked Cr2+Se6 layers (c&#8217;) along the c axis. In this structure, a wide variety of chemical bonding arrange in each layer, such as covalent Ga&#8211;Se, covalent Cr3+&#8211;Se, and weaker Cr2+&#8211;Se bonding, which endue it a large phonon symphony by strong coupling of soft acoustic and low&#8208;lying optical phonons. As a result, Ga6Cr5Se16 realizes an intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.79 W/m/K at 323 K, which is almost four times, or twice lower than that of Cr3Se4 (2.95 W/m/K), or Cr2Se3 (1.56 W/m/K), Ga2Se3 (1.36 W/m/K) at 323 K, respectively. These insights will offer comprehensive understanding of the phonon propagation in complex layered chalcogenides, also shed useful light on future design of low lattice thermal conductivity solids.

         <title>Programming Cellular Alignment in Engineered Cardiac Tissue via Bioprinting Anisotropic Organ Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned cardiac tissues are produced by 3D bioprinting a densely cellular ink composed of anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs). The aOBBs undergo shear&#8208;induced alignment along the print path when extruded through a tapered nozzle. This method enables programmable control over cardiac tissue alignment across multiple scales.








Abstract
The ability to replicate the 3D myocardial architecture found in human hearts is a grand challenge. Here, the fabrication of aligned cardiac tissues via bioprinting anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs) composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC&#8208;CMs) is reported. A bioink composed of contractile cardiac aOBBs is first generated and aligned cardiac tissue sheets with linear, spiral, and chevron features are printed. Next, aligned cardiac macrofilaments are printed, whose contractile force and conduction velocity increase over time and exceed the performance of spheroid&#8208;based cardiac tissues. Finally, the ability to spatially control the magnitude and direction of contractile force by printing cardiac sheets with different aOBB alignment is highlighted. This research opens new avenues to generating functional cardiac tissue with high cell density and complex cellular alignment.

         <title>Real&#8208;Space Crystal Structure Analysis by Low&#8208;Dose Focal&#8208;Series TEM Imaging of Organic Materials with Near&#8208;Atomic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methodology, low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series reconstruction (LD&#8208;FSR), enables near&#8208;atomic resolution of 1.6 &#197;. This method allows the distinction between co&#8208;existing organic polymorphs, and observation of crystal defects and atoms. Moreover, a new copper phthalocyanine polymorph (&#955;&#8208;CuPc) is identified using LD&#8208;FSR, resulting in real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation.








Abstract
Structural analysis of beam&#8208;sensitive materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) represents a significant challenge, as high&#8208;resolution TEM (HRTEM) requires high electron doses that limit its applicability to stable inorganic materials. Beam&#8208;sensitive materials, e.g., organic crystals, must be imaged under low dose conditions, leading to problematic contrast interpretation and loss of fine structural details. Here, HRTEM imaging of organic crystalline materials with near&#8208;atomic resolution of up to 1.6 &#197; is described, which enables real&#8208;space studies of crystal structures, as well as observation of co&#8208;existing polymorphs, crystal defects, and atoms. This is made possible by a low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series reconstruction methodology, which provides HRTEM images where contrast reflects true object structure and can be performed on contemporary cryo&#8208;EM instruments available to many research institutions. Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), a perchlorinated analogue of CuPc, and indigo crystalline films are imaged. In the case of indigo crystals, co&#8208;existing polymorphs and individual atoms (carbonyl oxygen) can be observed. In the case of CuPc, several polymorphs are observed, including a new one, for which the crystal structure is found based on direct in&#8208;focus imaging, accomplishing real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation. Such direct analysis can be transformative for structure studies of organic materials.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surfaces with adaptive adhesion and stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The dynamic application environments of superhydrophobic surfaces, such as in the manufacturing, chemical, and garment industries, require the fast adaptiveness of the surfaces to their surroundings. Despite the progress in materials and structural design of superhydrophobic surfaces, simultaneously achieving high superhydrophobic stability and low adhesion by traditional design is still challenging. Here, we demonstrate a liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surface with self&#8208;adjustable solid&#8208;liquid stability and adhesion when reacting to the dynamic environmental requirements. To understand the underlying adaptive processes, we imaged the liquid impalement dynamics in three dimensions by confocal microscope and measured the stability and superhydrophobicity in varied systems. We envision our design strategy of liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surfaces with dynamic anti&#8208;infiltration capability could stimulate the development of stable superhydrophobicity under complex wetting conditions.

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained Palladium Nanosheets for Synthetic Catalytic Therapy and Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Palladium nanosheets (Pd NSs) are well&#8208;investigated photothermal therapy (PTT) agents, but their catalytic potential for tumor therapy has been underexplored owing to the inactive dominant (111) facets. Herein, lattice tensile strain is introduced by surface reconstruction to activate the inert surface, endowing the strained Pd NSs (SPd NSs) with photodynamic, catalase&#8208;like and peroxidase&#8208;like properties. Tensile strain promoting the photodynamic and enzyme&#8208;like activities is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Compared with Pd NSs, SPd NSs exhibit lower photothermal effect, but &#8764;5 times higher tumor inhibition rate. This work calls for further study to activate nanomaterials by strain engineering and surface reconstruction for catalytic therapy of tumors.

         <title>Interface Modulated Resistive Switching in Mo&#8208;irradiated ReS2 for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Coupling charge impurity scattering effects and charge carrier modulation by doping can offer intriguing opportunities for atomic&#8208;level control of resistive switching (RS). Nonetheless, such effects have remained unexplored for memristive applications based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials. Here we report a facile approach to transform a RS&#8208;inactive rhenium disulfide (ReS2) into an effective switching material through interfacial modulation induced by Mo&#8208;irradiation doping. Using ReS2 as a model system, we unveil a unique RS mechanism based on the formation/dissolution of metallic &#946;&#8208;ReO2 filament across the defective ReS2 interface during the set/reset process. Through simple interfacial modulation, ReS2 of various thicknesses are switchable by modulating Mo irradiation period. Besides, the Mo&#8208;irradiated ReS2 memristor further exhibits a bipolar non&#8208;volatile switching ratio of nearly two orders of magnitude, programmable multilevel resistance states, and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the fabricated device could achieve a high MNIST learning accuracy of 91% under a non&#8208;identical pulse train. Our findings manifest the potential for modulating resistive switching in RS&#8208;inactive 2D materials via the unique doping&#8208;induced charged impurity scattering property.

         <title>Morphology Tuned Pt3Ge Accelerates Water Dissociation to Industrial Standard Hydrogen Production over a wide pH Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The discovery of novel materials for industrial standard hydrogen production is the present need considering the global energy infrastructure. We introduce a novel electrocatalyst, Pt3Ge, engineered with a desired crystallographic facet (202) accelerates hydrogen production by water electrolysis and records industrially desired operational stability compared to the commercial catalyst platinum. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) exhibits low overpotential of 21.7 mV (24.6 mV for Pt/C) and 92 mV for 10 mA/cm2 and 200 mA/cm2 current density, respectively in 0.5M H2SO4. It also exhibits remarkable stability of 15,000 accelerated degradation tests cycles (5000 for Pt/C) and exceptional durability of 500 h (@10 mA/cm2) in acidic media. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) also displayed low overpotential of 96 mV for 10 mA/cm2 current density in the alkaline medium, rationalizing its hydrogen production ability over a wide pH range required commercial operations. Long&#8208;term durability (&gt;75 h in alkaline media) with the industrial level current density (&gt;500 mA/cm2) has been demonstrated by utilizing the electrochemical flow reactor. The driving force behind this stupendous performance of Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) has been envisaged by mapping the reaction mechanism, active sites and charge transfer kinetics via controlled electrochemical experiments, ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy further corroborated by first principles calculations.

         <title>Universal Dynamic Liquid Interface for Healing Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method of creating a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is launched by reinforcing the defective surface and grain boundaries of perovskite film with nonvolatile 2&#8208;bromonaphthalene (BN) with a low melting point of 53&#8211;58&#160;&#176;C. Different from static interfaces, the fluid characteristic originating from the easy solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of the DHI not only reinforces management of defect passivation and energetics modification, but also enables effective defect real&#8208;time self&#8208;healing. High efficiencies are thus achieved for popular PSCs up to 12.05% (CsPbIBr2), 14.14% (CsPbI2Br), and 23.37% (FA0.92MA0.08PbI3).








Abstract
Healing charge&#8208;selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies are often static by one&#8208;off formation of a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, defects formed in&#8208;service will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is presented by incorporating a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Arising from the reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, the DHI boosts the PCE to 12.05% for an all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 solar cell and 14.14% for a CsPbI2Br cell, as well as 23.37% for an FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium) cell. The solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of DHI at elevated temperature causes a longitudinal infiltration into the bulk perovskite film to maximize the charge extraction, passivate defects at grain boundaries, and suppress ion migration. Furthermore, the stability is remarkably enhanced under air, heat, and persistent light&#8208;irradiation conditions, paving a universal strategy for advanced perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronics.

         <title>Studying Complex Evolution of Hyperelastic Materials under External Field Stimuli using Artificial Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Features in a Small&#8208;Scale Dataset</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear mechanical properties of hyperelastic materials can be viewed as responses of materials to external serial stimuli. A convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory (CBLSTM) model with spatiotemporal features is used to capture the complex evolution of structures and properties of materials under external field stimuli and to design materials with excellent performance via taking full advantage of data information even in a small&#8208;scale dataset.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;learning (DL) methods, in consideration of their excellence in dealing with highly complex structure&#8211;performance relationships for materials, are expected to become a new design paradigm for breakthroughs in material performance. However, in most cases, it is impractical to collect massive&#8208;scale experimental data or open&#8208;source theoretical databases to support training DL models with sufficient prediction accuracy. In a dataset consisting of 483 porous silicone rubber observations generated via ink&#8208;writing additive manufacturing, this work demonstrates that constructing low&#8208;dimensional, accurate descriptors is the prerequisite for obtaining high&#8208;precision DL models based on small experimental datasets. On this basis, a unique convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory model with spatiotemporal features extraction capability is designed, whose hierarchical learning mechanism further reduces the requirement for the amount of data by taking full advantage of data information. The proposed approach can be expected as a powerful tool for innovative material design on small experimental datasets, which can also be used to explore the evolutionary mechanisms of the structures and properties of materials under complex working conditions.

         <title>The Non&#8208;Classical Crystallization Mechanism of a Composite Biogenic Guanine Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spectacular colors and visual phenomena in animals are produced by light interference from highly reflective guanine crystals. Little is known about how organisms regulate crystal morphology to tune the optics of these systems. By following guanine crystal formation in developing spiders, we elucidate a crystallization mechanism. Guanine crystallization is a &#8220;non&#8208;classical&#8221;, multi&#8208;step process involving a progressive ordering of states. Crystallization begins with nucleation of partially ordered nanogranules from a disordered precursor phase. Growth proceeds by orientated attachment of the nanogranules into platelets which coalesce into single crystals, via progressive relaxation of structural defects. Despite their prismatic morphology, the platelet texture is retained in the final crystals, which are composites of crystal lamellae and interlamellar sheets. Interactions between the macromolecular sheets and the planar face of guanine appear to direct nucleation, favoring platelet formation. These findings provide insights on how organisms control the morphology and optical properties of molecular crystals.

         <title>Fabrication of Bragg Mirrors by Multilayer Inkjet Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bragg mirrors are widely applied in optical and photonic devices due to their capability of light management. However, the fabrication of Bragg mirrors is mainly accomplished by physical and chemical vapor deposition processes, which are costly and do not allow for lateral patterning. We here report for the first time the fabrication of Bragg mirrors by fully inkjet printing. The photonic bandgap of Bragg mirrors is tailored by adjusting the number of bilayers in the stack and the layer thickness via simply varying printing parameters. An ultra&#8208;high reflectance of 99% is achieved with the devices consisting of ten bilayers only, and the central wavelength of Bragg mirrors is tuned from visible into near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Inkjet printing allows for fabricating Bragg mirrors on various substrates (e.g., glass and foils), in different sizes and variable lateral patterns. The printed Bragg mirrors not only exhibit a high reflection at designed wavelengths but also show an outstanding homogeneity in color over a large area. Our approach thus enables additive manufacturing for various applications ranging from microscale photonic elements to enhanced functionality and aesthetics in large&#8208;area displays and solar technologies.

         <title>Unraveling Thermodynamic and Kinetic Contributions to the Stability of Doped Nanocrystalline Alloys using Nanometallic Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by modeling informed selection of the Mo&#8211;Au system, evolving grain boundary segregation behavior is explored through in situ electron microscopy thermal aging experiments on nanometallic multilayers. Isolation of the underlying stability mechanisms is accomplished by mapping the Au distribution with temperature, which, through comparison with thermodynamic predictions, collectively demonstrates the segregation states responsible for temperature&#8208;dependent stability transitions.








Abstract
Targeted doping of grain boundaries is widely pursued as a pathway for combating thermal instabilities in nanocrystalline metals. However, certain dopants predicted to produce grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;segregated nanocrystalline configurations instead form small nanoprecipitates at elevated temperatures that act to kinetically inhibit grain growth. Here, thermodynamic modeling is implemented to select the Mo&#8211;Au system for exploring the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to nanostructure stability. Using nanoscale multilayers and in situ transmission electron microscopy thermal aging, evolving segregation states and the corresponding phase transitions are mapped with temperature. The microstructure is shown to evolve through a transformation at lower homologous temperatures (&lt;600&#160;&#176;C) where solute atoms cluster and segregate to the grain boundaries, consistent with predictions from thermodynamic models. An increase in temperature to 800&#160;&#176;C is accompanied by coarsening of the grain structure via grain boundary migration but with multiple pinning events uncovered between migrating segments of the grain boundary and local solute clustering. Direct comparison between the thermodynamic predictions and experimental observations of microstructure evolution thus demonstrates a transition from thermodynamically preferred to kinetically inhibited nanocrystalline stability and provides a general framework for decoupling contributions to complex stability transitions while simultaneously targeting a dominant thermal stability regime.

         <title>Effective Passivation with Self&#8208;Organized Molecules for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecules with a planar molecular skeleton exhibit effective defect&#8208;passivation capability for perovskite photovoltaics, contributed by their ordered intermolecular arrangement and well&#8208;matched size with the perovskite lattice. The passivators spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adherent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which enables the best device yield in&#8208;lab efficiency of 25.05%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25% over the past decade and effective passivation for the interface with high trap density plays a significant role in this process. Here, two organic molecules are studied as passivators, and it is demonstrated that an advantageous molecular geometry and intermolecular ordering, aside from the functional moieties, are of great significance for effective and extensive passivation. Besides, the passivation molecules spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adjacent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which greatly reduces defect&#8208;assisted recombination throughout the whole perovskite/SnO2 interface. The champion device yields an in&#8208;lab PCE of 25.05% (certified 24.39%). The investigation provides a more comprehensive understanding of passivation and a new avenue to achieve effective bottom&#8208;interface engineering for perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Preparation of Amorphous SnO2&#8208;Encapsulated Multiphased Crystalline Cu Heterostructures for Highly Efficient CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of Cu@SnO2 nanostructures with hemicapsule, yolk&#8211;shell, and core&#8211;shell architectures are synthesized, in which a series of unconventional phases of Cu (i.e., 2H, 4H, and 6H) is observed. The obtained hemicapsule heterostructures exhibit superior CO2 reduction reaction selectivity toward CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (above 90%) in a wide potential window, outperforming their yolk&#8211;shell and core&#8211;shell counterparts.








Abstract
Controlling the architectures and crystal phases of metal@semiconductor heterostructures is very important for modulating their physicochemical properties and enhancing their application performances. Here, a facile one&#8208;pot wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize three types of amorphous SnO2&#8208;encapsulated crystalline Cu heterostructures, i.e., hemicapsule, yolk&#8211;shell, and core&#8211;shell nanostructures, in which unconventional crystal phases (e.g., 2H, 4H, and 6H) and defects (e.g., stacking faults and twin boundaries) are observed in the crystalline Cu cores, is reported. The hemicapsule Cu@SnO2 heterostructures, with voids that not only expose the Cu core with unconventional phases but also retain the interface between Cu and SnO2, show an excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) selectivity toward the production of CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) above 90% in a wide potential window from &#8722;1.05 to &#8722;1.55&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), and the highest FE of CO2RR (95.3%) is obtained at &#8722;1.45&#160;V (vs RHE). This work opens up a new way for the synthesis of new heterostructured nanomaterials with promising catalytic application.

Abstract
Memory technologies and applications implemented fully or partially using emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing interest in the research community in recent years. Their unique characteristics provide new possibilities for highly integrated circuits with superior performances, low power consumption as well as special functionalities. Here, an overview of progress in 2D material&#8208;based memory technologies and applications on the circuit level is presented. In the material growth and fabrication aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for producing large&#8208;scale 2D memory devices in batches are discussed. Reports on 2D material&#8208;based integrated memory circuits, from conventional dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM), static random&#8208;access memory (SRAM), and Flash memory arrays, to emerging memristive crossbar structures, all the way to three&#8208;dimensional (3D) monolithic stacking architecture, are systematically reviewed. Comparisons between experimental implementations and theoretical estimations for different integration architectures are given in terms of the critical parameters in 2D memory devices. Attempts to use 2D memory arrays for in&#8208;memory computing applications, which are mostly focused on logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory and neuromorphic computing, are summarized here. Finally, we review the major challenges that impede the large&#8208;scale applications of 2D material&#8208;based memory, and also give perspectives on possible approaches towards a more reliable system&#8208;level fabrication, hopefully shedding some light on future research in this field.

         <title>Multichannel superposition of grafted perfect vortex beams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inspired by plant grafting; grafted vortex beams can be formed through grafting two or more helical phase profiles of optical vortex beams. Recently; grafted perfect vortex beams (GPVBs) have attracted much attention due to their unique optical properties and potential applications. However; the current method to generate and manipulate GPVBs requires a complex and bulky optical system; hindering further investigation and limiting its practical applications. Here; we propose and demonstrate a compact metasurface approach for generating and manipulating GPVBs in multiple channels which eliminates the need for such a complex optical setup. For the first time; a single metasurface is utilized to realize various superpositions of GPVBs with different combinations of topological charges in four channels; leading to asymmetric singularity distributions. The positions of singularities in the superimposed beam can be further modulated by introducing an initial phase difference in the metasurface design. Our work demonstrates a compact metasurface platform that performs a sophisticated optical task that is very challenging with conventional optics; opening opportunities for the investigation and applications of GPVBs in a wide range of emerging application areas such as singular optics and quantum science.

         <title>Dirac Fermion Cloning, Moir&#233; Flat Bands, and Magic Lattice Constants in Epitaxial Monolayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Periodic substrate modulation perturbs the electronic states of graphene, duplicates Dirac cones, and effectively couples the two valleys of the Dirac states in epitaxial monolayer graphene. The intervalley interaction is controlled by the substrate lattice constant. Moir&#233; flat bands emerge at certain magic values of the substrate lattice constant.








Abstract
Tuning interactions between Dirac states in graphene has attracted enormous interest because it can modify the electronic spectrum of the 2D material, enhance electron correlations, and give rise to novel condensed&#8208;matter phases such as superconductors, Mott insulators, Wigner crystals, and quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Previous works predominantly focus on the flat band dispersion of coupled Dirac states from different twisted graphene layers. In this work, a new route to realizing flat band physics in monolayer graphene under a periodic modulation from substrates is proposed. Graphene/SiC heterostructure is taken as a prototypical example and it is demonstrated experimentally that the substrate modulation leads to Dirac fermion cloning and, consequently, the proximity of the two Dirac cones of monolayer graphene in momentum space. Theoretical modeling captures the cloning mechanism of the Dirac states and indicates that moir&#233; flat bands can emerge at certain magic lattice constants of the substrate, specifically when the period of modulation becomes nearly commensurate with the (3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3)R30o\[(\sqrt 3 \; \times \;\sqrt 3 )R{30^o}\] supercell of graphene. The results show that epitaxial single monolayer graphene on suitable substrates is a promising platform for exploring exotic many&#8208;body quantum phases arising from interactions between Dirac&#160;electrons.&#160;

         <title>NIR&#8208;II photothermally triggered &#8220;oxygen bomb&#8221; for hypoxic tumor programmed cascade therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hypoxia as a characteristic feature of solid tumors, has a close relationship with tumor resistance to photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) was reported to relieve hypoxic in solid tumors by acting as an oxygen carrier via several nanostructures. However, the oxygen delivery process is mostly driven by a concentration gradient, which is uncontrollable. Herein, a photothermally controlled &#8220;oxygen bomb&#8221; PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D is designed by encapsulating a PFC core within a functionalized bilayer polymer shell. Near&#8208;infrared second window photothermal agent gold nanorods (AuNRs) with excellent photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat energy conversion ability are fabricated on the surface of a polymer shell via an innovative modified two&#8208;step seedless ex situ growth process to thermally trigger O2 release. Then, a programmed cascade therapy strategy is customized for hypoxic orthotopic pancreatic cancer. Firstly, PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D is irradiated by a 980&#160;nm laser to photothermally trigger O2 infusing into the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, which is accompanied by local hyperemia and doxorubicin release. Subsequently, a 680&#160;nm laser is executed to generate singlet oxygen in the oxygenated tumor microenvironment for PDT. This choreographed programmed cascade therapy strategy would provide a new route for suppressing hypoxic tumor growth under mild conditions based on controllable and effective oxygen release.

         <title>Construction of N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames anchored with Fe single atoms and Fe2P nanoparticles as robust coupling catalyst for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance and high atomic economy electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and investigation of the related catalytic mechanism are of crucial importance yet such tasks are still challenging. Herein, we synthesized a highly dispersed N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames (NPCFs) anchored with Fe single atoms (SAs) and Fe2P nanoparticles (NPs) coupling catalyst by a novel in situ&#8208;doping&#8208;adsorption&#8208;phosphatization strategy for electrocatalytic ORR. The Fe SAs&#8211;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst shows a superior ORR activity with high E1/2 of 0.78 and 0.91&#160;V, low Tafel slope of 63.8 and 45.4 mV&#183;dec&#8211;1, and large JK of 2.46 and 14.47 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 at 0.8 and 0.85&#160;V in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M KOH, respectively, which surpasses most of the non&#8208;noble metal ORR catalysts, and is comparable to that of Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations reveal a synergistic effect that the existence of Fe2P weakens the adsorption of ORR intermediates on active sites and lowers the reaction free energy. The doped P atoms with a strong electron&#8208;donating ability would elevate the energy level of Fe&#8208;3d orbitals and facilitate the adsorption of O2. The active Fe atoms in Fe SAs&#8208;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 exist in a low oxidation state and are less positively charged, which serve as an electron reservoir capable of donating and releasing electrons thus improving the ORR activity. Operando and in situ characterization results indicated that the atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/Fe&#8211;P coupled active centers in Fe SAs&#8211;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst is characteristic of different catalytic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline media. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the Fe&#8211;P site as an active site for the O2 adsorption&#8211;activation process, which is beneficial to the formation of P&#8211;Fe&#8211;O&#8211;H* intermediate species, and the O&#8211;H bond in P&#8211;Fe&#8211;O&#8211;H* can cleave to form spillover H species, which can in turn combine with another N4&#8211;Fe&#8211;O&#8211;H* intermediate species, accelerating the ORR progress. By contrast, in 0.1 M KOH, the Fe&#8211;P sites are not involved in the ORR process, but the doping of P atoms alters the electronic structure of the Fe&#8211;N4 center, thereby improving the ORR activity. This work proposes a novel idea for constructing coupling catalysts with atomic&#8208;level precision and provides a strong reference for the development of high&#8208;efficiency ORR electrocatalysts for practical application.

In 0.5 M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the Fe&#8211;P site as an active site for the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption&#8211;activation process, which is beneficial to the formation of P&#8211;Fe&#8211;O&#8211;H* intermediate species, and the O&#8211;H bond in P&#8211;Fe&#8211;O&#8211;H* can cleave to form spillover H species, which can in turn combine with another N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Fe&#8211;O&#8211;H* intermediate species, accelerating the ORR progress. By contrast, in 0.1 M KOH, the Fe&#8211;P sites are not involved in the ORR process, but the doping of P atoms alters the electronic structure of the Fe&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; center, thereby improving the ORR activity. This work proposes a novel idea for constructing coupling catalysts with atomic-level precision and provides a strong reference for the development of high-efficiency ORR electrocatalysts for practical application.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Direct Light Orbital Angular Momentum Detection in Mid&#8208;Infrared Based on Type&#8208;II Weyl Semimetal TaIrTe4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The direct photocurrent detection capability of light orbital angular momentum (OAM) has recently been realized with topological Weyl semimetals, but it is limited to the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. The extension of the direct OAM detection capability to the mid&#8208;infrared band, which is a wave band that plays an important role in a vast range of applications, has not yet been realized. This is because the photocurrent responses of most photodetectors are neither sensitive to the phase information nor efficient in the mid&#8208;infrared region. In this study, a photodetector based on type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal tantalum iridium tellurides is designed with peculiar electrode geometries to directly detect the topological charge of the OAM using the orbital photogalvanic effect. Our results indicate that the helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current winding around the optical beam axis, with a magnitude proportional to its quantized OAM mode number. The topologically enhanced responses in the mid&#8208;infrared region of TaIrTe4 further help overcome the low responsivity issues and finally render direct OAM detection capability. Our study enables on&#8208;chip integrated OAM detection, and thus OAM&#8208;sensitive focal plane arrays in the mid&#8208;infrared region.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;broadband Strong Electromagnetic Interference Shielding with Ferromagnetic Graphene Quartz Fabric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with ultrahigh shielding effectiveness (SE) are highly desirable for high&#8208;speed electronic devices to attenuate radiated emissions. For hindering interference of their internal or external EMI fields, however, a metallic enclosure suffers from relatively low SE, band&#8208;limited anti&#8208;EMI responses, poor corrosion resistance, and non&#8208;adaptability to complex geometry of a given circuit. Here, we demonstrate a broadband, strong EMI shielding response fabric based on a highly structured ferromagnetic graphene quartz fiber (FGQF) via a modulation&#8208;doped chemical vapour deposition (CVD) growth process. The precise control of graphitic N&#8208;doping configuration endows graphene coatings on specifically designable quartz fabric weave with both high conductivity (3,906 S&#183;cm&#8211;1) and high magnetic responsiveness (a saturation magnetization of &#8764;0.14 emu / g under 300 k), thus attaining the synergistic effect of EMI shielding and electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption for broadband anti&#8208;EMI technology. The large&#8208;scale durable FGQF exhibits extraordinary EMI SE of &#8764;107&#160;dB over a broadband frequency (1&#8211;18&#160;GHz), by configurating &#8764;20&#160;nm thick graphene coatings on a millimeter&#8208;thick quartz fabric. Our work enables a potential for developing an industrial&#8208;scale, flexible, lightweight, durable and ultra&#8208;broadband strong shielding material in advanced applications of flexible anti&#8208;electronic reconnaissance, antiradiation and stealthy technologies.

         <title>Metamaterial Absorbers: from Tunable Surface to Structural Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Since the first demonstration, remarkable progress has been made in the theoretical analysis, structural design, numerical simulation, and potential applications of metamaterial absorbers (MAs). With the continuous advancement of novel materials and creative designs, the absorption of MAs has been significantly improved over a wide frequency spectrum from microwave to optical regime. Further, the integration of active elements into MAs design allows the dynamically manipulation of electromagnetic waves, opening a new platform to push the breakthrough in metadevices. In last several years, numerous efforts have been devoted to exploring innovative approaches for incorporating tunability to MAs, which is highly desirable because of the progressively increasing demand on designing versatile metadevices. In this review, a comprehensive and systematical overview of active MAs with adaptive and on&#8208;demand manner is revisited, highlighting innovative materials and unique strategies to precisely control the electromagnetic response. In addition to the mainstream method by manipulating periodic patterns, we call back two additional approaches including tailoring dielectric spacer and transforming overall structure. Following this, key parameters, such as operating frequency, relative tuning range, and switching speed, are summarized and compared to guide for optimum design. Finally, potential opportunities in the development of active MAs are discussed.

         <title>Defective Fe Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enhance Metabolic Profiling for High&#8208;Accuracy Diagnosis of Human Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precisely engineered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is developed as the matrix for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry for the acquisition of serum metabolic fingerprints. Fe&#8208;MOF&#8208;UL with favorable charge transfer and mitigated thermal dissipation achieves &#8776;10&#160;000&#8208;fold signal enhancement and leads to high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis of three major cancers, promising a universal detection tool for human cancers.








Abstract
Cancers heavily threaten human life; therefore, a high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis is vital to protect human beings from the suffering of cancers. While biopsies and imaging methods are widely used as current technologies for cancer diagnosis, a new detection platform by metabolic analysis is expected due to the significant advantages of fast, simple, and cost&#8208;effectiveness with high body tolerance. However, the signal of molecule biomarkers is too weak to acquire high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis. Herein, precisely engineered metal&#8211;organic frameworks for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, allowing favorable charge transfer within the molecule&#8211;substrate interface and mitigated thermal dissipation by adjusting the phonon scattering with metal nodes, are developed. Consequently, a surprising signal enhancement of &#8776;10 000&#8208;fold is achieved, resulting in diagnosis of three major cancers (liver/lung/kidney cancer) with area&#8208;under&#8208;the&#8208;curve of 0.908&#8211;0.964 and accuracy of 83.2%&#8211;90.6%, which promises a universal detection tool for large&#8208;scale clinical diagnosis of human cancers.

         <title>Molybdenum Carbide Electrocatalyst In Situ Embedded in Porous Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Carbon Nanotubes Promotes Rapid Kinetics in Sodium&#8208;Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge&#8208;storage kinetics of a sulfur&#8208;based sodium&#8208;metal battery are accelerated by incorporating highly redox&#8208;active MoC/Mo2C nanoparticles at the cathode. First&#8208;principle calculations shed fundamental insight on the source of this electrocatalytic enhancement. The resultant Na&#8211;S cells deliver among the most promising rate performance and cycling stabilities in the literature.








Abstract
This is the first report of molybdenum carbide&#8208;based electrocatalyst for sulfur&#8208;based sodium&#8208;metal batteries. MoC/Mo2C is in situ grown on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes in parallel with formation of extensive nanoporosity. Sulfur impregnation (50 wt%&#160;S)&#160;results in unique triphasic architecture termed molybdenum carbide&#8211;porous carbon nanotubes host (MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8211;S). Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state phase transformation to Na2S is promoted in carbonate electrolyte, with in situ time&#8208;resolved Raman, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical analyses demonstrating minimal soluble polysulfides. MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8211;S cathodes deliver among the most promising rate performance characteristics in the literature, achieving 987 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, 818 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1, and 621 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1. The cells deliver superior cycling stability, retaining 650 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&#8722;1, corresponding to 0.028% capacity decay per cycle.

     alt="Molybdenum Carbide Electrocatalyst In Situ Embedded in Porous Nitrogen-Rich Carbon Nanotubes Promotes Rapid Kinetics in Sodium-Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge-storage kinetics of a sulfur-based sodium-metal battery are accelerated by incorporating highly redox-active MoC/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C nanoparticles at the cathode. First-principle calculations shed fundamental insight on the source of this electrocatalytic enhancement. The resultant Na&#8211;S cells deliver among the most promising rate performance and cycling stabilities in the literature.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first report of molybdenum carbide-based electrocatalyst for sulfur-based sodium-metal batteries. MoC/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C is in situ grown on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes in parallel with formation of extensive nanoporosity. Sulfur impregnation (50 wt%&#160;S)&#160;results in unique triphasic architecture termed molybdenum carbide&#8211;porous carbon nanotubes host (MoC/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C@PCNT&#8211;S). Quasi-solid-state phase transformation to Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is promoted in carbonate electrolyte, with in situ time-resolved Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical analyses demonstrating minimal soluble polysulfides. MoC/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C@PCNT&#8211;S cathodes deliver among the most promising rate performance characteristics in the literature, achieving 987 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 818 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 3 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 621 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The cells deliver superior cycling stability, retaining 650 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to 0.028% capacity decay per cycle. High mass loading cathodes (64 wt%&#160;S,&#160;12.7&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) also show cycling stability. Density functional theory demonstrates that formation energy of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;i&gt;

         <title>Coupling Localized Laser Writing and Nonlocal Recrystallization in Perovskite Crystals for Reversible Multidimensional Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Performing multifield modulation of coupled localized laser writing and nonlocal moisture treatment on metal halide perovskites crystals enables the creation and manipulation of localized photoluminescence for optical encryption from 2D to 3D and 4D, such as reversible encryption&#8211;reading, repeatable erasing&#8211;refreshing, and even spatially and temporally resolved reading with high resolution.








Abstract
The ability to generate and manipulate photoluminescence (PL) with high spatial resolution has been of primary importance for applications in micro&#8208;optoelectronics, while the emerging metal halide perovskites offer novel material platforms where diverse photonic functionalities and fine structuring are constantly explored. Herein, micro&#8208;PL patterns consisting of highly luminescent CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) in nonluminescent perovskite crystals are directly fabricated by focused femtosecond laser irradiation. Further modulation with a moisture field leads to the selective dissolution of the laser&#8208;destabilized perovskite structures as revealed by density functional theory simulations, thus allowing for facile control of the reversible PL from the recrystallization of moisture&#8208;induced CsPbBr3 NCs. By leveraging the coupled laser writing and moisture modulation, multimodal information encryption is realized by reversible encryption&#8211;reading and repeatable erasing&#8211;refreshing. This optical storage mechanism is also extended to 3D and 4D by realizing spatially and temporally resolved optical encryption. The coupled multifield modulation on perovskite crystals can enable potential applications in optical storage and encryption, and offer a novel solution for the creation and manipulation of localized PL structures with high temporal and spatial resolutions.

         <title>Asymmetric Substitution of End&#8208;Groups Triggers 16.34% Efficiency for All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Asymmetric substitution of end&#8208;groups is first applied in molecular donors. Three commonly used end&#8208;groups of 2&#8208;ethylhexyl cyanoacetate (CA), 2&#8208;ethylhexyl rhodanine (Reh), and 1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (ID) are combined to construct a series of symmetric and asymmetric donors. Correspondingly, the asymmetric donors SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh and SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID show largely increased dipole moments (2.14 D and 3.39 D respectively) and enhanced aggregation propensity, as compared to those of symmetric donors of SM&#8208;CA, SM&#8208;Reh, and SM&#8208;ID. Using N3 as acceptor, interestingly, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh integrates the photovoltaic characteristics of high fill factor (FF) for SM&#8208;CA and high short&#8208;current density for SM&#8208;Reh, and delivers a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.34% with a high FF of 77.5%, which is much higher than 15.41% for SM&#8208;CA and 14.76% for SM&#8208;Reh. However, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID and SM&#8208;ID give the lower PCE of 8.20% and 2.76%. Characterization results suggest that the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction dictates the packing morphology of blend films instead of dipole effect or crystallinity. Mono&#8208;substitution of Reh facilitates the molecular demixing appropriately but keeps the characteristic of fine bicontinuous network of SM&#8208;CA:N3. SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh:N3 shows more efficient exciton extraction, higher hole transport, and better miscibility, which explains the merits integration and improved photovoltaic performance.

         <title>How Reproducible are Surface Areas Calculated from the BET Equation?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A round&#8208;robin study involving 61 labs is performed, and it is shown that the determination of Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) areas from identical isotherms is a largely ignored issue. To solve this, a new computational approach called &#8220;BET surface identification&#8221; (BETSI) is presented, which expands on the Rouquerol criteria, and which makes an unambiguous BET area calculation possible.








Abstract
Porosity and surface area analysis play a prominent role in modern materials science. At the heart of this sits the Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) theory, which has been a remarkably successful contribution to the field of materials science. The BET method was&#160;developed in the 1930s for open surfaces but is now the most widely used metric for the estimation of surface areas of micro&#8208; and mesoporous materials. Despite its widespread use, the calculation of BET surface areas causes a spread in reported areas, resulting in reproducibility problems in both academia and industry. To prove this, for this analysis, 18 already&#8208;measured raw adsorption isotherms were&#160;provided to sixty&#8208;one labs, who were&#160;asked to calculate the corresponding BET areas. This round&#8208;robin exercise resulted in a wide range of values. Here, the reproducibility of BET area determination from identical isotherms is demonstrated to be a largely ignored issue, raising critical concerns over the reliability of reported BET areas. To solve this major issue, a new computational approach to accurately and systematically determine the BET area of nanoporous materials is developed. The software, called &#8220;BET surface identification&#8221; (BETSI), expands on the well&#8208;known Rouquerol criteria and makes an unambiguous BET area assignment possible.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Assisted 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; Phase Transformation of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Common metal salts are used to realize the controlled phase transformation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) from the conventional thermodynamically stable 2H phase to unconventional metastable 1T&#8242; phase. This work not only paves the way to prepare high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;purity unconventional metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs for fundamental and practical investigations, but also greatly simplifies the procedure for the large&#8208;scale production of 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs.








Abstract
Phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) has demonstrated great potential in the fields of catalysis, electronics, energy storage and conversion, and condensed matter physics. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with unconventional metastable phases (e.g., 1T and 1T&#8242;) have attracted increasing research interest due to their unique and appealing physicochemical properties. However, there is still a lack of a simple, universal, and controlled method for the preparation of large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;purity unconventional&#8208;phase TMD crystals, restricting their further fundamental study and practical applications. Here, a facile, one&#8208;step salt&#8208;assisted general strategy is reported for the controlled phase transformation of commercially available TMDs with conventional 2H phase, yielding a large amount of metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;phase TMDs, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, and MoSe2. It is found that the easily accessible metal salts, such as K2C2O4&#183;H2O, K2CO3, Na2CO3, Rb2CO3, Cs2CO3, KHCO3, NaHCO3, and NaC2O4, can be used to assist the 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; phase transformation, greatly simplifying the synthetic process for producing metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs. Importantly, this method can also be used to prepare 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMD alloys, such as 1T&#8242;&#8208;WS2xSe2(1&#8722;x). This newly developed strategy is robust and highly effective, which can also be used for the phase engineering of other materials with various polymorphs.

         <title>Steric Engineering Enables Efficient and Photostable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and photostable wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites (&#8776;1.8&#160;eV) with only 25&#160;mol% bromide are enabled by steric engineering via alloying dimethylammonium and chloride. The WBG single&#8208;junction cells, with a high efficiency of 17.7%, exhibit promising operational stability under 1&#8208;sun illumination (T90 of 1045 h). This strategy enables all&#8208;perovskite tandem with an impressive stabilized efficiency of 26.0%.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG, &#8776;1.8&#160;eV) perovskite is a crucial component to pair with narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite in low&#8208;cost monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, the stability and efficiency of WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are constrained by the light&#8208;induced halide segregation and by the large photovoltage deficit. Here, a steric engineering to obtain high&#8208;quality and photostable WBG perovskites (&#8776;1.8&#160;eV) suitable for all&#8208;perovskite tandems is reported. By alloying dimethylammonium and chloride into the mixed&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, wide bandgaps are obtained with much lower bromide contents while the lattice strain and trap densities are simultaneously minimized. The WBG PSCs exhibit considerably improved performance and photostability, retaining &gt;90%&#160;of their initial efficiencies after 1000 h of operation at maximum power point. With the triple&#8208;cation/triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskites enabled by steric engineering, a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 26.0% in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells is further obtained. The strategy provides an avenue to fabricate efficient and stable WBG subcells for multijunction photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Identification of the Stable Pt Single Sites in the Environment of Ions: From Mechanism to Design Principle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kinds of Pt sites, Ptzn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 and Ptads&#8208;S2 are identified on Pt SA&#8208;Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Pt SA&#8208;ZCS), and interesting phenomena are observed and analyzed, facing the Brownian collision of ions in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process, which further inspires the design of novel composite with enhanced activity.








Abstract
For single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;based catalysis, it is urgent to understand the nature and dynamic evolution of SA active sites during the reactions. In this work, an example of Pt SA&#8208;Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Pt SA&#8208;ZCS) is found to display interesting phenomena when facing the Brownian collision of ions in aqueous photocatalysis. Via synchrotron radiation, surface techniques, microscopy, and theory calculations, the results show that two kinds of Pt sites exist: PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 (Pt substituting the Zn site) and Ptads&#8208;S2 (Pt adsorbing on the surface). In Na2S, the S2&#8722; can coordinate with Pt atoms and peel them from the Ptads&#8208;S2 sites, but leaves more stable PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 sites, bringing a low but stable catalytic activity (19.40&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Meanwhile, in ascorbic acid, the ascorbic acid ions show less complex ability with Pt atoms, but can decrease the migration barrier of Ptads&#8208;S2 sites (67.18 down to 35.96&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 52.03% drop after 6 h). Therefore, the Ptads&#8208;S2 sites gradually aggregate into nanoclusters, bringing a high but decayed catalytic activity. Moreover, a Pt SA&#8208;ZCS&#8208;Sulfur composite is designed mainly covered by PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 sites accordingly (max: 79.09&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 5% drop after 6 h and QE: 14.0% at 420&#160;nm), showing a beneficial strategy &#8220;from mechanism to design principle.&#8221;

         <title>Powering &#8776;50 &#181;m Motion by a Molecular Event in DNA Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major challenge in material design is to translate molecular events to macroscale properties. In this work, self&#8208;assembled DNA crystals are shown to reversibly expand and contract over 50 &#956;m in response to versatile stimuli.








Abstract
A major challenge in material design is to couple nanoscale molecular and supramolecular events into desired chemical, physical, and mechanical properties at the macroscopic scale. Here, a novel self&#8208;assembled DNA crystal actuator is reported, which has reversible, directional expansion and contraction for over 50 &#956;m in response to versatile stimuli, including temperature, ionic strength, pH, and redox potential. The macroscopic actuation is powered by cooperative dissociation or cohesion of thousands of DNA sticky ends at the designed crystal contacts. The increase in crystal porosity and cavity in the expanded state dramatically enhances the crystal capability to accommodate/encapsulate nanoparticles/proteins, while the contraction enables a &#8220;sponge squeezing&#8221; motion for releasing nanoparticles. This crystal actuator is envisioned to be useful for a wide range of applications, including powering self&#8208;propelled robotics, sensing subtle environmental changes, constructing functional hybrid materials, and working in drug controlled&#8208;release systems.

         <title>Engineering kesterite based photocathode for photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis from NOx reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ammonia is a key chemical feedstock for industry as well as future carbon&#8208;free fuel and transportable vector for renewable energy. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) ammonia synthesis from NOx reduction reaction (NOxRR) provides not only a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process through direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, but a sustainable solution for balancing the global nitrogen cycle by restoring ammonia from wastewater. In this work, we, for the first time, demonstrated selective ammonia synthesis from PEC NOxRR by kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS)) photocathode through loading defect&#8208;engineered TiOx cocatalyst on CdS/CZTS photocathode (TiOx/CdS/CZTS). The uniquely designed photocathode enables selective ammonia production from NOxRR, yielding up to 89.1% faradaic efficiency (0.1&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with a remarkable positive onset potential (0.38&#160;V versus RHE). By tailoring the amount of surface defective Ti3+ species, the adsorption of reactant NO3&#8211; and *NO2 intermediate is significantly promoted while the full coverage of TiOx also suppresses NO2&#8211; liberation as a by&#8208;product, contributing to high ammonia selectivity. Our further attempted PEC ammonia synthesis from simulated wastewater shows good faradaic efficiency of 64.9%, unveiling the potential of using kesterite based photocathode for sustainably restoring ammonia from nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater.

         <title>Van der Waals Exfoliation Processed Biopiezoelectric Submucosa Ultrathin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals exfoliation (vdWE) method to fabricate ultrathin films down to the thickness of effective piezoelectric domains is presented. The vdWE method facilitates the detection of piezoelectricity and make the application of piezoelectric biological tissues possible. The vdWE&#8208;processed SIS (small intestinal submucosa) ultrathin film reaches the thickness of 100 nm and exhibits enhanced piezoelectricity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric biomaterials have attracted significant attention due to the potential effect of piezoelectricity on biological tissues and their versatile applications. However, the high cost and complexity of assembling and domain aligning biomolecules at a large scale, and the disordered arrangement of piezoelectric domains as well as the lack of ferroelectricity in natural biological tissues remain a roadblock toward practical applications. Here, utilizing the weak van der Waals interaction in the layered structure of small intestinal submucosa (SIS), a van der Waals exfoliation (vdWE) process is reported to fabricate ultrathin films down to the thickness of the effective piezoelectric domain. Based on that, the piezoelectric property is revealed of SIS stemming from the collagen fibril, with piezoelectric coefficients up to 4.1 pm V&#8722;1 and in&#8208;plane polarization orientation parallel to the fibril axis. Furthermore, a biosensor based on the vdWE&#8208;processed SIS film with an in&#8208;plane electrode is demonstrated that produces open&#8208;circuit voltages of &#8776;250&#160;mV under the cantilever vibration condition. The vdWE method shows great potential in facilely fabricating ultrathin films of soft tissues and biosensors.

         <title>Review of Semiconductor Flash Memory Devices for Material and Process Issues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
V&#8208;NAND flash memory, regarding charge&#8208;trap materials (polycrystalline Si vs Si3N4&#8722;x), cell array architecture (NOR vs NAND), device configuration (2D vs 3D), and multilevel cell technologies is reviewed. Ways to overcome current challenges in materials and process technologies for 3D V&#8208;NAND are also suggested.








Abstract
Vertically integrated NAND (V&#8208;NAND) flash memory is the main data storage in modern handheld electronic devices, widening its share even in the data centers where installation and operation costs are critical. While the conventional scaling rule has been applied down to the design rule of &#8776;15&#160;nm (year 2013), the current method of increasing device density is stacking up layers. Currently, 176&#8208;layer&#8208;stacked V&#8208;NAND flash memory is available on the market. Nonetheless, increasing the layers invokes several challenges, such as film stress management and deep contact hole etching. Also, there should be an upper bound for the attainable stacking layers (400&#8211;500) due to the total allowable chip thickness, which will be reached within 6&#8211;7 years. This review summarizes the current status and critical challenges of charge&#8208;trap&#8208;based flash memory devices, with a focus on the material (floating&#8208;gate vs charge&#8208;trap&#8208;layer), array&#8208;level circuit architecture (NOR vs NAND), physical integration structure (2D vs 3D), and cell&#8208;level programming technique (single vs multiple levels). Current efforts to improve fabrication processes and device performances using new materials are also introduced. The review suggests directions for future storage devices based on the ionic mechanism, which may overcome the inherent problems of flash memory devices.

         <title>Stable Universal 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;Input Single&#8208;Molecule Logic Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule logic devices are ideal candidates for ultra&#8208;minimalistic circuit elements to perform high&#8208;density computing. Gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au single&#8208;electron transistors not only hold the advantage of controlling molecular orbitals (MOs) via bias and gate voltages, but also exhibit a unique electronic structure with two adjacent MOs. This provides a single&#8208;electron logic calculator to implement all universal logic gates within a single&#8208;molecule device.








Abstract
Controllable single&#8208;molecule logic operations will enable development of reliable ultra&#8208;minimalistic circuit elements for high&#8208;density computing but require stable currents from multiple orthogonal inputs in molecular junctions. Utilizing the two unique adjacent conductive molecular orbitals (MOs) of gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au (Fc = ferrocene) single&#8208;electron transistors (&#8776;2&#160;nm), a stable single&#8208;electron logic calculator (SELC) is presented, which allows real&#8208;time modulation of output current as a function of orthogonal input bias (Vb) and gate (Vg) voltages. Reliable and low&#8208;voltage (&#448;Vb&#448; &#8804; 80&#160;mV, &#448;Vg&#448; &#8804; 2&#160;V) operations of the SELC depend upon the unambiguous association of current resonances with energy shifts of the MOs (which show an invariable, small energy separation of &#8776;100 meV) in response to the changes of voltages, which is confirmed by electron&#8208;transport calculations. Stable multi&#8208;logic operations based on the SELC modulated current conversions between the two resonances and Coulomb blockade regimes are demonstrated via the implementation of all universal 1&#8208;input (YES/NOT/PASS_1/PASS_0) and 2&#8208;input (AND/XOR/OR/NAND/NOR/INT/XNOR) logic gates.

         <title>Catalytic Mechanism of Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Oxides for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with the perovskite Sr0.9TiO3&#8722;&#948;, the perovskite Sr0.9Ti0.7Mn0.3O3&#8722;&#948; (STMn0.3) with a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies exhibits superior adsorptive&#8208;catalytic performance of lithium polysulfides, and improves the utilization of sulfur.

Defective materials have been demonstrated to possess adsorptive and catalytic properties in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, which can effectively solve the problems of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttle and sluggish conversion kinetics during charging and discharging of Li&#8211;S batteries. However, there is still a lack of research on the quantitative relationship between the defect concentration and the adsorptive&#8208;catalytic performance of the electrode. In this work, perovskites Sr0.9Ti1&#8722;xMnxO3&#8722;&#948; (STMnx) (x&#160;=&#160;0.1&#8211;0.3) with different oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentrations are quantitatively regulated as research models. Through a series of tests of the adsorptive property and electrochemical performance, a quantitative relationship between oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentration and adsorptive&#8208;catalytic properties is established. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism of oxygen vacancies in Li&#8211;S batteries is investigated using density functional theory calculations and in&#160;situ experiments. The increased oxygen vacancies can effectively increase the binding energy between perovskite and LiPSs, reduce the energy barrier of LiPSs decomposition reaction, and promote LiPSs conversion reaction kinetics. Therefore, the perovskite STMn0.3&#160;with high oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentrations exhibits excellent LiPSs adsorptive and catalytic properties, realizing high&#8208;efficiency Li&#8211;S batteries. This work is helpful to realize the application of the quantitative regulation strategy of defect engineering in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Implanting an Electron Donor to Enlarge the d&#8211;p Hybridization of High&#8208;Entropy (Oxy)hydroxide: A Novel Design to Boost Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quantitative d&#8211;p hybridization theory is proposed to effectively illustrate the catalytic activity of each metal site in a high&#8208;entropy (HE) system, providing a guideline for the design/fabrication of advanced HE catalysts. Accordingly, a new way of introducing electron donors to construct catalysts with reinforced activity is raised and verified. The corresponding Ag&#8208;decorated HE Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy (HE) electrocatalysts are becoming a research hotspot due to their interesting &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; and have great potential for tailored catalytic properties. However, it is still a great challenge to illustrate their inherent catalytic mechanism for the &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221;, and there is also a paucity of quantitative descriptors to characterize the specific catalytic activity and give logical design strategies for HE systems. Herein, the unexpected activation of all metal sites in HE Cu&#8211;Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reported, and it is found that metal&#8211;oxygen d&#8211;p hybridization, as an effective descriptor, can indicate the intrinsic activity of each metal site. According to the quantitative hybridization, introducing an electron donor (e.g., Ag) is raised and verified to reinforce the electrocatalytic activity of the HE system. Consequently, Ag&#8208;decorated Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide (Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH) electrocatalysts are constructed by an electrochemical reconstruction method, and their OER performances are thoroughly characterized. The Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH is verified with a low overpotential (270&#160;mV at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and a small Tafel slope (35.3&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), as well as good electrochemical stability. The favorable activity of the electron donor and underlying synergistic &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; are demonstrated and disclosed. This work opens up a new strategy to guide the design/fabrication of advanced HE electrocatalysts.

         <title>Formation of Pixelated Elastic Films via Capillary Suction of Curable Elastomers in Templated Hele&#8211;Shaw Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capillary suction is a phenomenon in which surface tension spontaneously drives flow into confined geometries. This physics is leveraged to demonstrate a method for the passive assembly of soft materials using templated Hele&#8211;Shaw cells. These pixelated films are highly modular and can be designed to possess localized patterns and material properties.








Abstract
Natural materials are highly organized, frequently possessing intricate and sophisticated hierarchical structures from which superior properties emerge. In the wake of biomimicry, there is a growing interest in designing architected materials in the laboratory as such structures could enable myriad functionalities in engineering. Yet, their fabrication remains challenging despite recent progress in additive manufacturing. In particular, soft materials are typically poorly suited to form the requisite structures consisting of regular geometries. Here, a new frugal methodology is reported to fabricate pixelated soft materials. This approach is conceptually analogous to the watershed transform used in image analysis and allows the passive assembly of complex geometries through the capillary&#8208;mediated flow of curable elastomers in confined geometries. Emerging from sources distributed across a Hele&#8211;Shaw cell consisting of two parallel flat plates separated by an infinitesimally small gap, these flows eventually meet at the &#8220;dividing lines&#8221; thereby forming Voronoi tesselations. After curing is complete, these structures turn into composite elastic sheets. Rationalizing the fluid mechanics at play allows the structural geometry of the newly formed sheets to be tailored and thereby their local material&#160;properties to be tuned.

         <title>Structural Phase Transitions between Layered Indium Selenide for Integrated Photonic Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition between two topologically similar layered structures in In2Se3 breaks the speed and energy limitations of photonic memory, via reversible nonvolatile refractive index change induced by a single nanosecond pulse. In this work, the atomistic phase&#8208;change pathway between the layered structures is unraveled with in situ high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray diffraction and integrated photonic switching with a transferred epitaxial layer is demonstrated. Detailed analysis on the volumetric effect and by nonlinear spectroscopy are provided to harness the mode coupling and loss in the hybrid device.








Abstract
The primary mechanism of optical memoristive devices relies on phase transitions between amorphous and crystalline states. The slow or energy&#8208;hungry amorphous&#8211;crystalline transitions in optical phase&#8208;change materials are detrimental to the scalability and performance of devices. Leveraging an integrated photonic platform, nonvolatile and reversible switching between two layered structures of indium selenide (In2Se3) triggered by a single nanosecond pulse is demonstrated. The high&#8208;resolution pair distribution function reveals the detailed atomistic transition pathways between the layered structures. With interlayer &#8220;shear glide&#8221; and isosymmetric phase transition, switching between the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;structural states contains low re&#8208;configurational entropy, allowing reversible switching between layered structures. Broadband refractive index contrast, optical transparency, and volumetric effect in the crystalline&#8211;crystalline phase transition are experimentally characterized in molecular&#8208;beam&#8208;epitaxy&#8208;grown thin films and compared to ab initio calculations. The nonlinear resonator transmission spectra measure of incremental linear loss rate of 3.3&#160;GHz, introduced by a 1.5&#160;&#181;m&#8208;long In2Se3&#8208;covered layer, resulted from the combinations of material absorption and scattering.

         <title>Single&#8208;Junction Organic Solar Cells with 19.17% Efficiency Enabled by Introducing One Asymmetric Guest Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ternary system is developed by introducing an asymmetric electron acceptor BTP&#8208;2F2Cl into the PM1:L8&#8208;BO host system. The ternary system exhibits a record&#8208;high efficiency of 19.17% and demonstrates better long&#8208;term stability compared to the host system.








Abstract
The ternary strategy has been widely identified as an effective approach to obtain high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs).

&lt;p&gt;A new ternary system is developed by introducing an asymmetric electron acceptor BTP-2F2Cl into the PM1:L8-BO host system. The ternary system exhibits a record-high efficiency of 19.17% and demonstrates better long-term stability compared to the host system.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ternary strategy has been widely identified as an effective approach to obtain high-efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, for most ternary OSCs, the nonradiative voltage loss lies between those of the two binary devices, which limits further efficiency improvements. Herein, an asymmetric guest acceptor BTP-2F2Cl is designed and incorporated into a PM1:L8-BO host blend. Compared with the L8-BO neat film, the L8-BO:BTP-2F2Cl blend film shows higher photoluminescence quantum yield and larger exciton diffusion length. Introducing BTP-2F2Cl into the host blend extends its absorption spectrum, improves the molecular packing of host materials, and suppresses the nonradiative charge recombination of the ternary OSCs. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency is improved up to 19.17% (certified value 18.7%), which represents the highest efficiency value reported for single-junction OSCs so far. The results show that improving the exciton behaviors is a promising approach to reducing the nonradiative voltage loss and realizing high-performance OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Synthesis of MOF&#8208;74 Family for High Areal Energy Density of Aqueous Nickel&#8208;Zinc Batteries</title>

Abstract
Limited by single metal active sites and low electrical conductivity, designing nickel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials with high capacity and high energy density remains a challenge. Herein, a series of bi/multimetallic MOF&#8208;74 family in situ grown on carbon cloth (CC) by doping Mx+ ions in Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 are fabricated, NiM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+), and NiCoM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+). The type and ratio of doping metal ions can be adjusted while the original topology is preserved. Different metal ions are confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). Furthermore, these Ni&#8208;based MOF electrodes are directly utilized as cathodes for aqueous nickel&#8208;zinc batteries (NZBs). Among all the as&#8208;prepared electrodes, NiCo&#8208;MOF@CC&#8208;3 (NCM@CC&#8208;3) with an optimized Co/Ni ratio 1:1 exhibits the best electrical conductivity, which is according with the DFT theoretical calculations. The NCM@CC&#8208;3//Zn@CC battery achieves a high specific capacity of 1.77 mAh cm&#8211;2, a high areal energy density of 2.97 mWh cm&#8211;2, and high cycling stability of 83% capacity retention rate after 6000 cycles. The synthetic strategy based on the coordination effect of metal ions and the concept of binder&#8208;free electrodes, provides a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials in the energy storage field.

         <title>Isolated&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy Hardening in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics</title>

Abstract
Defect engineering is a well&#8208;established approach to customize the functionalities of perovskite oxides. In demanding high&#8208;power applications of piezoelectric materials; acceptor doping serves as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hardening approach but inevitably deteriorates the electromechanical properties. Here; we propose a new hardening effect associated with the isolated oxygen vacancy for achieving well&#8208;balanced performances. Guided by theoretical design; a well&#8208;balanced performance of mechanical quality factor (Qm) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) is achieved in lead&#8208;free potassium sodium niobate ceramics; where Qm increases by over 60% while d33 remains almost unchanged. By atomic&#8208;scale Z&#8208;contrast imaging; hysteresis measurement; and quantitative piezoresponse force microscopy analysis; we reveal that the improved Qm results from the inhibition of both extrinsic and intrinsic losses while the unchanged d33 is associated with the retainment of polarization contributes. More encouragingly; the hardening effect shows exceptional stability with increasing vibration velocity; offering the potential in material designing for practical high&#8208;power applications; such as pharmaceutical extraction and ultrasonic osteotome.

         <title>Highly Potassiophilic Graphdiyne Skeletons Decorated with Cu Quantum Dots Enable Dendrite&#8208;Free Potassium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Employing Al foil current collector at the potassium anode side is an ideal choice to entail low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;energy potassium metal battery (PMB). Nevertheless, the poor affinity between potassium and planar Al can cause uneven K plating/stripping and hence undermined anode performance, which remains a significant challenge to be addressed. Herein, we propose a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon@graphdiyne (NC@GDY) modified Al current collector affording potassiophilic properties that simultaneously suppresses the dendrite growth and prolongs the lifespan of K anodes. The thin and light modification layer (7&#160;&#956;m thick, with a mass loading of 500&#160;&#956;g cm&#8208;2) is fabricated by directly growing GDY nanosheets interspersed by Cu quantum dots on NC polyhedron templates. As a result, symmetric cell tests reveal that the K@NC@GDY&#8208;Al electrode exhibits an unprecedented cycle life of over 2400 h at a 40% depth of discharge. Even at an 80% depth of discharge, the cell can still sustain for 850 h. When paired with a potassium Prussian blue cathode, thus&#8208;assembled full cell demonstrates comparable capacity and rate performance with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PMBs.

         <title>Transition Metal Carbo&#8208;Chalcogenide &#8220;TMCC&#8221;: A New Family of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of 2D transition metal carbo&#8208;chalcogenides (TMCCs) can be considered an atomic&#8208;level combination of TM carbides (MXenes) and TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Realized by electrochemically assisted delamination, Nb2S2C and Ta2S2C are the first examples of TMCCs to be delaminated into single layers. These newly developed 2D TMCCs are 50% stronger than their TMDC counterparts and have a wide range of applications.








Abstract
A new family of 2D transition metal carbo&#8208;chalcogenides (TMCCs) is reported, which can be considered a combination of two well&#8208;known families, TM carbides (MXenes) and TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs), at the atomic level. Single sheets are successfully obtained from multilayered Nb2S2C and Ta2S2C using electrochemical lithiation followed by sonication in water. The parent multilayered TMCCs are synthesized using a simple, scalable solid&#8208;state synthesis followed by a topochemical reaction. A superconductivity transition is observed at 7.55 K for Nb2S2C. The delaminated Nb2S2C outperforms both multilayered Nb2S2C and delaminated NbS2 as an electrode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Ab initio calculations predict the elastic constant of TMCC to be over 50% higher than that of TMDC.

         <title>Native Ligand Carbonization Renders Common Platinum Nanoparticles Highly Durable for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction: Annealing Temperature Matters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native surface ligands (e.g., oleylamine and oleic acid) attached to Pt nanoparticles during synthesis can be directly converted into ultrathin, conformal graphitic shells upon thermal annealing, rendering common Pt particles highly stable catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. This in situ ligand carbonization strategy is general and can also be applied to improve the stability of commercial Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
Current protocols for synthesizing monodisperse platinum (Pt) nanoparticles typically involve the use of hydrocarbon molecules as surface&#8208;capping ligands. Using Pt nanoparticles as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), however, these ligands must be removed to expose surface sites. Here, highly durable ORR catalysts are realized without ligand removal; instead, the native ligands are converted into ultrathin, conformal graphitic shells by simple thermal annealing. Strikingly, the annealing temperature is a critical factor dictating the ORR performance of Pt catalysts. Pt nanoparticles treated at 500&#160;&#176;C show a very poor ORR activity, whereas those annealed at 700&#160;&#176;C become highly active along with exceptional stability. In&#8208;depth characterization reveals that thermal treatment from 500 to 700&#160;&#176;C gradually opens up the porosity in carbon shells through graphitization. Importantly, such graphitic&#8208;shell&#8208;coated Pt catalysts exhibit a superior ORR stability, largely retaining the activity after 20 000 cycles in a membrane electrode assembly. Moreover, this ligand carbonization strategy can be extended to modify commercial Pt/C catalysts with substantially enhanced stability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of boosting the ORR performance of common Pt nanoparticles by harnessing the native surface ligands, offering a robust approach of designing highly durable catalysts for proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells.

         <title>Nanostructured Metallic Glass in a Highly Upgraded Energy State Contributing to Efficient Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrodeposited Ni&#8211;P nanostructured metallic glass (NG) is located in an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes its catalytic performance. Modified Ni&#8211;P NG displays the best urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance of Ni&#8208;based alloys, with a low potential of 1.36 V @ 10 mA cm&#8211;2, and a Tafel slope of 13 mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Metallic glasses (MGs), with high density of low coordination sites and high Gibbs free energy state, are novel promising and competitive candidates in the family of electrochemical catalysts. However, it remains a grand challenge to modify the properties of MGs by control of the disordered atomic structure. Recently, nanostructured metallic glasses (NGs), consisting of amorphous nanometer&#8208;sized grains connected by amorphous interfaces, have been reported to exhibit tunable properties compared to the MGs with identical chemical composition. Here, it is demonstrated that electrodeposited Ni&#8211;P NG is characterized by an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes the catalytic performance. Moreover, the Ni&#8211;P NG with a heterogeneous structure is a perfect precursor for the fabrication of unique honey&#8208;like nanoporous structure, which displays superior catalytic performance in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Specifically, modified Ni&#8211;P NG requires a potential of mere 1.36&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, with a Tafel slope of 13&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, which is the best UOR performance in Ni&#8208;based alloys. The present work demonstrates that the nanostructurization of MGs provides a universal and effective pathway to upgrade the energy state of MGs for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts in energy conversion.

         <title>Machine Learning on a Robotic Platform for the Design of Polymer&#8208;Protein Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer&#8208;protein hybrids are intriguing materials that can bolster protein stability in non&#8208;native environments, thereby enhancing their utility in diverse medicinal, commercial, and industrial applications. One stabilization strategy involves designing synthetic random copolymers with compositions attuned to the protein surface, but rational design is complicated by a vast chemical and composition space. Here, a strategy is reported to design protein&#8208;stabilizing copolymers based on active machine learning, facilitated by automated material synthesis and characterization platforms. The versatility and robustness of the approach is demonstrated by the successful identification of copolymers that preserve, or even enhance, the activity of three chemically distinct enzymes following exposure to thermal denaturing conditions. Although systematic screening results in mixed success, active learning appropriately identifies unique and effective copolymer chemistries for the stabilization of each enzyme. Overall, this work broadens our&#160;capabilities to design fit&#8208;for&#8208;purpose synthetic copolymers that promote or otherwise manipulate protein activity, with extensions towards the design of robust polymer&#8208;protein hybrid&#160;materials.

         <title>A print&#8208;and&#8208;fuse Strategy for Sacrificial Filaments Enables Biomimetically Structured Perfusable Microvascular Networks with Functional Endothelium Inside 3D Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Current methods of microvessel fabrication mostly rely on self&#8208;assembly in tiny volumes, prefabricated designs of microchannels, or demand complicated multi&#8208;step procedures based on sacrificial templating to achieve specific geometrical features. Such application&#8208;oriented geometries subsequently require a design&#8208;specific and functional perfusion system that must be developed in parallel. In this study, we present a facile and flexible approach for the integration of biomimetically branched microvasculature within bulk hydrogels. For this, sacrificial scaffolds of thermoresponsive poly(2&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PcycloPrOx) are created using Melt Electrowriting (MEW) in an optimized and predictable way and subsequently placed into a customized bioreactor system, which is then filled with a hydrogel precursor solution. Aqueous environment above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PcycloPrOx at 25&#176;C swells the polymer without dissolving it, resulting in fusion of filaments that were deposited onto each other (print&#8208;and&#8208;fuse approach). Accordingly, an adequate printing pathway design results in generating physiological&#8208;like branchings and channel volumes which approximate Murray's law in the geometrical ratio between parent and daughter vessels. After gel formation, a temperature decrease below the LCST produces interconnected microchannels with distinct inlet and outlet regions. Initial placement of the sacrificial scaffolds in the bioreactors in a pre&#8208;defined manner directly yields perfusable structures via leakage&#8208;free fluid connections in a reproducible one&#8208;step procedure. Using this approach, rapid formation of a tight and biologically functional endothelial layer, as assessed not only through fluorescent dye diffusion, but also by tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;) stimulation, is obtained within three days.

         <title>Recording Temperature with Magnetic Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Small&#8208;sized temperature indicator additives autonomously record temperature events via a gradual irreversible signal change. This permits for instance the indication of possible cold&#8208;chain breaches or failure of electronics but also curing of glues. Thus, information about the materials&#8217; thermal history can be obtained upon signal detection at every point of interest. In this work, we introduce maximum&#8208;temperature indicators with magnetic readout based on micrometer&#8208;sized supraparticles. The magnetic signal transduction is by nature independent of the materials&#8217; optical properties. This facilitates to obtain valuable temperature information from the inside, i.e., bulk, even of dark and opaque macroscopic objects, which might differ from their surface. Compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art optical temperature indicators, complementary magnetic readout characteristics ultimately expand their applicability. The conceptualized supraparticles are hierarchically structured assemblies of environmentally friendly, inexpensive iron oxide nanoparticles and thermoplastic polymer. Irreversible structural changes, induced by polymer softening, yield magnetic interaction changes within and between the hierarchic sub&#8208;structures, which are distinguishable and define the temperature indication mechanism. The fundamental understanding of the supraparticles&#8217; working principle enabled us to customize the particles&#8217; working range, response time, and sensitivity, using a toolbox&#8208;like manufacturing approach. The magnetic signal change is detected self&#8208;referenced, fast and contactless.

         <title>Recent progress in 1D contacts for 2D material&#8208;based devices</title>

Abstract
Recent studies have intensively examined two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs) as promising materials for use in future quantum devices due to their atomic thinness. However, a major limitation occurs when 2DMs are in contact with metals; a van der Waals (vdW) gap is generated at the 2DM&#8208;metal interfaces, which induces metal&#8208;induced gap states that are responsible for uncontrollable Schottky barrier (SB), Fermi&#8208;level pinning (FLP), and high contact resistance (RC), thereby substantially lower the electronic mobility of 2DM&#8208;based devices. Here, vdW gap&#8208;free one&#8208;dimensional (1D) edge contact has been studied for use in 2D devices with substantially suppressed carrier scattering of 2DMs with hexagonal boron&#8208;nitride (hBN) encapsulation. The 1D contact further enables uniform carrier transport across multi&#8208;layered 2DM channels, high density transistor integration independent of scaling, and the fabrication of double gate transistors suitable for demonstrating unique quantum phenomena of 2DMs. In this paper, we review the existing 1D contact methods first. As a promising technology toward the large&#8208;scale production of 2D devices, seamless lateral contacts are reviewed in detail. We subsequently review the electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices developed via 1D contacts. Finally, we address the challenges regarding the reliability of 1D contacts, followed by an outlook of the 1D contact methods.

         <title>Compact modeling technology for the simulation of integrated circuits based on graphene field&#8208;effect transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In this study, we report the progress made towards the definition of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFET) that enables the electrical analysis of arbitrary GFET&#8208;based integrated circuits. A set of primary models embracing the main physical principles defines the ideal GFET response under DC, transient (time domain), AC (frequency domain), and noise (frequency domain) analysis. Other set of secondary models accounts for the GFET non&#8208;idealities, such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, trapping/detrapping&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi static&#8208;effects, which could have a significant impact under static and/or dynamic operation. At both device and circuit levels, significant consistency is demonstrated between the simulation output and experimental data for relevant operating conditions. Additionally, we provide a perspective of the challenges during the scale up of the GFET modeling technology towards higher technology readiness levels while drawing a collaborative scenario among fabrication technology groups, modeling groups, and circuit designers.

         <title>Socially&#8208;Directed Development of Materials for Structural Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A socially&#8208;directed approach to materials research and development is imperative to address contemporary challenges and mitigate future damage related to environmental and social impacts. This paper reviews and identifies areas of opportunity at the cross&#8208;disciplinary intersection of materials science and engineering, humanistic fields, and the social sciences, in particular for the case of materials that exhibit structural color.








Abstract
Advancing a socially&#8208;directed approach to materials research and development is an imperative to address contemporary challenges and mitigate future detrimental environmental and social impacts. This paper reviews, synergizes, and identifies cross&#8208;disciplinary opportunities at the intersection of materials science and engineering with humanistic social sciences fields. Such integrated knowledge and methodologies foster a contextual understanding of materials technologies embedded within, and impacting broader societal systems, thus informing decision making upstream and throughout the entire research and development process toward more socially responsible outcomes. Technological advances in the development of structural color, which arises due to the incoherent and coherent scattering of micro&#8208;and nanoscale features and possesses a vast design space, are considered in this context. Specific areas of discussion include material culture, narratives, and visual perception, material waste and use, environmental and social life cycle assessment, and stakeholder and community engagement. A case study of the technical and social implications of bio&#8208;based cellulose (as a source for structurally colored products) is provided. Socially&#8208;directed research and development of materials for structural color hold significant capacity for improved planetary and societal impact across industries such as aerospace, consumer products, displays and sensors, paints and dyes, and food and agriculture.

         <title>The Universal Growth of Ultrathin Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The universal growth of ultrathin perovskite single crystals is realized by designing an oriented solvent microenvironment induced by the interfacial electric field originated from the charge separation between solid and liquid phases. Such a strategy can fabricate a wide range of high&#8208;quality ultrathin perovskite single crystals, from layered to nonlayered, organic to inorganic, and toxic to low&#8208;toxic lead&#8208;free perovskite. Notably, the realization of high quality and diversity of ultrathin perovskites will facilitate both fundamental studies and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Perovskites have engaged significant attention owing to rich species and remarkable physical properties as well as optoelectronic applications. Compared to bulk counterparts, ultrathin perovskites exhibit more available compositions due to the breaking of bulk lattice limitation. Coupled with crystal lattice relaxation and quantum confinement, infinite intriguing properties of ultrathin perovskites deserve to be explored. Developing ultrathin perovskites with alterable composition and structure is a necessity to fully explore this versatile family. Herein, a universal strategy is conceived via constructing oriented solvent microenvironment induced by the interfacial electric field originated from the charge separation between solid and liquid phases, which is conducive to controlling the precursor distribution and makes crystals preferentially nucleate and grow in the preferentially lateral mode. From layered to nonlayered, organic to inorganic, and toxic to low&#8208;toxic lead&#8208;free perovskite, a full&#8208;range synthesis is achieved of ultrathin perovskites. This work opens up opportunities both for ultrathin perovskite exploration through compositional engineering and for device miniaturization in energy conversion applications.

         <title>Highly Effective Stroke Therapy Enabled by Genetically Engineered Viral Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
RGD&#8208;displaying phage (R&#8208;phage) is used to decorate silk fibroin protein microparticles. The resultant hybrid materials can not only promote adhesion, proliferation, and infiltration of neural stem cells (NSCs), but also induce NSCs to differentiate preferentially into neurons. After being implanted into the stroke&#8208;induced cavities, they can induce both angiogenesis and neurogenesis to promote the brain&#8208;tissue regeneration for repairing the cavities.








Abstract
Stroke results in the formation of a cavity in the infarcted brain tissue. Angiogenesis and neurogenesis are poor in the cavity, preventing brain&#8208;tissue regeneration for stroke therapy. To regenerate brain tissue in the cavity, filamentous phages, the human&#8208;safe nanofiber&#8208;like bacteria&#8208;specific viruses, are genetically engineered to display many copies of RGD peptide on the sidewalls. The viral nanofibers, electrostatically coated on biocompatible injectable silk protein microparticles, not only promote adhesion, proliferation, and infiltration of neural stem cells (NSCs), but also induce NSCs to differentiate preferentially into neurons in basal medium within 3 d. After the NSC&#8208;loaded microparticles are injected into the stroke cavity of rat models, the phage nanofibers on the microparticles stimulate angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the stroke sites within two weeks for brain regeneration, leading to functional recovery of limb motor control of rats within 12 weeks. The viral nanofibers also brought about the desired outcomes for stroke therapy, such as reducing inflammatory response, decreasing thickness of astrocytes scars, and increasing neuroblasts response in the subventricular zone. As virtually any functional peptide can be displayed on the phage by genetic means, the phage nanofibers hold promise as a unique and effective injectable biomaterial for stroke therapy.

         <title>Mesoporous Single Crystals with Fe&#8208;Rich Skin for Ultralow Overpotential in Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A screw&#8208;dislocation&#8208;driven spiral growth with micelle adsorption to synthesize mesoporous single&#8208;crystal hydroxides, in which abundant edge sites and single&#8208;crystal properties boost oxygen evolution reaction catalysis, is presented. An ultralow &#951;10 of 185&#160;mV, turnover frequency based on Fe atom as high as 16.9 s&#8211;1 at an overpotential of 350&#160;mV, and excellent catalysis stability are achieved.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key reaction in water splitting and metal&#8211;air batteries, and transition metal hydroxides have demonstrated the most electrocatalytic efficiency. Making the hydroxides thinner for more surface commonly fails to increase the active site number, because the real active sites are the edges. Up to now, the overpotentials of most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OER electrocatalysts at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (&#951;10) are still larger than 200&#160;mV. Herein, a novel design of mesoporous single crystal (MSC) with an Fe&#8208;rich skin to boost the OER is shown. The edges around the mesopores provide lots of real active sites and the Fe modification on these sites further improves the intrinsic activity. As a result, an ultralow &#951;10 of 185&#160;mV is achieved, and the turnover frequency based on Fe atoms is as high as 16.9 s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 350&#160;mV. Moreover, the catalyst has an excellent catalytic stability, indicated by a negligible current drop after 10&#8239;000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. The catalyst enables Zn&#8211;air batteries to run stably over 270 h with a low charge voltage of 1.89&#160;V. This work shows that MSC materials can provide new opportunities for the design of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Speed In&#8208;Memory Electronics Enabled by Proximity&#8208;Oxidation&#8208;Evolved Metal Oxide Redox Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>
Ultrafast (&#8776;42&#160;ns) and nonvolatile multilevel analog storage with long retention, robust endurance, high on/off ratio (105), and excellent reliability is developed using proximity&#8208;oxidation&#8208;grown TiO2 layers. Fundamental NOT, AND, and OR operations with reconfigurable logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory processing are constructed using proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept ReTFTs. On&#8208;demand signal memory&#8208;processing operations like multi&#8208;terminal addressable memory, learning, and pattern recognition/classification are developed for neuromorphic hardware.








Abstract
The pursuit of a universal device that combines nonvolatile multilevel storage, ultrafast writing/erasing speed, nondestructive readout, and embedded processing with low power consumption demands the development of innovative architectures. Although thin&#8208;film transistors and redox&#8208;based resistive&#8208;switching devices have independently been proven to be ideal building blocks for data processing and storage, it is still difficult to achieve both well&#8208;controlled multilevel memory and high&#8208;precision ultrafast processing in a single unit, even though this is essential for the large&#8208;scale hardware implementation of in&#8208;memory computing. In this work, an ultrafast (&#8776;42&#160;ns) and programable redox thin&#8208;film transistor (ReTFT) memory made of a proximity&#8208;oxidation&#8208;grown TiO2 layer is developed, which has on/off ratio of 105, nonvolatile multilevel analog storage with a long retention time, strong durability, and high reliability. Utilizing the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept ReTFTs, circuits capable of performing fundamental NOT, AND, and OR operations with reconfigurable logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory processing are developed. Further, on&#8208;demand signal memory&#8208;processing operations, like multi&#8208;terminal addressable memory, learning, pattern recognition, and classification, are explored for prospective application in neuromorphic hardware. This device, which operates on a fundamentally different mechanism, presents an alternate solution to the problems associated with the creation of high&#8208;performing in&#8208;memory processing technology.

         <title>A Photoelectric Spiking Neuron for Visual Depth Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a photoelectric spiking neuron for visual depth perception based on the Ag/TaOx/indium tin oxide memristive spiking encoder with high biological plausibility as well as ultralow power consumption. The biological visual systems are built and can estimate the depth of field based on the spiking rate difference, and consequently adapt its focus to optimize performances in visual tasks.








Abstract
The biological visual system encodes optical information into spikes and processes them by the neural network, which enables the perception with high throughput of visual processing with ultralow energy budget. This has inspired a wide spectrum of devices to imitate such neural process, while precise mimicking such procedure is still highly required. Here, a highly bio&#8208;realistic photoelectric spiking neuron for visual depth perception is presented. The firing spikes generated by the TaOX memristive spiking encoders have a biologically similar frequency range of 1&#8211;200&#160;Hz and sub&#8208;micro watts power. Such spiking encoder is integrated with a photodetector and a network of neuromorphic transistors, for information collection and recognition tasks, respectively. The distance&#8208;dependent response and eye fatigue of biological visual systems have been mimicked based on such photoelectric spiking neuron. The simulated depth perception shows a recognition improvement by adapting to sights at different distances. The results can advance the technologies in bioinspired or robotic systems that may be endowed with depth perception and power efficiency at the same time.

         <title>A Sulfur&#8208;Tolerant MOF&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Fe Catalyst for Efficient Oxidation of NO and Hg0</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst (denoted Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C) is theoretically predicted and fabricated by controlled metal&#8211;organic framework pryrolysis for oxidation of NO and Hg0, aiming at multipollutants removal in coal&#8208;fired power plants. Strikingly, the Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C exhibits sulfur resistance in catalytic oxidation of NO and Hg0, where SO2 boosts the catalytic cycle of NO oxidation over Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C through accelerating the regeneration of active sites.








Abstract
Catalytic oxidation of NO and Hg0 is a crucial step to eliminate multiple pollutants from emissions from coal&#8208;fired power plants. However, traditional catalysts exhibit low catalytic activity and poor sulfur resistance due to low activation ability and poor adsorption selectivity. Herein, a single&#8208;atom Fe decorated N&#8208;doped carbon catalyst (Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C), with abundant Fe1&#8208;N4 sites, based on a Fe&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework is developed to oxidize NO and Hg0. The results demonstrate that the Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C has ultrahigh catalytic activity for oxidizing NO and Hg0 at low and room temperature. More importantly, Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C exhibits robust sulfur resistance as it preferably adsorbs reactants over sulfur oxides, which has never been achieved before with traditional catalysts. Furthermore, SO2 boosts the catalytic oxidation of NO over Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C through accelerating the circulation of active sites. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Fe1&#8208;N4 active sites result in a low energy barrier and high adsorption selectivity, providing detailed molecular&#8208;level understanding for its excellent catalytic performance. This is the first report on NO and Hg0 oxidation over single&#8208;atom catalysts with strong sulfur tolerance. The outcomes demonstrate that single&#8208;atom catalysts are promising candidates for catalytic oxidation of NO and Hg0 enabling cleaner coal&#8208;fired power plant operations.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with High Performance for Three&#8208;Way Catalysis</title>

A unique dual&#8208;site catalyst composed of Pt and Pd atoms located in neighboring positions on the surface of CeO2 is fabricated, which possesses outstanding TWC performance, especially for NO elimination. The enhancement can be attributed to the strong interactions between the Pt and Pd atoms by formation of Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Pd fine structures.








Abstract
In response to growing levels of air pollution and emission regulations, novel three&#8208;way catalysts (TWCs) with high efficiency are highly coveted. Herein, a multi&#8208;step heating strategy to fabricate a unique dual&#8208;site catalyst composed of strongly coupled Pt and Pd atoms located in neighboring positions on the surface of CeO2 is demonstrated. Outstanding three&#8208;way catalytic performance is demonstrated, especially for NO elimination. Based on comprehensive investigations, the enhancement is attributed to the strong interactions between the neighboring Pt and Pd atoms, which can separately serve as active sites for CO and NO adsorption, efficiently reducing the energy barrier and accelerating the reaction rate. These findings not only contribute to designing and constructing next&#8208;generation catalysts, but also provide a promising opportunity to improve fuel efficiency and control emissions.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Robust and Extensible Fibrous Mechanical Sensors for Wearable Smart Healthcare</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conductive microfibers possess a large strain range (&#8776;700%) and high strength (&#8776;17.6&#160;MPa) because of the robust core fiber made from a new type of polyurethane polymer and CNTs layers, which simultaneously show a high strain resolution and a large detection range (from 0.0075% to 400%). The microfibers are capable of monitoring 11 health&#8208;related physiological signals.








Abstract
Fibrous material with high strength and large stretchability is an essential component of high&#8208;performance wearable electronic devices. Wearable electronic systems require a material that is strong to ensure durability and stability, and a wide range of strain to expand their applications. However, it is still challenging to manufacture fibrous materials with simultaneously high mechanical strength and the tensile property. Herein, the ultra&#8208;robust (&#8776;17.6&#160;MPa) and extensible (&#8776;700%) conducting microfibers are developed and demonstrated their applications in fabricating fibrous mechanical sensors. The mechanical sensor shows high sensitivity in detecting strains that have high strain resolution and a large detection range (from 0.0075% to 400%) simultaneously. Moreover, low frequency vibrations between 0 and 40&#160;Hz are also detected, which covers most tremors that occur in the human body. As a further step, a wearable and smart health&#8208;monitoring system has been developed using the fibrous mechanical sensor, which is capable of monitoring health&#8208;related physiological signals, including muscle movement, body tremor, wrist pulse, respiration, gesture, and six body postures to predict and diagnose diseases, which will promote the wearable telemedicine technology.

         <title>A Family of Frost&#8208;Resistant and Icephobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of cryoprotectant (and phase&#8208;change material (PCM)&#8208;based) compositions are engineered to be resistant against shear&#8208;flow and dissolution&#8208;driven material loss by securing them in a solid matrix, creating a slippery interface, capable of exceptional anti&#8208;icing/frosting, tailoring solid foulant adhesion, formulation&#8208;dependent optical transparency, self&#8208;healing, and thereby promising routes for the development of multifunctional surfaces that can significantly outperform commercial solutions.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;icing and icephobic materials play a crucial role in demanding applications ranging from energy to transportation systems operating in frigid climates. Despite remarkable advancements in the development of such surface coatings, the use of anti/de&#8208;icing chemicals remains one of the go&#8208;to solutions for ice management. However, they are notoriously prone to removal by shear forces and dissolution. Herein, the design rationale for developing a family of cryoprotectant and phase&#8208;change material (PCM)&#8208;based compositions in the form of mixtures, non&#8208;aqueous emulsions&#8208;creams, and gels that can substantially overcome such challenges is reported. This is achieved through the sustenance of an in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated surface hydration layer that protects the underlying substrate from a variety of foulants, varying from ice to disease&#8208;causing bacteria. Each formulation utilizes unique chemistry to curtail the embodied cryoprotectant loss and can be easily applied as an all&#8208;in&#8208;one sprayable/paintable coating capable of significantly outperforming untreated industrial materials in terms of their ability to delay condensation&#8208;frosting and shed ice simultaneously. Concomitantly, an array of formulation&#8208;specific functionalities is observed in the family, which includes optical transparency, mechanical durability, high shear&#8208;flow stability, and self&#8208;healing characteristics.

         <title>A Readily Scalable, Clinically Demonstrated, Antibiofouling Zwitterionic Surface Treatment for Implantable Medical Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple process has been developed to treat the surfaces of implantable medical devices with zwitterionic materials to reduce hospital acquired infection and complications. The process meets the regulatory and scalability requirements to treat real&#8208;world devices. Long&#8208;term catheterized patients who replaced conventional catheters with surface&#8208;treated catheters report improved urinary tract condition and quality of life.








Abstract
Unlike growth on tissue, microbes can grow freely on implantable devices with minimal immune system intervention and often form resilient biofilms that continuously pump out pathogenic cells. The efficacy of antibiotics used to treat infection is declining due to increased rates of pathogenic resistance. A simple, one&#8208;step zwitterionic surface modification is developed to significantly reduce protein and microbial adhesion to synthetic materials and demonstrate the successful modification of several clinically relevant materials, including recalcitrant materials such as elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane. The treated surfaces exhibit robust adhesion resistance against proteins and microorganisms in both static and flow conditions. Furthermore, the surface treatment prevents the adhesion of mammalian fibroblast cells while displaying no cytotoxicity. To demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the novel technology in the real&#8208;world, a surface&#8208;treated, commercial silicone foley catheter is developed that is cleared for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (K192034). 16&#160;long&#8208;term catheterized patients received surface&#8208;treated catheters and completed a Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI&#8208;I) questionnaire. 10&#160;out of 16&#160;patients described their urinary tract condition post implantation as &#8220;much better&#8221; or &#8220;very much better&#8221; and 72% (n&#160;=&#160;13) of patients desire to continue using the surface&#8208;treated catheter over conventional latex or silicone catheters.

         <title>Photonic&#8208;Crafting of Non&#8208;Volatile and Rewritable Antiferromagnetic Spin Textures with Drastic Difference in Electrical Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two bistable and reversibly controllable antiferromagnetic states in strained BFO film are discovered. These two non&#8208;volatile antiferromagnetic states are successfully patterned with a non&#8208;contact approach combining both optical and magnetic methods. The written antiferromagnetic pattern is electrically readable with at least 30% signal difference. This work promises an alternative route toward practical applications of antiferromagnetic spintronics.








Abstract
Antiferromagnetic spintronics is an emerging field of non&#8208;volatile data storage and information processing. The zero net magnetization and zero stray fields of antiferromagnetic materials eliminate interference between neighbor units, leading to high&#8208;density memory integrations. However, this invisible magnetic character at the same time also poses a great challenge in controlling and detecting magnetic states in antiferromagnets. Here, two antiferromagnetic spin states close in energy in strained BiFeO3 thin films at room temperature are discovered. It can be reversibly switched between these two non&#8208;volatile antiferromagnetic states by a moderate magnetic field and a non&#8208;contact optical approach. Importantly, the conductivity of the areas with each antiferromagnetic textures is drastically different. It is conclusively demonstrated the capability of optical writing and electrical reading of these newly discovered bistable antiferromagnetic states in the BiFeO3 thin films.

It can be reversibly switched between these two non-volatile antiferromagnetic states by a moderate magnetic field and a non-contact optical approach. Importantly, the conductivity of the areas with each antiferromagnetic textures is drastically different. It is conclusively demonstrated the capability of optical writing and electrical reading of these newly discovered bistable antiferromagnetic states in the BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thin films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoscale Faceting and Ligand Shell Structure Dominate the Self&#8208;Assembly of Nonpolar Nanoparticles into Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superlattice formation by self&#8208;assembly in liquid is a nanoengineering technique with broad technological applications. Liquid&#8208;phase electron microscopy reveals that faceted nanoparticles assemble differently on SiN surfaces with altered electrostatic and long&#8208;range attraction, demonstrating that the nanoscale morphology of the nanoparticles and the substrate's surface control the self&#8208;assembled superlattices.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanoscale structures at liquid&#8211;solid interfaces occurs in a broad range of industrial processes and is found in various phenomena in nature. Conventional theory assumes spherical particles and homogeneous surfaces, but that model is oversimplified, and nanoscale in situ observations are needed for a more complete understanding. Liquid&#8208;phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;STEM) is used to examine the interactions that direct the self&#8208;assembly of superlattices formed by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in nonpolar liquids. Varying the molecular coating of the substrate modulates short&#8208;range attraction and leads to switching between a range of different geometric structures, including hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp), simple hexagonal (sh), dodecahedral quasi&#8208;crystal (dqc), and body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) lattices, as well as random distributions. Langevin dynamics simulations explain the experimental results in terms of the interplay between nanoparticle faceting, ligand shell structure, and substrate&#8211;NP interactions.

         <title>Hypothesis Learning in Automated Experiment: Application to Combinatorial Materials Libraries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hypothesis learning approach based on conavigation of the hypothesis and experimental spaces toward physics discovery via active learning of competing hypotheses is developed. This approach is illustrated for exploring concentration&#8208;induced phase transition in Sm&#8208;doped BiFeO3 using a piezoresponse force microscopy, and can be extended to other characterization and synthesis experiments.








Abstract
Machine learning is rapidly becoming an integral part of experimental physical discovery via automated and high&#8208;throughput synthesis, and active experiments in scattering and electron/probe microscopy. This, in turn, necessitates the development of active learning methods capable of exploring relevant parameter spaces with the smallest number of steps. Here, an active learning approach based on conavigation of the hypothesis and experimental spaces is introduced. This is realized by combining the structured Gaussian processes containing probabilistic models of the possible system's behaviors (hypotheses) with reinforcement learning policy refinement (discovery). This approach closely resembles classical human&#8208;driven physical discovery, when several alternative hypotheses realized via models with adjustable parameters are tested during an experiment. This approach is demonstrated for exploring concentration&#8208;induced phase transitions in combinatorial libraries of Sm&#8208;doped BiFeO3 using piezoresponse force microscopy, but it is straightforward to extend it to higher&#8208;dimensional parameter spaces and more complex physical problems once the experimental workflow and hypothesis generation are available.

         <title>Highly Stable Halide&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8211;Se Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent thermodynamic mechanism of the lithiation/delithiation process of the Se cathode is revealed in the halide electrolyte system, benefiting from its wide electrochemical stability window and excellent stability toward Se. The highly mixed conductive character of the Se&#8211;Li3HoCl6 cathode ensures fast charge transfer and good performance of an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;Se cell.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S and Li&#8211;Se batteries are promising devices that can address the safety and electrochemical stability issues that arise from liquid&#8208;based systems. However, solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;Se/S batteries usually present poor cycling stability due to the high resistance interfaces and decomposition of solid electrolytes caused by their narrow electrochemical stability windows. Here, an integrated solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;Se battery based on a halide Li3HoCl6 solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity is presented. The intrinsic wide electrochemical stability window of the Li3HoCl6 and its stability toward Se and the lithiated species effectively inhibit degeneration of the electrolyte and the Se cathode by suppressing side reactions. The inherent thermodynamic mechanism of the lithiation/delithiation process of the Se cathode in solid is also revealed and confirmed by theoretical calculations. The battery achieves a reversible capacity of 402 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 750 cycles. The electrochemical performance, thermodynamic lithiation/delithiation mechanism, and stability of metal&#8208;halide&#8208;based Li&#8211;Se batteries confer theoretical study and practical applicability that extends to other energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes for Long&#8208;Term Tumor Tracking with Incremental NIR&#8208;II Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) is designed and synthesized for long&#8208;term monitoring of tumor progression in mice, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for noninvasive in vivo cell tracking. In contrast to current exogenous probes, the COE emission intensity increases with tumor growth, thereby harnessing advantages of both direct&#8208;labeling and indirect&#8208;labeling methods.








Abstract
The design and synthesis of the near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;II emissive conjugated oligoelectrolyte COE&#8208;BBT are reported. COE&#8208;BBT has a solubility in aqueous media greater than 50&#160;mg mL&#8722;1, low toxicity, and a propensity to intercalate lipid bilayers, wherein it exhibits a higher emission quantum yield relative to aqueous media. Addition of COE&#8208;BBT to cells provides two emission channels, at &#8776;500 and &#8776;1020&#160;nm, depending on the excitation wavelength, which facilitates in vitro confocal microscopy and in vivo animal imaging. The NIR&#8208;II emission of COE&#8208;BBT is used to track intracranial and subcutaneous tumor progression in mice. Of relevance is that the total NIR&#8208;II intensity increases over time. This phenomenon is attributed to a progressive attenuation of a COE&#8208;BBT self&#8208;quenching effect within the cells due to the expected dye dilution per cell as the tumor proliferates.

Therapeutic mRNA vaccination is an attractive approach to trigger antitumor immunity. However, the mRNA delivery technology for customized tumor vaccine is still limited. In this work, bacteria&#8208;derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are employed as an mRNA delivery platform by genetically engineering with surface decoration of RNA binding protein, L7Ae, and lysosomal escape protein, listeriolysin O (OMV&#8208;LL). OMV&#8208;LL can rapidly adsorb box C/D sequence&#8208;labelled mRNA antigens through L7Ae binding (OMV&#8208;LL&#8208;mRNA) and deliver them into dendritic cells (DCs), following by the cross&#8208;presentation via listeriolysin O&#8208;mediated endosomal escape. OMV&#8208;LL&#8208;mRNA significantly inhibits melanoma progression and elicits 37.5% complete regression in a colon cancer model. OMV&#8208;LL&#8208;mRNA induces a long&#8208;term immune memory and protects the mice from tumor challenge after 60 days. In summary, this platform provides a delivery technology distinct from lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for personalized mRNA tumor vaccination, and with a &#8220;Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Display&#8221; strategy that enables its versatile application in mRNA vaccines.

         <title>Atomically Sharp Lateral Superlattice Heterojunctions Built&#8208;In Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nanoporous Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D lateral superlattice heterostructure with unprecedented single&#8208;bond band discontinuities and heterocomponent dimensions down to one nanometer is realized by the coupling of interdigitated nanoribbons into a nitrogen&#8208;doped nanoporous graphene structure. The atomic scale band discontinuities at the nanoporous heterojunctions endow this nanomaterial with a multifunctionality that can be relevant for photodetection, excitonic solar cells, water splitting, or selective nanosieving.








Abstract
Nanometer scale lateral heterostructures with atomically sharp band discontinuities can be conceived as the 2D analogues of vertical Van der Waals heterostructures, where pristine properties of each component coexist with interfacial phenomena that result in a variety of exotic quantum phenomena. However, despite considerable advances in the fabrication of lateral heterostructures, controlling their covalent interfaces and band discontinuities with atomic precision, scaling down components and producing periodic, lattice&#8208;coherent superlattices still represent major challenges. Here, a synthetic strategy to fabricate nanometer scale, coherent lateral superlattice heterojunctions with atomically sharp band discontinuity is reported. By merging interdigitated arrays of different types of graphene nanoribbons by means of a novel on&#8208;surface reaction, superlattices of 1D, and chemically heterogeneous nanoporous junctions are obtained. The latter host subnanometer quantum dipoles and tunneling in&#8208;gap states, altogether expected to promote interfacial phenomena such as interribbon excitons or selective photocatalysis.

         <title>Enhancing the Reversibility of Lattice Oxygen Redox Through Modulated Transition Metal&#8211;Oxygen Covalency for Layered Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of activating the oxygen oxidation activity by construction of overwhelming nonbonding oxygen states, it is more crucial to enhance the reversibility of lattice oxygen redox reactions of layered battery electrodes through modulating transition metal (TM) &#63743;O covalency, which concurrently suppresses the phase transition and irreversible TM migration, thus leading to the improved structural stability and electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Utilizing reversible lattice oxygen redox (OR) in battery electrodes is an essential strategy to overcome the capacity limitation set by conventional transition metal redox. However, lattice OR reactions are often accompanied with irreversible oxygen oxidation, leading to local structural transformations and voltage/capacity fading. Herein, it is proposed that the reversibility of lattice OR can be remarkably improved through modulating transition metal&#8211;oxygen covalency for layered electrode of Na&#8208;ion batteries. By developing a novel layered P2&#8208;Na0.6Mg0.15Mn0.7Cu0.15O2 electrode, it is demonstrated that the highly electronegative Cu dopants can improve the lattice OR reversibility to 95% compared to 73% for Cu&#8208;free counterpart, as directly quantified through high&#8208;efficiency mapping of resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering. Crucially, the large energetic overlap between Cu 3d and O 2p states dictates the rigidity of oxygen framework, which effectively mitigates the structural distortion of local oxygen environment upon (de)sodiation and leads to the enhanced lattice OR reversibility. The electrode also exhibits a completely solid&#8208;solution reaction with an ultralow volume change of only 0.45% and a reversible metal migration upon cycling, which together ensure the improved electrochemical performance. These results emphasize the critical role of transition metal&#8211;oxygen covalency for enhancing the reversibility of lattice OR toward high&#8208;capacity electrodes employing OR chemistry.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Programming of Liquid Metal&#8208;Composite Microstructures through Direct Ink Write 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D printing strategy to program liquid metal&#8211;composite microstructures on demand throughout a part is introduced. Elastomer composites are created with unique liquid metal (LM) microdroplet architectures including smooth to discrete transitions from spherical to needle&#8208;like microstructures, curvilinear microstructures, connected LM networks, and geometrically complex patterns. This approach can enable applications in soft electronics, robotics, and reconfigurable structures.








Abstract
Soft, elastically deformable composites with liquid metal (LM) droplets can enable new generations of soft electronics, robotics, and reconfigurable structures. However, techniques to control local composite microstructure, which ultimately governs material properties and performance, is lacking. Here a direct ink writing technique is developed to program the LM&#160;microstructure (i.e., shape, orientation, and connectivity) on demand throughout elastomer composites. In contrast to inks with rigid particles that have fixed shape and size, it is shown that emulsion inks with LM&#160;fillers enable in situ control of microstructure. This enables filaments, films, and 3D structures with unique LM microstructures that are generated on demand and locked in during printing. This includes smooth and discrete transitions from spherical to needle&#8208;like droplets, curvilinear microstructures, geometrically complex embedded inclusion patterns, and connected LM networks. The printed materials are soft (modulus &lt; 200 kPa), highly deformable (&gt;600 % strain), and can be made locally insulating or electrically conductive using a single ink by controlling the process conditions. These capabilities are demonstrated by embedding elongated LM droplets in a&#160;soft heat sink, which rapidly dissipates heat from high&#8208;power LEDs. These&#160;programmable microstructures can enable new composite paradigms for emerging technologies that demand mechanical compliance with multifunctional response.

         <title>A Hierarchically Encoded Data Storage Device with Controlled Transiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically encoded data storage device consisting of resistive switching memory, electromagnetic (EM) metamaterial, and diffractive optical element is reported in this paper. The storage devices can be used to store hybrid information including electronic information, EM information, and optical information. It also exhibits controllable degradation manners in vitro and in vivo, which expands the applications in bio&#8208;implantable electronics.








Abstract
In the era of information explosion, high&#8208;security and high&#8208;capacity data storage technology attracts more and more attention. Physically transient electronics, a form of electronics that can physically disappear with precisely controlled degradation behaviors, paves the way for secure data storage. Herein, the authors report a silk&#8208;based hierarchically encoded data storage device (HEDSD) with controlled transiency. The HEDSD can store electronic, photonic, and optical information simultaneously by synergistically integrating a resistive switching memory (ReRAM), a terahertz metamaterial device, and a diffractive optical element, respectively. These three data storage units have shared materials and structures but diverse encoding mechanisms, which increases the degree of complexity and capacity of stored information. Silk plays an important role as a building material in the HEDSD thanks to its excellent mechanical, optical, and electrical properties and controlled transiency as a naturally extracted protein. By controlling the degradation rate of storage units of the silk&#8208;based HEDSD, different degradation modes of the HEDSD, and multilevel information encryption/decryption have been realized. Compared with the conventional memory devices, as&#8208;reported silk&#8208;based HEDSD can store multilevel complex information and realize multilevel information encryption and decryption, which is highly desirable to fulfill the future demands of secure memory systems and implantable storage devices.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Memristors with 4&#160;mV&#160;Switching Voltage Based on Surface&#8208;Modified Copper Nanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>
The development of memristors operating at low switching voltages can be very useful to avoid signal amplification in many types of circuits. Here, 400&#160;nm&#8208;thick dalkyl&#8208;dithiophosphoric modified copper nanoparticles (DDP&#8208;CuNPs) based nano&#8208;memristors (&lt;50 nm2) exhibiting volatile threshold&#8208;type resistive switching at an ultralow switching voltage of &#8776;4&#160;mV, and with an ultralow variability, are reported.








Abstract
The development of memristors operating at low switching voltages &lt;50&#160;mV&#160;can be very useful to avoid signal amplification in many types of circuits, such as those used in bioelectronic applications to interact with neurons and nerves. Here, it is reported that 400&#160;nm&#8208;thick films made of dalkyl&#8208;dithiophosphoric (DDP) modified copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) exhibit volatile threshold&#8208;type resistive switching (RS) at ultralow switching voltage of &#8776;4&#160;mV. The RS is observed in small nanocells with a lateral size of &lt;50&#160;nm&#8211;2, during hundreds of cycles, and with an ultralow variability. Atomistic calculations reveal that the switching mechanism is related to the modification of the Schottky barriers and insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition when ionic movement is induced via external bias. The devices are also used to model integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire neurons for spiking neural networks and it is concluded that circuits employing DDP&#8208;CuNPs consume around ten times less power than similar neurons implemented with a memristor that switches at 40&#160;mV.

         <title>Synergic Reaction Kinetics over Adjacent Ruthenium Sites for Superb Hydrogen Generation in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating adjacent Ru nanoparticles and single atoms onto defective carbon as hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst achieves ultralow overpotential and high intrinsic activity. The activity origin is the synergistic electronic regulations that facilitate water dissociation and reduce energy barriers of hydroxide/hydrogen desorption over adjacent Ru sites, resulting in an optimized reaction kinetics for alkaline hydrogen generation.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based electrocatalysts as platinum (Pt) alternatives in catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are promising. However, achieving efficient reaction processes on Ru catalysts is still a challenge, especially in alkaline media. Here, the well&#8208;dispersed Ru nanoparticles with adjacent Ru single atoms on carbon substrate (Ru1,n&#8208;NC) is demonstrated to be a superb electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. The obtained Ru1,n&#8208;NC exhibits ultralow overpotential (14.8&#160;mV) and high turnover frequency (1.25&#160;H2&#160;s&#8208;1 at &#8722;0.025&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), much better than the commercial 40 wt.% Pt/C. The analyses reveal that Ru nanoparticles and single sites can promote each other to deliver electrons to the carbon substrate. Eventually, the electronic regulations bring accelerated water dissociation and reduced energy barriers of hydroxide/hydrogen desorption on adjacent Ru sites, then an optimized reaction kinetics for Ru1,n&#8208;NC is obtained to achieve superb hydrogen generation in alkaline media. This work provides a new insight into the catalyst design in simultaneous optimizations of the elementary steps to obtain ideal HER performance in alkaline media.

         <title>Semiconductor Contact&#8208;Electrification&#8208;Dominated Tribovoltaic Effect for Ultrahigh Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first semiconductor direct&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerator (SDC&#8208;TENG) using gallium nitride and bismuth telluride is designed for ultrahigh power generation (40&#160;V, 2.56 A&#8201;m&#8722;2, 11.85 W&#8201;m&#8722;2). Compared to traditional polymer TENGs and previous centimeter&#8208;level SDC&#8208;TENGs, this work sets the normalized power density record for TENGs, which demonstrates the great potential of the tribovoltaic effect for energy harvesting and sensing.








Abstract
The semiconductor direct&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerator (SDC&#8208;TENG) based on the tribovoltaic effect is promising for developing a new semiconductor energy technology with high power density. Here, the first SDC&#8208;TENG built using gallium nitride (GaN) and bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) for ultrahigh&#8208;power generation is reported. During the friction process, an additional interfacial electric field is formed by continuous contact electrification (CE), and abundant electron&#8211;hole pairs are excited and move directionally to form a junction current that is always internally from Bi2Te3 to GaN, regardless of the semiconductor type. The peak open&#8208;circuit voltage can reach up to 40&#160;V and the power density is 11.85 W m&#8722;2 (average value is 9.23 W m&#8722;2), which is approximately 200 times higher than that of previous centimeter&#8208;level SDC&#8208;TENGs. Moreover, compared to traditional polymer TENGs under the same conditions, the average power density is remarkably improved by over 40 times. This study provides the first evidence of CE on the tribovoltaic effect and sets the normalized power density record for TENGs, which demonstrates a great potential of the tribovoltaic effect for energy harvesting and sensing.

         <title>Process&#8208;Aid Solid Engineering Triggers Delicately Modulation of Y&#8208;Series Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, high volatile, and asymmetric halogen benzene derivate, 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5&#8208;chlorobenzene, is applied as process&#8208;aid solid to manipulate the blend nanomorphology and enhance the crystallinity in Y&#8208;series small molecule&#8208;based photoactive layer system. A champion power conversion efficiency of 17.0% is yielded, which is one of the highest performances for thick&#8208;film organic solar cells.








Abstract
Volatile solids with symmetric&#160;&#960;&#8208;backbone are intensively implemented on manipulating the nanomorphology for improving the operability and stability of organic solar cells. However, due to the isotropic stacking, the announced solids with symmetric geometry cannot modify the microscopic phase separation and component distribution collaboratively, which will constrain the promotion of exciton splitting and charge collection efficiency. Inspired by the superiorities of asymmetric configuration, a novel process&#8208;aid solid (PAS) engineering is proposed. By coupling with BTP core unit in Y&#8208;series molecule, an asymmetric, volatile 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5&#8208;chlorobenzene solid can induce the anisotropic dipole direction, elevated dipole moment, and interlaminar interaction spontaneously. Due to the synergetic effects on the favorable phase separation and desired component distribution, the PAS&#8208;treated devices feature the evident improvement of exciton splitting, charge transport, and collection, accompanied by the suppressed trap&#8208;assisted recombination. Consequently, an impressive fill factor of 80.2% with maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5% in the PAS&#8208;treated device is achieved. More strikingly, the PAS&#8208;treated devices demonstrate a promising thickness&#8208;tolerance character, where a record PCE of 17.0% is yielded in PAS devices with a 300&#160;nm thickness photoactive layer, which represents the highest PCE for thick&#8208;film organic solar cells.

         <title>Modularizable Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Based Open Surfaces Enable Programmable Chemical Transport and Feeding using Liquid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;infused porous surface is created as an open surface platform for droplet reactors, where the LC phase transition triggers the chemical reaction by releasing reactants from the surface. The LC surfaces also exhibit desirable levels of automation, responsiveness, controllability, and modularizability, which find potential use in a realm of droplet reactors, materials synthesis, and regenerative cell therapy.








Abstract
Droplet&#8208;based miniature reactors have attracted interest in both fundamental studies, for the unique reaction kinetics they enable, and applications in bio&#8208;diagnosis and material synthesis. However, the precise and automatic feeding of chemicals, important for the delicate reactions in these miniaturized chemical reactors, either requires complex, high&#8208;cost microfluidic devices or lacks the capability to maintain a pinning&#8208;free droplet movement. Here, the design and synthesis of a new class of liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based open surfaces, which enable a controlled chemical release via a programmable LC phase transition without sacrificing the free transport of the droplets, are reported. It is demonstrated that their intrinsic slipperiness and self&#8208;healing properties enable a modularizable assembly of LC surfaces that can be loaded with different chemicals to achieve a wide range of chemical reactions carried out within the droplets, including sequential and parallel chemical reactions, crystal growth, and polymer synthesis. Finally, an LC&#8208;based chemical feeding device is developed that can automatically control the release of chemicals to direct the simultaneous differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells into endothelial progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes. Overall, these LC surfaces exhibit desirable levels of automation, responsiveness, and controllability for use in miniature droplet carriers and reactors.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Phonon Coupling in Ferromagnetic Monolayer Chromium Tribromide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8211;phonon coupling in monolayer chromium tribromide is investigated via Raman spectroscopy in combination with first principle calculations. The experimental Curie temperature and phonon shifts are in good agreement with numerical simulations. This work demonstrates how magnetic exchange interactions affect the phonon vibrations and establishes the missing guidelines for the design of the 2D magnetic materials and related devices.








Abstract
Novel 2D magnets exhibit intrinsic electrically tunable magnetism down to the monolayer limit, which has significant value for nonvolatile memory and emerging computing device applications. In these compounds, spin&#8211;phonon coupling (SPC) typically plays a crucial role in magnetic fluctuations, magnon dissipation, and ultimately establishing long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order. However, a systematic understanding of SPC in 2D magnets that combines theory and experiment is still lacking. In this work, monolayer chromium tribromide is studied to investigate SPC in 2D magnets via Raman spectroscopy and first principle calculations. The experimental Curie temperature and phonon shifts are found to be in good agreement with the numerical simulations. Specifically, it is demonstrated how magnetic exchange interactions affect phonon vibrations, which helps establish design fundamentals for 2D magnetic materials and other related devices.

         <title>Adaptive Biosensing and Neuromorphic Classification Based on an Ambipolar Organic Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive neuromorphic sensor system can locally process and classify biosignals based on a single high&#8208;performance material. This material is an organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor (OMIEC) based on a conjugated polymer P&#8208;3O, exhibiting exceptional ambipolar transistor properties and high stability. This versatile material enables straightforward fabrication and integration of electronic components, including transistors, ambipolar inverters, memory devices, and dopamine sensors.








Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are central to bioelectronic applications such as biosensors, health&#8208;monitoring devices, and neural interfaces, and have facilitated efficient next&#8208;generation brain&#8208;inspired computing and biohybrid systems. Despite these examples, smart and adaptive circuits that can locally process and optimize biosignals have not yet been realized. Here, a tunable sensing circuit is shown that can locally modulate biologically relevant signals like electromyograms (EMGs) and electrocardiograms (ECGs), that is based on a complementary logic inverter combined with a neuromorphic memory element, and that is constructed from a single polymer mixed conductor. It is demonstrated that a small neuromorphic array based on this material effects high classification accuracy in heartbeat anomaly detection. This high&#8208;performance material allows for straightforward monolithic integration, which reduces fabrication complexity while also achieving high on/off ratios with excellent ambient p&#8208; and n&#8208;type stability in transistor performance. This material opens a route toward simple and straightforward fabrication and integration of more sophisticated adaptive circuits for future smart bioelectronics.

         <title>A Dendritic Polymer&#8208;Based Nanosystem Mediates Drug Penetration and Irreversible Endoplasmic Reticulum Stresses in Tumor via Neighboring Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile strategy based on dual&#8208;responsive nanosystem for combination therapy is developed to promote drug penetration in tumors through amplifying the neighboring effect, which may shed light on overcoming the tumor extracellular matrix barrier and eradicating solid tumors.








Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;based cancer therapeutics are generally impeded by poor drug penetration into solid tumors due to their dense tumor extracellular matrix (ECM). Herein, pH/redox&#8208;responsive dendritic polymer&#8208;based NPs are developed to amplify the neighboring effect for improving drug penetration and driving cell apoptosis via combination therapy. Pyropheophorbide a (Ppa) is conjugated with PEGylated dendritic peptides via disulfide bonds and doxorubicin (DOX) encapsulated in the conjugate to construct dual&#8208;responsive NPs, PDPP@D. Delayed released DOX and Ppa from PDPP@D exert their combination therapeutic effect to induce cell apoptosis, and then they are liberated out of dying cells to amplify the neighboring effect, resulting in their diffusion through the dense ECM and penetration into solid tumors. Transcriptome studies reveal that PDPP@D leads to irreversible stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and inhibits cell protection through blocking the IRE1&#8208;dependent survival pathway and unleashing the DR5&#8208;mediated caspase activity to promote cell death. The strategy of amplifying the neighboring effect of NPs through combination therapy may offer great potential in enhancing drug penetration and eradicating solid tumors.

         <title>A Magnetically Separable Pd Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Selective Hydrogenation of Phenylacetylene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically separable single&#8208;atom catalyst, Pd1/Ni@G, is fabricated via anchoring atomically dispersed Pd single atoms on the shell of magnetic core&#8211;shell particles that consist of a Ni&#8208;nanoparticles core and a graphene sheets shell (Ni@G). The obtained Pd1/Ni@G catalyst displays robust catalytic performance for selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene with efficient activity and selectivity, as well as good stability, and it can be promptly recycled from the liquid reaction systems due to its magnetic separability.








Abstract
Selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes plays a crucial role in the synthesis of fine chemicals. However, how to achieve high selectivity and effective separation of the catalyst and substrate while obtaining high activity is the key for this reaction. In this work, a Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst is anchored to the shell of magnetic core&#8211;shell particles that consist of a Ni&#8208;nanoparticles core and a graphene sheets shell (Ni@G) for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, delivering 93% selectivity to styrene at full conversion with a robust turnover frequency of 7074 h&#8722;1 under mild reaction conditions (303 K, 2&#160;bar H2). Moreover, the catalyst can be recovered promptly from the liquid phase due to its magnetic separability, which makes it present good stability for enduring five cycles. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that H2 and substrates are activated by atomically dispersed Pd atoms and Ni@G hybrid support, respectively. The hydrogenation reaction occurs on the surface of Ni@G via hydrogen spillover from the metal to the support. Such a strategy opens an avenue for designing highly active, selective, and magnetically recyclable catalysts for selective hydrogenation in liquid reaction systems.

         <title>The Intrinsic Thermodynamic Difficulty and a Step&#8208;Guided Mechanism for the Epitaxial Growth of Uniform Multilayer MoS2 with Controllable Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
On epitaxial substrates with moderate surface interactions, density functional theory calculations show that a step with appropriate height can not only promote simultaneous nucleation of thickness&#8208;matched MoS2 domains with aligned edges but also suppresses the nucleation of thinner MoS2 domains, by which uniform multilayer MoS2 with targeted thickness can be grown.








Abstract
Multilayer MoS2 shows superior performance over the monolayer MoS2 for electronic devices while the growth of multilayer MoS2 with controllable and uniform thickness is still very challenging. It is revealed by calculations that monolayer MoS2 domains are thermodynamically much more favorable than multilayer ones on epitaxial substrates due to the competition between surface interactions and edge formation, leading accordingly to a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth pattern and non&#8208;continuously distributed multilayer domains with uncontrollable thickness uniformity. The thermodynamics model also suggests that multilayer MoS2 domains with aligned edges can significantly reduce their free energy and represent a local minimum with very prominent energy advantage on a potential energy surface. However, the nucleation probability of multilayer MoS2 domains with aligned edges is, if not impossible, extremely rare on flat substrates. Herein, a step&#8208;guided mechanism for the growth of uniform multilayer MoS2 on an epitaxial substrate is theoretically proposed. The steps with proper height on sapphire surface are able to guide the simultaneous nucleation of multilayer MoS2 with aligned edges and uniform thickness, and promote the continuous growth of multilayer MoS2 films. The proposed mechanism can be reasonably extended to grow multilayer 2D materials with uniform thickness on epitaxial substrates.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Swelling, Robust, and Adhesive Extracellular Matrix&#8208;Mimicking Hydrogel Used as Intraoral Dressing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extracellular matrix&#8208;mimicking hydrogel wound dressing is designed as tooth extraction adhesive wound dressing for intraoral application. The hydrogel exhibits excellent anti&#8208;swelling efficiency, along with consistent mechanical and adhesive robustness in aqueous environments. In vitro and in vivo tooth extraction models demonstrate the stability of hydrogels as physical and antibacterial barriers for intraoral wounds, leading to continuous protection and effective healing acceleration.








Abstract
Due to the wet and dynamic environment of the oral cavity, the healing of intraoral wounds, such as tooth extraction wounds, requires stable and firm wound dressings. In clinical practice, cotton balls and gauzes, sponge plugs, or sutures are used to treat extraction wounds, but none of these means can continuously isolate the wound from the intraoral environment and facilitate ideal healing conditions. Herein, inspired by the natural extracellular matrix, a family of wound dressings is developed for intraoral wound repair. Infiltrating a ductile long&#8208;chain hydrogel network into a prefabricated, sturdy macromolecular meshwork and in situ crosslinking endowed the composite hydrogel with controllable swelling behaviors and robust mechanical properties. The macromolecular meshwork functioned as the backbone to support the composite and restricts the swelling of the long&#8208;chain hydrogel network. In vitro tests verified that this wound dressing can provide durable protection for intraoral wounds against complex irritations. Furthermore, accelerated wound healing occurred when the wound dressing is applied in vivo on a canine tooth extraction model, due to the effective reduction of acute inflammation. These results suggest that this family of bioinspired hydrogels has great potential for application as intraoral wound dressing.

         <title>Sequential Phase Conversion&#8208;Induced Phosphides Heteronanorod Arrays for Superior Hydrogen Evolution Performance to Pt in Wide pH Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a sequential phase conversion, Ni2P&#8208;Ni12P5 nanorods are induced from Ni3S2 nanofilm rooted on nickel foam. Benefiting from the optimized electronic structure and heterophase collaboration, such nickel phosphide exhibits unprecedented pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction activity, superior to Pt/C and nearly all the reported transition metal phosphides.








Abstract
Developing an efficient and non&#8208;precious pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst is highly desirable for hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting but remains a significant challenge. Herein, a hierarchical structure composed of heterostructured Ni2P&#8208;Ni12P5 nanorod arrays rooted on Ni3S2 film (Ni2P&#8208;Ni12P5@Ni3S2) via a simultaneous corrosion and sulfidation is built followed by a phosphidation treatment toward the metallic nickel foam. The combination of theoretical calculations with in/ex situ characterizations unveils that such a unique sequential phase conversion strategy ensures the strong interfacial coupling between Ni2P and Ni12P5 as well as the robust stabilization of 1D heteronanorod arrays by Ni3S2 film, resulting in the promoted water adsorption/dissociation energy, the optimized hydrogen adsorption energy, and the enhanced electron/proton transfer ability accompanied with an excellent stability. Consequently, Ni2P&#8208;Ni12P5@Ni3S2/NF requires only 32, 46, and 34&#160;mV overpotentials to drive 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0 m KOH, 0.5 m H2SO4, and 1.0 m phosphate&#8208;buffered saline electrolytes, respectively, exceeding almost all the previously reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work may pave a new avenue for the rational design of non&#8208;precious electrocatalysts toward pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution catalysis.

         <title>16.52% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with High Tolerance of the Photoactive Layer Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 16.52% efficiency all&#8208;polymer solar cell is achieved by morphology control of the photoactive layer through adding a low&#8208;cost polymer donor, PTQ10, into the PM6:PY&#8208;IT blend. Meanwhile, ternary devices exhibit a high tolerance of the photoactive layer thickness, with high power conversion efficiencies of 15.27% and 13.91% at photoactive layer thicknesses of &#8776;205 and &#8776;306&#160;nm, respectively.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have drawn growing attention and achieved tremendous progress recently, but their power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags behind small&#8208;molecule&#8208;acceptor (SMA)&#8208;based PSCs due to the relative difficulty on morphology control of polymer photoactive blends. Here, low&#8208;cost PTQ10 is introduced as a second polymer donor (a third component) into the PM6:PY&#8208;IT blend to finely tune the energy&#8208;level matching and microscopic morphology of the polymer blend photoactive layer. The addition of PTQ10 decreases the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, and increases the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking coherence length and the ordered face&#8208;on molecular packing orientation, which improves the charge separation and transport in the photoactive layer. Moreover, the deeper highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of the PTQ10 polymer donor than PM6 leads to higher open&#8208;circuit voltage of the ternary all&#8208;PSCs. As a result, a PCE of 16.52% is achieved for ternary all&#8208;PSCs, which is one of the highest PCEs for all&#8208;PSCs. In addition, the ternary devices exhibit a high tolerance of the photoactive layer thickness with high PCEs of 15.27% and 13.91% at photoactive layer thickness of &#8776;205 and &#8776;306&#160;nm, respectively, which are the highest PCEs so far for all&#8208;PSCs with a thick photoactive layer.

Anti&#8208;Icing
In article number 2109930, Sushant Anand and co&#8208;workers introduce a family of cryoprotectant (and phase&#8208;change material)&#8208;based compositions that show high resistance against shear&#8208;flow and dissolution&#8208;driven material loss, which are capable of exceptional anti&#8208;icing/frosting, formulation&#8208;dependent optical transparency, self&#8208;healing, and bio&#8208;friendliness, and thereby promise new multifunctional surfaces that can outperform commercial solutions.

Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts
A single&#8208;atom Fe decorated N&#8208;doped carbon catalyst (Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C), derived from an Fe&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework, is developed by Zhengyang Gao, Hai&#8208;Long Jiang, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2110123. The unique Fe1&#8208;N4 sites in Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C enable ultrahigh activity for catalytic oxidations of NO and Hg(0) at low and room temperature. The preferable adsorption of reactants enables Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C robust sulfur resistance.

In&#8208;Memory Processing
To achieve in&#8208;memory processing, the development of an ultrafast and reconfigurable multi&#8208;terminal device is required. In article number 2200122, Mohit Kumar, Hyungtak Seo, and co&#8208;workers develop a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept ultrafast (&#8776;42 ns) and programmable redox thin&#8208;film transistor, which is successfully utilized to build in&#8208;memory electronics, including logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory processing, on&#8208;demand multiterminal addressable memory, learning, pattern recognition, and classification.

Antibiofouling
Harmful microbes can grow freely on implanted medical devices such as catheters (as shown on the right). In article number 2200254, Amir Sheikhi, Richard B. Kaner, and co&#8208;workers, report a  new method to apply a robust surface coating containing zwitterions, which creates a water layer that prevents biofilm formation (as shown on the left). This can improve the safety of the medical devices and reduce patient complications. Image credit: Amir Sheikhi/Penn State.

Data&#8208;Storage Devices
In article number 2201035, Jianxing Li, Tiger H. Tao, Zhitao Zhou, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an implantable silk&#8208;based hierarchically encoded data&#8208;storage device with controlled transiency. Resistive random&#8208;access memory, terahertz metamaterials, and diffractive optical elements are vertically integrated to store electronic, photonic, and optical information. The hierarchical degradation modes realized by different solvents can greatly increase the storage capacity and information encryption.

Superlattice Heterojunctions
In article number 2110099, Cesar Moreno, Diego Pe&#241;a, Miguel Pruneda, Aitor Mugarza, and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis of an atomically precise nitrogen&#8208;doped nanoporous graphene that electronically behaves as a nanometer&#8208;scale 2D lateral superlattice heterostructure with unprecedented band discontinuities down to the single&#8208;bond limit. The atomically sharp nanoporous heterojunctions endow this nanomaterial with a multifunctionality that can be very relevant for photodetection, excitonic solar cells, water splitting, or selective nanosieving.

         <title>Biomineralized Materials as Model Systems for Structural Composites: 3D Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomineralized load&#8208;bearing materials are intrinsically 3D composites and are widely used as model systems for developing novel structural materials with improved mechanical performance. This review presents recent progress in understanding the 3D architectural design of biomineralized composites. The emerging approaches to investigate their 3D structure&#8211;mechanical property&#8211;biomimetics relationships are also discussed.








Abstract
Biomineralized materials are sophisticated material systems with hierarchical 3D material architectures, which are broadly used as model systems for fundamental mechanical, materials science, and biomimetic studies. The current knowledge of the structure of biological materials is mainly based on 2D imaging, which often impedes comprehensive and accurate understanding of the materials&#8217; intricate 3D microstructure and consequently their mechanics, functions, and bioinspired designs. The development of 3D techniques such as tomography, additive manufacturing, and 4D testing has opened pathways to study biological materials fully in 3D. This review discusses how applying 3D techniques can provide new insights into biomineralized materials that are either well known or possess complex microstructures that are challenging to understand in the 2D framework. The diverse structures of biomineralized materials are characterized based on four universal structural motifs. Nacre is selected as an example to demonstrate how the progression of knowledge from 2D to 3D can bring substantial improvements to understanding the growth mechanism, biomechanics, and bioinspired designs. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multiscale 3D tomographic techniques are discussed with a focus on their integration with 3D geometric quantification, 4D in situ experiments, and multiscale modeling. Outlook is given on the emerging approaches to investigate the synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;function&#8211;biomimetics relationship.

         <title>Non&#8208;Electrode Components for Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc Batteries: Electrolytes, Solid&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Interphase, Current Collectors, Binders, and Separators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) have received tremendous interest for large&#8208;scale grid storage. This review is the first comprehensive overview devoted to the non&#8208;electrode components in AZBs, including the understandings from the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achievements and perspectives on electrolytes, solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase, current collectors, binders, and separators. This critical review provides fresh new insights in the future development of AZBs.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) are one of the promising options for large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage owing to their safety, affordability and environmental friendliness. During the past decade, there have been remarkable advancements in the AZBs technology, which are achieved through intensive efforts not only in the area of electrode materials but also in the fundamental understandings of non&#8208;electrode components such as electrolytes, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), current collectors, binders, and separators. In particular, the breakthroughs in the non&#8208;electrode components should not be underestimated in having enabled the AZBs to attain a higher energy and power density beyond that of the conventional AZBs, proving their critical role. In this article, the recent research progress is comprehensively reviewed with respect to non&#8208;electrode components in AZBs, covering the new&#8208;type of electrolytes that have been introduced, attempts for the tailoring of SEI, and the design efforts for multi&#8208;functional current collectors, binders and separators, along with the remaining challenges associated with these non&#8208;electrode components. Finally, perspectives are discussed toward future research directions in this field. This extensive overview on the non&#8208;electrode components is expected to guide and spur further development of high&#8208;performance AZBs.

Abstract
The field of bioprinting has made significant advancements in recent years and allowed for the precise deposition of biomaterials and cells. However, within this field lies a major challenge, which is developing high resolution constructs, with complex architectures. In an effort to overcome these challenges a biofabrication technique known as vat polymerization is being increasingly investigated due to its high fabrication accuracy and control of resolution (&#181;m scale). Despite the progress made in developing hydrogel precursors for bioprinting techniques, such as extrusion&#8208;based bioprinting, there is a major lack in developing hydrogel precursor bioresins for vat polymerization. This is due to the specific unique properties and characteristics required for vat polymerization, from lithography to the latest volumetric printing. This is of major concern as the shortage of bioresins available has a significant impact on progressing this technology and exploring its full potential, including speed, resolution, and scale. Therefore, this review discusses the key requirements that need to be addressed in successfully developing a bioresin. The influence of monomer architecture and bioresin composition on printability is described, along with key fundamental parameters that can be altered to increase printing accuracy. Finally, recent advancements in bioresins are discussed together with future directions.

         <title>Materials for Implantable Surface Electrode Arrays: Current Status and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface electrode arrays record from and/or stimulate biological tissues. Existing arrays are mechanically very different from living tissues; devices use rigid and elastic materials while tissues are nonlinearly viscoelastic. Matching the mechanical properties of tissues can reduce damage to native tissue architectures and improve implant conformability. Different material groups processed and fabricated arrays for multiple are discussed.








Abstract
Surface electrode arrays are mainly fabricated from rigid or elastic materials, and precisely manipulated ductile metal films, which offer limited stretchability. However, the living tissues to which they are applied are nonlinear viscoelastic materials, which can undergo significant mechanical deformation in dynamic biological environments. Further, the same arrays and compositions are often repurposed for vastly different tissues rather than optimizing the materials and mechanical properties of the implant for the target application. By first characterizing the desired biological environment, and then designing a technology for a particular organ, surface electrode arrays may be more conformable, and offer better interfaces to tissues while causing less damage. Here, the various materials used in each component of a surface electrode array are first reviewed, and then electrically active implants in three specific biological systems, the nervous system, the muscular system, and skin, are described. Finally, the fabrication of next&#8208;generation surface arrays that overcome current limitations is discussed.

         <title>Emerging 4D Printing Strategies for Next&#8208;Generation Tissue Regeneration and Medical Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 20, May 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
4D printing is becoming a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research field that holds considerable promise for diverse applications. This article introduces fabrication technologies and transforming strategies in terms of structural design and material composition design. The various 4D inks, actuation mechanisms, and recent advances in tissue regeneration and medical devices are summarized. Finally, the main challenges and future perspectives are presented.








Abstract
The rapid development of 3D printing has led to considerable progress in the field of biomedical engineering. Notably, 4D printing provides a potential strategy to achieve a time&#8208;dependent physical change within tissue scaffolds or replicate the dynamic biological behaviors of native tissues for smart tissue regeneration and the fabrication of medical devices. The fabricated stimulus&#8208;responsive structures can offer dynamic, reprogrammable deformation or actuation to mimic complex physical, biochemical, and mechanical processes of native tissues. Although there is notable progress made in the development of the 4D printing approach for various biomedical applications, its more broad&#8208;scale adoption for clinical use and tissue engineering purposes is complicated by a notable limitation of printable smart materials and the simplistic nature of achievable responses possible with current sources of stimulation. In this review, the recent progress made in the field of 4D printing by discussing the various printing mechanisms that are achieved with great emphasis on smart ink mechanisms of 4D actuation, construct structural design, and printing technologies, is highlighted. Recent 4D&#160;printing studies which focus on the applications of tissue/organ regeneration and medical devices are then summarized. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of 4D printing are also discussed.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide with increased entropy for piezoelectric electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezoelectricity in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted considerable interest because of their excellent flexibility and high piezoelectric coefficient compared to the conventional piezoelectric bulk materials. However, the ability to regulate the piezoelectric properties is limited because the entropy is constant for certain binary TMDs other than multielement ones. Herein, in order to increase the entropy, the ternary TMDs alloy, Mo1&#8208;xWxS2 with different W concentrations, is synthesized. The W concentration in the Mo1&#8208;xWxS2 alloy can be controlled precisely in the low&#8208;supersaturation synthesis and the entropy can be tuned accordingly. The Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy (x = 0.54) has the highest configurational entropy and best piezoelectric properties such as a piezoelectric coefficient of 4.22 pm V&#8211;1 and a piezoelectric output current of 150 pA at 0.24% strain. More importantly, it can be combined into a larger package to increase the output current to 600 pA to cater to self&#8208;powered applications. Combining with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy has been demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.

         <title>Dual Ligands Strategy to Regulate the Nucleation and Growth of Lead Chromate Photoanode for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for renewable hydrogen production has been regarded as a promising solution to utilize solar energy. However, most of the photoelectrodes still suffer from poor film quality and poor charge separation properties, mainly owing to the possible formation of detrimental defects including microcracks and grain boundaries. Herein, we developed a molecular coordination engineering strategy by employing acetylacetone (Acac) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) dual ligands to regulate the nucleation and crystal growth of lead chromate (PbCrO4) photoanode, resulting in the formation of a high&#8208;quality film with large grain size, well&#8208;stitched grain boundaries and reduced oxygen vacancies defects. With these efforts, the non&#8208;radiative charge recombination was efficiently suppressed, leading to the enhancement of its charge separation efficiency from 47% to 90%. After decorating with Co&#8208;Pi co&#8208;catalyst, the PbCrO4 photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 3.15&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.23&#160;V (versus RHE under simulated AM1.5G) and an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 0.82%. Our work provides a new strategy to modulate the nucleation and growth of high&#8208;quality photoelectrodes for efficient PEC water splitting.

Abstract
High color&#8208;purity blue and green organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been resolved thanks to the development of B/N&#8208;based polycyclic multiple resonance (MR) emitters. However, due to the derivatization limit of B/N polycyclic structures, the design of red MR emitters remains challenging. Herein, we report a series of novel red MR emitters by para&#8208;positioning N&#8208;&#960;&#8208;N, O&#8208;&#960;&#8208;O, B&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B pairs onto a benzene ring to construct a MR central core.

Moreover, these red MR emitters display excellent photophysical properties such as near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), fast radiative decay rate (kr) up to 7.4 &#8569; 107 s&#8722;1, and most importantly, narrowband emission with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 32&#160;nm. Incorporating these MR emitters, pure red OLEDs sensitized by phosphor realize state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performances with external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 36%, ultra&#8208;low efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE remains as high as 25.1% at the brightness of 50000&#160;cd m&#8722;2), ultra&#8208;high brightness over 130000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, together with good device lifetime.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High color-purity blue and green organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been resolved thanks to the development of B/N-based polycyclic multiple resonance (MR) emitters. However, due to the derivatization limit of B/N polycyclic structures, the design of red MR emitters remains challenging. Herein, we report a series of novel red MR emitters by &lt;i&gt;para-&lt;/i&gt;positioning N-&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-N, O-&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-O, B-&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-B pairs onto a benzene ring to construct a MR central core. These emitters can be facilely and modularly synthesized, allowing for easy fine-tuning of emission spectra by peripheral groups. Moreover, these red MR emitters display excellent photophysical properties such as near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), fast radiative decay rate (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) up to 7.4 &#8569; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and most importantly, narrowband emission with full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 32&#160;nm. Incorporating these MR emitters, pure red OLEDs sensitized by phosphor realize state-of-the-art device performances with external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 36%, ultra-low efficiency roll-off (EQE remains as high as 25.1% at the brightness of 50000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), ultra-high brightness over 130000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, together with good device lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Methylcellulose/MXene Hybrids with Greatly Enhanced Electrochemical Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ti3C2Tx MXene film is promising for electrochemical actuators due to its high electrical conductivity and volumetric capacitance. However, its actuation performance is limited by the slow ion diffusion through the film and poor mechanical property in aqueous electrolytes. Here, molecular&#8208;level methylcellulose/MXene hybrid films are assembled with obviously enlarged layer distance, improved wet strength and ambient stability. The hybrid films show significantly higher in&#8208;plane actuation strain in a liquid electrolyte. Based on direct strain measurements, in&#8208;situ XRD and ex&#8208;situ XPS analyses, the actuation enhancement can be ascribed to the enlarged layer distance allowing more water and ions to be intercalated/deintercalated and methylcellulose&#8208;induced sliding of MXene sheets. The assembled soft actuator has a high Young's modulus of 1.93&#160;GPa and can be operated in air, generating a peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain difference up to 0.541% under a triangular wave voltage of &#177;1&#160;V&#160;and a blocking force of 4.7 times its own weight.

         <title>A Bionic Interface to Suppressing the Coffee&#8208;ring Effect for Reliable and Flexible Perovskite Modules with a near 90% Yield Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The inhomogeneity, poor interfacial contact and pin&#8208;holes caused by the coffee&#8208;ring effect severely affect the printing reliability of flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, inspired by the bio&#8208;glue of barnacles, a bionic interface layer (Bio&#8208;IL) of NiOx/levodopa is introduced to suppress the coffee&#8208;ring effect during printing perovskite modules. The coordination effect of the sticky functional groups in Bio&#8208;IL can pinning the three&#8208;phase contact line and restrain the transport of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing and evaporation process. Moreover, the sedimentation rate of perovskite precursor is accelerated due to the electrostatic attraction and rapid volatilization from an extraordinary wettability. The super&#8208;hydrophilic Bio&#8208;IL affords an even spread over a large&#8208;area substrate, which boosts a complete and uniform liquid film for heterogeneous nucleation as well as crystallization. Perovskite films on different large&#8208;area substrates with negligible coffee&#8208;ring effect are printed. Consequently, the inverted flexible PSCs and perovskite solar modules achieve a high efficiency of 21.08% and 16.87%, respectively. This strategy ensures a highly reliable reproducibility of printing PSCs with a near 90% yield rate.

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Potassium Metal Battery Enabled by Directly Grown Graphene Modulated Aluminum Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Potassium (K) metal batteries have emerged as a promising energy&#8208;storage device owing to abundant K resources. An anode&#8208;free architecture that bypasses the need for anode host materials can deliver an elevated energy density. However, the poor efficiency of K plating/stripping on potassiophobic anode current collectors results in rapid K inventory loss and a short cycle life. Herein, commercial Al foils are decorated with an ultrathin graphene&#8208;modified layer (Al@G) through roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). By harnessing strong adhesion (10.52 N m&#8722;1) and a high surface energy (66.6 mJ m&#8211;2), the designed Al@G structure ensures a highly smooth and ordered K plating/stripping process. Consequently, during K&#8208;metal plating/stripping, Al@G can operate at a current density of up to 4.0&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and cyclic capacity of up to 4.0 mAh cm&#8211;2, with an ultralong lifespan of up to 1000 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and stable cycling of up to 750 h under periodic current fluctuations of 0.1&#8211;2.0&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. In addition, a novel anode&#8208;free K&#8208;metal full&#8208;cell prototype enabled by Al@G anode current collectors is constructed, demonstrating ameliorative cyclic stability.

         <title>Responsive Hydrogel Based on Triggered Click Reaction for Liver Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Globally, liver cancer, which is one of the major cancers worldwide, has attracted the growing attention of technological researchers for its high mortality and limited treatment options. Hydrogel is a soft three&#8208;dimensional network material containing a large number of hydrophilic monomers. By adding moieties such as nitrobenzyl groups to the network structure of the cross&#8208;linked nanocomposite hydrogel, the click reaction improves the drug release efficiency in vivo will improve the survival rate and prolong the survival time of the liver cancer patients. The application of a nanocomposite hydrogel drug delivery system can not only enrich the drug concentration at the tumor site for a long time but also effectively prevent the distant metastasis of residual tumor cells. At present, a large number of researches have been applied to the construction of responsive nanocomposite hydrogel drug delivery systems, but there are few comprehensive articles to systematically summarize these discoveries. Here, this systematic review concludes the synthesis methods and related applications of nanocomposite responsive hydrogels with actions to external or internal physiological stimuli. With different physical or chemical stimuli, the structural unit rearrangement and the controlled release of drugs can be used for responsive drug delivery in different states.

         <title>Dangling Octahedra Enable Edge States in 2D Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The structural reconstruction at the crystal layer edges of 2D lead halide perovskites (LHPs) leads to unique edge states (ES) which are manifested by prolonged carrier lifetime and reduced emission energy. These special ES could effectively enhance the optoelectronic performance of devices, but their intrinsic origin and working mechanism remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that the ES of a family of 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper LHPs [BA2CsPb2Br7, BA2MAPb2Br7 and BA2MA2Pb3Br10 (BA = butylammonium; MA = methylammonium)] arise from the rotational symmetry elevation of the PbBr6 octahedra dangling at the crystal layer edges. These dangling octahedra give rise to localized electronic states that enable an effective transport of electrons from the interior to layer edges, and the population of electrons in both the intrinsic states and ES can be manipulated via controlling the external fields. Moreover, the abundant phonons, activated by the dangling octahedra, can interact with electrons to facilitate radiative recombination, counterintuitive to the suppressive role commonly observed in conventional semiconductors. This work unveils the intrinsic atomistic and electronic origins of ES in 2D LHPs, which could stimulate the exploration of ES&#8208;based exotic optoelectronic properties and corresponding design of high&#8208;performance devices for these emergent low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors.

Here we demonstrate that the ES of a family of 2D Ruddlesden-Popper LHPs [BA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CsPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, BA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MAPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and BA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (BA = butylammonium; MA = methylammonium)] arise from the rotational symmetry elevation of the PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra dangling at the crystal layer edges. These dangling octahedra give rise to localized electronic states that enable an effective transport of electrons from the interior to layer edges, and the population of electrons in both the intrinsic states and ES can be manipulated via controlling the external fields. Moreover, the abundant phonons, activated by the dangling octahedra, can interact with electrons to facilitate radiative recombination, counterintuitive to the suppressive role commonly observed in conventional semiconductors. This work unveils the intrinsic atomistic and electronic origins of ES in 2D LHPs, which could stimulate the exploration of ES-based exotic optoelectronic properties and corresponding design of high-performance devices for these emergent low-dimensional semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Giant Negative Magnetoresistance beyond Chiral Anomaly in Topological Material YCuAs2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Large negative magnetoresistance (MR) effect, which usually emerges in various magnetic systems, is a technologically important property for spintronics. Recently, the so&#8208;called &#8220;chiral anomaly&#8221; in topological semimetals offers an alternative to generate considerable negative MR effect without utilizing magnetism. However, it requires that the applied magnetic field must be strictly along the electric current direction, which sets a strong limit for practical applications. Here, we discover a giant negative MR effect with a value of up to &#8208;40% in 9 T at 2 K in a nonmagnetic Dirac material YCuAs2, which is not restricted to the specific configuration for applied magnetic fields. Based on magnetic susceptibility and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, the giant negative MR effect is tightly connected with the unexpected spin&#8208;dependent scattering from vacancy&#8208;induced local moments, which is also beyond classical Kondo effect. The present work not only offers an alternative route for spintronics based on nonmagnetic topological materials, but also helps to further understand the negative MR effect in topological materials.

         <title>Coupling Lipid Nanoparticle Structure and Automated Single&#8208;Particle Composition Analysis to Design Phospholipase&#8208;Responsive Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structured lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are characterized using Raman, X&#8208;ray, and neutron scattering to quantify the activity of the enzyme phospholipase D (PLD). Combining single&#8208;particle and bulk analysis for static and dynamic systems enables a label&#8208;free dynamic monitoring of PLD activity in LNPs. This demonstrates that particle structure drives the interaction of lipid nanocarriers with PLD.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are versatile structures with tunable physicochemical properties that are ideally suited as a platform for vaccine delivery and RNA therapeutics. A key barrier to LNP rational design is the inability to relate composition and structure to intracellular processing and function. Here Single Particle Automated Raman Trapping Analysis (SPARTA) is combined with small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS) techniques to link LNP composition with internal structure and morphology and to monitor dynamic LNP&#8211;phospholipase D (PLD) interactions. This analysis demonstrates that PLD, a key intracellular trafficking mediator, can access the entire LNP lipid membrane to generate stable, anionic LNPs. PLD activity on vesicles with matched amounts of enzyme substrate is&#160;an order of magnitude lower, indicating that the LNP lipid membrane structure can be used to control enzyme interactions. This represents an opportunity to design enzyme&#8208;responsive LNP solutions for stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery and diseases where PLD is dysregulated.

         <title>Mesopore&#8211;rich Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst with FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NC Single Atom Sites Delivers Remarkable Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance in Alkaline Media</title>

Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts offer excellent performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. With a view towards boosting the intrinsic ORR activity of Fe single atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts, fine&#8208;tuning the local coordination of Fe sites to optimize the binding energies of ORR intermediates is imperative. Here we report the successful synthesis of a porous FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR electrocatalyst rich in catalytically accessible FeN4&#8211;O sites (wherein the Fe single atoms are coordinated to four in&#8208;plane nitrogen atoms and one subsurface axial oxygen atom) supported on N&#8208;doped carbon nanorods (NCR). Fe K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) verified the presence of FeN4&#8211;O active sites in FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR, whilst density functional theory calculations revealed that the FeN4&#8211;O coordination offered a lower energy and more selective 4&#8208;electron/4&#8208;proton ORR pathway compared to traditional FeN4 sites. Electrochemical tests validated the outstanding intrinsic activity of FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR for alkaline ORR, outperforming both Pt/C and almost all other M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts reported to date. A primary zinc&#8208;air battery constructed using FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR delivered a peak power density of 214.2&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 334.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, highlighting the benefits of fine&#8208;tuning the local coordination of the iron single atoms.

         <title>Advances on thermal conductive epoxy&#8208;based composites as electronic packaging underfill materials &#8211; A review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The integrated circuits (ICs) industry has been continuously producing micro&#8208;electronic components with ever higher integration level, packaging density and power density, which demand more stringent requirements for heat dissipation. Electronic packaging materials are used to pack these microelectronic components together, help to dissipate heat, redistribute stresses, and protect the whole system from the environment. They serve an important role in ensuring the performance and reliability of the electronic devices. Among various packaging materials, epoxy&#8208;based underfills are often employed in flip&#8208;chip packaging. However, widely used capillary underfill materials suffer from their low thermal conductivity, unable to meet the growing heat dissipation required of next&#8208;generation IC chips with much higher power density. Despite many strategies have been proposed to improve the thermal conductivity of epoxy, its application as underfill materials with complex performance requirements is still difficult. In fact, optimizing the combined thermal&#8208;electrical&#8208;mechanical&#8208;processing properties of underfill materials for flip&#8208;chip packaging remains a great challenge. Herein, we review state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances that have been made to satisfy the key requirements of capillary underfill materials. Based on these studies, we provide the perspectives for designing high&#8208;performance underfill materials with novel microstructures in electronic packaging for high&#8208;power density electronic devices.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Green OLED with 4500 hours Lifetime and 20% External Quantum Efficiency by Optimizing the Emission Zone Using A Single&#8208;Emission Spectrum Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Device optimization of LEDs targets the most efficient conversion of electrically injected charges into emitted light. The emission zone in an LED is where charges recombine and light is emitted from. It is believed that the emission zone is strongly linked to device efficiency and lifetime. However, the emission zone size is below the optical diffraction limit, so it has been difficult to measure. An accessible method based on a single emission spectrum which enables emission zone measurements with sub&#8208;second time resolution is shown. A procedure is introduced to study and control the emission zone of an LED system and correlate it with device performance. A thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic LED emission zone is experimentally measured over all luminescing current densities, while varying the device structure and while ageing. The emission zone is shown to be finely controlled by emitter doping because electron transport via the emitter is the charge transport bottleneck of the system. Suspected quenching/degradation mechanisms are linked with the emission zone changes, device structure variation and ageing. Using these findings, a device with an ultralong 4500 hour T95 lifetime at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 with 20% external quantum efficiency is shown.

Using these findings, a device with an ultralong 4500 hour T&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt; lifetime at 1000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 20% external quantum efficiency is shown.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Realizing photoactive and thermodynamically stable all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells remains a challenging task within halide perovskite photovoltaic research.[11] Here, we report a dual strategy for realizing efficient inorganic mixed halide perovskite photovoltaic devices based on a terbium doped solar absorber, i.e., CsPb1&#8208;xTbxI2Br, which undertakes a bulk and surface passivation treatment in the form of CsPb1&#8208;xTbxI2Br quantum dots (QDs), to maintain a photoactive &#947;&#8208;phase under ambient conditions and with significantly improved operational stability. Devices fabricated from our air&#8208;processed perovskite thin films exhibit an air&#8208;stable power conversion efficiency (PCE) that reaches 17.51% (small area devices) with negligible hysteresis and maintains &gt;90%&#160;of the initial efficiency when operating for 600 hours under harsh environmental conditions, stemming from the combined effects of the dual&#8208;protection strategy. Our approach is further examined within large&#8208;area perovskite solar cell modules (19.8 cm2 active area) to realize 10.94% PCE and &gt;30&#160;days ambient stability, as well as within low&#8208;band gap &#947;&#8208;CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2.5Br0.5 (Eg = 1.73&#160;eV) materials, yielding 19.01% (18.43% certified) PCE.

         <title>Transparent, High&#8208;Performance and Stable Sb2S3 Photoanode Enabled by Heterojunction Engineering with Conjugated Polycarbazole Frameworks for Unbiased Photoelectrochemical Overall Water Splitting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and durable photoanodes is essential in solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) energy conversion. Sb2S3 is a low&#8208;bandgap (&#8764;1.7&#160;eV) n&#8208;type semiconductor with a maximum theoretical solar conversion efficiency of &#8764;28% for PEC water splitting. However, bulk Sb2S3 exhibits opaque characteristics and suffers from severe photocorrosion, and thus the use of Sb2S3 as a photoanode material remains underexploited. This study describes the design and fabrication of a transparent Sb2S3&#8208;based photoanode by conformably depositing a thin layer of conjugated polycarbazole frameworks (CPF&#8208;TCzB) onto the Sb2S3 film. This structural design creates a type&#8208;II heterojunction between CPF&#8208;TCzB and Sb2S3 with a suitable band&#8208;edge energy offset, thereby greatly enhancing the charge separation efficiency. The CPF&#8208;TCzB/Sb2S3 hybrid photoanode can exhibit a remarkable photocurrent density of 10.1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus RHE. Moreover, the thin CPF&#8208;TCzB overlayer effectively inhibits photocorrosion of Sb2S3 and enables long&#8208;term operation for at least 100 h with &#8776;10% loss in photocurrent density. Furthermore, a standalone unbiased PEC tandem device comprised of the CPF&#8208;TCzB/Sb2S3 photoanode and a back&#8208;illuminated Si photocathode can achieve a record solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 5.21%, representing the most efficient PEC water splitting device of its kind.

         <title>Surface Oxygen Vacancies Confined by Ferroelectric Polarization for Tunable CO Oxidation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Surface oxygen vacancies have been widely discussed to be crucial for tailoring the activity of various chemical reactions from CO, NO to water oxidation by using oxide&#8208;supported catalysts. However, the real role and potential function of surface oxygen vacancies in the reaction remains unclear because of their very short life&#8208;time. Here we report that surface oxygen vacancies can be well confined electrostatically for a polarization screening near the perimeter interface between Pt {111} nanocrystals and the negative polar surface (001) of ferroelectric PbTiO3. Strikingly, such a catalyst demonstrates a tunable catalytic CO oxidation kinetics from 200&#160;&#176;C to near room temperature by increasing O2 gas pressure, accompanied with the conversion curve from a hysteresis&#8208;free loop to hysteresis one. The combination of reaction kinetics, electronic energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicates that the oxygen vacancies stabilized by the negative polar surface are the active sites for O2 adsorption as a rate&#8208;determining step and then dissociated O moves to the surface of Pt nanocrystals for oxidizing adsorbed CO. Our results open a new pathway for tunable catalytic activity of CO oxidation.

         <title>General Synthesis and Solution Processing of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
By virtue of their extraordinarily high surface areas, ordered pore structures, various compositions and rich functionality, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are of great interest in diverse fields such as gas separation, sensing, catalysis, energy, environment science and biomedicine. However, the difficulty in processing MOF crystals and controlling the superstructure of MOFs is emerging as critical issue in their application. Herein, we report that a robust template, i.e., nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), can be used for the synthesis of MOF materials with one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanofiber morphology. The NFC@MOF core&#8208;shell nanofibers with a uniform network structure and high aspect ratios can be prepared by use of this template. The small crystal size, flexibility and good dispersity of NFC@MOF nanofibers make it convenient for macroscale assembly and solution processing of MOF materials. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study has been demonstrated that free&#8208;standing MOF nanofiber membranes represent good performance in applications of water treatment and heterogeneous catalysis reaction. This general synthesis and solution processing strategy may herald a new era in promoting the industrial application of MOFs.

         <title>Nanoscale antiferromagnetic domain imaging using full&#8208;field resonant x&#8208;ray magnetic diffraction microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The physical properties of magnetic materials frequently depend not only on the microscopic spin and electronic structures, but also on the structures of mesoscopic length scales that emerge, for instance, from domain formations, chemical and/or electronic phase separations. However, experimental access to such mesoscopic structures is currently limited, especially for antiferromagnets (AF) with net zero magnetizations. Here, we combine full&#8208;field microscopy and resonant magnetic x&#8208;ray diffraction to visualize AF domains of the spin&#8208;orbit Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 over &#8764;0.1 mm2 area with the spatial resolution as high as &#8764;150&#160;nm. With the unprecedented wide field of views and high spatial resolutions, we reveal an intertwining of two AF domains on a length comparable to the measured average AF domain wall width of 545&#160;nm. This mesoscopic structure comprises a substantial portion of the sample surface, and thus can result in a macroscopic response that is unexpected from its microscopic magnetic structure. In particular, our symmetry analysis shows that the inversion symmetry, which is preserved by the microscopic AF order, becomes ill defined in the mesoscopic length scale. This result underscores the importance of our novel technique for a thorough understanding of the physical properties of antiferromagnets.

With the unprecedented wide field of views and high spatial resolutions, we reveal an intertwining of two AF domains on a length comparable to the measured average AF domain wall width of 545&#160;nm. This mesoscopic structure comprises a substantial portion of the sample surface, and thus can result in a macroscopic response that is unexpected from its microscopic magnetic structure. In particular, our symmetry analysis shows that the inversion symmetry, which is preserved by the microscopic AF order, becomes ill defined in the mesoscopic length scale. This result underscores the importance of our novel technique for a thorough understanding of the physical properties of antiferromagnets.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Electronic waste carries energetic costs and an environmental burden rivaling that of plastic waste due to the rarity and toxicity of the heavy metal components. We introduce recyclable conductive composites for printed circuits formulated with polycaprolactone (PCL), conductive fillers, and enzyme/protectant nanoclusters. Circuits can be printed with flexibility (breaking strain &#8764;80%) and conductivity (&#8764;2.1&#160;&#215; 104 S/m). These composites are degraded at the end&#8208;of&#8208;life by immersion in warm water with programmable latency. &#8764;94% of the functional fillers can be recycled and reused with similar device performance. The printed circuits remain functional and degradable after at least 7&#8208;month shelf storage at room temperature and one month of continuous operation under electrical voltage. The present studies provide composite design toward recyclable and easily disposable printed electronics for applications such as wearable electronics, biosensors, and soft robotics.

         <title>Strain Modulation for Light&#8208;Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain modulation strategy to constrain phase segregation in a wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorber by reinforcing the energy barrier for ion migration is reported. With compressive strain, the single&#8208;junction devices yield one of smallest voltage deficits of 440 mV. Moreover, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells achieve a champion efficiency of 26.95% with improved light stability at open&#8208;circuit.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising to penetrate photovoltaic market. However, the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorbers used in top&#8208;cell often suffer severe phase segregation under illumination, which restricts the operation lifetime of tandem solar cells. Here, a strain modulation strategy to fabricate light&#8208;stable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is reported. By employing adenosine triphosphate, the residual tensile strain in the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorber is successfully converted to compressive strain, which mitigates light&#8208;induced ion migration and phase segregation. Based on the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite with compressive strain, single&#8208;junction solar cells with the n&#8211;i&#8211;p layout yield a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.53% with the smallest voltage deficits of 440&#160;mV. These cells also maintain 83.60% of initial PCE after 2500 h operation at the maximum power point. Finally, these top cells are integrated with silicon bottom cells in a monolithic tandem device, which achieves a PCE of 26.95% and improved light stability at open&#8208;circuit.

         <title>Nontrivial Doping Evolution of Electronic Properties in Ising&#8208;Superconducting Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the feasibility of synthesizing stable aliovalent alloys of transition metal dichalcogenide materials in the single&#8208;layer limit throughout the entire alloy composition range. Furthermore, an experimental and theoretical atomic&#8208;scale characterization of the evolution of the electronic ground state (both the electronic structure and collective electronic phases) of a 2D Ising superconductor (single&#8208;layer NbSe2) with structural disorder is reported.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides offer unprecedented versatility to engineer 2D materials with tailored properties to explore novel structural and electronic phase transitions. In this work, the atomic&#8208;scale evolution of the electronic ground state of a monolayer of Nb1&#8722;&#948;Mo&#948;Se2 across the entire alloy composition range (0 &lt; &#948;&#160;&lt; 1) is investigated using low&#8208;temperature (300 mK) scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). In particular, the atomic and electronic structure of this 2D alloy throughout the metal to semiconductor transition (monolayer NbSe2 to MoSe2) is studied. The measurements enable extraction of the effective doping of Mo atoms, the bandgap evolution and the band shifts, which are monotonic with &#948;. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that collective electronic phases (charge density wave and superconductivity) are remarkably robust against disorder and further shown that the superconducting TC changes non&#8208;monotonically with doping. This contrasting behavior in the normal and superconducting state is explained using first&#8208;principles calculations. Mo doping is shown to decrease the density of states at the Fermi level and the magnitude of pair&#8208;breaking spin fluctuations as a function of Mo content. These results paint a detailed picture of the electronic structure evolution in 2D TMD alloys, which is of utmost relevance for future 2D materials design.

         <title>Open&#8208;Environment Tactile Sensing System: Towards Simple and Efficient Material Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Robotic perception can have simple and effective sensing functions that are unreachable for humans using only the isolated tactile perception method, with the assistance of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). However, the reliability of triboelectric sensors remains a major challenge due to the inherent environmental limitations. Here, an intelligent tactile sensing system that combines TENG and deep learning technology is proposed. Using a triboelectric triple tactile sensor (TTS) array, typical characteristics of each testing material can be maintained stably even under different contact conditions (touch conditions and external environmental conditions) by extracting features from three independent electrical signals as well as the normalized output signals. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is integrated, and a high accuracy of 96.62% is achieved in a material identification task. Our tactile sensing system has been exhibited to an open environment for material identification and the real&#8208;time demonstration. Compared to the complex process that humans must integrate multiple sensing (touching and viewing) to accomplish tactile perception, the proposed sensing system shows a huge advantage in cognitive learning for the visually impaired, biomimetic prosthetics, and virtual spaces construction.

         <title>Dendrimersome synthetic cells harbor cell division machinery of bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The integration of active cell machinery with synthetic building blocks is the bridge towards developing synthetic cells with biological functions and beyond. Self&#8208;replication is one of the most important tasks of living systems, and various complex machineries exist to execute it. In E. coli, a contractile division ring is positioned to mid&#8208;cell by concentration oscillations of self&#8208;organizing proteins (MinCDE), where it severs membrane and cell wall. So far, the reconstitution of any cell division machinery has been exclusively tied to liposomes. Here we show the reconstitution of a rudimentary bacterial divisome in fully synthetic bicomponent dendrimersomes. By tuning the membrane composition, the interaction of biological machinery with synthetic membranes can be tailored to reproduce its dynamic behavior. This constitutes an important breakthrough in the assembly of synthetic cells with biological elements, as tuning of membrane&#8208;divisome interactions is the key to engineer emergent biological behavior from the bottom&#8208;up.

         <title>An Anode&#8208;free Zn&#8208;graphite Battery</title>

Abstract
Anode&#8208;free battery concept was proposed to pursue the aspiration of energy&#8208;dense, rechargeable metal batteries, but this has not been achieved with dual&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we demonstrate the first anode&#8208;free Zn&#8208;graphite battery enabled by efficient Zn plating&#8208;stripping onto silver&#8208;coated Cu substrate. The silver coating guides uniform Zn deposition without dendrite formation or side reaction over a wide range of electrolyte concentrations, enabling the construction of anode&#8208;free Zn cells. In addition, the graphite cathode operates efficiently under reversible bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI&#8722;) intercalation without anodic corrosion. An extra high&#8208;potential TFSI&#8208; intercalation plateau is recognized at 2.75&#160;V, contributing to the high capacity of graphite cathode. Thanks to efficient Zn plating&#8208;stripping and TFSI&#8722; intercalation&#8208;deintercalation, we construct the anode&#8208;free Zn&#8208;graphite dual&#8208;ion battery that exhibits impressive cycling stability with 82% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. At the same time, a specific energy of 79&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the mass of cathode and electrolyte is achieved, which is over two times higher than conventional Zn&#8208;graphite batteries (&lt;30&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1).

         <title>Quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals Antiferromagnetic CrZr4Te14 with Large In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Negative Magnetoresistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered CrZr4Te14 is constructed of [CrTe2] and [ZrTe3] chains along the b&#8208;axis. The intrachain magnetic coupling of the [CrTe2] chain is ferromagnetic, while the opposite magnetic ordering between the chains makes CrZr4Te14 an antiferromagnet. Moreover, CrZr4Te14 shows large intrinsic negative magnetoresistence of &#8722;56%, and the in&#8208;plane anisotropic factor reaches 8.2 owing to the ferromagnetic [CrTe2] chains.








Abstract
The discovery of 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials is of great significance to explore intriguing 2D magnetic physics and develop innovative spintronic devices. In this work, a new quasi&#8208;1D vdW layered compound CrZr4Te14 is successfully synthesized. Owing to the existence of 1D [CrTe2] and [ZrTe3] chains along the b&#8208;axis, CrZr4Te14 crystals show strong anisotropy of phonon vibrations, electrical transport, and magnetism. Density functional theory calculations reveal the ferromagnetic (FM) coupling within the [CrTe2] chain, while the interchain and interlayer couplings are both weakly antiferromagnetic (AF). Notably, a large intrinsic negative magnetoresistance (nMR) of &#8722;56% is achieved at 2 K under 9 T, and the in&#8208;plane anisotropic factor of nMR can reach up to 8.2 in the CrZr4Te14 device. The 1D FM chains and anisotropic nMR effect make CrZr4Te14 an interesting platform for exploring novel polarization&#8208;sensitive spintronics.

         <title>Origin of the 2D Electron Gas at the SrTiO3 Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D electron gas at the surface of SrTiO3 (001) can be turned on and off by depositing either SrO or TiO2, which is observed by a combination of oxide molecular beam epitaxy with in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray scattering and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Either way, the surface remains TiO2&#8208;terminated.








Abstract
Bulk SrTiO3 is a well&#8208;known band insulator and the most common substrate used in the field of complex oxide heterostructures. Its surface and interface with other oxides, however, have demonstrated a variety of remarkable behaviors distinct from those expected. In this work, using a suite of in situ techniques to monitor both the atomic and electronic structures of the SrTiO3 (001) surface prior to and during growth, the disappearance and re&#8208;appearance of a 2D electron gas (2DEG) is observed after the completion of each SrO and TiO2 monolayer, respectively. The 2DEG is identified with the TiO2 double layer present at the initial SrTiO3 surface, which gives rise to a surface potential and mobile electrons due to vacancies within the TiO2&#8722;x adlayer. Much like the electronic reconstruction discovered in other systems, two atomic planes are required, here supplied by the double layer. The combined in situ scattering/spectroscopy findings resolve a number of longstanding issues associated with complex oxide interfaces, facilitating the employment of atomic&#8208;scale defect engineering in oxide&#160;electronics.

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Functionalized n&#8208;Type Polymer with High Electron Mobility for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>
Cyano functionalization of thienylene&#8211;vinylene&#8211;thienylene donor unit in n&#8208;type polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCN leads to simultaneously enhanced ion&#8208;uptake ability, film structural order, and charge&#8208;transport property compared to its non&#8208;cyanated analogue, subsequently enabling a record&#8208;high &#956;e,OECT of 0.24 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and &#181;C* of 41.3 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in n&#8208;type OECTs.








Abstract
n&#8208;Type organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) with high electron mobility are scarce and highly challenging to develop. As a result, the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#181;C*) of n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) lags far behind the p&#8208;type analogs, restraining the development of OECT&#8208;based low&#8208;power complementary circuits and biosensors. Here, two n&#8208;type donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) polymers based on fused bithiophene imide dimer f&#8208;BTI2 as the acceptor unit and thienylene&#8211;vinylene&#8211;thienylene (TVT) as the donor co&#8208;unit are reported. The cyanation of TVT enables polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCN with simultaneously enhanced ion&#8208;uptake ability, film structural order, and charge&#8208;transport property. As a result, it is able to obtain a high volumetric capacitance (C*) of 170&#160;&#177;&#160;22&#160;F cm&#8722;3 and a record OECT electron mobility (&#956;e,OECT) of 0.24 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCN, subsequently achieving a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#181;C* of 41.3 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm) of 12.8 S cm&#8722;1 in n&#8208;type accumulation&#8208;mode OECTs. In contrast, only a moderate &#181;C* of 1.50 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is measured for the non&#8208;cyanated polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVT. These remarkable results demonstrate the great power of cyano functionalization of polymer semiconductors in developing n&#8208;type OMIECs with substantial electron mobility in aqueous environment for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OECTs.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes utilizing a Europium&#8208;Activated Calcium Oxide Phosphor with External Quantum Efficiency of up to 54.7%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoluminescence quantum efficiency of a CaO:Eu NIR phosphor is significantly improved and stabilized at high temperature. By utilizing GeO2 decomposition, the oxygen vacancies in the CaO lattice are effectively repaired. A record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 54.7% at 740 nm is obtained with a thermal stability greatly improved from 57% to 90% at 125&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence materials with broadband emissions are necessary for the development of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based light sources. However, most known NIR&#8208;emitting materials are limited by their low external quantum efficiency. This work demonstrates how the photoluminescence quantum efficiency of europium&#8208;activated calcium oxide (CaO:Eu) NIR phosphor can be significantly improved and stabilized at operating temperatures of LEDs. A carbon paper wrapping technology is innovatively developed and used during the solid&#8208;state sintering to promote the reduction of Eu3+ into Eu2+. In parallel, the oxygen vacancies in the CaO lattice are repaired utilizing GeO2 decomposition. Through this process, a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 54.7% at 740 nm is obtained with a thermal stability greatly improved from 57% to 90% at 125&#160;&#176;C. The as&#8208;fabricated NIR&#8208;LEDs reach record photoelectric efficiency (100 mA@23.4%) and output power (100 mA&#8202;@&#8202;319.5 mW). This discovery of high&#8208;performance phosphors will open new research avenues for broadband NIR LED light sources in a variety of photonics applications.

         <title>Triggering the Lattice Oxygen Activation of Single&#8208;atomic Mo Sites Anchored Ni&#8208;Fe Oxyhydroxides Nanoarrays for Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>

Abstract
Tuning the reactivity of lattice oxygen is of significance for lowering the energy barriers and accelerating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, single&#8208;atomic Mo sites were anchored on Ni&#8208;Fe oxyhydroxides nanoarrays by a facile MOFs&#8208;derived strategy, exhibiting superior performance towards OER in alkaline media. The in&#8208;situ electrochemical spectroscopies and the isotope labeling experiments reveal the involvement of lattice oxygen during OER cycles. Combining the theoretical and experimental investigation of electronic configuration, it is comprehensively confirmed that the incorporation of single&#8208;atomic Mo sites enables the higher oxidation state of metal and the strengthened metal&#8208;oxygen hybridization, as well as the formation of oxidized ligand holes above Fermi level. In a word, the considerable acceleration of water oxidation is achieved via enhancing the reactivity of lattice oxygen and triggering the lattice oxygen activation. This work may provide new insights for designing ideal electrocatalysts via tuning the chemical state and activating the anions ligands.

         <title>Photoinduced Multi&#8208;Bit Nonvolatile Memory Based on a van der Waals Heterostructure with a 2D&#8208;Perovskite Floating Gate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D perovskite is applied as a charge&#8208;trapping and photosensitive layer in floating&#8208;gate non&#8208;volatile optoelectronic memory, demonstrating superior performance and multi&#8208;bit negative photoconductivity (NPC)/positive photoconductivity (PPC) behavior with low optical switching power.








Abstract
The development of floating&#8208;gate nonvolatile memory (FGNVM) is limited by the charge storage, retention and transfer ability of the charge&#8208;trapping layer. Here, it is demonstrated that due to the unique alternate inorganic/organic chain structure and superior optical sensitivity, an insulating 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite (2D&#8208;RPP) layer can function both as an excellent charge&#8208;storage layer and a photosensitive layer. Optoelectronic memory composed of a MoS2/hBN/2D&#8208;RPP (MBR) van der Waals heterostructure is demonstrated. The MBR device exhibits unique light&#8208;controlled charge&#8208;storage characteristics, with maximum memory window up to 92&#160;V, high on/off ratio of 104, negligible degeneration over 103&#160;s, &gt;1000 program/erase cycles, and write speed of 500&#160;&#181;s. Dependent on the initial states, the MBR optoelectronic memory can be programmed in both positive photoconductivity (PPC) and negative photoconductivity (NPC) modes, with up to 11 and 22 distinct resistance states, respectively. The optical program power for each bit is as low as 36/10&#160;pJ for PPC/NPC. The results not only reveal the potential of 2D&#8208;RPP as a superior charge&#8208;storage medium in floating&#8208;gate memory, but also provides an effective strategy toward fast, low&#8208;power and stable optical multi&#8208;bit storage and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Recyclable and Reusable Natural Plant&#8208;Based Paper for Repeated Digital Printing and Unprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eco&#8208;friendly and in situ recyclable alternative to current wood&#8208;derived printing paper is reported. The novel paper is fabricated from renewable plant pollen quickly and straightforwardly with less energy consumption and shows excellent printability, readability, and pH&#8208;triggered ability of toner erasability. Repeated reprinting and recycling are demonstrated due to their stable hydroswelling property.








Abstract
Although paperless technologies are becoming ubiquitous, paper and paper&#8208;based materials remain one of the most widely used resources, predicted to exceed an annual total of 460 million metric tons by 2030. Given the environmental challenges, deleterious impact on natural resources, and waste associated with conventional wood&#8208;based paper manufacturing, developing more sustainable strategies to source, produce, and recycle paper from natural materials is essential. Here, the development and production of reusable and recyclable paper are reported. This approach offers a pathway for easily producing natural pollen grains via ecofriendly, economical, scalable, and low&#8208;energy fabrication routes. It is demonstrated that the pollen&#8208;based paper exhibits high&#8208;quality printability, readability, and erasability, enabling its reuse. Based on the pH&#8208;responsive morphological responses of engineered pollen materials, a method for hygro stable printing and on&#8208;demand unprinting is presented. The reusability of the pollen paper renders it more advantageous than conventional single&#8208;print wood&#8208;based paper. This study thus provides possible pathways to utilize non&#8208;allergenic pollen, which is renewable and naturally abundant, as a sustainable source of reusable paper. While this work primarily deals with paper, the methods described here can be extended to produce other products such as cartons and containers for the storage and transport of liquid and solid materials.

         <title>Sensitive Activatable Nanoprobes for Real&#8208;Time Ratiometric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Reactive Oxygen Species and Ameliorating Inflammation In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanotheranostic agent (TMSN@PM) with platelet&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated, tempol&#8208;grafted, manganese&#8208;doped, mesoporous silica nanoparticles is reported. Response to inflammatory microenvironment including mild acidic and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), TMSN@PM can effectively eliminate ROS and biodegrade itself for the release of manganese ions for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, resulting in an imaging&#8208;guided real&#8208;time monitoring of the treatment process of inflammatory diseases.








Abstract
Imaging&#8208;guided real&#8208;time monitoring of the treatment process of inflammatory diseases is important for the timely adjustment of treatment planning to lower unnecessary side effects and improve treatment outcomes. However, it is difficult to reflect the dynamic changes of inflammation in vivo with enough tissue penetration depth. Here a novel nanotheranostic agent (denominated TMSN@PM) with platelet membrane (PM)&#8208;coated, tempol&#8208;grafted, manganese&#8208;doped, mesoporous silica nanoparticles is developed. The PM endows the TMSN@PM with the ability to target inflammation sites, which are verified by fluorescence imaging with Cyanine5 carboxylic acid (Cy5)&#8208;labeled TMSN@PM. Under the inflammatory environment (mild acidity and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS)), TMSN@PM can scavenge the excess ROS, thereby alleviating inflammation, degrade, and release manganese ions for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The relaxation changes (&#916;R1) are almost linearly correlated with the concentration of H2O2, which can reflect the degree of inflammation. This method offers a non&#8208;invasive imaging&#8208;based strategy for early prediction of the therapeutic outcomes in inflammatory therapy, which may contribute to precision medicine in terms of prognostic stratification and therapeutic planning in future.

Response to inflammatory microenvironment including mild acidic and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), TMSN@PM can effectively eliminate ROS and biodegrade itself for the release of manganese ions for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, resulting in an imaging-guided real-time monitoring of the treatment process of inflammatory diseases.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imaging-guided real-time monitoring of the treatment process of inflammatory diseases is important for the timely adjustment of treatment planning to lower unnecessary side effects and improve treatment outcomes. However, it is difficult to reflect the dynamic changes of inflammation in vivo with enough tissue penetration depth. Here a novel nanotheranostic agent (denominated TMSN@PM) with platelet membrane (PM)-coated, tempol-grafted, manganese-doped, mesoporous silica nanoparticles is developed. The PM endows the TMSN@PM with the ability to target inflammation sites, which are verified by fluorescence imaging with Cyanine5 carboxylic acid (Cy5)-labeled TMSN@PM. Under the inflammatory environment (mild acidity and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS)), TMSN@PM can scavenge the excess ROS, thereby alleviating inflammation, degrade, and release manganese ions for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The relaxation changes (&#916;&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) are almost linearly correlated with the concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which can reflect the degree of inflammation. This method offers a non-invasive imaging-based strategy for early prediction of the therapeutic outcomes in inflammatory therapy, which may contribute to precision medicine in terms of prognostic stratification and therapeutic planning in future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Immunosuppressive Exosomes that Inhibit Cytokine Storms Contribute to the Alleviation of Sepsis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The induced exosomes (iExo) obtained from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;treated tumor cells are shown to be able to simulate the immunosuppressive function of tumor tissues to balance the immune hyperactivation of sepsis. Seven specific miRNAs in iExo are the key to its function. Exosome mimics prepared by encapsulating seven miRNAs with hyaluronic acid&#8211;polyethylenimine (HA&#8208;PEI) can also alleviate sepsis.








Abstract
Sepsis is a disease characterized by multiple organ failure caused by immune hyperactivation and cytokine storms. Studies have shown that the incidence of sepsis in melanoma patients is substantially lower compared to the general population. It is also observed that experimental tumor&#8208;bearing animals have high survival rates after sepsis induction, suggesting that tumors may suppress sepsis&#8208;associated immune overactivation, thereby alleviating sepsis. Based on the above&#8208;described findings, this work assesses whether tumor cells play an antisepsis role in mice through the secretion of exosomes. Analysis of exosome activity reveals that the induced exosomes (iExo) secreted by tumor cells following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment improve sepsis to a greater extent than normal secretory exosomes. Further analysis reveals that iExo exert their protective effects mainly through seven key miRNAs. In vitro bionic simulation of exosomes is carried out using exosome mimics generated by loading the aforementioned microRNAs into hyaluronic acid&#8211;polyethylenimine nanoparticles. Exosome mimics at specific miRNA ratios alleviate sepsis in mice and cynomolgus monkeys, indicating that biomimetic simulation of tumor&#8208;suppressive exosomes may represent a promising therapeutic method for the treatment of sepsis and cytokine&#8208;storm&#8208;related conditions.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Micro&#8208;LEDs Exhibiting High Output Power and High Modulation Bandwidth Simultaneously</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A parallel&#8208;arrayed planar (PAP) strategy is proposed and applied for fabricating AlGaN&#8208;based deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#956;&#8208;LEDs). The simultaneously demonstrated ultrahigh light output power, high wall&#8208;plug efficiency, and high modulation bandwidth shed light on the tremendous potential of the PAP strategy for fabricating DUV LEDs for multifunctional applications.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) solar&#8208;blind communication (SBC) shows distinct advantages of non&#8208;line&#8208;of&#8208;sight propagation and background noise negligibility over conventional visible&#8208;light communication. AlGaN&#8208;based DUV micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#181;&#8208;LEDs) are an excellent candidate for a DUV&#8208;SBC light source due to their small size, low power consumption, and high modulation bandwidth. A long&#8208;haul DUV&#8208;SBC system requires the light source exhibiting high output power, high modulation bandwidth, and high rate, simultaneously. Such a device is rarely reported. A parallel&#8208;arrayed planar (PAP) approach is here proposed to satisfy those requirements. By reducing the dimensions of the active emission mesa to micrometer scale, DUV &#181;&#8208;LEDs with ultrahigh power density are created due to their homogeneous injection current and enhanced planar isotropic light emission. Interconnected PAP &#181;&#8208;LEDs with a diameter of 25&#160;&#181;m are produced. This device has an output power of 83.5&#160;mW with a density of 405 W cm&#8722;2 at 230&#160;mA, a wall&#8208;plug efficiency (WPE) of 4.7% at 155&#160;mA, and a high &#8722;3&#160;dB modulation bandwidth of 380&#160;MHz. The remarkable high output power and efficiency make those devices a reliable platform to develop high&#8208;modulation&#8208;bandwidth wireless communication and to meet the requirements for bio&#8208;elimination.

Abstract
A stretchable and self&#8208;healable conductive material with high conductivity is critical to high&#8208;performance wearable electronics and integrated devices for applications where large mechanical deformation is involved. While there has been great progress in developing stretchable and self&#8208;healable conducting materials, it remains challenging to concurrently maintain and recover such functionalities before and after healing. Here, a highly stretchable and autonomic self&#8208;healable conducting film consisting of a conducting polymer (poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS) and a soft&#8208;polymer (poly(2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid), PAAMPSA) is reported. The optimal film exhibits outstanding stretchability as high as 630% and high electrical conductivity of 320 S cm&#8722;1, while possessing the ability to repair both mechanical and electrical breakdowns when undergoing severe damage at ambient conditions. This polymer composite film is further utilized in a tactile sensor, which exhibits good pressure sensitivity of 164.5 kPa&#8722;1, near hysteresis&#8208;free, an ultrafast response time of 19&#160;ms, and excellent endurance over 1500 consecutive presses. Additionally, an integrated 5 &#215; 4 stretchable and self&#8208;healable organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) array with great device performance is successfully demonstrated. The developed stretchable and autonomic self&#8208;healable conducting film significantly increases the practicality and shelf life of wearable electronics, which in turn, reduces maintenance costs and build&#8208;up of electronic waste.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Tuned Multiphoton&#8208;Emitting InP Nanotetrapods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystalline nanotetrapod transits from a single to multiphoton emitter upon tuning its shape, which is revealed by single&#8208;particle spectroscopy. Calculation and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic results prove that the precise changeover of the exciton confinement dimension is driven by the geometry of the particle shape. Interactions between multiple excitons allow a useful and direct manipulation of single&#8208;nanotetrapod luminescence.








Abstract
As the properties of a semiconductor material depend on the fate of the excitons, manipulating exciton behavior is the primary objective of nanomaterials. Although nanocrystals exhibit unusual excitonic characteristics owing to strong spatial confinement, studying the interactions between excitons in a single nanoparticle remains challenging due to the rapidly vanishing multiexciton species. Here, a platform for exciton tailoring using a straightforward strategy of shape&#8208;tuning of single&#8208;crystalline nanocrystals is presented. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal a systematic transition of exciton confinement orientation from 3D to 2D, which is solely tuned by the geometric shape of material. Such a precise shape&#8208;effect triggers a multiphoton emission in single nanotetrapods with arms longer than the exciton Bohr radius of material. In consequence, the unique interplay between the multiple quantum states allows a geometric modulation of the quantum&#8208;confined Stark effect and nanocrystal memory effect in single nanotetrapods. These results provide a useful metric in designing nanomaterials for future photonic applications.

Such a precise shape-effect triggers a multiphoton emission in single nanotetrapods with arms longer than the exciton Bohr radius of material. In consequence, the unique interplay between the multiple quantum states allows a geometric modulation of the quantum-confined Stark effect and nanocrystal memory effect in single nanotetrapods. These results provide a useful metric in designing nanomaterials for future photonic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple 2D Phase Transformations in Monolayer Transition Metal Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically resolved multiple 2D phase transformations (MoS2&#160;&#8594; Mo4S6, MoSe2&#160;&#8594; L&#8208;, Z&#8208;Mo6Se6) is observed in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides under in situ heating with stoichiometry control by electron beam irradiation. Through chalcogen sliding and reconstruction mechanisms, phase transformations are well manipulated to fabricate diphase heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces, which will pave the way to phase engineered optoelectronics.








Abstract
Phase transformation lies at the heart of materials science because it allows for the control of structural phases of solids with desired properties. It has long been a challenge to manipulate phase transformations in crystals at the nanoscale with designed interfaces and compositions. Here in situ electron microscopy is employed to fabricate novel 2D phases with different stoichiometries in monolayer MoS2 and MoSe2. The multiphase transformations: MoS2&#160;&#8594; Mo4S6 and MoSe2&#160;&#8594; Mo6Se6 which are highly localized with atomically sharp boundaries are observed. Their atomic mechanisms are determined as chalcogen 2H &#8596; 1T sliding, cation shift, and commensurate lattice reconstructions, resulting in decreasing direct bandgaps and even a semiconductor&#8211;metal transition. These results will be a paradigm for the manipulation of multiphase heterostructures with controlled compositions and sharp interfaces, which will guide the future phase engineered electronics and optoelectronics of metal chalcogenides.

         <title>A Bi&#8208;Layer Hydrogel Cardiac Patch Made of Recombinant Functional Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of minimally invasive cardiac patch based on 3D printed, genetically modified double&#8208;layer protein gel is developed. The biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogel patch exhibits promising effects of hemostasis, fibrosis reduction, and heart function recovery on mice with two myocardium damage models.








Abstract
The development of minimally invasive cardiac patches, either as hemostatic dressing or treating myocardial infarction, is of clinical significance but remains a major challenge. Designing such patches often requires simultaneous consideration of several material attributes, including bioabsorption, non&#8208;toxicity, matching the mechanic properties of heart tissues, and working efficiently in wet and dynamic environments. Using genetically engineered multi&#8208;domain proteins, a printed bi&#8208;layer proteinaceous hydrogel patch for heart failure treatments is reported. The intrinsic self&#8208;healing nature of hydrogel materials physically enables seamless interfacial integration of two disparate hydrogel layers and functionally endows the cardiac patches with the combinatorial advantages of each layer. Leveraging the biocompatibility, structural stability, and tunable drug release properties of the bi&#8208;layer hydrogel, promising effects of hemostasis, fibrosis reduction, and heart function recovery on mice is demonstrated with two myocardium damage models. Moreover, this proteinaceous patch is proved biodegradable in vivo without any additive inflammations. In conclusion, this work introduces a promising new type of minimally invasive patch based on genetically modified double&#8208;layer protein gel for treating heart&#8208;related injuries or diseases.

         <title>Engineering High Strength and Super&#8208;Toughness of Unfolded Structural Proteins and their Extraordinary Anti&#8208;Adhesion Performance for Abdominal Hernia Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of biological fibers with a combination of high strength and high toughness is developed on the basis of engineered unfolded structural proteins. The outstanding biocompatibility and superior mechanical properties allow application of the constructed fiber patches for efficient abdominal hernia repair without any tissue adhesion.








Abstract
The utility of unfolded structural proteins with diverse sequences offers multiple potentials to create functional biomaterials. However, it is challenging to overcome their structural defects for the development of biological fibers with a combination of high strength and high toughness. Herein, robust fibers from a recombinant unfolded protein consisting of resilin and supercharged polypeptide are fabricated via wet&#8208;spinning approaches. Particularly, the highly ordered structures induced by supramolecular complexation significantly improve the fiber's mechanical performance. In contrast to chemical fibers with high strength and low toughness (or vice versa), the present fibers demonstrate exceptional high strength and super&#8208;toughness, showing a breaking strength of &#8776;550&#160;MPa and a toughness of &#8776;250&#160;MJ m&#8211;3, respectively, surpassing many polymers and artificial protein fibers. Remarkably, the outstanding biocompatibility and superior mechanical properties allow application of the constructed fiber patches for efficient abdominal hernia repair in rat models. In stark contrast to clinical patches, there is no observed tissue adhesion by this treatment. Therefore, this work provides a new type of engineered protein material for surgical applications.

         <title>Autonomous Reconstitution of Fractured Hybrid Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) are a widely researched class of materials with prospects for a vast array of optoelectronic applications. In this work, it is demonstrated that broken centimeter&#8208;sized crystals of a typical HOIP, MAPbI3, can self&#8208;heal and are capable of mechanical and electrical recovery after mild compression of their fragments.








Abstract
The outstanding performance and facile processability turn hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites into one of the most sought&#8208;after classes of semiconducting materials for optoelectronics. Yet, their translation into real&#8208;world applications necessitates that challenges with their chemical stability and poor mechanical robustness are first addressed. Here, centimeter&#8208;size single crystals of methylammoniumlead(II) iodide (MAPbI3) are reported to be capable of autonomous self&#8208;healing under minimal compression at ambient temperature. When crystals are halved and the fragments are brought in contact, they can readily self&#8208;repair as a result of a liquid&#8208;like behavior of their lattice at the contact surface, which leads to a remarkable healing with an efficiency of up to 82%. The successful reconstitution of the broken single crystals is reflected in recuperation of their optoelectronic properties. Testing of the healed crystals as photodetectors shows an impressive 74% recovery of the generated photocurrent relative to pristine crystals. This self&#8208;healing capability of MAPbI3 single crystals is an efficient strategy to overcome the poor mechanical properties and low wear resistance of these materials, and paves the way for durable and stable optoelectronic devices based on single crystals of hybrid perovskites.

         <title>Fermi&#8208;Level Pinning&#8208;Free WSe2 Transistors via 2D Van der Waals Metal Contacts and Their Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A creation of clean van der Waals contacts is reported. Clean contacts made from 2D metal Cl&#8211;SnSe2 can completely eliminate the Femi&#8208;level pinning, permitting ideal Schottky barrier heights and polarity&#8208;controllable transistors. With the ability to control the carrier polarity, various functional logic gates and circuits (inverter, NAND, and NOR) are demonstrated by integrating WSe2 transistors with Cl&#8211;SnSe2 contacts.








Abstract
Precise control over the polarity of transistors is a key necessity for the construction of complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor circuits.

&lt;p&gt;A creation of clean van der Waals contacts is reported. Clean contacts made from 2D metal Cl&#8211;SnSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can completely eliminate the Femi-level pinning, permitting ideal Schottky barrier heights and polarity-controllable transistors. With the ability to control the carrier polarity, various functional logic gates and circuits (inverter, NAND, and NOR) are demonstrated by integrating WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transistors with Cl&#8211;SnSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contacts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise control over the polarity of transistors is a key necessity for the construction of complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor circuits. However, the polarity control of 2D transistors remains a challenge because of the lack of a high-work-function electrode that completely eliminates Fermi-level pinning at metal&#8211;semiconductor interfaces. Here, a creation of clean van der Waals contacts is demonstrated, wherein a metallic 2D material, chlorine-doped SnSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Cl&#8211;SnSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is used as the high-work-function contact, providing an interface that is free of defects and Fermi-level pinning. Such clean contacts made from Cl&#8211;SnSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can pose nearly ideal Schottky barrier heights, following the Schottky&#8211;Mott limit and thus permitting polarity-controllable transistors. With the integration of Cl&#8211;SnSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as contacts, WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transistors exhibit pronounced p-type characteristics, which are distinctly different from those of the devices with evaporated metal contacts, where n-type transport is observed. Finally, this ability to control the polarity enables the fabrication of functional logic gates and circuits, including inverter, NAND, and NOR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Upcycling Silicon Photovoltaic Waste into Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon from waste photovoltaics is recycled into thermoelectrics in this work. The majority&#8208;carrier nature of thermoelectrics (defect and impurity insensitive) is highlighted as the perfect destination for recycling minority&#8208;carrier devices (such as photovoltaics). This work closes the loop for sustainability in green energy production.








Abstract
Two decades after the rapid expansion of photovoltaics, the number of solar panels reaching end&#8208;of&#8208;life is increasing. While precious metals such as silver and copper are usually recycled, silicon, which makes up the bulk of a solar cells, goes to landfills. This is due to the defect&#8208; and impurity&#8208;sensitive nature in most silicon&#8208;based technologies, rendering it uneconomical to purify waste silicon. Thermoelectrics represents a rare class of material in which defects and impurities can be engineered to enhance the performance. This is because of the majority&#8208;carrier nature, making it defect&#8208; and impurity&#8208;tolerant. Here, the upcycling of silicon from photovoltaic (PV) waste into thermoelectrics is enabled. This is done by doping 1% Ge and 4% P, which results in a figure of merit (zT) of 0.45 at 873&#160;K, the highest among silicon&#8208;based thermoelectrics. The work represents an important piece of the puzzle in realizing a circular economy for photovoltaics and electronic waste.

         <title>Activating a Semiconductor&#8211;Liquid Junction via Laser&#8208;Derived Dual Interfacial Layers for Boosted Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual interfacial layers, composed of a top covalent anchored carbon dots layer and a Mo:BiVO4 shallow layer with enriched oxygen vacancies, are constructed to synchronously boost charge&#8208;carrier kinetics and inhibit photocorrosion, which results in a BiVO4 photoanode with a photocurrent density of 6.08&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and operational stability up to 120 h at 1.23 VRHE.








Abstract
The semiconductor&#8211;liquid junction (SCLJ), the dominant place in photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysis, determines the interfacial activity and stability of photoelectrodes, whcih directly affects the viability of PEC hydrogen generation. Though efforts dedicated in past decades, a challenge remains regarding creating a synchronously active and stable SCLJ, owing to the technical hurdles of simultaneously overlaying the two advantages. The present work demonstrates that creating an SCLJ with a unique configuration of the dual interfacial layers can yield BiVO4 photoanodes with synchronously boosted photoelectrochemical activity and operational stability, with values located at the top in the records of such photoelectrodes. The bespoke dual interfacial layers, accessed via grafting laser&#8208;generated carbon dots with phenolic hydroxyl groups (LGCDs&#8208;PHGs), are experimentally verified effective, not only in generating the uniform layer of LGCDs with covalent anchoring for inhibited photocorrosion, but also in activating, respectively, the charge separation and transfer in each layer for boosted charge&#8208;carrier kinetics, resulting in FeNiOOH&#8211;LGCDs&#8208;PHGs&#8211;MBVO photoanodes with a dual configuration with the photocurrent density of 6.08 mA cm&#8722;2 @ 1.23 VRHE, and operational stability up to 120 h @ 1.23 VRHE. Further work exploring LGCDs&#8208;PHGs from catecholic molecules warrants the proposed strategy as being a universal alternative for addressing the interfacial charge&#8208;carrier kinetics and operational stability of semiconductor photoelectrodes.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Affords Sustainable Plastics with Ultrahigh Robustness and Water&#8208;Assisted Arbitrarily Shape Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular plastic&#8208;like hydrogel (SPH) is introduced to fabricate sustainable plastics with simultaneous high mechanical performance and convenient water&#8208;induced processability. Diverse 2D/3D shapes are generated via origami, kirigami, embossing, etc., in virtue of plastic deformation and shape memory effect of SPHs. The plastics show Young's modulus up to 3.4&#160;GPa and tensile strength up to 124.0&#160;MPa due to dense inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;chain hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonds.








Abstract
Herein, the supramolecular plastic&#8208;like hydrogel (SPH) is introduced as a platform to fabricate sustainable plastics with ultrahigh stiffness and strength as well as water&#8208;assisted arbitrarily shapeable capability. The transparent plastics are constructed from SPHs of cellulose ether/polycarboxylic acid complexes and demonstrate mechanical robustness with Young's modulus up to 3.4&#160;GPa and tensile strength up to 124.0&#160;MPa, superior or comparable to most common plastics. Meanwhile, the shape of the plastics can be reversibly engineered by air drying of the SPHs with diverse 2D/3D shapes and structures, which are generated conveniently via origami, kirigami, embossing, etc., in virtue of plastic deformation and shape memory effect of SPHs. On the basis of multi&#8208;dimensional infrared&#8208;spectral analysis, it is revealed that the dense acid&#8211;acid and acid&#8211;ether hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonding network in the plastic is responsible for the mechanical robustness while the evolution of water&#8211;polymer H&#8208;bonds into polymer&#8211;polymer H&#8208;bonds during air drying contributes to the shape fixing. This work provides a novel method of manufacturing sustainable plastics with simultaneous strong mechanical performance and convenient processibility from hydrogels with plastic&#8208;like mechanical behavior.

An atom&#8208;programming on semiconducting oligomers tunes NIR&#8208;II emission beyond 1500&#160;nm with high brightness. With this strategy, whole&#8208;body vessel, biliary tract, and bladder of living mice are clearly monitored at emission wavelengths over 1500&#160;nm. Utilizing NIR&#8208;II nanoparticles, NIR&#8208;II microscopic imaging of in vivo deep&#8208;brain at a high depth of 870&#160;&#181;m and ultrafast hemodynamics are achieved in high resolution.








Abstract
Materials with long&#8208;wavelength second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission are highly desired for in vivo dynamic visualizating of microstructures in deep tissues. Herein, by employing an atom&#8208;programming strategy, a series of highly fluorescent semiconducting oligomers (SOMs) with tunable NIR&#8208;IIb emissions are developed for bioimaging applications. After self&#8208;assembly into nanoparticles (NPs), they show good brightness, high photostability, and satisfactory biocompatibility. The SOM NPs are applied as probes for high&#8208;resolution imaging of whole&#8208;body and hind&#8208;limb blood vessels, biliary tract, and bladder with their emissions over 1500&#160;nm. This work demonstrates an atom&#8208;programming strategy for constructing semiconducting small molecules with enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence for deep&#8208;tissue imaging, affording new insight for advancing molecular design of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.

Utilizing NIR-II nanoparticles, NIR-II microscopic imaging of in vivo deep-brain at a high depth of 870&#160;&#181;m and ultrafast hemodynamics are achieved in high resolution.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials with long-wavelength second near-infrared (NIR-II) emission are highly desired for in vivo dynamic visualizating of microstructures in deep tissues. Herein, by employing an atom-programming strategy, a series of highly fluorescent semiconducting oligomers (SOMs) with tunable NIR-IIb emissions are developed for bioimaging applications. After self-assembly into nanoparticles (NPs), they show good brightness, high photostability, and satisfactory biocompatibility. The SOM NPs are applied as probes for high-resolution imaging of whole-body and hind-limb blood vessels, biliary tract, and bladder with their emissions over 1500&#160;nm. This work demonstrates an atom-programming strategy for constructing semiconducting small molecules with enhanced NIR-II fluorescence for deep-tissue imaging, affording new insight for advancing molecular design of NIR-II fluorophores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multifunctional Photoacoustic/Fluorescence Dual&#8208;Mode&#8208;Imaging Gold&#8208;Based Theranostic Nanoformulation without External Laser Limitations</title>

mdGC as a multifunctional photoacoustic/fluorescence dual&#8208;mode imaging theranostic nanoformulation shows good diagnosis and treatment performance without external laser limitations through the mitochondria&#8208;mediated apoptotic pathway by increasing the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential, and regulating the expression of apoptosis&#8208;related genes.








Abstract
Theranostics is a new type of biomedical technology that organically combines the diagnosis and therapy of diseases. Among molecular imaging techniques, the integration of photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence (FL) imaging modes with high sensitivity and imaging depth provides precise diagnostic outcomes. Gold nanorods (Au NRs) are well&#8208;known contrast agents for PA imaging and photothermal therapy. However, their high toxicity, poor biocompatibility, rapid clearance, and the need for an external laser source limit their application. Therefore, modification of Au NRs with carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials (CBNs) is done to obtain a multifunctional dual&#8208;mode gold&#8208;based nanoformulation (mdGC), which preforms dual&#8208;mode imaging of PA and FL. The results show that mdGC promotes tumor cell apoptosis and exhibits good antitumor performance through the mitochondria&#8208;mediated apoptotic pathway by increasing the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, and regulating the expression of apoptosis&#8208;related genes. The targeting rate of mdGC to tumor tissue is up to 20.71 &#177; 1.94%&#160;ID g&#8208;1; the tumor growth inhibition rate is as high as 80.44% without external laser sources. In general, mdGC is a potential multifunctional diagnostic and therapy integrated nanoformulation.

         <title>Raising the Intrinsic Safety of Layered Oxide Cathodes by Surface Re&#8208;Lithiation with LLZTO Garnet&#8208;Type Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Garnet&#8208;type solid electrolyte LLZTO supplies lithium ions to retard the oxygen release of oxide cathode during heating. LLZTO acts bifunctionally to solve the safety issues from flammable liquid electrolytes and high&#8208;capacity layered cathodes at high SOC. Consequently, LiCoO2/graphite cell with 1 wt% LLZTO addition achieves significantly enhanced safety performances.








Abstract
Battery safety concerns are becoming more and more prominent with the increasing demands of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with higher energy density. The greatest threat to battery safety derives from the easy release of oxygen from the high&#8208;capacity layered oxide cathodes at highly delithiated states and subsequent exothermic reactions with reductive agents in batteries. Herein, it is demonstrated that solid electrolyte Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) can supply lithium ions to re&#8208;lithiate the charged LiCoO2 at elevated temperatures. Such a re&#8208;lithiation process can lower the state&#8208;of&#8208;charge of LiCoO2, and thus, inherently postpones its structural decomposition and the associated release of oxygen during the heating process. The LiCoO2/graphite full cell with 1&#160;wt% addition of LLZTO demonstrates remarkably enhanced safety performances. This work proposes a strategy that through the adoption of solid electrolytes to solve safety issues raised from both flammable liquid electrolytes and high capacity cathodes, to achieve intrinsically safe LIBs or solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Large Transverse and Longitudinal Magneto&#8208;Thermoelectric Effect in Polycrystalline Nodal&#8208;Line Semimetal Mg3Bi2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological semimetals provide new opportunities for exploring novel thermoelectric phenomena, owing to their exotic and nontrivial electronic structure topology around the Fermi surface. Herein, large magneto&#8208;thermoelectric and magnetoresistance effects in polycrystalline type&#8208;II nodal&#8208;line topological semimetal Mg3Bi2 through a defect engineering method are revealed.








Abstract
Topological semimetals provide new opportunities for exploring novel thermoelectric phenomena, owing to their exotic and nontrivial electronic structure topology around the Fermi surface. Herein, the discovery of large transverse and longitudinal magneto&#8208;thermoelectric (MTE) effects in Mg3Bi2 is reported and predicted to be a type&#8208;II nodal&#8208;line semimetal in the absence of spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). The maximum transverse power factor is 2182 &#956;W m&#8722;1K&#8722;2 at 13.5 K and 6 Tesla. The longitudinal power factor reaches up to 3043 &#956;W m&#8722;1K&#8722;2, which is 20 times higher than that in a zero&#8208;strength magnetic field and is also comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MTE materials. By compensating the Mg loss in Mg&#8208;rich conditions for tuning the carrier concentration close to intrinsic state, the sample fabricated in this study exhibits a large linear non&#8208;saturating magnetoresistance of 940% under a field of 14 Tesla. Using density functional calculations, the authors attribute the underlying mechanism to the parent linear&#8208;dispersed nodal&#8208;line electronic structure without SOC and the anisotropic Fermi surface shape with SOC, highlighting the essential role of high carrier mobility and open electron orbits in the moment space. This work offers a new avenue toward highly efficient MTE materials through defect engineering in polycrystalline topological semimetals.

         <title>Structural Modularization of Cu2Te Leading to High Thermoelectric Performance near the Mott&#8211;Ioffe&#8211;Regel Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By structurally&#8208;functionally modularizing Cu2Te with multiple point defects, mosaic nanograins, and crystal&#8208;amorphicity duality, high thermoelectric performance is obtained near the Mott&#8211;Ioffe&#8211;Regel limit. This work presents a case of paradigm shift from the band edge to the mobility edge in thermoelectric materials research.








Abstract
To date, thermoelectric materials research stays focused on optimizing the material's band edge details and disfavors low mobility. Here, the paradigm is shifted from the band edge to the mobility edge, exploring high thermoelectricity near the border of band conduction and hopping. Through coalloying iodine and sulfur, the plain crystal structure is modularized of liquid&#8208;like thermoelectric material Cu2Te with mosaic nanograins and the highly size mismatched S/Te sublattice that chemically quenches the Cu sublattice and drives the electronic states from itinerant to localized. A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art figure of merit of 1.4 is obtained at 850 K for Cu2(S0.4I0.1Te0.5); and remarkably, it is achieved near the Mott&#8211;Ioffe&#8211;Regel limit unlike mainstream thermoelectric materials that are band conductors. Broadly, pairing structural modularization with the high performance near the Mott&#8211;Ioffe&#8211;Regel limit paves an important new path towards the rational design of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Exchange Driven Phase Transition in CsPbI3 Nanowires for Fabricating Epitaxial Perovskite Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state anion exchange is conducted in Y&#8208;CsPbI3/CsPbBr3 nanowire crossbar structures, driving an indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct bandgap phase transition in Y&#8208;CsPbI3 nanowires. The heterojunction created by phase transition is epitaxial, with sharp interface and excellent thermal stability. A threshold&#8208;dominating anion exchange mechanism is proposed in these 1D nanowires, fundamentally different from the gradient&#8208;domination mechanism in 3D perovskites.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange in halide perovskites provides a unique pathway of bandgap engineering for fabricating heterojunctions in low&#8208;cost photovoltaics and optoelectronics. However, it remains challenging to achieve robust and sharp perovskite heterojunctions, due to the spontaneous anion interdiffusion across the heterojunction in 3D perovskites. Here, it is shown that the anionic behavior in 1D perovskites is fundamentally different, that the anion exchange can readily drive an indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct bandgap phase transition in CsPbI3 nanowires (NWs) and greatly lower the phase transition temperature. In addition, the heterojunction created by phase transition is epitaxial in nature, and its chemical composition can be precisely controlled upon postannealing. Further study of the phase transition dynamics reveals a threshold&#8208;dominating anion exchange mechanism in these 1D NWs rather than the gradient&#8208;dominating mechanism in 3D systems. The results provide important insights into the ionic behavior in halide perovskites, which is beneficial for applications in solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), and other semiconductor devices.

         <title>Versatile Polymer&#8208;Initiating Biomineralization for Tumor Blockade Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facilely synthesized versatile polymer, 1,2&#8208;distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8211;N&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;alendronate, not only serves as an initiator to trigger the biomineralization in the peripheral region of tumors after anchoring on the surface of the tumor cell membrane, but also as an anti&#8208;osteoclast agent to alleviate bone destruction, both of which efficiently suppress the growth and lung metastasis of osteosarcoma.








Abstract
Tumor blockade therapy is a promising penetration&#8208;independent antitumor modality, which effectively inhibits the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and information between the tumor and surrounding microenvironments. However, the current blockade therapy strategies have limited antitumor efficacy due to defects of inadequate tumor obstruction, possible side effects, and short duration. For these reasons, a facilely synthesized versatile polymer 1,2&#8208;distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8211;N&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;alendronate (DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;ALN, DPA) is developed to initiate the formation of biomineral shell around osteosarcoma as a potent physical barrier. The DSPE moiety shares a similar chemical structure with the cytomembrane, allowing the membrane insertion of DPA. The bisphosphonic acid groups in ALN attract ions to realize biomineralization around cells. After injection in the invasive osteosarcoma tissue, DPA inserts into the cytomembrane, induces continuous mineral deposition, and ultimately builds a physical barrier around the tumor. Meanwhile, ALN in DPA alleviates bone destruction by suppressing the activity of osteoclasts. Through hindering the exchange of necessary substances, the biomineralization coating inhibits the growth of primary osteosarcoma and pulmonary metastasis simultaneously. Therefore, the multifunctional polymer&#8208;initiating blockade therapy provides a promising modality for tumor inhibition in clinics with high efficacy and negligible side effects.

High&#8208;quality and solution&#8208;processible chlorine&#8208;doped ultrathin graphene (Cl&#8208;G) nanosheets are fabricated through a handy yet eco&#8208;friendly electrochemical exfoliation process. The as&#8208;made all&#8208;solid&#8208;state MSC built by using Cl&#8208;G via a facile mask&#8208;assisted method delivers a large reversible capacity and ultrasteady charge/discharge performance, with the capacitance being maintained at 98.1% even after 250&#8201;000 cycles.








Abstract
Graphene&#8208;constructed micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) have received considerable attention recently, as part of the prospective wearable and portable electronics, owing to their distinctive merits of well&#8208;tunable power output, robust mechanical flexibility, and long cyclability. In the current work, the focus is on the fabrication of high&#8208;quality and solution&#8208;processible chlorine&#8208;doped graphene (Cl&#8208;G) nanosheets through a handy yet eco&#8208;friendly electrochemical exfoliation process. The Cl&#8208;G is characteristic of the large lateral size of &#8776;10&#160;&#181;m, abundant nanopores with sizes of as small as 2&#160;nm, as well as numerous steps from the rugged surface. Arising from the rich chemical functionalities and structure defects, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state MSC built by using Cl&#8208;G via a facile mask&#8208;assisted method delivers a large reversible capacity and ultrasteady charge/discharge performance, with the capacitance being maintained at 98.1% even after 250&#8201;000 cycles. The Cl&#8208;G&#8208;MSC with EMIMBF4/PVDF&#8208;HFP as the electrolyte displays a large volumetric capacitance up to 160 F cm&#8722;3 at the scan rate of 5&#160;mV s&#8722;1 and high volumetric energy density of 97.9&#160;mW h cm&#8722;3 at the power density of 3.4 W cm&#8722;3. The device can also output a high voltage up to 3.5&#160;V and robust capability with 94.8% of capacitance retention upon 10&#8201;000 cycles.

         <title>Confined Growth of Silver&#8211;Copper Janus Nanostructures with {100} Facets for Highly Selective Tandem Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through breaking the common symmetric growth, three kinds of silver&#8208;copper Janus nanostructures with {100} facets are synthesized with a wet&#8208;chemical method. Coupling the tandem catalysis, copper {100} facets, and electron transfer between silver and copper, the obtained Janus nanostructures demonstrate excellent Faradaic efficiency toward both ethylene and multicarbon products in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds significant potential to promote carbon neutrality. However, the selectivity toward multicarbon products in CO2RR is still too low to meet practical applications. Here the authors report the delicate synthesis of three kinds of Ag&#8211;Cu Janus nanostructures with {100} facets (JNS&#8208;100) for highly selective tandem electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to multicarbon products. By controlling the surfactant and reduction kinetics of Cu precursor, the confined growth of Cu with {100} facets on one of the six equal faces of Ag nanocubes is realized. Compared with Cu nanocubes, Ag65&#8211;Cu35 JNS&#8208;100 demonstrates much superior selectivity for both ethylene and multicarbon products in CO2RR at less negative potentials. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the compensating electronic structure and carbon monoxide spillover in Ag65&#8211;Cu35 JNS&#8208;100 contribute to the enhanced CO2RR performance. This study provides an effective strategy to design advanced tandem catalysts toward the extensive application of CO2RR.

         <title>More than Carbazole Derivatives Activate Room Temperature Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence of Benzoindole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four carbazole/1H&#8208;benzo[f]indole (Cz/Bd) derivatives are synthesized to give a general mechanism of Bd&#8208;based ultralong organic phosphorescence. When Bd derivatives were&#160;dispersed into the matrixes, their strong ultralong phosphorescence was&#160;activated and it originated from the radical cations. The photo&#8208;activated ultralong phosphorescence may open a simple way for high&#8208;resolution photolithography, which is promising in the technology of encryption.








Abstract
The mechanism of carbazole (Cz)&#8208;based phosphors is still unclear since its isomer (1H&#8208;benzo[f]indole, Bd) is discovered in 2020. Herein, the successful synthesis of four Cz/Bd derivatives is reported, named as 2CzBr, CzBdBr, 2BdBr, and 3Bd, and the general mechanism for their ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) is provided. Bd and its derivatives give double groups of phosphorescence, including the short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence with a short lifetime and the ultralong phosphorescence at long wavelengths, assigned to their neutral molecules and radical cations, respectively. Interestingly, the doped poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films of CzBdBr and 2BdBr show photo&#8208;activated ultralong phosphorescence at room temperature. The activation of Bd derivatives &#8216;UOP involves three factors: 1) well dispersion in the matrix with limited amount, 2) generation of their radical cations and 3) the matrix&#8208;mediated stabilization of radical cations. The function of Cz derivatives to activate the Bd derivatives&#8217; UOP could be replaced by photo&#8208;activation or using other matrixes. Significantly, the application of the doped PMMA films is practiced and gives an exciting result that the high&#8208;resolution QR code could be reversibly printed and erased on the film. This research has expanded the understanding in the field of organic phosphorescence and it may pave a new way for its development.

         <title>Construction of Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conducting Scaffolds in Zn Powder: A Scalable Route to Dendrite&#8208;Free and Flexible Zn Anodes</title>

A mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor scaffold was introduced into Zn powder to successfully fabricate anti&#8208;corrosive, flexible, and dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes by using a scalable tape&#8208;casting strategy.








Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are considered ideal candidates for Zn&#8208;based batteries because they enable a positive synergistic integration of safety and energy density. However, Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes still experience easy corrosion, uncontrolled dendrite growth, and poor mechanical strength, which restrict their further application. Herein, a mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting scaffold is introduced into Zn&#8208;P to successfully fabricate anti&#8208;corrosive, flexible, and dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes using a scalable tape&#8208;casting strategy. The as&#8208;established scaffold is characterized by robust flexibility, facile scale&#8208;up synthesis methodology, and exceptional anti&#8208;corrosive characteristics, and it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux during Zn plating/stripping, thus allowing stable Zn cycling. Benefiting from these comprehensive attributes, the as&#8208;prepared Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anode provides superior electrochemical performance, including long&#8208;life cycling stability and high rate capability in practical coin and flexible pouch cells; thus, it holds great potential for developing advanced Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The findings of this study provide insights for a promising scalable pathway to fabricate highly efficient and reliable Zn&#8208;based anodes and will aid in the realization of advanced flexible energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>A Biomaterial&#8208;Based Hedging Immune Strategy for Scarless Tendon Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospun&#8208;fiber&#8208;tethered scarring subpopulation membranes are fabricated to shift type I biased polarization, alleviate stress, and mitigate inflammatory depression. Wrapping Him&#8208;MFM alleviates pathological responses, protects tenocytes in situ, and restores hierarchically arranged collagen fibers covered by a basement membrane, structurally and functionally similar to mature tendons, demonstrating a promising strategy to yield regeneration.








Abstract
Scarring rather than regeneration, is an inevitable outcome of unbalanced amplifications of inflammation&#8208;destructive signals and atresia of the regenerative niche. However, identifying and effectively hedging against the risk of scarring and realizing the conversion of regenerative cues remain difficult. In this work, a hedging immune strategy based microfibrous membrane (Him&#8208;MFM), by tethering distearoyl phosphoethanolamine layer&#8208;supported copoly(lactic/glycolic acid) electrospun fibers with identified CD11b+/CD68+ scarring subpopulation membranes in the immune landscape after tendon injury to counterweigh tissue damage, is reported. Him&#8208;MFM, carrying relevant risk receptors is shown to shift high type I biased polarization, alleviate apoptosis and metabolic stress, and mitigate inflammatory tenocyte response. Remarkably, the hedging immune strategy reverses the damaged tendon sheath barrier to the innate IL&#8208;33 secretory phenotype by 4.36 times and initiates the mucous&#8208;IL&#8208;33&#8208;Th2 axis, directly supplying a transient but obligate regenerative niche for sheath stem cell proliferation. In murine flexor tendon injury, the wrapping of Him&#8208;MFM alleviates pathological responses, protects tenocytes in situ, and restores hierarchically arranged collagen fibers covered with basement membrane, and is structurally and functionally comparable to mature tendons, demonstrating that the hedging immunity is a promising strategy to yield regenerative responses not scarring.

         <title>Regulation of Surface Defect Chemistry toward Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Particle surface instability induces severe electrochemical degradations in Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials, especially when the battery operates at high voltage. This study illustrates a strategy for simultaneously regulating surface defect chemistry and surface structure, leading to a dramatic improvement in electrochemical properties. These findings provide a facile way to surface engineering to achieve stable cathodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Surface reconstruction of Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides (NLO) degrades the cycling stability and safety of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which challenges typical surface&#8208;modification approaches to build a robust interface with electrochemical activity. Here, a strategy of leveraging the low&#8208;strain analogues of Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMR) to reconstruct a stable surface on the Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes is proposed. The new surface structure not only consists of a gradient chemical composition but also contains a defect&#8208;rich structure regarding the formation of oxygen vacancies and cationic ordering, which can simultaneously facilitate lithium diffusion and stabilize the crystal structure during the (de)lithiation. These features in the NLO lead to a dramatic improvement in electrochemical properties, especially the cyclability under high voltage cycling, exhibiting the 30% increase in capacity retention after 200 cycles at the current density of 1&#160;C (3.0&#8211;4.6&#160;V). The findings offer a facile and effective way to regulate defect chemistry and surface structure in parallel on Ni&#8208;rich layered structure cathodes to achieve high&#8208;energy density LIBs.

         <title>Triboresistive Touch Sensing: Grid&#8208;Free Touch&#8208;Point Recognition Based on Monolayered Ionic Power Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of sensing, termed &#8220;triboresistive touch sensing&#8221;, is developed for self&#8208;powered gridless touch&#8208;position recognition. An ionic poly(dimethylsiloxane) exhibiting high transmittance (96.5%), stretchability (539.1%), resilience (99.0%), and ionic conductivity (0.25 mS m&#8722;1) is designed to generate power based on an electric field induced by touch. The voltages ensure sensing the touch positions without electrode grids and external power sources.








Abstract
Recent growing pursuit of skin&#8208;mountable devices has been impeded by the complicated structures of most sensing systems, containing electrode grids, stacked multilayers, and even external power sources. Here, a type of touch sensing, termed &#8220;triboresistive touch sensing&#8221;, is introduced for gridless touch recognition based on monolayered ionic power generators. A homogeneous monolayer, i.e., ionic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), generates electricity based on the electric field generated by touch. Voltages generated at each corner of the ionic PDMS rely on resistance between touch points and each corner, ensuring recognition of the touch positions without the need for electrode grid layers and external power sources. With notable advantages of high transparency (96.5%), stretchability (539.1%), and resilience (99.0%) of the ionic PDMS, epidermal triboresistive sensing is demonstrated to express touch position and readily play a musical instrument.

&lt;p&gt;A novel type of sensing, termed &#8220;triboresistive touch sensing&#8221;, is developed for self-powered gridless touch-position recognition. An ionic poly(dimethylsiloxane) exhibiting high transmittance (96.5%), stretchability (539.1%), resilience (99.0%), and ionic conductivity (0.25 mS m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is designed to generate power based on an electric field induced by touch. The voltages ensure sensing the touch positions without electrode grids and external power sources.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent growing pursuit of skin-mountable devices has been impeded by the complicated structures of most sensing systems, containing electrode grids, stacked multilayers, and even external power sources. Here, a type of touch sensing, termed &#8220;triboresistive touch sensing&#8221;, is introduced for gridless touch recognition based on monolayered ionic power generators. A homogeneous monolayer, i.e., ionic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), generates electricity based on the electric field generated by touch. Voltages generated at each corner of the ionic PDMS rely on resistance between touch points and each corner, ensuring recognition of the touch positions without the need for electrode grid layers and external power sources. With notable advantages of high transparency (96.5%), stretchability (539.1%), and resilience (99.0%) of the ionic PDMS, epidermal triboresistive sensing is demonstrated to express touch position and readily play a musical instrument. A gridless system of triboresistive sensing allows rearrangement of the touch sections according to a given situation without any physical modification, and thus easily completes consecutive missions of controlling position, orientation, and gripping functions of a robot.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Dots as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for the Treatment of Cancer&#8208;Related Anemia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the adverse effects of erythropoietin (EPO) on cancer patient survival, it is necessary to develop new agents for cancer&#8208;related anemia treatment. Therefore, novel carbon dots, J&#8208;CDs, derived from jujube are designed. J&#8208;CDs specifically promote the proliferation of erythroid cells by stimulating the self&#8208;renewal of erythroid progenitor cells. Moreover, J&#8208;CDs have no discernible effects on tumor proliferation, unlike EPO.








Abstract
Due to the adverse effects of erythropoietin (EPO) on cancer patient survival, it is necessary to develop new agents that can be used to efficiently manage and treat cancer&#8208;related anemia. In this study, novel distinctive carbon dots, J&#8208;CDs, derived from jujube are designed, synthesized, and characterized. Based on the obtained results, this material comprises sp2 and sp3 carbon atoms, as well as oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;based groups, and it specifically promotes the proliferation of erythroid cells by stimulating the self&#8208;renewal of erythroid progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, J&#8208;CDs have no discernible effects on tumor proliferation and metastasis, unlike EPO. Transcriptome profiling suggests that J&#8208;CDs upregulate the molecules involved in hypoxia response, and they also significantly increase the phosphorylation levels of STAT5, the major transducer of signals for erythroid progenitor cell proliferation. Overall, this study demonstrates that J&#8208;CDs effectively promote erythrocyte production without affecting tumor proliferation and metastasis; thus, they may be promising agents for the treatment of cancer&#8208;related anemia.

         <title>Searching for an Optimal Multi&#8208;Metallic Alloy Catalyst by Active Learning Combined with Experiments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and simple methodology is suggested in order to search for the optimal components and composition of multi&#8208;metallic alloy catalysts regardless of the catalytic background by a combination of active learning and experiment. After conducting several iterations, the optimum ternary catalyst, which shows superior performance compared to unary or binary catalysts, is discovered.








Abstract
Searching for an optimal component and composition of multi&#8208;metallic alloy catalysts, comprising two or more elements, is one of the key issues in catalysis research. Due to the exhaustive data requirement of conventional machine&#8208;learning (ML) models and the high cost of experimental trials, current approaches rely mainly on the combination of density functional theory and ML techniques. In this study, a significant step is taken toward overcoming limitations by the interplay of experiment and active learning to effectively search for an optimal component and composition of multi&#8208;metallic alloy catalysts. The active&#8208;learning model is iteratively updated using by examining electrocatalytic performance of fabricated solid&#8208;solution nanoparticles for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). An optimal metal precursor composition of Pt0.65Ru0.30Ni0.05 exhibits an HER overpotential of 54.2&#160;mV, which is superior to that of the pure Pt catalyst. This result indicates the successful construction of the model by only utilizing the precursor mixture composition as input data, thereby improving the overpotential by searching for an optimal catalyst. This method appears to be widely applicable since it is able to determine an optimal component and composition of electrocatalyst without obvious restriction to the types of catalysts to which it can be applied.

         <title>Thermally Drawn Highly Conductive Fibers with Controlled Elasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elasticity is introduced in thermally drawn fibers by modifying the pathway of metallic electrodes to either a buckled or helical configuration. The electrodes maintain minimal change in resistance within the elastic strain regime defined by geometric and material properties. Integration of light&#8208;emitting diodes connected by stretchable electrodes within fibers yields stretchable and conformable fabric optical antennas for high&#8208;bandwidth data transmission.








Abstract
Electronic fabrics necessitate both electrical conductivity and, like any textile, elastic recovery. Achieving both requirements on the scale of a single fiber remains an unmet need. Here, two approaches for achieving conductive fibers (107 S m&#8722;1) reaching 50% elongation while maintaining minimal change in resistance (&lt;0.5%) in embedded metallic electrodes are introduced. The first approach involves inducing a buckling instability in a metal microwire within a cavity of a thermally drawn elastomer fiber. The second approach relies on twisting an elastomer fiber to yield helical metal electrodes embedded in a stretchable yarn. The scalability of both approaches is illustrated in apparatuses for continuous buckling and twisting that yield tens of meters of elastic conducting fibers. Through experimental and analytical methods, it is elucidated how geometric parameters, such as buckling pre&#8208;strain and helical angle, as well as materials choice, control not only the fiber's elasticity but also its Young's modulus. Links between mechanical and electrical properties are exposed. The resulting fibers are used to construct elastic fabrics that contain diodes, by weaving and knitting, thus demonstrating the scalable fabrication of conformable and stretchable antennas that support optical data transmission.

         <title>Magnetoelectric Effect in Hydrogen Harvesting: Magnetic Field as a Trigger of Catalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is initiated by exploiting the magnetoelectric nature of CoFe2O4&#8211;BiFeO3 core&#8211;shell nanoparticles purely with alternating magnetic fields. As a direct trigger for the HER, magnetic fields can open cooperative pathways for maximizing hydrogen production by synergetic combinations with other energy sources such as electric fields and light.








Abstract
Magnetic fields have been regarded as an additional stimulus for electro&#8208; and photocatalytic reactions, but not as a direct trigger for catalytic processes. Multiferroic/magnetoelectric materials, whose electrical polarization and surface charges can be magnetically altered, are especially suitable for triggering and control of catalytic reactions solely with magnetic fields. Here, it is demonstrated that magnetic fields can be employed as an independent input energy source for hydrogen harvesting by means of the magnetoelectric effect. Composite multiferroic CoFe2O4&#8211;BiFeO3 core&#8211;shell nanoparticles act as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is triggered when an alternating magnetic field is applied to an aqueous dispersion of the magnetoelectric nanocatalysts. Based on density functional calculations, it is proposed that the hydrogen evolution is driven by changes in the ferroelectric polarization direction of BiFeO3 caused by the magnetoelectric coupling. It is believed that the findings will open new avenues toward magnetically induced renewable energy harvesting.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Tailored Surface Oxide on Cu&#8211;Ga Intermetallics Enhances CO2 Reduction Selectivity to Methanol at Ultralow Potential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8211;Ga&#8208;based intermetallics exhibit extremely high Faradaic efficiency toward methanol (78%) in an electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. The operando generates gallium oxide, identified as the active material, mapped via potential&#8208;dependent in situ X&#8208;ray absorption, in situ infrared, and ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic techniques. The best catalyst shows long&#8208;term stability with high current density in a gas diffusion electrode based flow cell.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) is performed on two intermetallic compounds formed by copper and gallium metals (CuGa2 and Cu9Ga4). Among them, CuGa2 selectively converts CO2 to methanol with remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 77.26% at an extremely low potential of &#8722;0.3&#160;V vs RHE. The high performance of CuGa2 compared to Cu9Ga4 is driven by its unique 2D structure, which retains surface and subsurface oxide species (Ga2O3) even in the reduction atmosphere. The Ga2O3 species is mapped by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) techniques and electrochemical measurements. The eCO2RR selectivity to methanol are decreased at higher potential due to the lattice expansion caused by the reduction of the Ga2O3, which is probed by in situ XAFS, quasi in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and ex situ XPS measurements. The mechanism of the formation of methanol is visualized by in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy and the source of the carbon of methanol at the molecular level is confirmed from the isotope&#8208;labeling experiments in presence of 13CO2. Finally, to minimize the mass transport limitations and improve the overall eCO2RR performance, a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)&#8208;based gas diffusion electrode is used in the flow cell configuration.

Tumor Therapy
In article number 2110094, Jianxun Ding and co&#8208;workers develop a versatile polymer, 1,2&#8208;distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8208;N&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;alendronate (DPA), for osteosarcoma blockade therapy. DPA not only initiates biomineralization in the peripheral tissue of tumors after insertion into the cytomembrane, but also alleviates bone destruction efficiently, both of which significantly inhibit the growth and lung metastasis of osteosarcoma.

Cytokine Storms
The homeostasis of the body is regulated by the immune system. The balance between tumorinduced immunosuppressive states and cytokine storms caused by immune hyperactivation in sepsis is like the yin and yang in Chinese. Biomimetic exosomes can suppress cytokine storms in sepsis with loaded miRNAs, as reported by Wenqing Gao, Yang Zhang, Huijuan Liu, Tao Sun, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2108476.

Triboresistive Touch Sensing
In article number 2108586, Jeong&#8208;Yun Sun and  co&#8208;workers report a novel type of touch sensing, termed triboresistive touch sensing, which is developed for self&#8208;powered gridless touch recognition. An ionic poly(dimethylsiloxane) exhibiting high transmittance (96.5%), stretchability (539.1%), resilience (99.0%), and ionic conductivity (0.25 mS m&#8722;1) is designed to generate power based on the electric field generated by touch. The generated voltages ensure recognition of the touch positions without electrode grid layers and external power sources.

Photovoltaic Waste
In article number 2110518, Nripan Mathews, Jing Wu, Ady Suwardi and co&#8208;workers enable upcycling of waste photovoltaics into thermoelectrics, making use of the majority&#8208;carrier nature of thermoelectrics, which are generally more defect&#8208; and impurity&#8208;tolerant than minority&#8208;carrier&#8208;based photovoltaics. This work helps to close the loop of circular economy for renewable energy.

Nanophotonics
As reported by Sohee Jeong, Dongho Kim, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2110665, by tuning their shape, single&#8208;crystalline InP nanocrystals undergo a transition from single&#8208; to multiphoton emitter. The geometric parameters of individual nanotetrapod particles drive a changeover of exciton confinement dimension. Interactions between multiple excitons in the tetrapodal geometry allow precise control over the nanophotonics.

Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
In article number 2110612, Chiara Gattinoni, Xiang&#8208;Zhong Chen, Salvador Pan&#233;, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the hydrogen evolution reaction can be triggered via the magnetoelectric effect when an alternating magnetic field is applied to an aqueous dispersion of composite multiferroic core&#8211;shell nanoparticles. These findings could provide cooperative pathways for maximizing hydrogen production yield by synergetic combinations of magnetic fields with other energy sources.

Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskites
In article number 2109374, Luca Catalano, Pan&#269;e Naumov, and co&#8208;workers address the poor mechanical robustness of bulk hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite (HOIP) crystals by demonstrating that broken centimeter&#8208;size single crystals of a typical HOIP, MAPbI3, can readily self&#8208;repair under mild compressive forces at ambient temperature. The self&#8208;healed crystals show an impressive recovery of their mechanical and optoelectronic properties.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials have spectacular electrical and optical properties but their device fabrication and integration are arduous and expensive. Optical modification methods offer less detrimental processes that can often be done in one optical setup, sometimes even simultaneously with one another, saving time and money. Additionally, the extreme locality of lasers can be utilized in designable laser direct writing processes.








Abstract
2D materials are under extensive research due to their remarkable properties suitable for various optoelectronic, photonic, and biological applications, yet their conventional fabrication methods are typically harsh and cost&#8208;ineffective. Optical modification is demonstrated as an effective and scalable method for accurate and local in situ engineering and patterning of 2D materials in ambient conditions. This review focuses on the state of the art of optical modification of 2D materials and their applications. Perspectives for future developments in this field are also discussed, including novel laser tools, new optical modification strategies, and their emerging applications in quantum technologies and biotechnologies.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Diffusion Induced Capacity Losses in Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the novel and largely overlooked Li&#8208;trapping mechanism is introduced and compared to other known capacity loss mechanisms affecting lithium&#8208;based batteries. The diffusion&#8208;based trapping of active Li inside both positive and negative electrode materials, leads to continuous albeit reversible capacity losses.








Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8208;based batteries generally exhibit gradual capacity losses resulting in decreasing energy and power densities. For negative electrode materials, the capacity losses are largely attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase layer and volume expansion effects. For positive electrode materials, the capacity losses are, instead, mainly ascribed to structural changes and metal ion dissolution. This review focuses on another, so far largely unrecognized, type of capacity loss stemming from diffusion of lithium atoms or ions as a result of concentration gradients present in the electrode. An incomplete delithiation step is then seen for a negative electrode material while an incomplete lithiation step is obtained for a positive electrode material. Evidence for diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity losses is presented based on published experimental data and results obtained in recent studies focusing on this trapping effect. The implications of the diffusion&#8208;controlled Li&#8208;trapping induced capacity losses, which are discussed using a straightforward diffusion&#8208;based model, are compared with those of other phenomena expected to give capacity losses. Approaches that can be used to identify and circumvent the diffusion&#8208;controlled Li&#8208;trapping problem (e.g., regeneration of cycled batteries) are discussed, in addition to remaining challenges and proposed future research directions within this important research area.

         <title>Nanosphere Lithography: A Versatile Approach to Develop Transparent Conductive Films for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanosphere lithography is a versatile platform for building 2D transparent nanomesh electrodes and optoelectronics. This review gives a critical overview of the recent research concerning the nanosphere lithography for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performing transparent conductive film design and fabrication toward flexible optoelectronics for energy conversion and storage, sensors, displays, and other applications.








Abstract
Transparent conductive films (TCFs) are irreplaceable components in most optoelectronic applications such as solar cells, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, sensors, smart windows, and bioelectronics. The shortcomings of existing traditional transparent conductors demand the development of new material systems that are both transparent and electrically conductive, with variable functionality to meet the requirements of new generation optoelectronic devices. In this respect, TCFs with periodic or irregular nanomesh structures have recently emerged as promising candidates, which possess superior mechanical properties in comparison with conventional metal oxide TCFs. Among the methods for nanomesh TCFs fabrication, nanosphere lithography (NSL) has proven to be a versatile platform, with which a wide range of morphologically distinct nanomesh TCFs have been demonstrated. These materials are not only functionally diverse, but also have advantages in terms of device compatibility. This review provides a comprehensive description of the NSL process and its most relevant derivatives to fabricate nanomesh TCFs. The structure&#8208;property relationships of these materials are elaborated and an overview of their application in different technologies across disciplines related to optoelectronics is given. It is concluded with a perspective on current shortcomings and future directions to further advance the field.

         <title>Bistable and Multistable Actuators for Soft Robots: Structures, Materials, and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing bistability and multistability for creating varieties of high&#8208;performance soft robots has attracted increasing interest in soft robotics. This paper presents a comprehensive review of integrating representative bistable and multistable structures with soft materials under different actuations in soft actuators for diverse robotic functionalities, as well as, theoretical guidance on structural designs and materials selection for target robotic tasks.








Abstract
Snap&#8208;through bistability is often observed in nature (e.g., fast snapping to closure of Venus flytrap) and the life (e.g., bottle caps and hair clippers). Recently, harnessing bistability and multistability in different structures and soft materials has attracted growing interest for high&#8208;performance soft actuators and soft robots. They have demonstrated broad and unique applications in high&#8208;speed locomotion on land and under water, adaptive sensing and fast grasping, shape reconfiguration, electronics&#8208;free controls with a single input, and logic computation. Here, an overview of integrating bistable and multistable structures with soft actuating materials for diverse soft actuators and soft/flexible robots is given. The mechanics&#8208;guided structural design principles for five categories of basic bistable elements from 1D to 3D (i.e., constrained beams, curved plates, dome shells, compliant mechanisms of linkages with flexible hinges and deformable origami, and balloon structures) are first presented, alongside brief discussions of typical soft actuating materials (i.e., fluidic elastomers and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials such as electro&#8208;, photo&#8208;, thermo&#8208;, magnetic&#8208;, and hydro&#8208;responsive polymers). Following that, integrating these soft materials with each category of bistable elements for soft bistable and multistable actuators and their diverse robotic applications are discussed. To conclude, perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field are considered.

Automotive head&#8208;up displays (HUDs) projected on the windshield provide the driver with visual navigation and vehicle data within the comfort of the driver's personal eye box through a customizable extended display space. This article presents a review of technological advances and future perspectives in holographic HUDs by analyzing the optoelectronics devices and the user experience of the driver.








Abstract
Driver's access to information about navigation and vehicle data through in&#8208;car displays and personal devices distract the driver from safe vehicle management. The discrepancy between road safety and infotainment must be addressed to develop safely operated modern vehicles. Head&#8208;up displays (HUDs) aim to introduce a seamless uptake of visual information for the driver while securely operating a vehicle. HUDs projected on the windshield provide the driver with visual navigation and vehicle data within the comfort of the driver's personal eye box through a customizable extended display space. Windshield HUDs do not require the driver to shift the gaze away from the road to attain road information. This article presents a review of technological advances and future perspectives in holographic HUDs by analyzing the optoelectronics devices and the user experience of the driver. The review elucidates holographic displays and full augmented reality in 3D with depth perception when projecting the visual information on the road within the driver's gaze. Design factors, functionality, and the integration of personalized machine learning technologies into holographic HUDs are discussed. Application examples of the display technologies regarding road safety and security are presented. An outlook is provided to reflect on display trends and autonomous driving.

         <title>Ion Migration in Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: Mechanism, Characterizations, and Material and Device Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 19, May 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental and engineering aspects of ion&#8208;related issues in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are reviewed, including the origins and driving mechanisms of ion migration, characterization approaches for probing ion distribution, impact of ion migration on device performance and stability, and strategies for ion management in PeLEDs. Perspectives on the remaining challenges and future opportunities are highlighted.








Abstract
In recent years, perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have emerged as a promising new lighting technology with high external quantum efficiency, color purity, and wavelength tunability, as well as, low&#8208;temperature processability. However, the operational stability of PeLEDs is still insufficient for their commercialization. The generation and migration of ionic species in metal halide perovskites has been widely acknowledged as the primary factor causing the performance degradation of PeLEDs. Herein, this topic is systematically discussed by considering the fundamental and engineering aspects of ion&#8208;related issues in PeLEDs, including the material and processing origins of ion generation, the mechanisms driving ion migration, characterization approaches for probing ion distributions, the effects of ion migration on device performance and stability, and strategies for ion management in PeLEDs. Finally, perspectives on remaining challenges and future opportunities are highlighted.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Airflow Sensors Based on Suspended Carbon Nanotube Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suspended carbon nanotube networks (SCNTNs) are prepared for fabricating high&#8208;performance airflow sensors. Due to the ultralight and flexible nature of CNTs and their unique junction structures, SCNTN&#8208;based airflow sensors achieved ultrafast response, low detection threshold, high sensitivity, and ultralong cycling lifetime. Acoustic tests and mathematical models show that their high sensing performance originates from the intertube stress at the junctions.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance airflow sensors are in great demand in numerous fields but still face many challenges, such as slow response speed, low sensitivity, large detection threshold, and narrow sensing range. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit many advantages in fabricating airflow sensors due to their nanoscale diameters, excellent mechanical and electrical properties, and so on. However, the intrinsic extraordinary properties of CNTs are not fully exhibited in previously reported CNT&#8208;based airflow sensors due to the mixed structures of macroscale CNT assemblies. Herein, this article presents suspended CNT networks (SCNTNs) as high&#8208;performance airflow sensors, which are self&#8208;assembled by ultralong CNTs and short CNTs in a one&#8208;step floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition process. The SCNTN&#8208;based airflow sensors achieved a record&#8208;breaking short response time of 0.021 s, a high sensitivity of 0.0124 s m&#8722;1, a small detection threshold of 0.11 m s&#8722;1, and a wide detection range of &#8776;0.11&#8211;5.51 m s&#8722;1, superior to most of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art airflow sensors. To reveal the sensing mechanism, an acoustic response testing system and a mathematical model are developed. It is found that the airflow&#8208;caused intertube stress change resulted in the resistance variation of SCNTNs.

Herein, this article presents suspended CNT networks (SCNTNs) as high-performance airflow sensors, which are self-assembled by ultralong CNTs and short CNTs in a one-step floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition process. The SCNTN-based airflow sensors achieved a record-breaking short response time of 0.021 s, a high sensitivity of 0.0124 s m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a small detection threshold of 0.11 m s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a wide detection range of &#8776;0.11&#8211;5.51 m s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, superior to most of the state-of-the-art airflow sensors. To reveal the sensing mechanism, an acoustic response testing system and a mathematical model are developed. It is found that the airflow-caused intertube stress change resulted in the resistance variation of SCNTNs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Conformational heterogeneity in bulky&#8208;group&#8208;shielded deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters enables suppression of spectral broadening, redshifting, and concentration quenching. Devices based on the emitter present high external quantum efficiency up to 22.35% with suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off and color indices close to Rec.2020 blue gamut over a wide doping range of 10&#8211;50 wt%.








Abstract
To achieve high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence satisfying Rec.2020 standard blue gamut, two thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters are developed: 5&#8208;(2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracen&#8208;7&#8208;yl)&#8208;10,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[b,e][1,4]azasiline (TDBA&#8208;PAS) and 10&#8208;(2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracen&#8208;7&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (TDBA&#8208;DPAC). Inheriting from their parented organoboron multi&#8208;resonance core, both emitters show very promising deep&#8208;blue emissions with relatively narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM, &#8776;50&#160;nm in solution), high photoluminescence quantum yield (up to 92.3%), and short emission lifetime (&#8804;2.49&#160;&#181;s) with fast reverse intersystem crossing (&gt;106 s&#8722;1) in doped films. More importantly, replacing the spiro&#8208;centered sp3 C atom (TDBA&#8208;DPAC) with the larger&#8208;radius sp3 Si atom (TDBA&#8208;PAS), enhanced conformational heterogeneities in bulky&#8208;group&#8208;shielded TADF molecules are observed in solution, doped film, and device. Consequently, OLEDs based on TDBA&#8208;PAS retain high maximum external quantum efficiencies &#8776;20% with suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off and color index close to Rec.2020 blue gamut over a wide doping range of 10&#8211;50 wt%. This study highlights a new strategy to restrain spectral broadening and redshifting and efficiency roll&#8208;off in the design of deep&#8208;blue TADF emitters.

         <title>A Binary Hydrate&#8208;Melt Electrolyte with Acetate&#8208;Oriented Cross&#8208;Linking Solvation Shells for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binary hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte with a new solvation structures is developed. In such an electrolyte, the carboxylate groups in OAc&#8722; can bond with the H2O molecules in their neighboring solvation structures, achieving a cross&#8208;linked H&#8208;bond network. Therefore, the hydrogen evolution reaction and by&#8208;product formation are remarkably restricted on Zn anodes in the hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with low cost and high safety are promising energy&#8208;storage devices. However, ZIBs with metal Zn anodes usually suffer from low coulombic efficiency and poor cycling performance due to the occurrence of side reactions on the Zn anodes. Here, a binary hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte is designed to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction and by&#8208;product formation on Zn anodes by adjusting the Zn2+ solvation structure. In the solvation structure of the hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte, the carboxylate group in OAc&#8722; will coordinate with the Zn2+, which will weaken the interaction between Zn2+ and H2O molecules to achieve higher ionization energy of H2O molecules. Simultaneously, these carboxylate groups of OAc&#8722; can serve as H&#8208;bond acceptors to construct H&#8208;bonds with H2O molecules in their neighboring solvation structures, forming a cross&#8208;linking H&#8208;bond network. Such a cross&#8208;linking H&#8208;bond network further suppresses the water activity in ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte. As a result, in such an electrolyte, the side reactions are effectively restricted on Zn anodes and thus Zn anodes can achieve a high coulombic efficiency of 99.59% even after cycling. To illustrate the feasibility of the ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte in aqueous ZIBs, Zn||p&#8208;chloranil cells are assembled based on the ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte. The resultant Zn||p&#8208;chloranil cells exhibit enhanced cycling performance compared with the cases with a conventional ZnSO4 electrolyte.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Material Design Enabling High&#8208;Performance Multifunctional Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics without Optical Modulations</title>

Detailed balance theory is applied to explore the performance potential for semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) based on complementary near&#8208;infrared materials. With this theory, ATT&#8208;9 with an optimal ultranarrow bandgap is designed and synthesized. The near&#8208;infrared blend PTB7&#8208;Th:ATT&#8208;9 featuring an ultralow Urbach energy achieves multifunctional ST&#8208;OPVs with an excellent light utilization efficiency and heat&#8208;insulation performance exceeding commercial 3M films.








Abstract
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) have drawn great attention for promising applications in building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, providing additional power generation for daily use. A previously proposed strategy, &#8220;complementary NIR absorption,&#8221; is widely applied for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs. However, rational material design toward high performance has not been achieved. In this work, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) model describing this strategy is developed to explore the full potential of material design on ST&#8208;OPV performance. Guided by the model, a novel nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), ATT&#8208;9, is designed and synthesized, which possesses optimal bandgap for ST&#8208;OPVs, achieving a record short&#8208;circuit current density of 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a power conversion efficiency of 13.40%, the highest value among devices based on NFAs with bandgaps lower than 1.2&#160;eV. It is notworthy that, at such a low bandgap, the energy loss of the device is only 0.58&#160;eV, which is attributed to the low energetic disorder confirmed by an ultralow Urbach energy of 21.6 meV. Benefiting from the optimal bandgap and low energy loss, the ATT&#8208;9&#8208;based ST&#8208;OPV achieves a high light utilization efficiency of 3.33% without optical modulations, and meanwhile shows excellent thermal insulation, exceeding the commercial 3M heat&#8208;insulating window film, demonstrating the outstanding application prospects of multifunctional ST&#8208;OPVs.

A comprehensive optimization strategy, including 2&#8208;phenylethylammonium ligand (PEA+)&#8208;passivated FAPbI3 quantum dots (QDs), synergistic coverage effects between the QDs and hole&#8208;transporting layers, and effective electron&#8208;transporting layers for constructing a feasible device structure leads to a high&#8208;efficiency near&#8208;infrared (NIR) QD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diode (QLED) centered at 772&#160;nm and exhibiting a maximum external quantum efficiency up to 15.4%, the highest external quantum efficiency recorded for perovskite&#8208;based NIR QLEDs.








Abstract
In recent years, the performance of perovskite quantum dots (QDs) and QD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) has improved greatly, with electroluminescence (EL) efficiency of green and red emission exceeding 20%. However, the development of perovskite near&#8208;infrared (NIR) QLEDs has reached stagnation, where the reported maximum EL efficiency is still below 6%, limiting their further applications. In this work, new NIR&#8208;emissive FAPbI3 QDs are developed by post&#8208;treating long alkyl&#8208;encapsulated QDs with 2&#8208;phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI). The incorporation of PEAI reduces the QD surface defects for giving a high photoluminescence quantum yield up to 61.6%. The n&#8208;octane solution of PEAI&#8208;passivated FAPbI3 QDs is spin coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS&#8208;treated ITO electrode modified with a thermally crosslinked hole&#8208;transporting layer to give a full&#8208;coverage, smooth, and dense QD film. Incorporating with an effective electron&#8208;transporting material, CN&#8208;T2T, which has deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and good electron mobility, the optimal device with EL &#955;max at 772&#160;nm achieves an external quantum efficiency up to 15.4% at a current density of 0.54&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (2.6&#160;V), which is the highest efficiency ever reported for perovskite&#8208;based NIR QLEDs. This study provides a facile strategy to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite QD films suitable for highly efficient NIR QLED applications.

         <title>Nanostructured, Fluid&#8208;Bicontinuous Gels for Continuous&#8208;Flow Liquid&#8211;Liquid Extraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nightmare of each plumber is a large network of entangled and branched pipes. In this work, this assembly is realized for pipes with diameters of a few hundred nanometers. Water is pumped through the network and solute molecules are exchanged between adjacent pipes. This liquid&#8211;liquid extraction process demonstrates the potential for continuous&#8208;flow molecular separations, important for a sustainable chemical industry.








Abstract
Fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gels are unique materials that allow two distinct fluids to interact through a percolating, rigid scaffold. Current restrictions for their use are the large fluid&#8208;channel sizes (&gt;5&#160;&#181;m), limiting the fluid&#8211;fluid interaction surface&#8208;area, and the inability to flow liquids through the channels. In this work a scalable synthesis route of nanoparticle stabilized fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gels with channels sizes below 500&#160;nm and specific surface areas of 2 m2 cm&#8722;3 is introduced. Moreover, it is demonstrated that liquids can be pumped through the fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gels via electroosmosis. The fast liquid flow in the fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gel facilitates their use for molecular separations in continuous&#8208;flow liquid&#8211;liquid extraction. Together with the high surface areas, liquid flow through fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gels enhances their potential as highly permeable porous materials with possible uses as microreaction media, fuel&#8208;cell components, and separation membranes.

         <title>Ferroelastic&#8211;Ferroelectric Multiferroicity in van der Waals Rhenium Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelastic&#8211;ferroelectric multiferroic materials can switch orientations of crystal structure and polarization with external strain. 2D ferroelastic&#8211;ferroelectric multiferroicity in single&#8208;crystalline rhenium dichalcogenides is discovered. Reorientation of the physical properties based on reversible bond switching between the rhenium atoms provides insights for 2D multiferroic phase transitions and opens up new opportunities for applications such as multilevel memory.








Abstract
2D multiferroics with combined ferroic orders have gained attention owing to their novel functionality and underlying science. Intrinsic ferroelastic&#8211;ferroelectric multiferroicity in single&#8208;crystalline van der Waals rhenium dichalcogenides, whose symmetries are broken by the Peierls distortion and layer&#8208;stacking order, is demonstrated. Ferroelastic switching of the domain orientation and accompanying anisotropic properties is achieved with 1% uniaxial strain using the polymer encapsulation method. Based on the electron localization function and bond dissociation energy of the Re&#8211;Re bonds, the change in bond configuration during the evolution of the domain wall and the preferred switching between the two specific orientation states are explained. Furthermore, the ferroelastic switching of ferroelectric polarization is confirmed using the photovoltaic effect. The study provides insights into the reversible bond&#8208;switching process and potential applications based on 2D multiferroicity.

         <title>Highly Anisotropic Organometal Halide Perovskite Nanowalls Grown by Glancing&#8208;Angle Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel vacuum&#8208;based approach, compatible with most substrates, for the fabrication of aligned organometal halide perovskite vertical nanowalls by glancing&#8208;angle deposition, is presented. Their alignment provides the samples with strong anisotropic properties, such as photoluminescence. Furthermore, their implementation in photovoltaic devices provides them with a polarization&#8208;sensitive response, a milestone for the development of self&#8208;powered photodetectors.








Abstract
Polarizers are ubiquitous components in current optoelectronic devices as displays or photographic cameras. Yet, control over light polarization is an unsolved challenge, since the main drawback of the existing display technologies is the significant optical losses. In such a context, organometal halide perovskites (OMHP) can play a decisive role given their flexible synthesis with tunable optical properties such as bandgap and photoluminescence, and excellent light emission with a low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate. Therefore, along with their outstanding electrical properties have elevated hybrid perovskites as the material of choice in photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Among the different OMHP nanostructures, nanowires and nanorods have lately arisen as key players in the control of light polarization for lighting or detector applications. Herein, the fabrication of highly aligned and anisotropic methylammonium lead iodide perovskite nanowalls by glancing&#8208;angle deposition, which is compatible with most substrates, is presented. Their high alignment degree provides the samples with anisotropic optical properties such as light absorption and photoluminescence. Furthermore, their implementation in photovoltaic devices provides them with a polarization&#8208;sensitive response. This facile vacuum&#8208;based approach embodies a milestone in the development of last&#8208;generation polarization&#8208;sensitive perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices such as lighting appliances or self&#8208;powered photodetectors.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Engineered Conjugated Polymer Nanoplatform for Activatable Companion Diagnostics and Multistage Augmented Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>

A glucose&#8208;oxidase&#8208;based nanoplatform simultaneously realizes photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;based companion diagnostics, photothermal/starvation therapy, and real&#8208;time monitoring of cancer treatment.








Abstract
Companion diagnostics (CDx) provides critical information for precision medicine. However, current CDx is mostly limited to in vitro tests, which cannot accurately evaluate the disease progression and treatment response in real time. To overcome this challenge, herein a glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;engineered conjugated polymer (polyaniline, PANI) nanoplatform (denoted as PANITG) is reported for activatable imaging&#8208;based CDx and multistage augmented photothermal/starvation synergistic therapy. PANITG comprises a pH&#8208;activatable conjugated polymer as a photothermal convertor and photoacoustic (PA) emitter, a GOx as a cancer starvation inducer as well as a H2O2 and acid producer, and a H2O2&#8208;cleavable linker as a &#8220;switch&#8221; for GOx activity. The in vivo PA imaging and photothermal therapy abilities are activated by acidic tumor microenvironment and self&#8208;augmented by the reaction between GOx and glucose. Meanwhile, the photothermal effect will enhance the GOx activity in turn. Such multistage augmentation of the therapeutic effects will facilitate effective cancer management. In addition, the in vivo PA imaging with PANITG reveals the tumor pH level which is correlated to the efficiency of the photothermal therapy and to the catalytic activity of GOx at each stage, enabling real&#8208;time activatable CDx.

&lt;p&gt;A glucose-oxidase-based nanoplatform simultaneously realizes photoacoustic-imaging-based companion diagnostics, photothermal/starvation therapy, and real-time monitoring of cancer treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companion diagnostics (CDx) provides critical information for precision medicine. However, current CDx is mostly limited to in vitro tests, which cannot accurately evaluate the disease progression and treatment response in real time. To overcome this challenge, herein a glucose oxidase (GOx)-engineered conjugated polymer (polyaniline, PANI) nanoplatform (denoted as PANITG) is reported for activatable imaging-based CDx and multistage augmented photothermal/starvation synergistic therapy. PANITG comprises a pH-activatable conjugated polymer as a photothermal convertor and photoacoustic (PA) emitter, a GOx as a cancer starvation inducer as well as a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and acid producer, and a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-cleavable linker as a &#8220;switch&#8221; for GOx activity. The in vivo PA imaging and photothermal therapy abilities are activated by acidic tumor microenvironment and self-augmented by the reaction between GOx and glucose. Meanwhile, the photothermal effect will enhance the GOx activity in turn. Such multistage augmentation of the therapeutic effects will facilitate effective cancer management. In addition, the in vivo PA imaging with PANITG reveals the tumor pH level which is correlated to the efficiency of the photothermal therapy and to the catalytic activity of GOx at each stage, enabling real-time activatable CDx.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Fully Solution&#8208;Printed Photosynaptic Transistor Array with Ultralow Energy Consumption for Artificial&#8208;Vision Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully solution&#8208;printed photosynaptic organic field&#8208;effect transistor is developed by introducing a source Schottky barrier. Both working voltage and current are substantially lowered, giving rise to an ultralow energy consumptions of 0.07&#8211;34 fJ per spike in short&#8208;term plasticity and 0.41&#8211;19.87 fJ per spike in long&#8208;term plasticity, which are comparable with biological synapses.








Abstract
Photosynaptic organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) represent a viable pathway to develop bionic optoelectronics. However, the high operating voltage and current of traditional photosynaptic OFETs lead to huge energy consumption greater than that of the real biological synapses, hindering their further development in new&#8208;generation visual prosthetics and artificial perception systems. Here, a fully solution&#8208;printed photosynaptic OFET (FSP&#8208;OFET) with substantial energy consumption reduction is reported, where a source Schottky barrier is introduced to regulate charge&#8208;carrier injection, and which operates with a fundamentally different mechanism from traditional devices. The FSP&#8208;OFET not only significantly lowers the working voltage and current but also provides extraordinary neuromorphic light&#8208;perception capabilities. Consequently, the FSP&#8208;OFET successfully emulates visual nervous responses to external light stimuli with ultralow energy consumption of 0.07&#8211;34 fJ per spike in short&#8208;term plasticity and 0.41&#8211;19.87 fJ per spike in long&#8208;term plasticity, both approaching the energy efficiency of biological synapses (1&#8211;100 fJ). Moreover, an artificial optic&#8208;neural network made from an 8 &#215; 8 FSP&#8208;OFET array on a flexible substrate shows excellent image recognition and reinforcement abilities at a low energy cost. The designed FSP&#8208;OFET offers an opportunity to realize photonic neuromorphic functionality with extremely low energy consumption dissipation.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Fibers Embedded with Zincophilic Cu Nanoboxes for Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D framework consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon fibers embedded with Cu nanoboxes (Cu NBs@NCFs) is constructed as a multifunctional host for dendrite&#8208;free and stable Zn anodes. Benefiting from the macroporous network, hollow structures, and rich zincophilic sites, the Cu NBs@NCFs host shows low voltage hysteresis, high Coulombic efficiency, and impressive cycling stability in both symmetric and full cells.








Abstract
The practical application of Zn&#8208;metal anodes (ZMAs) is mainly impeded by the limited lifespan and low Coulombic efficiency (CE) resulting from the Zn dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, a 3D multifunctional host consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon fibers embedded with Cu nanoboxes (denoted as Cu NBs@NCFs) is rationally designed and developed for stable ZMAs. The 3D macroporous configuration and hollow structure can lower the local current density and alleviate the large volume change during the repeated cycling processes. Furthermore, zincophilic Cu and in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed Cu&#8211;Zn alloy can act as homogeneous nucleation sites to minimize the Zn nucleation overpotential, further guiding uniform and dense Zn deposition. As a result, this Cu NBs@NCFs host exhibits high CE of Zn plating/stripping for 1000 cycles. The Cu NBs@NCFs&#8211;Zn electrode shows low voltage hysteresis and prolonged cycling life (450 h) with dendrite&#8208;free behaviors. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a Zn&#8208;ion full cell is fabricated based on this Cu NBs@NCFs&#8211;Zn anode, which demonstrates decent rate capability and improved cycling performance.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Encoding Free&#8208;Standing RNA Hydrogel for Sub&#8208;Compartmentalized Translation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and robust RNA hydrogel is developed as a result of rolling circle transcription possessing RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes. Selective catalytic activity and enhanced production of proteins in a sub&#8208;compartmentalized system are observed. This innovative gel technology will expand the current realm of RNA research and create an impact on the RNA principles and applications from the bench to the clinic.








Abstract
RNA can self&#8208;fold into complex structures that can serve as major biological regulators in protein synthesis and in catalysis. Due to the abundance of structural primitives and functional diversity, RNA has been utilized for designing nature&#8208;defined goals despite its intrinsic chemical instability and lack of technologies. Here, a robust, free&#8208;standing RNA hydrogel is developed through a sequential process involving both ligation and rolling circle transcription to form RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes, capable of both catalytic activity and enhancing expression of several proteins in sub&#8208;compartmentalized, phase&#8208;separated translation environments. The observations suggest that this hydrogel will expand RNA research and impact practical RNA principles and applications.

         <title>Unveiling the Interaction Mechanisms of Electron and X&#8208;ray Radiation with Halide Perovskite Semiconductors using Scanning Nanoprobe Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution microscopy using nanoprobe diffraction reveals spatially resolved changes in the local crystal structure of halide perovskite films upon irradiation with high&#8208;energy electrons and X&#8208;rays. High&#8208;angle defective grain boundaries trigger the formation of degradation phases, leading to changes in the crystal structure. Targeting high&#8208;angle grain boundaries is critical for film stability under high&#8208;energy radiation conditions, especially for space photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
The interaction of high&#8208;energy electrons and X&#8208;ray photons with beam&#8208;sensitive semiconductors such as halide perovskites is essential for the characterization and understanding of these optoelectronic materials. Using nanoprobe diffraction techniques, which can investigate physical properties on the nanoscale, studies of the interaction of electron and X&#8208;ray radiation with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art (FA0.79MA0.16Cs0.05)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 hybrid halide perovskite films (FA, formamidinium; MA, methylammonium) are performed, tracking the changes in the local crystal structure as a function of fluence using scanning electron diffraction and synchrotron nano X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. Perovskite grains are identified, from which additional reflections, corresponding to PbBr2, appear as a crystalline degradation phase after fluences of 200 e&#8722; &#197;&#8722;2. These changes are concomitant with the formation of small PbI2 crystallites at the adjacent high&#8208;angle grain boundaries, with the formation of pinholes, and with a phase transition from tetragonal to cubic. A similar degradation pathway is caused by photon irradiation in nano&#8208;X&#8208;ray diffraction, suggesting common underlying mechanisms. This approach explores the radiation limits of these materials and provides a description of the degradation pathways on the nanoscale. Addressing high&#8208;angle grain boundaries will be critical for the further improvement of halide polycrystalline film stability, especially for applications vulnerable to high&#8208;energy radiation such as space photovoltaics.

         <title>Magnon&#8208;Coupled Intralayer Moir&#233; Trion in Monolayer Semiconductor&#8211;Antiferromagnet Heterostructures</title>

         <dc:description>
Moir&#233; patterns of van der Waals heterostructures offer a powerful platform for engineering excitonic states, leading to the formation of moir&#233; excitonic states. However, interactions between moir&#233; excitonic states and magnetic elementary excitations are not studied. In this work, a moir&#233; excitonic system interacting with an antiferromagnetic order in a monolayer MoSe2 and an antiferromagnetic MnPS3 heterostructure is reported.








Abstract
Moir&#233; fringe patterns created by stacking different 2D layered materials as artificial van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have become a novel platform to study and engineer optically generated excitonic properties. The moir&#233; patterns contribute to the formation of spatially ordered excitonic states (excitons and trions), which can be used in the quantum simulation of many&#8208;body systems and ensembles of coherent quantum light emitters. The intriguing moir&#233; excitonic properties are affected by and controlled via the interaction with magnetic elements. Here, a moir&#233; excitonic system interacting with the magnetic elementary excitation of antiferromagnetic orders in MoSe2/MnPS3 vdW heterostructures is reported. The low&#8208;temperature photoluminescence spectra with additional fine spectral structures on the low&#8208;energy side, which are coupled magnon&#8211;trion peaks below the N&#233;el temperature of MnPS3, are carefully investigated. The fine spectral structures with long lifetime and coherence time are assigned to intralayer trion&#8211;magnon complexes trapped in the moir&#233; potentials (moir&#233; trion&#8211;magnon complexes). These findings highlight the emergence of moir&#233; trion&#8211;magnon complexes and provide a new way to explore novel quantum phenomena in moir&#233; excitonic systems with magnetic functionalities.

         <title>Reducing Contact Resistance and Boosting Device Performance of Monolayer MoS2 by In Situ Fe Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable Fe doping strategy is developed in centimeter&#8208;sized monolayer MoS2 films with ultralow contact resistance. Excellent device performance featured with ultrahigh electron mobility and on/off current ratio is achieved, thanks to the ultralow electron effective mass. Unidirectional Fe&#8208;MoS2 domains are prepared on 2 in. commercial c&#8208;plane sapphire, suggesting the feasibility of synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal semiconductors with outstanding device performance.








Abstract
2D semiconductors are emerging as plausible candidates for next&#8208;generation &#8220;More&#8208;than&#8208;Moore&#8221; nanoelectronics to tackle the scaling challenge of transistors. Wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WS2, have been successfully synthesized recently; nevertheless, the absence of effective doping technology fundamentally results in energy barriers and high contact resistances at the metal&#8211;semiconductor interfaces, and thus restrict their practical applications. Herein, a controllable doping strategy in centimeter&#8208;sized monolayer MoS2 films is developed to address this critical issue and boost the device performance. The ultralow contact resistance and perfect Ohmic contact with metal electrodes are uncovered in monolayer Fe&#8208;doped MoS2, which deliver excellent device performance featured with ultrahigh electron mobility and outstanding on/off current ratio. Impurity scattering is suppressed significantly thanks to the ultralow electron effective mass and appropriate doping site. Particularly, unidirectionally aligned monolayer Fe&#8208;doped MoS2 domains are prepared on 2 in. commercial c&#8208;plane sapphire, suggesting the feasibility of synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale 2D single&#8208;crystal semiconductors with outstanding device performance. This work presents the potential of high&#8208;performance monolayer transistors and enables further device downscaling and extension of Moore's law.

         <title>A Gradient pH&#8208;Sensitive Polymer&#8208;Based Antiviral Strategy via Viroporin&#8208;Induced Membrane Acidification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is challenging to develop potent and broad&#8208;spectrum antivirals. Gradient pH&#8208;sensitive polymeric nanoprobes are designed for accurate measurement of the cellular membrane acidification induced by virus infection. In response to acidified membranes, one of the polymers selectively targets to virus&#8208;infected cells and viruses, eventually lysing viral envelopes and exerting powerful activities against a variety of viruses.








Abstract
Lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;targeting strategies hold great promise to develop broad&#8208;spectrum antivirals. However, it remains a big challenge to identify novel membrane&#8208;based targets of viruses and virus&#8208;infected cells for development of precision targeted approaches. Here, it is discovered that viroporins, viral&#8208;encoded ion channels, which have been reported to mediate release of hydrogen ions, trigger membrane acidification of virus&#8208;infected cells. Through development of a fine&#8208;scale library of gradient pH&#8208;sensitive (GPS) polymeric nanoprobes, the cellular membrane pH transitions are measured from pH 6.8&#8211;7.1 (uninfection) to pH 6.5&#8211;6.8 (virus&#8208;infection). In response to the subtle pH alterations, the GPS polymer with sharp response at pH 6.8 (GPS6.8) selectively binds to virus&#8208;infected cell membranes or the viral envelope, and even completely disrupts the viral envelope. Accordingly, GPS6.8 treatment exerts suppressive effects on a wide variety of viruses including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 through triggering viral&#8208;envelope lysis rather than affecting immune pathway or viability of host cells. Murine viral&#8208;infection models exhibit that supplementation of GPS6.8 decreases viral titers and ameliorates inflammatory damage. Thus, the gradient pH&#8208;sensitive nanotechnology offers a promising strategy for accurate detection of biological pH environments and robust interference with viruses.

         <title>A Selective Targeting Anchor Strategy Affords Efficient and Stable Ideal&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming for hybrid perovskite solar cells, a novel strategy is developed that using ethylenediamine diiodide and phenethylammonium iodide as co&#8208;modifiers to selectively targeting anchor with lead&#8211;tin binary perovskite materials, resulting in comprehensively healing the dual&#8208;sourced defects. As a result, a champion efficiency of 22.51% is achieved, which is the record efficiency among the ideal&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Mixed lead&#8211;tin perovskite solar cells (LTPSCs) with an ideal bandgap are demonstrated as a promising candidate to reach higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than their Pb&#8208;counterparts. Herein, a Br&#8208;free mixed lead&#8211;tin perovskite material, FA0.8MA0.2Pb0.8Sn0.2I3, with a bandgap of 1.33&#160;eV, as a perovskite absorber, is selected. Through density functional theory calculations and optoelectronic techniques, it is demonstrated that both Pb&#8208; and Sn&#8208;related A&#8208;site vacancies are pushed into deeper energetic depth, causing severe nonradiative recombination. Hence, a selective targeting anchor strategy that employs phenethylammonium iodide and ethylenediamine diiodide as co&#8208;modifiers to selectively anchor with Pb&#8208; and Sn&#8208;related active sites and passivate bimetallic traps, respectively, is established. Furthermore, the selectivity of the molecular oriented anchor passivation is demonstrated through energetic depth specificity of Pb&#8208; and Sn&#8208;related traps. As a result, a substantially enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) from 0.79 to 0.90 V for the LTPSCs is achieved, yielding a champion PCE of 22.51%, which is the highest PCE among the reported ideal&#8208;bandgap PSCs. The VOC loss is reduced to 0.43&#160;V.

         <title>Accurately Localizing Multiple Nanoparticles in a Multishelled Matrix Through Shell&#8208;to&#8208;Core Evolution for Maximizing Energy&#8208;Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicate structure of multiple cores localized separately in a hollow multishelled matrix is developed and achieved through a facile synthesis strategy of &#8220;in situ evolution of shell to core&#8221;. Such a structure could benefit charge diffusion, buffer the volume expansion, and stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase, thus enabling the high&#8208;capacity electrode material to realize nearly its theoretical lithium&#8208;storage capability.








Abstract
Robust and fast lithium energy storage with a high energy density is highly desired to accelerate the market adoption of electric vehicles. To realize such a goal requires the development of electrode materials with a high capacity, however, such electrode materials suffer from huge volume expansion and induced short cycling life. Here, using tin (Sn) as an example, an ideal structure is designed to effectively solve these problems by separately localizing multiple Sn nanoparticles in a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon hollow multishelled structure with duplicated layers for carbon shell (Sn NPs@NxC HoMS&#8208;DL). The fabricated composite can promote ion and electron diffusion owing to the conductive network formed by connected multiple shells and cores, effectively buffer the volume expansion, and maintain a stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. Despite the challenging fabrication, such a structure is realized through an innovative and facile synthesis strategy of &#8220;in situ evolution of shell to core&#8221;, which is applicable for diverse low&#8208;melting&#8208;point materials. As expected, such a structure enables the high&#8208;capacity electrode material to realize nearly its theoretical lithium&#8208;storage capability: the developed Sn NPs@NxC HoMS&#8208;DL electrode maintains 96% of its theoretical capacity after 2000 cycles at 2C.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Defective and Porous Ir Metallene with Polyallylamine for Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyallylamine&#8208;wrapped Ir metallene with a defective and porous structure is fabricated by a one&#8208;step wet chemical reduction method. The abundance of defects and pores and the surface functionalization of the Ir metallene provide a large specific surface area, high conductivity, efficient mass transport/diffusion, and tunable electronic structure, resulting in excellent hydrogen evolution reaction performance.








Abstract
The design of defects and porous structures into metallene with functional surfaces is highly desired to improve its permeability, surface area, and active sites, but remains a great challenge. In this work, polyallylamine&#8208;encapsulated Ir metallene with defects and porous structure (Ir@PAH metallene) is easily fabricated by a one&#8208;step wet chemical reduction method. The Ir@PAH metallene exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with an overpotential of only 14&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, a low Tafel slope of 31.2&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, and almost no activity decay after stability test. The abundant defects and pores as well as several&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer nanosheet structures of Ir@PAH metallene provide a large specific surface area, high conductivity, and efficient mass transport/diffusion. In addition, surface&#8208;functionalized PAH molecules can modulate the electronic structure through strong Ir&#8211;N interaction and act as proton carriers to capture hydrogen ions, which is very beneficial for the HER in acidic media. This work provides a useful strategy for the synthesis of the defective and porous metallene with functionalized surfaces for various catalytic applications.

         <title>Chemical Passivation Stabilizes Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical passivation of Zn surface is achieved by a simple treatment in a solution of strong oxidant such as KMnO4, which drastically improves its electrochemical cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are an attractive option for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, which is vital to the integration of renewable energy resources with the electric energy infrastructure. The cycling stability of aqueous ZIBs is determined by the electrochemical reversibility of Zn anode, which is often deteriorated by its corrosion and dendritic Zn deposition. Here, a simple and rapid surface passivation strategy that can drastically improve the cycling stability of Zn anodes is demonstrated. For example, a dip in KMnO4 solution readily forms a continuous, conformal, and robust protective layer on the native Zn surface, leading to a more uniform plating/stripping process, increased corrosion resistance, and tolerance to manufacturing and processing defects on Zn metal electrodes. The Zn electrode cycling stabilities at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 are extended by &#8776;40 times. In full battery tests in the configuration of Zn||&#946;&#8208;MnO2, the full cell with passivated Zn anode exhibited a capacity retention of 68.7% after 300 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g&#8722;1, while the cell with untreated Zn anode can only retain 7.4% of capacity under the same conditions.

         <title>Integrated Afterglow and Self&#8208;Trapped Exciton Emissions in Hybrid Metal Halides for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed to modulate the afterglow and self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emissions in 0D (Ph3S)2Sn1&#8722;xTexCl6 (x = 0&#8211;1) single crystals. Moreover, the integration of afterglow and STE emissions is realized in (Ph3S)2Sn0.92Te0.08Cl6. These as&#8208;prepared 0D hybrid metal halides with colorful emissions are demonstrated for multiple anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information storage applications.








Abstract
0D hybrid metal halides (0D HMHs) are considered to be promising luminescent emitters. 0D HMHs commonly exhibit self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emissions originating from the inorganic metal halide anion units. Exploring and utilizing the emission features of the organic cation units in 0D HMHs is highly desired to enrich their optical properties as multifunctional luminescent materials. Here, tunable emissions from organic and inorganic units are successfully achieved in triphenylsulfonium (Ph3S+)&#8208;based 0D HMHs. Notably, integrated afterglow and STE emissions with adjustable intensities are obtained in (Ph3S)2Sn1&#8722;xTexCl6 (x&#160;= 0&#8211;1) via the delicate combination of [SnCl6]2&#8722; and [TeCl6]2&#8722;. Moreover, such a strategy can be readily extended to develop other HMH materials with intriguing optical properties. As a demonstration, 0D (Ph3S)2Zn1&#8722;xMnxCl4 (x&#160;= 0&#8211;1) are constructed to achieve integrated afterglow and Mn2+ d&#8211;d emissions with high efficiency. Consequently, these novel 0D HMHs with colorful afterglow and STE emissions are applied in multiple anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Bioinspired Tough Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Flexible Ultralong&#8208;Life Zinc&#8211;Air Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
A tough, intrinsic hydroxide&#8208;conductive, bioinspired solid&#8208;state electrolyte is designed for flexible ultralong&#8208;life zinc&#8211;air batteries, which is featured of dynamic dual&#8208;penetrating network structure with the synergism of ionomer and molecular polymer and gracefully obtains excellent comprehensive properties of mechanical robustness, high ion conductivity and good water retention.








Abstract
Manufacturing advanced solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) for flexible rechargeable batteries becomes increasingly important but remains grand challenge. The sophisticated structure of robust animal dermis and good water&#8208;retention of plant cell in nature grant germane inspirations for designing high&#8208;performance SSEs. Herein, tough bioinspired SSEs with intrinsic hydroxide ion (OH&#8722;) conduction are constructed by in situ formation of OH&#8722; conductive ionomer network within a hollow&#8208;polymeric&#8208;microcapsule&#8208;decorated hydrogel polymer network. By virtue of the bioinspired design and dynamic dual&#8208;penetrating network structure, the bioinspired SSEs simultaneously obtain mechanical robustness with 1800% stretchability, good water uptake of 107&#160;g g&#8722;1 and water retention, and superhigh ion conductivity of 215 mS cm&#8722;1. The nanostructure of bioinspired SSE and related ion&#8208;conduction mechanism are revealed and visualized by molecular dynamics simulation, where plenty of compact and superfast ion&#8208;transport channels are constructed, contributing to superhigh ion conductivity. As a result, the flexible solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries assembled with bioinspired SSEs witness high power density of 148 mW cm&#8722;2, specific capacity of 758 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultralong cycling stability of 320 h as well as outstanding flexibility. The bioinspired methodology and deep insight of ion&#8208;conduction mechanism will shed light on the design of advanced SSEs for flexible energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>Biobased Elastomer Nanofibers Guide Light&#8208;Controlled Human&#8208;iPSC&#8208;Derived Skeletal Myofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastomeric nanofiber sheets, made from a new biobased nanohybrid polymer, support the differentiation and contractile function of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived skeletal muscle fibers. The controlled alignment of nanofibers provides extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;like guidance, promoting myofiber differentiation and maturation. The hyperelastic properties of the elastomer nanofibers stabilize optogenetically activate contractions and promote culture longevity.








Abstract
Generating skeletal muscle tissue that mimics the cellular alignment, maturation, and function of native skeletal muscle is an ongoing challenge in disease modeling and regenerative therapies. Skeletal muscle cultures require extracellular guidance and mechanical support to stabilize contractile myofibers. Existing microfabrication&#8208;based solutions are limited by complex fabrication steps, low throughput, and challenges in measuring dynamic contractile function. Here, the synthesis and characterization of a new biobased nanohybrid elastomer, which is electrospun into aligned nanofiber sheets to mimic the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix, is presented. The polymer exhibits remarkable hyperelasticity well&#8208;matched to that of native skeletal muscle (&#8776;11&#8211;50&#160;kPa), with ultimate strain &#8776;1000%, and elastic modulus &#8776;25&#160;kPa.&#160;Uniaxially aligned nanofibers guide myoblast alignment, enhance sarcomere formation, and promote a &#8776;32% increase in myotube fusion and &#8776;50% increase in myofiber maturation. The elastomer nanofibers stabilize optogenetically&#160;controlled human induced pluripotent stem cell derived skeletal myofibers. When activated by blue light, the myofiber&#8211;nanofiber hybrid constructs maintain a significantly higher (&gt;200%) contraction velocity and specific force (&gt;280%) compared to conventional culture methods. The engineered myofibers exhibit a power density of &#8776;35&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;3. This system is a promising new skeletal muscle tissue model for applications in muscular disease modeling, drug discovery, and muscle regeneration.

         <title>Mesoporous Single&#8208;Crystal Lithium Titanate Enabling Fast&#8208;Charging Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous single&#8208;crystal architecture is performed on the spinel Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) anode for ultrafast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The unique interconnected porous structure of LTO microrods significantly shortens the Li+ ion diffusion length and facilitates electrolyte mass transportation. The single&#8208;crystalline nature of these LTO microrods is well preserved even after 10&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
There remain significant challenges in developing fast&#8208;charging materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to sluggish ion diffusion kinetics and unfavorable electrolyte mass transportation in battery electrodes. In this work, a mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline lithium titanate (MSC&#8208;LTO) microrod that can realize exceptional fast charge/discharge performance and excellent long&#8208;term stability in LIBs is reported. The MSC&#8208;LTO microrods are featured with a single&#8208;crystalline structure and interconnected pores inside the entire single&#8208;crystalline body. These features not only shorten the lithium&#8208;ion diffusion distance but also allow for the penetration of electrolytes into the single&#8208;crystalline interior during battery cycling. Hence, the MSC&#8208;LTO microrods exhibit unprecedentedly high rate capability, achieving a specific discharge capacity of &#8776;174 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, which is very close to its theoretical capacity, and &#8776;169 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 C. More importantly, the porous single&#8208;crystalline microrods greatly mitigate the structure degradation during a long&#8208;term cycling test, offering &#8776;92% of the initial capacity after 10&#160;000 cycles at 20 C. This work presents a novel strategy to engineer porous single&#8208;crystalline materials and paves a new venue for developing fast&#8208;charging materials for LIBs.

         <title>White&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Resonant Emission from a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk gain media, large&#8208;dimensional resonant cavities, and sizable focusing apparatuses seriously limit the application scope of solar&#8208;powered light sources. Particularly, the miniaturization of solar&#8208;driven photon emitters remains challenging. Here resonant emission from monolayer semiconductor under simulated solar illumination by a white&#8208;light emitting diode is demonstrated, which represents an exciting step toward on&#8208;chip solar&#8208;powered photonic circuits.








Abstract
Resonant emission in photonic structures is very useful to construct all&#8208;photonic circuits for optical interconnects and quantum computing. Optical generation of most resonant&#8208;emitting modes in photonic structures is obtained by coherent pumping rather than incoherent illumination. Particularly, the development of white&#8208;light&#8208; or even solar&#8208;powered on&#8208;chip light sources remains challenging but is very attractive in view of the much facile availability of these incoherent excitation sources. Here, net resonant emission from a monolayer semiconductor is demonstrated under simulated solar illumination by a white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode. The device is formed by embedding a 2D gain medium into a planar microcavity on a silicon wafer, which is compatible with the prevailing on&#8208;chip photonic technology. Coherent and white&#8208;light excitation sources are, respectively, selected for optical pumping, where the output light in two cases exhibits well&#8208;consistent resonant wavelength, linewidth, polarization, location, and Gaussian&#8208;beam profile. The fundamental TEM00 mode behaves as a doublet emission, resulting from anisotropy&#8208;induced non&#8208;degenerate states with orthogonal polarizations. The extraordinary spectral flipping is attributed to the competitive interplay of resonant absorption and emission. This work paves a way toward white&#8208;light or solar&#8208;powered state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photonic applications at the chip scale.

         <title>Creating Composite Vortex Beams with a Single Geometric Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compact metasurface approach is proposed and experimentally demonstrated to create composite vortex beams. A single geometric metasurface is used to realize the superposition of multiple vortex beams with different circular polarization states. This method provides a compact platform to generate composite vortex beams with engineered singularity distributions, which are fundamentally important for singular optics and quantum science.








Abstract
Composite vortex beams (CVBs) have attracted considerable interest recently due to the unique optical properties and potential applications. However, these beams are mainly generated using spatial light modulators, which suffer from large volume, high cost, and limited resolution. Benefiting from the ultrathin nature and unprecedented capability in light manipulation, optical metasurfaces provide a compact platform to perform this task. A metasurface approach to creating these CVBs is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The design is based on the superposition of multiple circularly polarized vortex beams with different topological charges, which is realized based on a geometric metasurface consisting of metallic nanorods with spatially variant orientations. The effects of the initial phases, amplitude coefficients, incident polarization state, and propagation distance on the generated CVBs, which are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction, are experimentally analyzed. This work has opened a new avenue for engineering CVBs with a minimal footprint, which has promising applications ranging from multiple optical traps to quantum science.

         <title>Mobile Phone Flashlight&#8208;Excited Red Afterglow Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the rational design of organic luminogens with strong intramolecular charge transfer and optimized molecular geometry, the mobile phone flashlight&#8208;excited red afterglow imaging of lymph nodes in living mice is realized for the first time, offering a safe and conventional approach to realize the afterglow imaging of living mice with deep issue penetration and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio.








Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with ultralong lifetime possess the remarkable advantage in bioimaging for elimination of background noise by characteristic time scale. However, most of RTP luminogens need to be excited by the harmful ultraviolet (UV) lamp, and exhibit green or yellow emission with shallow tissue penetration, constraining the in vivo bioimaging for further application in clinical diagnosis and pathological study. In this text, the much safer excitation process by sunlight and mobile phone flashlight is realized by organic luminogens with various electronic pull&#8211;push systems. Moreover, the bright red RTP emission with lifetime up to 344&#160;ms is achieved by optimizing molecular geometry and electronic property. Especially, the mobile phone flashlight&#8208;excited red afterglow imaging of lymph nodes in living mice has been realized for the first time, affording a safe and conventional approach to achieve the afterglow imaging of living mice with deep issue penetration and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Micropatterning of Polydopamine by Multiphoton Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mussel&#8208;inspired polydopamine serves as a versatile platform for facile functionalization applicable to almost any surface. In this work, a novel approach of polydopamine deposition applying multiphoton lithography is introduced, resulting in 2D microstructures of complex designs with adjustable morphology and thickness. Reaching sub&#8208;micrometer pattern precision, this approach does not require photomasks or stamps and enables full spatial deposition control.








Abstract
Mussel&#8208;inspired polydopamine (PDA) initiates a multifunctional modification route that leads to the generation of novel advanced materials and their applications. However, existing PDA deposition techniques still exhibit poor spatial control, have a very limited capability of micropatterning, and do not allow local tuning of the PDA topography. Herein, PDA deposition based on multiphoton lithography (MPL) is demonstrated, which enables full spatial and temporal control with nearly total freedom of patterning design. Using MPL, 2D microstructures of complex design are achieved with pattern precision of 0.8&#160;&#181;m without the need of a photomask or stamp. Moreover, this approach permits adjusting the morphology and thickness of the fabricated microstructure within one deposition step, resulting in a unique tunability of material properties. The chemical composition of PDA is confirmed and its ability for protein enzyme immobilization is demonstrated. This work presents a new methodology for high&#8208;precision and complete control of PDA deposition, enabling PDA incorporation in applications where fine and precise local surface functionalization is required. Possible applications include multicomponent functional elements and devices in microfluidics or lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Antibacterial Strategies Enabled by Gene&#8208;Transfection and Immunomodulatory Nanoparticles in 3D&#8208;Printed Scaffolds for Synergistic Exogenous and Endogenous Treatment of Infections</title>

LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37 nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on a 3D&#8208;printed scaffold address the challenges associated with implant&#8208;related infections. The LL37 peptides grafted on NP surfaces effectively kill recalcitrant pathogens. Intracellular LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37 NPs then release loaded LL37 plasmids, providing a constant supply of LL37. The NPs also alleviate immunosuppression at sites of infection, thus restoring the normal anti&#8208;infection function of the immune system.








Abstract
As research on refractory Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;related implant infection intensifies, certain challenges remain, including low antibiotic concentrations within infected areas, immune escape achieved by intracellular bacteria, myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) inducing regional immunosuppression, and recurrence of residual pathogenic bacteria after drug suspension. Herein, a novel antimicrobial system to simultaneously address these issues is proposed. Specifically, an oxygen&#8208;species&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed scaffold with shell&#8211;core nanoparticles is designed, which are loaded with an antimicrobial peptide plasmid (LL37 plasmid) and have LL37 grafted on their surface (LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37). The surface&#8208;grafted LL37 directly kills S. aureus and, following entry into cells, the nanoparticles kill intracellular bacteria. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo, following translation of the LL37 plasmid, cells function as factories of the antimicrobial peptide, thereby generating a continuous, prolonged antibacterial effect at the site of infection. This system significantly reduces the abnormal increase in MDSCs within the infected microenvironment, thus relieving the immunosuppressive state and restoring a protective antimicrobial immune response. Hence, this proposed antimicrobial system provides an antimicrobial immune response and a novel strategy for S. aureus&#8208;related infections by offering a combined active antimicrobial and immunotherapeutic strategy, thereby significantly reducing the recurrence rate following recovery from implant&#8208;associated infections.

         <title>Ligand Modulation of Active Sites to Promote Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the 2&#8208;methylimidazole (MI) ligand modulated electronic structure, the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI reduces the orbital overlap between the Fe/Co 3d and O 2p, which weakens the adsorption to oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and thus facilitates the unfavorable O2 desorption. As a result, the MI&#8208;modulated catalyst demonstrates ultralow overpotential (230/290&#160;mV at 10/100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2), and robust stability (&gt;155&#160;h).








Abstract
Rationally designed catalysts hold the key to address the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, engineering the active sites of such catalysts still faces grand challenges. This study proposes a feasible ligand modulation strategy to boost the OER catalytic activity of cobalt&#8208;iron oxyhydroxide ((Fe,Co)OOH). The 2&#8208;methylimidazole (MI) ligand coordination on (Fe,Co)OOH reduces the orbital overlap between the Fe/Co 3d and O&#160;2p, which weakens the adsorption to oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and thus facilitates the unfavorable O2 desorption. As a result, the MI ligand modulated (Fe,Co)OOH achieves an excellent OER performance with low overpotentials (230/290&#160;mV at 10/100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2) and excellent durability (&gt;155&#160;h). This study provides a novel ligand modulation strategy for the design of OER catalysts.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Ended Ni3S2&#8211;Co9S8 Heterostructures Nanocage Anode with Enhanced Reaction Kinetics for Superior Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni3S2&#8211;Co9S8 heterostructures with an open&#8208;ended nanocage structure wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO cages) are accurately designed and synthesized by a selective etching and one&#8208;step sulfuration method, which displays excellent electrochemical performance as the anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sulfides are perceived as promising anode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and structural diversity. Nonetheless, the poor structural stability and sluggish kinetics of sulfides lead to unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. Herein, Ni3S2&#8211;Co9S8 heterostructures with an open&#8208;ended nanocage structure wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO cages) are well designed as the anode for PIBs via a selective etching and one&#8208;step sulfuration approach. The hollow Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO nanocages, with large surface area, abundant heterointerfaces, and unique open&#8208;ended nanocage structure, can reduce the K+ diffusion length and promote reaction kinetics. When used as the anode for PIBs, the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO exhibits high reversible capacity and low capacity degradation (0.0089% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8211;1). A potassium&#8208;ion full battery with a Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO anode and Prussian blue cathode can display a superior reversible capacity of 400&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1 after 300 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8211;1. The unique structural advantages and electrochemical reaction mechanisms of the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO are revealed by finite&#8208;element&#8208;simulation in situ characterizations. The universal synthesis technology of bimetallic sulfide anodes for advanced PIBs may provide vital guidance to design high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Co&#8208;Electrolysis for Co&#8208;Production of Phosphate and Hydrogen in Neutral Phosphate Buffer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2 gas, NaZnPO4, and electric energy can be generated concurrently by a unique self&#8208;co&#8208;electrolysis system (SCES), which is driven by the spontaneous reaction between Zn and H2O in a neutral PBS solution. The SCES uses a Zn anode, a CoP&#8208;based catalytic cathode, and a neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as the electrolyte. In the SCES, Zn is not only a sacrificial anode but also an important precursor of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NaZnPO4. A high&#8208;performance N,Cu&#8208;CoP/carbon cloth (CC) catalyst is synthesized to catalyze the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at an especially low overpotential.








Abstract
The spontaneous reaction between Zn and H2O is of critical importance and could plausibly be used to produce H2 gas, especially under neutral conditions. However, this reaction has long been overlooked owing to its sluggish kinetics and Zn consumption. Herein, a unique self&#8208;co&#8208;electrolysis system (SCES) is reported, which uses a Zn anode, a CoP&#8208;based catalytic cathode, and a neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as the electrolyte. In this SCES, Zn is not only a sacrificial anode but also an important precursor of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NaZnPO4. Additionally, the composition and phase structure of NaZnPO4 can be well regulated. In this study, a high&#8208;performance N,Cu&#8208;CoP/carbon cloth (CC) catalyst is synthesized to catalyze the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at an especially low overpotential of 64.7 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. H2 gas (13.7 mL cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and NaZnPO4 (3.73 mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) are obtained at the cathode and anode, respectively, in the N,Cu&#8208;CoP/CC||Zn SCES spontaneously. Moreover, the SCES has a favorable open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.79 V and a maximum power density of 1.83 mW cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to elucidate the electronic structure and HER catalytic mechanism of the N and Cu co&#8208;doped CoP catalysts.

         <title>Bimetallic Nanocatalysts Immobilized in Nanoporous Hydrogels for Long&#8208;Term Robust Continuous Glucose Monitoring of Smart Contact Lens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart contact lenses containing bimetallic nanocatalysts immobilized in nanoporous hydrogels are developed for long&#8208;term and robust continuous glucose monitoring. The smart contact lenses can accurately monitor increasing and decreasing blood glucose levels with 92.2% acceptable data in diabetic and normal rabbits. Finally, the clinical feasibility and safety of smart contact lenses are evaluated on the eyes of a human patient.








Abstract
Smart contact lenses for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) have great potential for huge clinical impact. To date, their development has been limited by challenges in accurate detection of glucose without hysteresis for tear glucose monitoring to track the blood glucose levels. Here, long&#8208;term robust CGM in diabetic rabbits is demonstrated by using bimetallic nanocatalysts immobilized in nanoporous hydrogels in smart contact lenses. After redox reaction of glucose oxidase, the nanocatalysts facilitate rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and nanoparticle&#8208;mediated charge transfer with drastically improved diffusion via rapid swelling of nanoporous hydrogels. The ocular glucose sensors result in high sensitivity, fast response time, low detection limit, low hysteresis, and rapid sensor warming&#8208;up time. In diabetic rabbits, smart contact lens can detect tear glucose levels consistent with blood glucose levels measured by a glucometer and a CGM device, reflecting rapid concentration changes without hysteresis. The CGM in a human demonstrates the feasibility of smart contact lenses for further clinical applications.

&lt;p&gt;A gradient pH-sensitive (GPS) polymer is developed by Fuping You, Dan Lu, Zhiqiang Lin, and co-workers in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202109580"&gt;2109580&lt;/a&gt;. In response to an acidified membrane, the GPS polymer with dye conjugation illuminates, targets, and lyses the envelope of viruses, resulting in leakage of viral nucleic acid and a broad-spectrum activity of the GPS polymer against a variety of viruses.

Organometal&#8208;Halide Perovskites
In article number 2107739, &#193;ngel Barranco, Juan Ramon Sanchez&#8208;Valencia, and co&#8208;workers report highly aligned organometal&#8208;halide perovskite vertical nanowalls using a new vacuum&#8208;based approach evolved from the glancing&#8208;angle deposition (GLAD) technique. The alignment and separation degree of the supported nanostructures are governed by the angle of deposition, which for glancing angles provides samples with strong optical anisotropic properties such as polarized&#8208;photoluminescence or polarization&#8208;sensitive photocurrent response.

Mesoporous Materials
In article number 2109356, Jianming Li, Pengfei Yan, Shuhong Jiao, and co&#8208;workers report mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline lithium titanate microrods featured with a single&#8208;crystalline structure and interconnected pores inside for fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The unique structure of lithium titanate enables a short lithium&#8208;ion diffusion distance and fast penetration of electrolytes into the electrode interior during battery cycling, which contribute to high&#8208;rate capability and excellent cycling stability. The novel design of porous single&#8208;crystalline materials paves a new venue for developing fast&#8208;charging materials for LIBs.

Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
A comprehensive optimization strategy leads to high&#8208;efficiency near&#8208;infrared quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), as reported in article 2109785 by Zong&#8208;Liang Tseng, Shun&#8208;Wei Liu, Ken&#8208;Tsung Wong, and co&#8208;workers. Post&#8208;treatment of encapsulated FAPbI3 QDs reduces QD surface defects, and the passivated QDs dispersed in n&#8208;octane are effectively spin&#8208;coated on top of a treated electrode, leading to full&#8208;coverage, smooth, and dense QD films. The resulting QLED devices have electroluminescence &#955;max at 772 nm with external quantum efficiency up to 15.4% at a current density of 0.54 mA cm&#8722;2 (2.6 V).

Airflow Sensors
In article number 2107062, Rufan Zhang and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis of suspended carbon nanotube networks (SCNTNs) for high&#8208;performance airflow sensors. Due to the ultralight and flexible nature of CNTs and their unique junction structures, the SCNTN&#8208;based airflow sensors achieve ultrafast response, low detection threshold, high sensitivity, and ultralong cycling lifetime.

         <title>Revisiting the Roles of Natural Graphite in Ongoing Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of natural graphite&#8208;based materials in ongoing lithium&#8208;ion batteries is presented, covering fundamental mechanisms, detailed applications, and an outlook of natural graphite&#8208;based materials, from not only the aspects of structure and properties, modifications, derivatives, and composites, but also perspectives in terms of natural graphite in hybrid lithium&#8208;ion/lithium&#8208;metal cells and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.








Abstract
Graphite, commonly including artificial graphite and natural graphite (NG), possesses a relatively high theoretical capacity of 372&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8211;1 and appropriate lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation potential, and has been extensively used as the anode of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With the requirements of reducing CO2 emission to achieve carbon neutral, the market share of NG anode will continue to grow due to its excellent processability and low production energy consumption. NG, which is abundant in China, can be divided into flake graphite (FG) and microcrystalline graphite (MG). In the past 30 years, many researchers have focused on developing modified NG and its derivatives with superior electrochemical performance, promoting their wide applications in LIBs. Here, a comprehensive overview of the origin, roles, and research progress of NG&#8208;based materials in ongoing LIBs is provided, including their structure, properties, electrochemical performance, modification methods, derivatives, composites, and applications, especially the strategies to improve their high&#8208;rate and low&#8208;temperature charging performance. Prospects regarding the development orientation as well as future applications of NG&#8208;based materials are also considered, which will provide significant guidance for the current and future research of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.

         <title>Electrode Engineering in Halide Perovskite Electronics: Plenty of Room at the Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational selection of electrodes plays a critical role in perovskite&#8208;based electronics due to the high reactivity of halide perovskite materials. A comprehensive review of perovskite/electrode interfaces, as well as, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact engineering, which assists the development of perovskite&#8208;based devices with inhibited interfacial reactions, ohmic carrier transport, and non&#8208;hysteric electronic characteristics, is presented.








Abstract
Contact engineering is a prerequisite for achieving desirable functionality and performance of semiconductor electronics, which is particularly critical for organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskites due to their ionic nature and highly reactive interfaces. Although the interfaces between perovskites and charge&#8208;transporting layers have attracted lots of attention due to the photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting diode applications, achieving reliable perovskite/electrode contacts for electronic devices, such as transistors and memories, remains as a bottleneck. Herein, a critical review on the elusive nature of perovskite/electrode interfaces with a focus on the interfacial electrochemistry effects is presented. The basic guidelines of electrode selection are given for establishing non&#8208;polarized interfaces and optimal energy level alignment for perovskite materials. Furthermore, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies on interface&#8208;related electrode engineering are reviewed and discussed, which aim at achieving ohmic transport and eliminating hysteresis in perovskite devices. The role and multiple functionalities of self&#8208;assembled monolayers that offer a unique approach toward improving perovskite/electrode contacts are also discussed. The insights on electrode engineering pave the way to advancing stable and reliable perovskite devices in diverse electronic applications.

         <title>Kirigami&#8208;Inspired Biodesign for Applications in Healthcare</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kirigami patterns, inspired by arts of paper&#8208;cutting, provide innovative opportunities for precise structural engineering via material removal. In this report, the design of kirigami&#8208;based conformable systems for biomedical applications is discussed. Factors including cut geometry, materials, and fabrication are covered. Then, applications in healthcare, including sensors, implantable devices, therapeutics, surgical tools, and regenerative medicine are explored.








Abstract
Mechanically flexible and conformable materials and integrated devices have found diverse applications in personalized healthcare as diagnostics and therapeutics, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine constructs, surgical tools, secure systems, and assistive technologies. In order to impart optimal mechanical properties to the (bio)materials used in these applications, various strategies have been explored&#8212;from composites to structural engineering. In recent years, geometric cuts inspired by the art of paper&#8208;cutting, referred to as kirigami, have provided innovative opportunities for conferring precise mechanical properties via material removal. Kirigami&#8208;based approaches have been used for device design in areas ranging from soft bioelectronics to energy storage. In this review, the principles of kirigami&#8208;inspired engineering specifically for biomedical applications are discussed. Factors pertinent to their design, including cut geometry, materials, and fabrication, and the effect these parameters have on their properties and configurations are covered. Examples of kirigami designs in healthcare are presented, such as, various form factors of sensors (on skin, wearable), implantable devices, therapeutics, surgical procedures, and cellular scaffolds for regenerative medicine. Finally, the challenges and future scope for the successful translation of these biodesign concepts to broader deployment are discussed.

         <title>The Pivotal Role of s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;Block Metals in Water Electrolysis: Status Quo and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 18, May 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review pioneeringly presents the unique and essential role of some s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metal species enabling transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts to efficiently drive hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Transition metals, in particular noble metals, are the most common species in metal&#8208;mediated water electrolysis because they serve as highly active catalytic sites. In many cases, the presence of nontransition metals, that is, s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals with high natural abundance in the earth&#8208;crust in the catalytic material is indispensable to boost efficiency and durability in water electrolysis. This is why alkali metals, alkaline&#8208;earth metals, rare&#8208;earth metals, lean metals, and metalloids receive growing interest in this research area. In spite of the pivotal role of these nontransition metals in tuning efficiency of water electrolysis, there is far more room for developments toward a knowledge&#8208;based catalyst design. In this review, five classes of nontransition metals species which are successfully utilized in water electrolysis, with special emphasis on electronic structure&#8211;catalytic activity relationships and phase stability, are discussed. Moreover, specific fundamental aspects on electrocatalysts for water electrolysis as well as a perspective on this research field are also addressed in this account. It is anticipated that this review can trigger a broader interest in using s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals species toward the discovery of advanced polymetal&#8208;containing electrocatalysts for practical water splitting.

         <title>Macroscale Conjugated Microporous Polymers: Controlling Versatile Functionalities Over Several Dimensions</title>

Recent progress in macroscale conjugated microporous polymers for gas adsorption, energy, sensing, filtration/purification, and catalysis applications are reviewed, with particular focus on how the macroscopic architectures brings about more functionalities and opportunities.








Abstract
Since discovered in 2007, conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) have been developed for numerous applications including gas adsorption, sensing, organic and photoredox catalysis, energy storage, etc. While featuring abundant micropores, the structural rigidity derived from CMPs&#8217; stable &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton leads to insolubility and thus poor processability, which severely limits their applicability, e.g., in CMP&#8208;based devices. Hence, the development of CMPs whose structure can not only be controlled on the micro&#8208; but also on the macroscale have attracted tremendous interest. In conventional synthesis procedures, CMPs are obtained as powders, but in recent years various bottom&#8208;up synthesis strategies have been developed, which yield CMPs as thin films on substrates or as hybrid materials, allowing to span length scales from individual conjugated monomers to micro&#8208;/macrostructures. This review surveys recent advances on the construction of CMPs into macroscale structures, including membranes, films, aerogels, sponges, and other architectures. The focus is to describe the underlying fabrication techniques and the implications which follow from the macroscale morphologies, involving new chemistry and physics in such materials for applications like molecular separation/filtration/adsorption, energy storage and conversion, photothermal transformation, sensing, or catalysis.

Thermoelectrics turns wasted heat energy into useful electrical energy. Current commercial manufacturing techniques are time and energy intensive, contributing to low utilization of thermoelectrics. This review explores how printing has been used to make thermoelectric materials and generators, and how advances in the last five years hold great promise for printing to become the dominant future manufacturing technique for thermoelectrics.








Abstract
The looming impact of climate change and the diminishing supply of fossil fuels both highlight the need for a transition to more sustainable energy sources. While solar and wind can produce much of the energy needed, to meet all our energy demands there is a need for a diverse sustainable energy generation mix. Thermoelectrics can play a vital role in this, by harvesting otherwise wasted heat energy and converting it into useful electrical energy. While efficient thermoelectric materials have been known since the 1950s, thermoelectrics have not been utilized beyond a few niche applications. This can in part be attributed to the high cost of manufacturing and the geometrical restraints of current commercial manufacturing techniques. Printing offers a potential route to manufacture thermoelectric materials at a lower price point and allows for the fabrication of generators that are custom built to meet the waste heat source requirements. This review details the significant progress that has been made in recent years in printing of thermoelectric materials in all thermoelectric material groups and printing methods, and highlights very recent publications that show printing can now offer comparable performance to commercially manufactured thermoelectric materials.
